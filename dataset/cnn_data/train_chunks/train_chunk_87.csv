"(CNN) -- After days of heavy fighting, forces loyal to Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo laid down their arms Tuesday, and the self-declared president was negotiating the terms of his surrender, his foreign minister said. Calm was reported Tuesday afternoon in Abidjan, the West African nation's largest city and the center of the battle between Gbagbo's military and those loyal to his rival, Alassane Ouattara, who is recognized internationally as the legitimate president. ""We must now do what we can do to have lasting peace,"" said Alcide Djedje, the foreign minister, who participated in talks at the French ambassador's residence in Abidjan. Two of Gbagbo's generals were in ""the process of negotiating a surrender,"" French Prime Minister Francois Fillon told parliament Tuesday. A U.N. official said that Gbagbo asked for U.N. protection for himself during the negotiations. Ouattara's camp said it was sticking to a demand it has made all along: that Gbagbo recognize Ouattara's victory at the polls, said spokesman Patrick Achi. ""I think it is something very important,"" Achi said. ""The military fight is almost over. As soon as he surrenders, all the fighting will stop."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Ouattara wants Gbagbo to sign a letter saying he recognizes his rival as president. In a phone interview with French news channel LCI, a man claiming to be Gbagbo said he would not sign the paper because he does not acknowledge his rival's victory and that he demands ""the truth of the ballot box."" But, he said, he is willing to meet with Ouattara. He also said the French have inserted themselves into the war. ""My problem is not to stay in a building or not,"" the man said. ""My problem is that we find an exit from this crisis."" A key question is whether Gbagbo will remain in the Ivory Coast, said Choi Young-jin, head of the U.N. mission in the country. ""Gbagbo had many options after the election, but he squandered his opportunities,"" said Choi, who has been speaking with Ouattara as well as Gbagbo's advisers. ""I don't know what options he has now."" ""I think he (Gbagbo) knows everything is over for him,"" said Youssoufou Bamba, Ivory Coast's ambassador to the United Nations. ""His military forces have been defeated. He is alone now."" Bamba said Gbagbo should go on trial ""because he has committed so much crime"" against civilian and peaceful demonstrators. But Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who served as the African Union's main negotiator in Ivory Coast, said Ouattara and others should consider allowing safe passage for Gbagbo to Angola, South Africa or another country. Choi said the combat is over and that only a few elements were out on the streets. An American resident of Abidjan, who did not want to be identified, said she could hear sporadic gunfire from her apartment but the heavy shelling and mortars had stopped. Choi said Gbagbo was hunkered down in the basement of his Abidjan residence with his family. He said there were still guards posted around the house, but not many. U.S. President Barack Obama called Tuesday for Gbagbo to ""stand down immediately."" ""Tragically, the violence that we are seeing could have been averted had Laurent Gbagbo respected the results of last year's presidential election,"" Obama said. ""To end this violence and prevent more bloodshed, former President Gbagbo must stand down immediately, and direct those who are fighting on his behalf to lay down their arms."" Ouattara's forces entered Abidjan on Thursday after an offensive that swept across the country. When they arrived, the sporadic post-election violence that had plagued Abidjan for four months escalated into war. By Tuesday, they had surrounded the presidential palace. ""We do not see why he shall not surrender,"" Achi said earlier, adding the new government may seek trial for Gbagbo in the International Court of Justice. An Abidjan resident said state-run television, which has served as a powerful mouthpiece for Gbagbo, went dark Monday, a sign that Ouattara's forces had overrun the building. Gbagbo's forces suffered a setback Monday when U.N. helicopters fired on one of its camps to prevent the use of heavy weapons against civilians and U.N. peacekeepers. Djedje, the foreign minister, said the U.N. attack prompted Gbagbo's forces to stop fighting. ""Since there was no more ammunition and weapons, they decided to lay down the arms and negotiate a cease-fire,"" he said. U.N. peacekeeping director Alain Le Roy told reporters the United Nations was not taking sides in the conflict, but had to act after three days of fire from Gbagbo's forces left four U.N. peacekeepers seriously injured. ""We are shooting at heavy weapons. We are not shooting at the presidency,"" Le Roy said. The political chaos and violence has claimed hundreds of lives in Ivory Coast. In one of the bloodiest incidents yet, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported the killings of 800 people last week in the western cocoa-producing town of Duekoue.","NEW: Man identified as Gbagbo tells station he won't recognize Ouattara win .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's general prosecutor on Monday extended the detention of two of former President Hosni Mubarak's sons, saying further investigation is needed. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak will be held for another 15 days, the prosecutor's office said in a statement, adding that members of the office went to Tora prison to conduct questioning. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak's lawyers were present, the statement said. The two were being questioned ""regarding the prices of their real estate, lands and their role in intervening in the program of settling Egypt's debts,"" as well as commissions on a gas deal with Israel and their roles in ""mandatory partnerships with foreign companies in Egypt,"" the statement said. They were also being asked about ""their role in privatization and evaluation of private shares and selling them,"" the prosecutor's office said. Last month, Egyptians exulted over the detention of their ailing former president and his two sons in a probe exploring the killing of protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the center of the country's dramatic uprising earlier this year that led to Mubarak's ouster. Mubarak and his two sons were detained in connection with the protesters' deaths, an official with Egypt's Justice Ministry said at the time. Prosecutors have also been investigating what properties and bank accounts the Mubaraks have. Hosni Mubarak has decried accusations of responsibility in the deaths, saying the probe is aimed at tarnishing his reputation and that of his family. He has also said he and his children have not violated any laws, and that an investigation of the properties they own will show they've done nothing wrong.","Gamal, Alaa Mubarak were detained in April .

"New York (CNN) -- A U.S.-born Muslim cleric and his son are exploring the possibility of legal action after they said they were prevented from traveling aboard an American Airlines flight from New York to Charlotte, North Carolina, their attorney says. Al Amin Abdul Latif and his son, Abu Bakar, were heading on Friday to an annual conference on Islamophobia. They are the second pair of imams barred, at least initially, from traveling to the conference that day. Also Friday, Imams Masudur Rahman and Mohamed Zaghloul -- both clad in Islamic attire -- were told to leave the aircraft as it was taxiing toward the runway. All four are represented by attorney Mo Idlibi, who said that none of them had done anything out of the ordinary, nor were they praying or chanting. Idlibi said the elder Abdul Latif and his son have reached out to American Airlines for ""accountability of the embarrassment and humiliation"" that they said they endured. ""Imams have rights,"" said Idlibi. ""They know they have rights. And they will hold these entities accountable if that's what it comes to."" He added that the incident was unlawful and is ""unequivocally a civil rights issue."" American Airlines responded in a written statement, saying ""there was no ill intent on the part of any of our employees involved in this."" ""It was a situation that just got very complicated very quickly. Because we don't discuss security matters, you may wish to talk with TSA."" A spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration said ""this passenger (Al Amin Abdul Latif) was properly screened by TSA and cleared to fly."" ""TSA did not deny the passenger boarding,"" said spokeswoman Kristin Lee. According to the pair's attorney, the younger Abdul Latif was initially permitted to board the plane. But his father was instructed to meet with a gate agent to book a separate flight. Shortly thereafter, federal agents then boarded the American Airlines plane and removed the younger Abdul Latif as well. Neither man was given an explanation, their attorney says. The younger Abdul Latif was permitted on the following day to fly to Charlotte. His father, however, was again denied and was compelled to drive instead. According to an American Airlines statement, an airline has the legal authority to refuse transport to an individual it deems unsafe, but airlines cannot by law refuse transport based solely on a person's race, color, national origin, religion, ethnicity or sex. ""Ultimately, the airline must be able to establish that the pilot's determination to refuse to transport an individual was not arbitrary or capricious in order for the airline to fulfill its obligations under the statute,"" said American Airlines spokesman Ed Martelle. The incident has sparked controversy. ""That kind of hype and hysteria reflect what's worst about our country,"" said Zead Ramadan, board president of the Council on American Islamic Relations-New York. Ramadan points to last week's killing of al Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden as a reason for what he calls ""an uptick"" in racial profiling against Muslims. ""There has been a spike,"" Ramadan said. ""Even in grade schools, we've seen more bullying."" The news comes as New Yorkers and others around the country tune in to media coverage of heightened security measures in the wake of bin Laden's death.","A U.S.-born Muslim cleric and his son are exploring the possibility of legal action .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal will face longtime rival Roger Federer in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters on Saturday in a rematch of the event's past two title matches. Defending champion Nadal crushed fellow left-hander Michael Llodra 6-2 6-2 on Friday, needing just 75 minutes to clinch his 35th successive victory on clay against a French player appearing in his first top-level quarterfinal on the surface. Federer, who beat the Spaniard in the 2009 final, later overcame Robin Soderling -- who inflicted Nadal's last defeat on clay at that year's French Open. The world No. 3 triumphed 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 against the Swedish fifth seed in one hour 42 minutes . After successive titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, Nadal's progress has been simpler this week following a third-round walkover when rejuvenated former world No. 4 Juan Martin del Potro pulled out with a hip injury. ""Today it was quite good, especially here with the altitude it's a little bit more complicated because it's more difficult to go over him,"" Nadal told the ATP Tour website after conceding only eight points on his serve and breaking Llodra four times. ""It's a bit more difficult with the serve. I felt quite good on the court, I served well. In the second set there were quite a lot of rallies and not so many in the first, and I think I played really well."" Friday's opening quarterfinal saw Thomaz Bellucci continued his giantkilling run by ousting seventh seed Tomas Berdych, beating the 2010 Wimbledon runner-up 7-6 (7-2) 6-3. The 23-year-old became the first Brazilian since Gustavo Kuerten in 2003 to reach the last-four stage in the Spanish capital as he followed up his earlier shock win over British fourth seed Andy Murray. Bellucci, ranked 36th, reached the semis of a Masters 1000 event for the first time. ""Of course, yesterday's match gave me a lot of confidence that I was needing,"" he said. ""I was losing some games and wasn't playing very well, but yesterday I played my best tennis. ""Today I had a lot of confidence on the court and I managed to get a victory. I played well and I have got even more confidence for tomorrow's match."" Bellucci next faces either world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who is unbeaten in 29 consecutive matches this year, or Spanish sixth seed David Ferrer -- the losing finalist in Monte Carlo and Barcelona last month. ""They are losing very few matches, but they are not invincible, they can also lose,"" Bellucci said ahead of the duo's clash in Friday's late match. Germany's Julia Gorges continued her fine form in the women's event in Madrid, with the Stuttgart champion beating Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to reach the semifinals. She won 6-4 6-2 to follow up her second successive win over world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki and set up a clash with fourth seed Victoria Azarenka. The Belarusian battled past unseeded Czech Lucie Safarova 6-3 3-6 6-2 to move to within one win of claiming the No. 4 ranking -- which no woman from her country has done before. Her last meeting with Gorges ended in disappointment in Stuttgart last month when the 21-year-old Azarenka had to retire hurt with a shoulder injury after winning the first set. Chinese sixth seed Li Na also went through to the last four, beating American Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-4 3-6 6-4. Both players had beaten Italians in the previous round, with Mattek-Sands upsetting third seed and French Open champion Francesca Schiavone. Australian Open finalist Li will take on Czech 16th seed Petra Kvitova for a place in Sunday's title match. Kvitova, 21, came from behind to beat Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova 3-6 6-3 7-5 to follow up her earlier win over Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva. Cibulkova eliminated former No. 1 Maria Sharapova in the previous round.","Defending champion Rafael Nadal through to semifinals of Madrid Masters .

"(CNN Student News) -- March 29, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Japan: Disaster-affected Areas • Cuba • Qatar . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: An airport's recovery, a former president's return to Cuba, and a plan to block out the sun! All of it's on the schedule for today's show. I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News! First Up: Sign of Hope . AZUZ: We're starting today in Japan at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Engineers are trying to figure out just how much the recent earthquake and tsunami damaged the plant's nuclear reactors, and what that might mean for the area around those reactors. Yesterday, a government official said one of the reactors might be leaking radioactive material. Tests on seawater showed some signs of contamination as well, about 360 miles out into the Pacific Ocean. And tests have shown small amounts of plutonium in the soil at different spots around the power plant, though the company that owns the plant says the plutonium is not a harmful amount. Parts of Japan were shaken by another earthquake, though; this one hit on Monday. Wasn't nearly as strong as the quake from two weeks ago. But it did happen in the same general area as the March 11th quake, near the city of Sendai on Japan's east coast. That's where Martin Savidge is now for us. He's at Sendai's airport, looking at how its recovery is a sign of hope for the victims of these disasters. (BEGIN VIDEO) MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If you remember some of the most amazing images that came out in the first hours after the tsunami, one of them would have to be the airport in Sendai. It was just so amazing to see this massive airport overrun with water and debris. Now, we're going back to see how it looks today. But first, we have to avoid Japan's ongoing nuclear disaster. COLONEL ROB TOFT, USAF SPECIAL OPS: This is the Fukushima reactor, the 25-mile restricted area. This is our airplane here. SAVIDGE: Colonel Rob Toft was aboard the first plane to land at Sendai after the tsunami. TOFT: I think anything that you see on TV, well, Hollywood with their greatest special effects can't put into perspective the amount of destruction that was down there on the airfield the day that we arrived. SAVIDGE: Sweeping in for landing ourselves, we see none of that. You can probably see that, for the most part, behind us it looks great. It really does. The transition is amazing given what happened here the day of the disaster. But get away from the runway and you see the reminders, which a literal army of 240 U.S. airmen, soldiers and Marines, alongside Japanese civilians, frantically worked to clear. By just dumb luck, there were no large passenger planes here when the wave hit, but hundreds of smaller, mostly private aircraft weren't so lucky. They look as though they fell from the sky. Even ones in the hangers weren't spared. This is the main entrance here at Sendai. It's like any normal American airport, only it's not so normal now. Sendai's an international hub. Think Logan Airport or Dulles. Japanese officials had written the place off. Did you think it would be able to be reopened? COLONEL MAKOTO KASAMATSU, JAPAN SELF-DEFENSE FORCES: To be honest, the answer is no. SAVIDGE: But it is open. It now serves as a center for humanitarian aid distribution. And guiding those planes from the same roof on which so many sought shelter, now stand American Air Force air traffic controllers, who saw a tragedy and were able to help. MASTER SGT. MICHAEL CHARVAT, U.S. AIR FORCE COMBAT CONTROLLER: You feel kind of sad. Then you know you're here for a job and hopefully you can bring some relief to the Japanese people. SAVIDGE: Once an iconic image of a disaster, Sendai Airport has now been transformed into an early sign of hope. Martin Savidge, CNN, Sendai, Japan. (END VIDEO) Crisis in Libya . AZUZ: President Obama says the U.S. role in Libya will get smaller as NATO takes control of the coalition operation. But U.S. forces will still be involved. The question a lot of people are asking is why did the U.S. get involved in the first place? Democrats and Republicans have been criticizing the president. They're asking about the purpose of the mission in Libya, the cost, and what it might mean for America's relationship with the Arab world. President Obama was scheduled to give a speech last night to address some of those concerns. It happened after we produced this show. We're gonna have more details on that speech for you tomorrow. Unrest in Syria . AZUZ: In the Middle Eastern nation of Syria, a law that's been on the books for nearly 50 years could soon be removed. It's called the ""emergency law."" What it does is allow the Syrian government to make preventive arrests, meaning it can arrest people before they commit a crime. The decision to lift the law comes after protests against the country's government. Dozens of people have been killed in the fighting between protesters and Syrian security forces. A lot of this violence has been happening in a couple cities in Syria. The government blamed the violence in one of those cities, the one you see in these photos, on ""armed gangs"" who got a hold of police weapons. I.D. ME . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an island nation located in the Caribbean Sea. Communist forces took over my government in 1959. I'm less than 100 miles away from the United States, but I've had a tense relationship with America for decades. I'm Cuba, and my capital city is Havana. Pres. Carter in Cuba . AZUZ: And that's where former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is right now. He's in the middle of a three-day visit to the communist nation of Cuba. President Carter arrived on Monday. He was invited by Cuban President Raul Castro, whom he's scheduled to meet with today. Yesterday, Carter met with religious leaders and U.S. officials. It's not the former U.S. president's first trip to Cuba. Shasta Darlington looks at what's on the agenda for former President Carter and how this trip will be different from his last visit to the island nation. (BEGIN VIDEO) SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, HAVANA: When Jimmy Carter arrived on his last visit to Cuba, Fidel Castro himself was on the tarmac to greet the former U.S. president. He's the only American leader, in or out of office, to visit the island since Castro's 1959 revolution. Carter will be back on a private mission to talk about ways to improve U.S.-Cuba relations with the new president, Raul Castro. In some ways, the time is ripe. Castro has introduced sweeping changes to the Soviet-style economy. Cuba freed the last of 75 dissidents jailed in a 2003 crackdown on the opposition that prompted worldwide condemnation. Oscar Elias Biscet was sentenced to 25 years in prison for counter-revolutionary activities, but freed this month. OSCAR ELIAS BISCET, CUBAN DISSIDENT [TRANSLATED]: ""I want to continue my work in the defense of human rights,"" he says. ""We want a democratic and free society."" DARLINGTON: Raul Castro agreed to release the prisoners last year as part of a deal brokered by the Catholic Church and Spain, removing one of the major obstacles to improved relations with the United States. But you wouldn't know it from President Barack Obama's speech. He talked about changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba that he's made, and the need for reciprocal action. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Cuban authorities must take some meaningful actions to respect the basic rights of their own people, not because the United States insists upon it, but because the people of Cuba deserve it. DARLINGTON: Part of the reason for the impasse between the nations is Alan Gross, a USAID contractor who was arrested in Havana in 2009. This month, Gross was sentenced to 15 years in jail for his work on what Cuba saw as a ""subversive"" program hooking dissidents up to the internet. The U.S. said he was merely helping the Jewish community. No doubt, expectations will run high that Carter will try to secure the early release for Gross. But at least officially, it's not even on the three-day agenda for the former president. Shasta Darlington, CNN. Havana. (END VIDEO) Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Soccer's World Cup is played every two years. Nope! Not true! The FIFA World Cup occurs once every four years. Robotic Cloud? AZUZ: In the summer of 2022, the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar will host the World Cup. This is a country where the temperatures in the Summer are normally triple digits, so engineers are working on ways for fans and players to beat the heat. This is one idea. It's a robotic cloud made out of carbon fibers. Officials are planning to put together a prototype this year, and this animation shows you how it might work. Engines would help the robo-cloud get off the ground. And officials would plan to use remote controls to position the cloud between the stadium and the sun. Will it work? Engineers have 11 years to find out for sure. Before We Go . AZUZ: Finally, in a cross-state battle, someone's about to get their just desserts. And it looks like it's going to be Maine, thanks to the world's biggest whoopie pie. This is basically a giant cookie sandwich with fluffy filling in the middle. Delicious! Maine and Pennsylvania were jawing over which state could claim it as their dessert. Pennsylvania's largest: more than 200 pounds. This one in Maine: more than a thousand! Goodbye . AZUZ: No matter how you slice it, that victory is sweet. I'm sure it took a while to bake something so big. But if you ask the chefs, they'd probably say it was easy as pie. We've eaten up all our time for today. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","Hear how a Japanese airport's recovery could offer signs of hope .

"London (CNN) -- A shooting on board the HMS Astute, a British nuclear submarine making a visit to Southampton, left one person dead and another critically wounded, authorities said Friday. One man was arrested after the shooting, said police, who were contacted by the Ministry of Defense about the incident. ""I am greatly saddened to hear of this tragic incident and of the death of a Royal Navy serviceman,"" Defense Secretary Liam Fox said in a statement Friday. ""It is right and proper that a full police investigation is carried out and allowed to take its course. ""My thoughts and sympathies are with those who have been affected and their families."" No other details of the incident were immediately released. The Astute made headlines last year when it ran aground off the Isle of Skye, in northern Scotland, while doing sea trials. Its nuclear propulsion system was not damaged in the incident, and its reactor was declared safe, with no environmental impact. It was eventually pulled free and escorted back to port. The submarine can carry a mix of as many as 38 Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes and Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, according to the ministry.","NEW: ""Full police investigation"" will be carried out, defense secretary says .

"(CNN) -- Gold is always worth its weight in, well, itself. Sometimes, it's worth even more. A gold nugget, weighing 100 troy ounces, sold at auction in Sacremento for $400,000 Wednesday night. ""We valued it at around $200,000,"" said Amy Baker, auction manager for Holabird-Kagin American. ""There were 6 to 7 people bidding on it, most of them anonymously. It went to an anonymous (phone) bidder."" Baker said the auction house may be able to release more information on the winning bidder Thursday. Security is important when you're dealing with a large hunk of precious metal. ""The new owner, I'm not sure when it will exactly be delivered to him,"" Baker said. ""That's confidential."" On Wednesday, gold closed at $1,396.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, making the nearly 7-pound nugget worth about $140,000, if it were melted down. But since the nugget, found last year in Nevada County, California, is believed to be the largest one left from the state's gold rush, it has special value. An estimated 500,000 people traveled to California between 1848 and 1864 in search of instant wealth. ""It's the last one we know left in existence,"" Baker said. ""There have been larger ones over the years, but they have been melted down."" The nugget will be on display this weekend at the Sacramento Convention Center, she said. The California Natural Resources Agency says the largest nugget ever mined in the state was found in 1854 and weighed 195 pounds. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report .","Gold closes at $1,393.40 an ounce in electronic trading on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- NATO has launched around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya as it considers various options for dealing with escalating violence in the war-torn country, America's ambassador to the organization told reporters Monday. Representatives of key Western powers also highlighted the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone in Libya -- part of growing campaign to break strongman Moammar Gadhafi's grip on power. British, French and U.S. officials were working on a draft text that includes language on a no-fly zone, diplomatic sources at the United Nations told CNN. The language in the text will deal with triggers rather than timelines for taking such a step, one diplomat noted. If gross violations of human rights are committed, the diplomat added, the elements of the text could be quickly turned into a resolution. Any resolution on military intervention in Libya, however, would be subject to a vote by the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council. Such intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China, who rarely approve of such measures. ""The violence that's been taking place and perpetrated by the government in Libya is unacceptable,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said at the White House. Moammar Gadhafi's government ""will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there."" Obama stressed that NATO is considering a wide range of responses -- including military options -- for dealing with the crisis. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later cited three potential responses under active consideration: establishing the no-fly zone, military-backed humanitarian aid, and stronger enforcement of the U.N. arms embargo. Carney downplayed speculation about the possibility of providing arms to the Libyan rebels, telling reporters that ""it would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya."" ""We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we're pursuing,"" he warned. A senior U.S. official familiar with the administration's deliberations on Libya denied a report in the British press that the administration had asked Saudi Arabia to arm the rebels. U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague told members of the British parliament, however, that ""we are making contingency plans for all eventualities in Libya."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in Belgium that the organization has no immediate intention to intervene in the Libyan civil war. But ""as a defense alliance and a security organization, it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality,"" he said. Rasmussen stressed that it is important to ""remain vigilant"" in light of ""systemic attacks"" by Gadhafi's regime against the Libyan population. ""The violation of human rights and international humanitarian law is outrageous,"" he said. Rasmussen also noted that the defense ministers from member states will meet Friday and Saturday to discuss how the organization can help partner countries in North Africa and the broader Middle East. ""We can see a strong wind of change blowing across the region -- and it is blowing in the direction of freedom and democracy,"" he asserted. Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa lashed out the Western leaders, calling their response part of ""a conspiracy to divide (and) partition the country."" ""The English are yearning for the colonial era"" while Obama is acting ""like a child,"" he said. ""Territorial integrity is sacrosanct and we will die for it."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, meanwhile, appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli, the United Nations said in a statement Monday. Abdelilah Al-Khatib, a former foreign minister of Jordan, will ""undertake urgent consultations with the authorities in Tripoli and in the region on the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the wider dimensions of the crisis,"" according to the statement. As diplomats debated various options, the violence in Libya continued to intensify. Forces loyal to Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf, launching aerial strikes meant to help crush the uprising against him. Death toll estimates from the conflict have reached as high as 2,000 people. Roughly 200,000 people have fled Libya, with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, according to the United Nations.

"New York (CNN) -- Police say they have discovered more human remains on a Long Island, New York, beach near where the corpses of four women were discovered last year. The remains of a fifth body were located west of Cedar Beach, Long Island, approximately one mile from where the other corpses were discovered in December, according to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. ""There may be clues available now with this body that will help the homicide investigation and will help it move forward,"" Dormer said. An investigation will be conducted to identify the remains. Meanwhile, police say, the hunt for a potential serial killer continues, as does the search for Shannan Gilbert, 24, whose disappearance resulted in the finding of the other bodies within a quarter mile of each other. The four bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine. All four women found dead advertised for prostitution services on the website Craigslist, police said. The bodies were found in various stages of decomposition, and at least one could have been there for as long as two years, Dormer said.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Concerns about lost culture, a plan to cut college costs and a fearless flyer. That's what's ahead in today's program. But we start with a tour of some international headlines. First Up: Two Months Later . AZUZ: We begin in Japan, where the country paused for a moment of silence on Wednesday. It was exactly two months after a powerful earthquake struck off the Japanese coast. It was the largest quake to hit Japan in more than 100 years. And it caused a tsunami, a giant ocean wave, that rushed ashore. The impact on the Asian country was devastating. Nearly 15,000 people were killed. Another 10,000 are still missing. The quake and tsunami damaged several of Japan's nuclear reactors. The worst was this one -- the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Engineers have spent two months trying to contain the crisis. Yesterday, the company that owns the Fukushima plant said there's a new radiation leak from one of the reactors. They didn't know if the radioactive water was leaking into the sea. Japan is making some progress in its efforts to clean up and rebuild from the natural disasters. But it's going to take a while, partly because the damage is so wide-spread. Around 130,000 people in Japan have nowhere to live. Temporary housing is going up, but slowly. Libya Civil War . AZUZ: Next up, the north African nation of Libya. This is a country that's in the middle of a civil war that started about a month before the Japan earthquake. On one side are the forces of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's leader for more than 40 years. On the other side, rebels who want Gadhafi out of power. Other countries are involved too. Forces from the U.S., U.K., France, and several others are part of a military coalition to protect Libya's civilians. That group is led by NATO - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Yesterday, rebels were able to take control of the airport in the city of Misrata. That's been a big battle-ground between the rebels and Gadhafi's forces. Controlling the airport is important because it can provide access to humanitarian aid that's trying to get into Libya. Greece Protests . AZUZ: Finally, we're going to cross the Mediterranean Sea and wind up in Greece, a country that's facing some major economic struggles. People can invest their money in places all over the world. So when one country -- like Greece -- has problems, it can have a wide impact. Last year, the nation needed a financial bail-out and it got one from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. But part of the deal is that Greece has to find ways to cut its budget. And a lot of people aren't happy about some of the options being considered. Yesterday, about 20,000 of them marched through the capital Athens. Some of these protests turned violent. Police fired tear gas on the protesters. This is far from over, because there are rumors that Greece might need another bailout. Sound Check . MAYOR CHUCK CARIKER, TUNICA, MISSISSIPPI: It is devastating. It's painful to watch the slow rise of the water. We can't start the recovery and you can't start the healing process until the water goes down. And that's the part that is painful. For their safety, for the safety of others, they are not allowed back in there. Impact of Flooding . AZUZ: That was the mayor of Tunica, Mississippi. About 600 people in his community have been forced out of their homes as flood waters rush in. This flooding along the Mississippi River could affect people in ways you might not think about. For example, at the gas pump. Some of the largest refineries in the U.S. are located next to the river. There are concerns that those refineries might have to temporarily close as the flooding moves through. And that fear is already driving up the price of gas. The nationwide average went up more than a cent on Wednesday. This next report from Martin Savidge looks at another unexpected threat from the floods. The potential loss of a cultural connection. (BEGIN VIDEO) MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Long before the Interstate Highway System, there was Highway 61. It was an important north/south connection that stretched from Minnesota to Louisiana. But here's why we're back on Highway 61 today. For much of that distance, Highway 61 runs parallel to the Mississippi River. In fact, it's one of the reasons it's also known as the Great River Road. Historian Judy Peiser says the road, like the river, transformed life. JUDY PEISER, CENTER FOR SOUTHERN FOLKLORE: It brings trade, travel, transportation. Same thing with Highway 61. SAVIDGE: From the 1920s to the 1950s, this was a migratory route for African Americans leaving the Deep South looking for better economic opportunity in the North. BLIND MISSISSIPPI MORRIS, BLUES MUSICIAN: 61 is kind of like the underground railroad of the South for the poor sharecropper fellow looking for a better way of life. SAVIDGE: A lot of culture came with them up the river and up this highway. Jazz came up Highway 61. Highway 61 is how the blues ended up on Beale Street. BRAD WEBB, BLUES MUSICIAN: 61 leads straight to Beale Street. SAVIDGE: And that's no accident? WEBB: That's no accident. I'm sure. PEISER: It was a highway of business, it was a highway of education, it was a highway of getting your doctorate, it was a highway of music, it was a highway of life. And it's part of our soul in this region. SAVIDGE: But now the historic levels of the Mississippi River are threatening life along Highway 61. In town after town, from Memphis to New Orleans, people wait to see what the water will bring down the road. Martin Savidge, CNN, Memphis. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! B.A., J.D., and M.Ed. are all types of what? If you think you know it, shout it out! Are they: A) Sports leagues, B) Government agencies, C) Academic degrees or D) Horse breeds? You've got three seconds -- GO! These are academic degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Juris Doctor, and Master of Education. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Faster and Cheaper? AZUZ: A B.A. is one of the most common degrees offered by colleges and most people spend four or five years earning it. But with tuition prices going up, that means more money for every year you're in school. Tom Foreman looks at a program that cuts the costs and the time. (BEGIN VIDEO) TOM FOREMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A bachelor's degree at the University of North Carolina Greensboro is a bargain, just over $11,000 a year for in-state students. But a handful here are now getting an even bigger break: working toward a degree in three years, not the usual four. Elyssa Tucker, who wants to be a psychiatrist, is one of them. Were you more interested in the economic benefit or the shorter time in school? ELYSSA TUCKER, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO STUDENT: For me personally, it was more of the shorter time in school because I do want to go to med school so, really, time is of the essence. I would rather get it done faster than trying to take my time and drag it out forever. My parents, economically, they're like, yes, this is a gold mine, do it. You are in this. FOREMAN: A small but growing number of schools are tackling soaring tuitions by offering a three-year option. While some educators worry that it short circuits the college experience, proponents like Steve Roberson say hundreds of students here come from well below the poverty line. STEVE ROBERSON, DEAN OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO: The notion of a college degree that it's affordability is just extraordinarily frightening for most families. FOREMAN: To join the plan, students must arrive with 12 hours of college level courses completed in high school or elsewhere. They must know their major and they must take on a heavy course load. But the savings: . ROBERSON: We estimate this will save students around $8,000. FOREMAN: $8,000. ROBERSON: Almost $8,000, which is about a fourth of a typical collegiate experience here. FOREMAN: It's tough work. TUCKER: If you are not driven, this is not going to work for you. FOREMAN: But for those who are, it can mean a fast-track to even higher degrees, good jobs and less debt along the way. Tom Foreman, CNN, Greensboro, North Carolina. (END VIDEO) Don' Fail Me . AZUZ: ""Don't Fail Me!"" It's a new documentary from CNN that premieres this weekend. The program features the three students that you see here and it uses their stories to take a look at the overall U.S. education system. Check out ""Don't Fail Me"" when it airs this coming Sunday, May 15th at 8 P.M. Eastern and Pacific on CNN. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, we're gonna take a trip over the Grand Canyon. Looks like they're installing a new part on our helicopter. Here we go. Uh, looks like you dropped something there, guys. Or someone. And he didn't drop, he fell! Right before the after-burners kicked in on his personal jetpack! This flight of fancy -- and air-show of awesome-ness -- lasted more than eight minutes. He was supposed to do the run one day earlier. Goodbye . AZUZ: But he jettisoned that idea, saying he needed a practice run. It looks like he pulled it off without any problems, despite the gravity of the situation. Time for us to jet.

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona need just one point to win Spain's La Liga for the third straight year after a 2-0 win over neighbors Espanyol Sunday night. Goals from Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique have taken Barcelona to 91 points, eight ahead of Real Madrid, who thrashed Sevilla 6-2 Saturday to keep alive their slim hopes. Barcelona will clinch the title Wednesday night if they avoid defeat against Levante. They will then turn their attentions to the Champions League final against Manchester United on May 28 at Wembley. It was not a vintage display by Pep Guardiola's men in the wake of their Champions League semifinal second leg tie against Real Madrid in midweek. But World Cup winner Iniesta found room for himself to shoot home in the first half after 20 minutes with Pique heading home from a Xavi corner at the start of the second. Espanyol, who are still chasing a Europa League place, offered stiff resistance in the Nou Camp, but Barcelona were always in command and Eric Abidal came off the bench for a second appearance after his successful recovery from a liver tumor. Valencia look set to finish third behind Barca and Real as Mallorca and Villarreal drew 0-0. They lead Villarreal by five points after their 3-0 win over Real Sociedad 24 hours earlier. Villarreal coach Juan Carlos Garrido said his team were tired after contesting the Europa League semifinal Thursday. ""We can say that we have got a point which takes us closer to a place in the Champions League although obviously a win would have been better,"" he told AFP. Osasuna scored a fine 3-1 away win at Real Zaragoza in Sunday's late game to ease their relegation fears.","Barcelona beat Espanyol 2-0 to close on Spanish title .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations refugee agency reported disturbing accounts of violence and persecution of sub-Saharan Africans within Libya Tuesday, urging a recognition of their particular vulnerability in the midst of civil war. A group of Sudanese who arrived in Egypt from eastern Libya told representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that armed Libyans were going to door to door, forcing people from sub-Saharan countries to leave. They also reported the rape of a 12-year-old Sudanese girl and said many of their documents had been confiscated or destroyed. Spokesman Adrian Edwards said the agency was alarmed by such accounts, increasing in number as the situation in Libya intensifies. Sub-Saharan Africans came under attack after reports that strongman Moammar Gadhafi had recruited them to serve as mercenaries. Libya's war has forced out 215,000 people, many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders. The refugee agency has been working with the International Organization of Migration (IOM) to evacuate people, many of whom have been spending cold nights under the stars and with very little to eat. Others have been sheltered in cramped, unsanitary conditions. The IOM said it was accelerating repatriation of Bangladeshis, who remain stranded by the thousands on both borders with Libya. The agency said it will need at least 20 more chartered flights to evacuate Bangladeshis remaining on the Egyptian border alone. A Bangladeshi man died over the weekend after a fight over food distribution at the Egyptian border, the UNHCR staff reported. They said many of the 3,500 Bangladeshis at that border have been waiting for up to 10 days for transportation and are becoming increasingly agitated. Fewer people are crossing over from Libya into Tunisia, a drop the UNHCR said coincided with intensified fighting in western Libya. Those fleeing have described risky travel conditions and numerous roadblocks. As the fighting escalates in Libya, many are in dire need of help just to survive, U.N. agencies said. The U.N. World Food Programme said a convoy of its trucks was able to enter eastern Libya and was due to arrive in Benghazi some time Tuesday. The convoy, carrying high-energy date bars, was part of a $39.2 million emergency operation intended to provide food to more than one million people in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia over a three-month period. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Sudanese tell U.N. refugee agency of rape and forced removals .

"Paris (CNN) -- Without the star attraction on Wednesday, this might have just been another fashion show at Paris Fashion Week. There were whispers and rumors that the designer's muse would make an appearance, but no one was certain. We were also in the dark. We knew that Lady Gaga would be strutting down the catwalk as part of Nicola Formichetti's womenswear show for Mugler (of Thierry Mugler fame), but we weren't sure if Gaga would turn up for an interview with CNN. For 24 hours, her people who were in touch with our people could not confirm if the interview would actually go ahead, but they encouraged us to come to Paris anyway to see the catwalk show. So we did. It wasn't your average fashion show. For one, it was in a basketball gym. The basketball hoops were carefully hidden from view, and the set clearly overtook the space. Scores of gothic arches lined the runway with dozens of photographers marking the foot of the catwalk. This made for a striking alternative to just a white walkway for the crowd, but for the scrum of photographers poised at the foot of the runway, this couldn't have been worse. Their concerns were justified. It seemed no one could get a really clear image of the show or the models as they strutted down the catwalk. One photographer said it was hard enough not getting enough space to work in (photographers are usually given little more than the width of their shoulders to set up camp for the show), but it was something else not being able to see the proverbial wood from the trees (full disclosure: the gothic columns were made of wood). Another was so angry that he wouldn't be able to sell any of the footage as he said none of it was useable. But theatrical it was, and Gaga wouldn't have it any other way. Speakers blasted her latest single, ""Born This Way,"" as the superstar strutted down the catwalk amidst the models. The models themselves were interesting. There was a model with his whole shaved head tattooed -- a skull and a brain. He apparently has a starring role in Gaga's ""Born This Way"" video. Then there were the shoes. Some of them were as high as 15 inches (platform of course). It was an extreme runway with some justification as the models teetered tentatively down the end of catwalk. A couple even stumbled. I remember staring at my own 6-inch heels and wondered what I was complaining about as I walked slowly around the show. As for the clothes, I was expecting a lot of leather and PVC -- your average gothic look. I was pleasantly surprised to see some pieces I would wear: gorgeous slinky dresses and yes, even the PVC high-waisted pencil skirt. My producer, Jonathan, tried to stay in the shadows so no one would notice his (in his own words) ""$5 brown corduroy jacket bought from a Kabul market."" When the Lady herself emerged puffing a cigarette, clad in a black bra, black hat, black PVC trousers and VERY high black knee-high boots, sections of the crowd whooped with delight. What you have to know about fashion shows, especially during Paris Fashion Week, is that this is the time for buyers and fashion editors to see the newest collection so it isn't just about the entertainment factor. Anyway, back to the Gaga show. While the set was lit up, the darkness in the crowd was lit by the multitude of LED lights from the many mobile phones capturing every moment. Then just 12 minutes later, the show ended and the crowd slowly exited the gym. However, we went against the tide (me in my 6-inch heels) and made our way backstage. Our contact negotiated with the burly bodyguards to let us through to the other side, where we walked up stairs, across bleachers (me trying not to trip over the miles of lighting cables) to where our second cameraman had set up lights and cameras. This is where the interview with Lady Gaga and Nicola Formichetti would take place -- if it would take place at all. And then we waited. To be fair, when this whole interview opportunity first came up, we were told it would take place after the show at 11 p.m. local time. Then when we got to our spot, we were told Gaga would show up in an hour. Then it was 15 minutes and then it was half an hour. True to their word, 30 minutes later there was a flurry of activity below us, and we saw the singer and her stylist weaving their way through the crowds taking their plaudits from those who were part of the show as they sipped champagne. When Lady Gaga approached, she was in good spirits. She introduced herself as Gaga, and she was excited for her friend Nicola -- he was the man behind the infamous meat dress. In fact, one of the first things she said was she didn't want to take any credit for the show or for the collection. Although she did say she had bought the lot. For Gaga, this was a night not about her but about the man who helped create her image and look. Throughout the interview, she embraced and kissed him. She looked at him lovingly, and they acted like friends in a playground. For his part, he seemed shy, grateful for the applause, but very much taking his cue from his famous friend. The interview went well -- after all, we were talking about the brand (both Mugler and Lady Gaga) -- until I asked about John Galliano, who was ousted from Dior after reportedly making anti-Semitic remarks. I had to. Designer John Galliano apologizes . This was the biggest news during Paris Fashion Week, and people were commenting and reacting. But when I asked the question if they had any reaction to the scandal, you could almost hear a pin drop. Gaga quickly looked at her publicist and said she didn't want to comment. Rather, she said, she wanted ""to keep it positive."" After a few more questions about marketing and business, I commented on her shoes as I wanted to know how she was able to walk in her very high platform shoes, which by the way have no heels. They were high platforms that basically look like she's on her tiptoes. I asked because I was embarrassed to admit I was walking very carefully in my heels. Both Gaga and Formichetti immediately knew the make of my shoes (YSL) and we bonded. The interview came to an end. We took some photographs, and I left for the bureau to edit the piece. We waited for this for over a day, and it was over in 10 minutes. I enjoyed the show. I liked the clothes. I thought she was nice and personable but very careful in what she said. It's not every day I get to interview a megastar, and you couldn't get any bigger than Lady Gaga these days.","CNN's Monita Rajpal is at Paris Fashion Week .

"(CNN) -- Before two pirate leaders departed the captured yacht where they held four Americans earlier this month, a maritime source says they left instructions: Kill the hostages if we do not come back from negotiations. U.S. officials later took the two negotiating pirates into custody -- a move that goes against standard negotiation practices, the maritime source said. The four Americans were later killed, but it is not clear why. Also not clear is when during the negotiations -- or why -- the Americans detained the two pirate negotiators. The pirates' detention goes against standard negotiating practices, as the pirates came in good faith to make a deal to hand over the hostages, said the maritime source, who was briefed on the incident and has connections to British intelligence officials. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. U.S. Central Command declined to comment on whether officials detained the pirates and said the FBI and the Justice Department have the lead in the case. The Justice Department had no comment Sunday. On Friday, the FBI said there was no comment due to the continuing investigation. However, a U.S. government official told CNN the talks with the two pirate negotiators faltered when it was determined the men ""had no authority to negotiate anything."" American officials then took the men into custody rather then let them return to the yacht, the U.S. official said. ""It would be unfathomable to have put them back on the boat where they might have done harm to the hostages,"" the official said, disagreeing with a published report that the detention of two fellow pirates might have upset those still aboard the captured yacht -- named the Quest -- who were holding four Americans. ""There was no change in mood, no escalation"" and gunfire broke out on the Quest more than eight hours later, the U.S. official said. The official took issue with a New York Times report that said the FBI's hostage negotiator aboard the USS Sterett decided the two Somalis were not serious about resolving the matter, which led U.S. officials to take the two men into custody and ask for a new representative from the pirates. According to the the U.S. official,  who was not authorized to discuss the Quest hijacking on the record, the issue was not whether the two pirates were serious about negotiating, but that they lacked the power to cut a deal. The American side continued trying to negotiate via radio with those still aboard the yacht and made an offer, and were told by the suspects aboard the Quest they would sleep on the matter before providing a reply, the U.S. official said. The Navy also tried to contact Somalis on land who might be able to exert influence over the men holding the Quest. The FBI hostage negotiator is part of a special team based at Quantico, Virginia, and had field experience, the U.S. official said. It was unclear if that experience included any previous negotiations with Somali pirates. Americans Jean and Scott Adam, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle were found shot to death after U.S. forces boarded the Quest around 1 a.m. Tuesday, U.S. officials have said. The 58-foot yacht was being shadowed at the time by the military after pirates took it over off the coast of Oman on February 18. U.S. forces had responded after a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a U.S. Navy ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on board the Quest, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mark Fox has said. The killings took place as negotiations involving the FBI were under way for the hostages' release. When Fox spoke last week, he said two pirates boarded a U.S. Navy ship Monday for talks. He told reporters he had no information on details of the negotiations or whether a ransom had been offered. Two pirates were found dead on board the Quest, said Fox. In the process of clearing the vessel, U.S. forces killed two others, he said. Thirteen other pirates were captured and detained on the Quest, along with the other two already aboard the U.S. Navy ship. Fox said authorities believe the pirates were trying to get the vessel and hostages to Somalia, or at least into Somali territorial waters. Piracy has flourished recently off the coast of Somalia, which has not had an effective government for two decades. Globally, more than 50 pirate attacks have already taken place in 2011. As of February 15 -- the most recent statistic posted on the International Maritime Bureau's website, pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages. CNN's Zain Verjee and Carol Cratty contributed to this report .","NEW: A second source says two pirates were detained by U.S. forces .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid's hopes of European success were boosted on Monday with the news that Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka have been passed fit for Tuesday's first leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against English club Tottenham. Top scorer Ronaldo was in doubt for the match, Real's first in the last-eight stage since 2004, due to a recurring hamstring problem suffered before the international break. The Portugal captain missed Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Sporting Gijon which ended Real coach Jose Mourinho's unbeaten home league record that started nine years ago when he was in charge at Porto. However, he trained on Monday along with Brazilians Kaka and Marcelo, who were also named in the 19-man squad following their recovery from thigh and rib problems respectively. Marvelous Mourinho record falls -- but will it ever be beaten? Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso returns after a domestic suspension and striker Gonzalo Higuain should make his second appearance after returning on Saturday as a substitute following back surgery, but France striker Karim Benzema is ruled out along with midfielders Fernando Gago and Pedro Leon. ""This is a match that a lot of people want to play in but are unable to,"" Mourinho told reporters on Monday. ""It has been several years since Real Madrid have played in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. ""The Champions League is the most important club competition in the world. Whoever plays it doesn't have to look far for motivation. All we must do is focus on this match."" Tottenham have also been hit by injuries, but former France international William Gallas may make a surprise return from a knee problem to boost a defensive line-up lacking club captain Ledley King, Jonathan Woodgate, Younes Kaboul and Alan Hutton. Mourinho loses long unbeaten record . Young Wales winger Gareth Bale is expected to return from a hamstring injury after training at the Bernabeu on Monday, and will give Spurs an attacking threat that was missing in the last-16 elimination of AC Milan. ""I was one of the first people to say that Gareth Bale would be an excellent player, and I said it when he still wasn't a familiar face in European football,"" Mourinho said. ""I know he is a great player, but he is young and has a lot of room for improvement. I think he will be the best of the best."" Tottenham reached the European Cup semifinals in 1962, but this is the first time that the London side have qualified for the tournament since it was revamped as the Champions League in 1992. Coach Harry Redknapp said his team have every chance of reaching the last four. ""I don't feel any pressure. No one expected us to be here at the start of the season and we have a big chance of winning,"" he told reporters. ""We are not just coming here to turn up. We want to keep progressing. ""The dream is still there for us, we have to make that dream come true. We want to go all the way if we can. We know how difficult it's going to be, but there is still a chance and we have to take it."" In Tuesday's other quarterfinal first-leg tie, Mourinho's former club Inter Milan continue their title defense against German club Schalke at the San Siro. Schalke beat Inter on penalties in the 1997 UEFA Cup final at that venue, but go into the match with new coach Ralf Rangnick -- who failed to take the club past the group stage in 2005-06 in his first spell in charge. Inter coach Leonardo has yet to win a Champions League match at home, and his side must bounce back from Saturday's demoralizing 3-0 defeat in the Milan derby which put a big dent in Inter's hopes of retaining the Serie A crown. ""The way we qualified has brought confidence, proving that we never give up,"" the Brazilian said of his team's elimination of Schalke's fellow Germans Bayern Munich in the previous round. ""That's what we want to keep doing -- it doesn't matter if we lost the derby on Saturday. I respect the criticism I have had since then but the first-minute goal made life complicated. We're obviously disappointed, but I'm sure my players will react. And, yes, I've never won a Champions League game at home (as a coach) but I'm not dwelling on it."" Schalke's last game against St. Pauli on Friday was called off after an assistant referee was hit by a full beer cup thrown from the crowd, but by that stage defender Christoph Metzelder had already broken his nose and Mario Gavranovic and Peer Kluge also picked up injuries. Former AC Milan striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is ruled out along with Christoph Moritz and Christian Pander. Inter striker Diego Milito, a two-goal hero in last year's final, returned from a two-month injury absence against AC Milan but the Argentine may again start on the bench.","Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Marcelo included in Real Madrid's 19-man squad .

"(CNN) -- Twelve suspected members of the Zetas drug gang and a member of Mexico's Navy were killed in a shootout on an island in a lake that straddles the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities said Monday. The Mexican Navy said the shootout occurred Sunday on Falcon Lake, located between Texas and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, after troops patrolling the area spotted a camping area on an island. The suspected drug traffickers used the island for storing marijuana to be transported by boat to the United States, the Navy said in a statement. After the shootout, the Navy said it seized guns, ammunition and bullet-proof vests from the island. Falcon Lake drew the attention of law enforcement authorities on both side of the border last September after an American man on a personal watercraft was reportedly ambushed by attackers and shot in the head. 2010: 'He took a bullet for me,' Falcon Lake victim's wife says . Tiffany Hartley told police that she and her husband were riding water scooters on the lake on September 30 when they were attacked. Her husband's body has not been found, and the case has remained unsolved. ""It didn't happen in the United States,"" said Zapata County, Texas, Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez. Suspects in Falcon Lake killing identified . And Mexican authorities, he told CNN last month, have ""somewhat of a zero solvency rate, and a zero conviction rate."" ""So unfortunately, this case may remain open forever, even though the information and the evidence may be there,"" according to Gonzalez.","Mexico's Navy says a shootout occurred around an island used to store marijuana .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of firing an assault rifle in a shootout with authorities, which happened shortly after he tried to force his way onto a Missouri military base, was arrested Thursday on a college campus, police said. Cody Wilcoxson was armed with an AK-47 gun when he was detained at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, said Rolla Police Chief Mark Kearse. Police were able to take him into custody without any shots being fired on campus, he said. That wasn't the case earlier, according to Kearse. He said Wilcoxson tried to get onto Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army base more than 25 miles west of Rolla. The man did not manage to enter the military base. But afterward, the police chief said, he fired dozens of rounds of bullets from his assault rifle in a shootout with police. He then likely headed east down Route 44 to the university, Kearse said. Despite the exchange of gunfire, there no reports of injuries. CNN's Rich Porter contributed to this report.","Missouri police chief says Cody Wilcoxson got in a shootout with police .

"London (CNN) -- British Airways and Unite -- the union representing many of the airline's cabin crew -- reached an agreement on Thursday, reducing the threat of strikes. The deal, announced by a Unite spokesman, signals the end of a long-running dispute between cabin crew and the airline over pay and working conditions. Unite says it will not be calling for any industrial action following the talks as BA agreed to restore travel concessions to staff who went on strike. Unite said a two-year pay rise had also been agreed, giving rises of 4% this year and 3.5% next year, subject to productivity agreements. The agreement is to be put to a ballot of around 7,000 workers, with a recommendation to accept. Industrial action would have been called within days if the deal had not been negotiated, the Press Association reported. Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, said in a written statement: ""We always said that this dispute could only be settled by negotiation, not by confrontation or litigation. And so it has proved."" A spokesman for BA said: ""We are very pleased the threat of industrial action has been lifted and that we have reached a point where we can put this dispute behind us."" BA's cabin crew employees have been embroiled in an ongoing wage dispute over the past two years and some 6,700 crew participated in 22-days of strikes last year. In late March, cabin crew vote by more than 8-1 to stage fresh strikes. Of the 10,000 crew polled, 83% of the 6,981 who returned valid ballot papers voted yes to strike action. But in mid-April BA and Unite agreed a 28-day extension before any further strike action was called.","Unite says it will not be calling for any industrial action following the talks .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama heads to El Paso, Texas, on Tuesday to give a speech on the need for comprehensive immigration reform -- a perennial hot-button political issue that both Democrats and Republicans hope to use to their advantage in 2012. Obama has held a series of meetings with key Latino officials and reform advocates in recent weeks. Despite an aggressive push for substantive policy changes from his political base, the president recently indicated he has ruled out acting on his own to implement provisions of a reform bill that failed to win congressional approval last year. Nevertheless, immigration reform ""remains a priority"" for the administration, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday. There has been bipartisan support for reform in the past, Carney noted, and ""we think we can build support for it again in the future."" The issue requires ""focus,"" ""education,"" and ""persistence,"" Carney said. ""The sooner it gets done, the better for the country."" Carney said the president's speech is likely to highlight border security improvements and the economic costs stemming from a failure to change course. Republican leaders have indicated an unwillingness to consider broader changes -- including a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- until the Mexican border is brought under tighter control. Conservative frustration has boiled over in recent months in form of a rash of state-level proposals to apprehend and deport illegal immigrants. Key parts of an Arizona law requiring police officers to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other statutes were recently blocked by the federal courts. The Justice Department sued Arizona, arguing that only the federal government has the authority to dictate immigration policy. Progressive reform advocates, meanwhile, have been frustrated by Congress's inability to pass the DREAM Act, which would offer legal standing to immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the country for at least five years. The bill would require, among other things, a high school or General Education Development diploma, two years of college or military service, and criminal background checks. Advocates say the bill would give legal standing to young people brought to the United States by their parents who have bettered themselves and served their new country. Republican opponents equate the measure to amnesty, and have said it would signal to the world that the United States is not serious about enforcing its laws or its borders. They have also called the bill unfair to immigrants who, in many cases, waited years to come to the country legally. The measure was defeated by a Republican filibuster in the Senate last December after winning passage in the House of Representatives. Most analysts believe it has little chance of clearing the GOP-controlled House now. Regardless, the immigration issue remains politically potent. Obama won several Western states in 2008 -- including Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada -- partly on the rising power of the Latino vote. Democrats believe Hispanic voters might put traditionally Republican Arizona in play next year. In the long run, Democrats are also hoping to use their advantage among Hispanics to make inroads in core GOP states such as Texas. Obama won over two-thirds of the nationwide Hispanic vote in 2008. His approval rating among Hispanics hovered around 68 percent during the first three months of this year, according to the most recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation polls. For their part, Republicans have depended on the immigration issue in the past to fire up conservative voters. Some analysts also believe that if Democrats push too hard, too fast on immigration, particularly in tough economic times, it could push swing voters toward the GOP.","President Obama will discuss the need for immigration reform Tuesday in El Paso .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan looked likely Sunday to win the election, a CNN tally of preliminary results showed. The Independent National Electoral Commission posted on its website the count from 28 of the country's 36 states and its capital, showing Jonathan with more than 19 million votes, compared to his main challenger -- Muhammadu Buhari -- who had close to 9 million votes. A formal announcement of the results could come as early as Monday. To avoid a runoff, Jonathan must get at least a quarter of the vote in two-thirds of the 36 states and the capital. Nigerians voted Saturday for their president, a week after parliamentary elections were marred by violence and accusations of fraud in Africa's most populous nation. Jonathan is the front-runner despite a poor performance in those elections by his People's Democratic Party. He is popular in the Christian and animist south. The former vice president assumed office after President Umaru Yar'Adua died last year following treatment for a kidney ailment in Saudi Arabia. Jonathan has led the nation of about 150 million people since May. About 73 million people were registered to vote. His main challenger, Buhari, is a former military ruler and was a contestant in the 2003 and 2007 elections. He is the candidate for the Congress for Progressive Change and enjoys support from the mostly Muslim north. Other candidates included Nuhu Ribadu and current Kano state Gov. Ibrahim Shekarau. A CNN iReporter in Lagos, who gave her name as Jan Young, said Saturday she expected the race to be tight. ""If the incumbent president wins, it won't be a landslide victory but a fair split between the ruling and opposition parties who campaigned for our votes. I also expect our nation would demand accountability from whoever wins at the end of the day,"" she wrote. Saturday's voting was largely peaceful, in contrast to the violence that characterized the country's parliamentary elections on April 9. During that vote, separate bomb blasts ripped through a polling station and a collation center in northeastern Nigeria. Human Rights Watch has estimated that at least 85 people have been killed in political violence so far. A new election chief promised free and fair elections, but the electoral commission was forced to put off elections earlier this year by a week after logistical problems, including party logos missing from ballot papers, were reported nationwide. It was a major setback reminiscent of the nation's 2007 elections, which the European Union described as filled with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and its largest oil producer, is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States, and hosts many Western oil companies and workers. Nigerians voted April 9 for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. A gubernatorial vote will be held on April 26.","Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan is the front-runner .

"(CNN) -- The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said in a report Wednesday there are ""reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed and continue being committed in Libya."" The report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's government, as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country. It also noted war crimes, including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting.  ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are ""most responsible for the crimes committed.""  The individuals were not named. ""It is indeed a characteristic of the situation in Libya that massive crimes are reportedly committed upon instruction of a few persons who control the organizations that execute the orders,"" the report said. ""Arresting those who ordered the commission of crimes, should the judges decide to issue warrants, will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya."" In March, shortly after the International Criminal Court was asked to investigate the issue, a court spokeswoman said Gadhafi would probably face serious charges. But the prosecutor did not name the people against whom he had evidence. ""Even today, people in Tripoli are arrested illegally, tortured and they disappear,"" Moreno-Ocampo told CNN. ""We have evidence of that and we will show it to the judges."" It is not clear if he plans to file charges against anyone on the rebel side, though the report mentioned ""alleged war crimes as well as other crimes against humanity"" appear to have been committed by ""different parties."" He warned when he opened the probe two months ago that the rebels are subject to international law just as Gadhafi's forces are. ""Now, there are people opposing Gadhafi with weapons. And also we would like to warn them, you cannot commit crimes. Our business in Libya is (to) stop the crimes,"" he told CNN in March. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the specter of ICC prosecution ""should warn those around Gadhafi about the perils of continuing to tie their fate to his."" ""Gadhafi has lost any and all legitimacy to lead Libya,"" she said, remarking on ""widespread and systematic attacks"" against civilians by government forces. Her comments were later echoed by the acting deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Mark Toner, who called on Gadhafi to cease hostilities and to ""allow the International Organization for Migration and other organizations to provide much needed relief and evacuation services to civilians caught up in the Libyan conflict."" He said the United States is making available an additional $6.5 million for the migration organization's operations in Libya. That means the United States now is shelling out a total of $53.5 million in emergency assistance ""to meet the humanitarian needs of conflict victims, vulnerable migrants, and others displaced by the civil unrest in Libya,"" he said. But the Russian ambassador to the United Nations said Russia is ""deeply alarmed by the growing number of civilian causalities and the destruction of civilian facilities as a result of the actions by opposing Libyan parties."" ""Unfortunately it must be noted that actions by NATO-led coalition forces also lead to civilian causalities,"" said Ambassador Vitaly Churkin. ""This took place in particular during recent bombings in Tripoli."" He warned against exceeding the mandate established by U.N. Security Council resolution 1973, which allows military action in Libya to protect civilians. ""Any disproportionate use of force is unacceptable,"" he said. This is the first time the International Criminal Court has begun investigating possible crimes against humanity as they were occurring in wartime, Moreno-Ocampo said. Social networking websites such as Facebook were part of the reason that was possible, he said. ""This triggered a very quick reaction. The (United Nations) Security Council reacted in a few days, the U.N. General Assembly reacted in a few days. So, now because the Court is up and running we can do this immediately,"" he said. ""I think Libya is a new world,"" he added. ""How we manage the new challenge, that's what we will see now."" The United Kingdom used Wednesday's meeting to support investigations in Libya, while also using the forum to urge Syria not to attack protesting civilians. ""The deteriorating situation in Syria is of increasing concern in this regard,"" said Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant. ""The violent repression there must stop immediately."" Meanwhile, Gadhafi's forces once again shelled Misrata's port on Wednesday, leaving five people dead and dozens injured, a rebel spokesman told CNN. The shelling started around 1 p.m. ""This is the only terminal we have for the city and for humanitarian vessels to come in and take foreigners out,"" rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan said. A few ambulances and private cars arrived on the scene to take the casualties away after the shelling stopped. The International Organization for Migration told CNN that it had one chartered vessel that entered Misrata's port early Wednesday morning. Contact was made with the ship's captain, and no one was injured on the boat. Some 840 migrants have boarded the boat, and more were being placed on board, the IOM said. The vessel, which had brought 180 tons of humanitarian aid to Misrata, was expected to depart in the afternoon. As the bloody battles in the North African country dragged into their fourth month, a U.N. official said the Libyan government and opposition members were trying to find a way for a cease-fire. Abdul Ilah al-Khatib, the U.N.'s  special envoy to Libya, said both sides had told him that they were ready for a cease-fire. The only problem was that they disagreed on what conditions would be needed to lay down arms, the envoy said. The Libyan government wants an end to NATO aerial attacks; the opposition wants Gadhafi to step down and will not negotiate with him or any of his family members, al-Khatib said. ""A real and credible cease-fire must be agreed upon to suspend aggressive actions and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children,"" al-Khatib told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.  ""A cease-fire must be declared either formally, or -- in a first step -- as part of an informal understanding between the opposing forces in Libya."" NATO began bombing Libya on March 19, after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary, short of invasion, to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. This weekend, Libyan authorities said one of Gadhafi's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed by a NATO airstrike. This prompted an increase in pro-Gadhafi forces' attacks in rebel-held cities and also in the beleaguered western port city of Misrata, witnesses said. An explosion rocked Benghazi Tuesday, the eastern city that is controlled by rebel fighters. The blast damaged several cars in Benghazi's main square and a rebel spokesman blamed it on Gadhafi supporters who were somehow able to infiltrate the rebel-held city. CNN could not independently confirm that report. The continued fighting has sent people fleeing. More than 8,000 people -- most of them women and children -- fled into Tunisia over the weekend to escape the fighting between Libyan government troops and opposition forces, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday . Nearly 40,000 Libyans have fled the country's western mountainous region in the past month as pro-Gadhafi and opposition forces have fought for control of the border crossing point, according to the U.N. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat and Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.S. is making available an additional $6.5 million for emergency assistance .

"(CNN) -- Volunteers and veterinarians caring round the clock for stranded pilot whales were buoyed Saturday evening by news that two were released off the Florida Keys. After being transported by boat, the males swam away in the Atlantic Ocean about nine miles off the lower Florida Keys shortly before 6 p.m., said Karrie Carnes, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokeswoman. The pair are 12 feet and 13 feet long and weigh more than 1,000 pounds each. They are considered teenagers. Five other surviving pilot whales are being cared for in a sea pen established at Cudjoe Key, about 20 miles east of Key West. ""They (the whales) are being literally cradled 24 hours a day,"" Carnes said. Fourteen whales died after stranding themselves in shallow waters over a 12-mile stretch of sand flats. Veterinarians are not sure why the protected whales came to shore, said Carnes, adding that they are usually found in 300-meter deep waters in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. ""We may never know why this group stranded."" The pod showed no evident signs of significant emaciation or illness, but may have become disoriented and followed each other to the shore. ""They are very social animals,"" Carnes said. The rescue effort, which began Thursday, has included hundreds of federal and state employees, veterinarians and volunteers, said Carnes, who works at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Rescuers plan to transfer the five survivors to a rehabilitation facility in Key Largo once they are healthy enough to undergo the journey, Carnes told CNN. Tents and wet sheets are protecting the five from the sun and temperatures. Veterinarians are checking their blood and body fluids and are pumping them with antibiotics and enzymes. Volunteers from the Marine Mammal Conservancy in Key Largo have been crucial to the operation. ""For a lot of people, marine animals are very charismatic,"" Carnes said. ""People have a love of the ocean and mysteries of the deep."" Sea World, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also have provided assistance in the lifesaving effort. Adult pilot whales can measure up to 20 feet long and weigh up to 3 tons. Due to their social nature, they are often involved in mass strandings, according to the American Cetacean Society. The ACS is a nonprofit group based in California that works to protect whales, dolphins and porpoises, according to its website. A similar incident occurred in the Florida Keys in 2003, when 28 whales were stranded. Most of them died, but after several months of care, five were released back into the ocean. CNN's Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","Two male pilot whales are released in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida Keys .

"(EW.com)  -- Will Ferrell, blithe impersonator of obtuse elves, TV anchormen, and former presidents, is not the first actor one thinks of to play Nick Halsey, an alcoholic wretch on a bender, in the sober indie drama ""Everything Must Go."" On one rock-bottom day, Nick is fired from his sales job and his wife leaves him, having first changed the locks and piled all his possessions in their suburban front yard. The sight of indoor stuff splayed outdoors may be absurd. But there is nothing at all funny about the pathetic mess Nick continues to make of his life. And Ferrell, whose vaguely uncomprehending onscreen stare usually signals amusing male cluelessness to come, upends expectations from the very first scene, as Nick sits in his car, locked in a traffic standstill and palpably unable to endure the stress without a pull on his liquor flask. With characteristic physical fearlessness, the actor becomes a downward-spiraling alcoholic. No joke. It's a terrific performance -- one that's unmatched by the rest of the movie, written and directed by Dan Rush. Based on Raymond Carver's notable short story ''Why Don't You Dance?,'' ""Everything Must Go"" is a sweetened-up, padded-out scenario of hope cracking through a drunk's despair. Rush's background as a director of commercials is evident in his feature-film debut: Everything and everyone look 10 degrees softer and more composed than they need to be. Carver's original minimalist story goes down in two gulps: The drinking guy sells his stuff to a young couple passing by. The end. Rush's adaptation skips the young couple, expands the yard sale, and adds a cop who's Nick's AA sponsor (Michael Peña). EW.com: See all of this week's reviews . There's also: a lonely black kid who becomes Nick's protégé (Christopher Jordan Wallace); an old high school classmate (Laura Dern, in a fine, subtle, self-contained scene) who assures Nick that he really does have a heart; and a neighbor across the street (Rebecca Hall) who's pregnant. Despite Nick's worst, hurtful behavior toward her, she's willing to extend a kind of forgiveness. Ferrell, for his part, looks like he would have no problem going even deeper and darker than Rush could bear. Like Bill Murray and Greg Kinnear before him, this funnyman reveals serious acting chops.

"(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o scored his 17th goal in 16 games but his controversial penalty could only salvage a 1-1 home draw for Italian champions Inter Milan against Brescia in the San Siro on Saturday. Andrea Caracciolo put newly-promoted Brescia in front in the first half, but it was canceled out by Eto'o's strike after the break. The Cameroon international went down himself in the penalty area as he tussled with Gaetano Berardi, but the award of the spot-kick was met with disbelief by the visiting players. The disappointing draw leaves Inter three points adrift of leaders Lazio, who are playing Roma in the capital derby on Sunday. Inter came into the match off the back of a 3-1 reverse to Tottenham Hotspur and with coach Rafael Benitez having to shuffle his pack after injuries to key players. But striker Diego Milito was able to start his first game for over a month and was soon involved as he shot just wide. Brescia were ahead on 14 minutes as Caracciolo slipped the ball under home keeper Luca Castellazzi. Eto'o, who is in the form of his life, twice came close to an equalizer and then set up Goran Pandev for a chance he spurned from close range. Inter lost Maicon and Walter Samuel to injury after the break and struggled for an equalizer before they won their penalty on 73 minutes. TV replays appeared to indicated Eto'o had trod on the ball as he went down, but Benitez said the award was fair. ""From the bench it seemed a penalty to me,"" he told AFP. Milito shot over in injury time from a great position, but defeat would have been harsh on Brescia. In other Serie A action on Saturday, Bologna moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Lecce with Marco Di Vaio and Henry Gimenez scoring in the final six minutes.","Inter Milan held to 1-1 home draw against Brescia on San Siro .

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut teenager's unique prom proposal at his school's entrance, which resulted in him being banned from the event, is garnering legislative attention, according to one state representative. State Rep. Jason Perillo said he and fellow Republican state Rep. Sean Williams are drafting legislation that would allow school administrations, along with the parents and the student, to create a community-service option to determine the best course of discipline. This legislation comes after Shelton, Connecticut, high school senior James Tate, along with two friends, received an ""in-house"" suspension on Tuesday for pasting in large letters a prom invitation on his high school's entrance. The message read, ""Sonali Rodrigues, Will you go to prom with me? HMU (Hit me Up) -Tate.""    Rodrigues accepted Tate's invitation. However, according to Shelton High School officials, any student who receives an in-school or out-of-school suspension for any reason will not be allowed to attend the prom, thereby banning Tate and his two friends. ""This regulation is reinforced over the course of the spring by daily ... announcements, posted signage in common areas of the building, and in classrooms, as well as information letters and automated phone messages to parents,"" Beth Smith, the school's headmaster, said in a statement Thursday. ""These communications are intended to remind our students and parents of the high school expectations and consequences. This unfortunate situation is a result of one of those consequences."" Tate told CNN that the invitation ""was a harmless, fun, thoughtful and creative way to ask a girl to prom."" ""She's my best friend,"" he said of Rodrigues, ""and I wanted to give her something special."" Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti admited he was surprised about the amount of attention the story has received, but he said he thinks that the prom ban deserves a second look. ""We put regulations in place that are inflexible and that do not allow for us to apply some common sense or have flexibility,"" said Lauretti.    ""Their regulation says if a kid gets suspended after April 1st, they cannot go to the prom."" Tate's prom ban is causing an outpouring of support for Tate and Rodrigues on Facebook; over 110,000 people have ""liked"" the page ""Let James Tate Go To the Prom.""  One message reads, ""this punishment DOES NOT fit this crime at all !!!,"" while another says, ""LET THE KID GO TO PROM!"" T-shirts with the slogan ""Team Tate"" are also on sale. A website called ""James Tate Senior Prom 2011"" is asking supporters to make donations to help him get the ""prom he deserves."" Meanwhile, state legislator Perillo told CNN, ""I do think punishment is necessary but I don't think the punishment fits the crime."" ""It perhaps wasn't smart, but creative,"" Tate's mother Tracey said.  ""I think they could have handled it differently, something more appropriate,"" she added. Calls to Shelton High School, the Connecticut State Department of Education and the Shelton school superintendent's office were not returned. CNN's Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","James Tate wanted to make a special invitation for his prom date .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Justice Department lawyer testified Friday the department does not enforce certain voting law cases when the victims are white, and called the decision to drop a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party ""a travesty of justice."" Christopher Coates, who headed the department's Voting Rights section in 2008, said he believes some senior civil rights officials at the Justice Department enforce voting cases ""in a racially selective manner."" Coates testified, against the instructions of his Justice Department bosses, before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, saying he felt obligated to correct statements made by the current Voting Rights section chief that race is not a factor in deciding which cases to pursue. Coates said there has been a long-held hostility by some Justice Department lawyers toward voting rights cases against African-American defendants. One staff researcher ""informed me in no uncertain terms that he had not come to the Voting section to sue African-American defendants,"" Coates testified. And the election of President Barack Obama ""brought to positions of influence and power within the Civil Rights Division many of the very people who had demonstrated hostility to the concept of equal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act,"" Coates said. Among those promoted was a lawyer who, Coates said, had prohibited him from asking job applicants if they would enforce the voting laws in a race-neutral manner. A Justice Department spokesman Friday afternoon called the Civil Rights Commission's investigation ""thin on facts and evidence and thick on rhetoric."" ""The department makes enforcement decisions based on the merits, not the race, gender or ethnicity of any party involved,"" spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said. The New Black Panther Party case stemmed from an incident on November 4, 2008 -- Election Day -- when two members of the party stood outside a Philadelphia polling station yelling racial slurs. Both men wore paramilitary outfits and black books; one held a nightstick. No voters filed complaints in the incident, but it was captured on video and appeared on national television. Coates told the Civil Rights Commission, ""White voters also have an interest in being able to go to the polls without having race-haters such as Black Panther King Samir Shabazz -- whose public rhetoric includes such statements as 'kill cracker babies' -- standing at the entrance of the polling place with a billy club in his hand hurling racial slurs."" He called it ""outrageous conduct"" and a ""travesty of justice for the Justice Department not to allow attorneys in the Voting Section to obtain nationwide injunctive relief against all four of the defendants."" The Bush-era Justice Department charged the New Black Panther Party and three of its members with voter intimidation, and a judge entered a default judgment against them the following April when they failed to appear in court. But in May of 2009, the Justice Department dismissed the cases against all the defendants except the man carrying the nightstick. Coates declined to discuss the Justice Department's internal deliberations on the matter, saying he was honoring the department's assertion that internal discussions are protected from disclosure. But he acknowledged reports that he had fought the dismissal of the charges, including one heated confrontation in which he cursed at a more senior official. The decision to drop the case ""was intended to send a direct message"" that the filing of similar voting cases ""would not continue in the Obama administration,"" Coates testified . He said he was specifically instructed not to pursue cases against jurisdictions for having ineligible voters on their voting rolls, saying one jurisdiction had 130 percent more voters on its rolls than it had adult residents. But he did not ascribe racial motives to that order, saying instead he believed that his bosses would rather leave 100 non-eligible people on voter rolls rather than risk taking one person off who is eligible. Nonetheless, he said, it is wrong to ignore voter list violations because the violations make vote fraud easier to conceal. Coates' testimony follows that of former Justice Department attorney J. Christian Adams, who also testified there was a ""pervasive hostility"" in the Justice Department toward enforcing voting rights cases against African-Americans. The Justice Department Friday said it is committed to the color-blind enforcement of laws. ""Let's not forget the context in which these allegations are being made,"" spokesman Schmaler said in a written statement. ""The politicization that occurred in the Civil Rights Division in the previous administration has been well documented by the inspector general, and it was a disgrace to the great history of the division. We have changed that."" The Black Panther case has been a contentious matter before the Civil Rights Commission. One hearing this summer erupted in shouting between commission members, with conservative commission members accusing the Justice Department of ""stonewalling"" the commission's investigation into the dismissed charges, and a liberal commission member, in turn, calling those complaints the ""last gasps of a conservative majority of this commission.""","Justice Department lawyer says some civil rights cases are suppressed .

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. Border Patrol agents who were assisting in the apprehension of suspected illegal immigrants were killed Thursday when their vehicle was struck by a train, officials said. They were driving an unmarked Border Patrol vehicle when it was struck by a 90-car freight train at a crossing about nine miles west of Gila Bend, Arizona, the agency said. Authorities were investigating what caused the accident that killed Border Patrol Agents Eduardo Rojas Jr. and Hector Clark, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement. The vehicle, an SUV, was struck by the train at the rail crossing of Paloma Road near exit 106 of Interstate 8. ""This is unfortunate not just for me, not just for the Yuma Sector, but for the Border Patrol as a whole,"" Border Patrol spokesman Kenneth Quillin said. The agents were on duty and were assisting other officers in tracking down a group of people suspected to have entered the country illegally, Quillin said. The agents were trying to position themselves north of where the other agents were, he said. Both Clark, 39, and Rojas, 35, were lead agents in the Border Patrol's Yuma Sector, the agency said. Rojas, who had been working with the patrol for more than 11 years, is survived by his wife and two children. Clark, who had been working with the patrol for nearly 10 years, also is survived by his wife and two children. ""This tragedy is a reminder to all of us that whether they are facing down a criminal suspect with a weapon, or patrolling the highways and deserts, these law enforcement professionals encounter life-threatening dangers every day,"" Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne said. Napolitano noted the service of others as she expressed sympathy for the victims and their families. ""We also keep in our thoughts and prayers all of those who put their lives at risk every day, at home and abroad, to defend our country. We honor their service and pray for their continued safety,"" she said. On Friday, a Mexican man was arraigned in a U.S. federal court for the killing last December of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in Arizona.

"Paris (CNN) -- French air accident investigators probing a mysterious crash that killed 228 people will not bring more bodies up from the Atlantic Ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday. Those two bodies are being examined to see if there is enough DNA to identify them, investigators said, adding that they hope to have results by Wednesday. If they can identify the remains, they will consider bringing up other bodies from the wreckage of Air France flight 447, which crashed nearly two years ago off the coast of Brazil. Only about 50 bodies were recovered in the aftermath of the crash. The bulk of the wreckage was located earlier this year and contains many more human remains, investigators say. Recovering more bodies will be a difficult task, with miles of cable required to bring each one up over a period of three hours, they said. Relatives of the victims are divided on whether they should be left in place or brought to the surface. Experts trying to figure out why the plane crashed expect to know Monday whether they will be able to recover information from data recorders found at the bottom of the ocean, they said Thursday. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found almost two weeks ago after an unprecedented series of submarine searches of a mountain range 3,900 meters (12,700 feet) under the ocean. They were brought to the surface and taken to Paris by ship and plane. Over the next several days, their protective casing will be removed, salt will be cleaned off, and the recorders will be left out to dry, investigators told journalists in Paris Thursday. Once they are dry, any further salt residue will be removed. Investigators will assess the recorders visually, then check the state of the memory cards and finally make a back-up of the cards. This could take up to three days, they said. Only then they will begin to analyze what is on the recorders, they added. Investigators also brought an engine and an avionics bay containing computers to the surface Monday, they said . The pilots of Air France 447 lost contact with air traffic controllers on June 1, 2009, while flying across an area of the Atlantic known for severe turbulence, officials said. But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the ocean remains a mystery. The plane belly-flopped into the water while en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, falling so fast that air masks did not have time to deploy. The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said. A first body was recovered May 3, still buckled into its seat, days after the data recorders were found, the French Interior Ministry said. The body ""appeared degraded,"" the ministry added in a written statement. Another body was brought up two days later. ""The attempts to bring up the bodies were made in particularly complex conditions. Considerable uncertainties still remain regarding the technical feasibility of recovering the bodies,"" the Interior Ministry statement said. DNA samples from the remains will be sent to a laboratory for analysis, the statement added. Some relatives of those who died have expressed reservations about remains being brought to the surface. Last month Robert Soulas, head of a support group for families of flight victims, said: ""For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."" Other relatives have called for the bodies to be recovered. France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said last week that the external casings of both the flight recorders -- which record data and cockpit voices -- were in good condition and that they had started a ""drying"" process. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based BEA, said at the time that even if there was some internal damage to the recorders, some data might still be recoverable. ""We must be very very careful... we are confident but it will take time for us to know whether we can retrieve all the data."" But Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, a British aviation consultancy, said: ""I remain skeptical about how useful this device (memory unit) will be. If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split up. You also have the corrosive effects of seawater and the immense depths involved.""

"(CNN)  -- South African Thomas Aiken dedicated his maiden European Tour win to golf legend Seve Ballesteros after claiming the Spanish Open by two shots Sunday. Aiken carded a closing 70 at El Prat for a 10-under total of 278. Denmark's Anders Hansen finished second on eight-under with Scotland's Scott Jamieson and Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal sharing third a further shot back. The death of Spain's Ballesteros Saturday cast a shadow over the tournament with the players observing a minute's silence during the third round action. ""It's been a sad week with Seve passing away,"" said the 27-year-old Aiken. ""I definitely want to dedicate this win to him with it being his home Open and what he gave to his home fans and to golf,"" he told the official European Tour website. Golf legend Ballesteros dies aged 54 . All the players wore black armbands on the final day as Aiken kept his nerve to earn South Africa their fifth win on the European Tour this season. ""I've been waiting for this for a long, long time and I've been knocking on the door. I'm ecstatic,"" he added. Hansen broke out of a tie for second with a birdie on the final hole while Welshman Phillip Price and France's Gregory Havret both bogeyed the 18th to drop into a tie for fifth with Scot Paul Lawrie, England's Simon Dyson and David Horsey and Havret's compatriot Romain Wattel. Jose Maria Olazábal, mourning the loss of his great friend and ex-Ryder Cup partner Ballesteros, bravely played the final round but shot a five-over 77 to finish on eight-over.","Thomas Aiken of South Africa wins Spanish Open title at El Prat .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Peruvians will head to the polls Sunday in a tight race that centers on how to best manage Peru's robust economic growth. Peru can expect growth of 7% this year, according to the World Bank, and is one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America. The country overcame the global financial crisis relatively unharmed, maintaining GDP growth, employment creation and poverty reduction, according Peru's ministry of economics and finance. The good news comes with high expectations from Peruvians, who want to see the rewards of this progress in tangible ways in their lives. While the economy as a whole has done well, salaries have remained depressed during the same period. So the big question for Peruvians this Sunday is, who will make the most of the recent combination of good macroeconomic management and high commodity prices? They have five main choices who are so close in the polls that pollsters anticipate there will be a second round of voting. But it is impossible to predict which two candidates will make it to the second round. Peruvian law forbids the publishing of poll numbers one week prior to election day, but the trend from all pollsters previously was a rise for Ollanta Humala, who entered the final stretch as the leader of the pack. The nationalist Humala represents the most radical departure from the rest of the pack. The former army officer, who participated in a failed uprising in 2000, lost to current President Alan Garcia in the second round of the last presidential elections. His previous presidential bid was sunk in part because of accusations that he admired and would emulate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who embarked on a socialist reorganization of his country. Humala denies that he would follow in Chavez's footsteps, and has portrayed himself as an admirer of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who represented a more center-left position. ""I think (Humala) has tried much harder to appear more moderate, more centered,"" analyst Giovanna Penaflor said. Running close to him is Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori. At 36, she is the youngest of the candidates. At 19, she was the country's first lady for her father. ""She is young, which is both a positive and negative characteristic,"" Penaflor said. ""It puts her close to a very important segment of voters, but it detracts from her experience."" Critics have accused her of campaigning more to free her father, who is serving multiple, concurrent 25-year sentences, but she says that his case should rest on decisions from the judiciary, not the executive. Another former president, Alejandro Toledo, also has the potential to advance to the second round. Toledo, who was the face of the opposition to Fujimori, championed market-oriented policies that helped Peru grow during his term from 2001 to 2006, but was unpopular in the polls. He is enjoying a resurgence of popularity that he is riding into this weekend's elections. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is another surging candidate. The economist is a one-time minister of energy and mines, minister of economy, and prime minister. In addition to his Peruvian citizenship he holds an American one, which has been the source of criticism. But Kuczynski has embraced his Peruvian nationality on the campaign trail, even adopting the cuy, a Peruvian guinea pig served as a traditional dish, as his mascot. The final leading candidate is Luis Castaneda, a former mayor of Lima. ""He is an efficient and successful public administrator that has done works for the good of the community, and Lima has recognized that with a very high approval rating,"" analyst Luis Benavente said. ""But in the campaign, he was unable to turn it into a national symbol."" The top two vote-getters would face each other in a runoff on June 5.

"New York (CNN) -- The head of the National Black Farmers Association renewed his call Tuesday for Congress to fund a historic discrimination case settlement involving minority farmers. He slammed the sharply divided Senate for repeatedly stripping funding provisions from different bills, and urged President Obama to call for a decisive vote on the measure by the end of September. ""Suffering is an understatement of what is going on with black farmers,"" John Boyd said in front of a federal courthouse in lower Manhattan. We ""are tired of waiting."" Boyd said black farmers are losing land at a rate three times faster than other agricultural workers. He said that it takes nearly 400 days to process a black farmer's loan request at the Agriculture Department, compared with less than 30 days for white farmers. ""Congress has money for everything -- to bail out banks, Wall Street, AIG, everybody,"" he said.  But ""we can't seem to get this done.  There is something terribly wrong with that picture."" Boyd showed up in front of the courthouse with a mule -- a reference to Civil War-era promises of assistance for freed African-American slaves. Last month, the U.S. Senate failed to approve $1.25 billion for the settlement between the U.S. Agriculture Department and black farmers, prompting finger-pointing by members of both parties and outrage among many black farmers. ""We are very, very, very disappointed that we are just caught up in such a larger political fight in the Senate, where it's just partisan division,"" Boyd said after the August 5 outcome. A 1997 case against the Agriculture Department, Pigford v. Glickman, was settled out of court 11 years ago, but tens of thousands of farmers missed the filing deadline to submit claims. As a senator, Obama sponsored a measure in the 2008 Farm Bill that reopened the case, known as Pigford II. The  $1.25 billion settlement is owed to the farmers after years of being denied government farm loans and support from federal programs because of the color of their skin. Under a federal judge's terms dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. In February, the Department of Justice released a statement saying Attorney General Eric Holder and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack were announcing a resolution to Pigford II. The statement said the settlement agreement is contingent on the appropriation of funds by Congress. ""Following the appropriation, class members may pursue their individual claims through a non-judicial claims process in front of a neutral arbitrator,"" the Justice Department statement said. ""Claimants who establish their credit-related claims will be entitled to receive up to $50,000 and debt relief. A separate track may provide actual damages of up to $250,000 through a more rigorous process. The actual value of awards may be reduced based on the total amount of funds made available and the number of successful claims."" Prominent members of both parties have voiced support for paying out the settlements. In July, the House approved a war supplemental funding bill that included money to pay for the settlement. But the attempt to approve the funds in August failed in the Senate. It was the seventh attempt by the Senate to approve the funds, Boyd said. CNN's Shawna Shepherd, Alan Silverleib, Elise Zeiger and Ed Hornick contributed to this report.","NEW: Association chief urges final Senate vote on black farmers' aid by end of month .

"(CNN) -- Clinging to Scotland's rugged east coast is a golf course so tough it once reduced Sergio Garcia to tears. Just imagine what it could do to a hopeless weekend hacker. Aspiring basketball players may struggle to ever play at Madison Square Gardens, but one of the world's most historic golf courses is open to all comers. Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have walked its fairways. And so have I. That's the beauty of golf; you don't have to imagine. If you've got $220 spare you can take your clubs to Carnoustie and discover firsthand why the locals call it ""Carnasty."" ""We get golfers of all abilities, from pros to relative beginners,"" said Rod Soutar, who's been a caddy at Carnoustie for 30 years. ""You just hope they can relax and enjoy it."" This relative beginner was far from relaxed as I stood before the packed clubhouse terrace, preparing for the most terrifying tee shot of my life. ""Watch out for the thick rough on the right, the out of bounds to the left and the bunkers up ahead,"" said my caddy with no hint of irony. She didn't mention that there were also a hundred or so people standing by ready to burst into laughter if the predicted shank ensued. ""It's all about having realistic expectations,"" said Souter, who caddied for Tiger Woods at the 1996 Scottish Open. ""The problem a lot of golfers have is they want to go home and tell their friends 'I shot a 69 at Carnoustie,' but it's not going to happen. ""I've had golfers throwing clubs in frustration -- and even heard of people walking off the course in the middle of a round. They want to play to their handicap, but they don't realize how much more difficult that is here."" Carnoustie has hosted seven British Opens and is regularly ranked the most difficult golf course on the planet. In 1999 conditions were so tough a 19-year-old Garcia had to be comforted by his mother after shooting an 89. But that doesn't put off the thousands of golfing tourists who make the pilgrimage every year. ""Amateur golfers want to play famous courses like Carnoustie and St. Andrews whatever the weather,"" said Scott Hart, who owns tour operator Golf Scotland. ""They know to expect a tough time on the links courses, but they're prepared for it. And they must be enjoying it, because they keep coming back. We've never had an unsatisfied customer."" My round started with a double-bogey six, which my caddy tactfully told me was still one better than Garcia managed in 1999. But that was where the rain started and the comparison ended. Zig-zagging the fairways and finding almost every pot bunker on the course, I got the full ""Carnasty"" experience. My poor caddy was put through quite an ordeal, but as it turns out it could have been worse. ""I once had a guy turn up on a corporate day who'd never hit a ball in his life,"" Soutar said. ""He was wearing Caterpillar work boots and he really hacked it up the first. I think he scored 160-odd in the end, and that was without me calling any of the penalties on him. ""Caddies actually enjoy that kind of thing. We have a warped sense of humor and we like to see who can caddy the worst score. The all-time record is something like 180 I think."" My Carnoustie experience culminated in a sunset walk down the last, the scene of Jean van de Velde's infamous implosion at the 1999 British Open, where the likes of Hogan, Tom Watson, Gary Player and Padraig Harrington lifted the iconic Claret Jug. Suddenly a torrid day on the golf course made perfect sense. When a weekend hacker gets the chance to walk in the footsteps of golfing legend it really doesn't matter what your card looks like (for the record this 20 handicapper hit 108). If it does, you're in for a miserable time. ""Some golfers beat themselves up when they should be relaxing and enjoying it,"" Soutar said. ""But at least they don't take it out on the caddies.""","Carnoustie's Championship Course was named the most difficult in the world by Time magazine .

"(CNN) -- A report from Amnesty International says the wave of popular unrest sweeping North Africa and the Middle East makes this a critical time for the human rights movement -- one that could result in historic gains by freedom-loving, tech-savvy people or distressing setbacks if oppressive regimes clamp down on activists and stay in power. The report, which coincides with the advocacy group's 50th anniversary, documents what it claims are cases of torture, unwarranted imprisonment, restrictions on freedom of expression and other alleged abuses around the world. France, for example, is among those countries called out for its restrictions on predominantly Muslim women wearing veils. Amnesty also challenges China over its alleged repression of free expression, notes the dire conditions for pregnant women in Afghanistan and points to difficulties wrought by violence in parts of Africa. Yet the so-called ""Arab Spring"" is front-and-center in the report, with its authors singling out the popular movements against generally long-entrenched administrations as a time of great promise and danger. Throngs of mostly young people helped to peacefully oust heads of state in Egypt and Tunisia, while governments in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and Libya have thus far resisted similar attempts -- killing civilians in the process, according to Amnesty. ""Not since the end of the Cold War have so many oppressive governments faced such a challenge to their stranglehold of power,"" Salil Shetty, Amnesty's leader, said in a press release. ""The demand for political and economic rights spreading across the Middle East and North Africa is dramatic proof that all rights are equally important and a universal demand."" But William Aceves, a California Western School of Law professor, said one factor distinguishing what happened in Egypt and Tunisia -- where mass popular movements helped unseat Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia's Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, who had led their countries for 30 and 23 years respectively -- from the institution of new governments in places like Afghanistan is that there is less outside control of what happens next. That could mean such nation's new governments -- perhaps after democratic elections -- could choose to restrict women's, immigrants or others' rights. If so, these popular revolutions could put those groups promoting human rights in a tough spot. ""The question is what happens if you have a democratization process that doesn't lead to greater civil liberties,"" said Aceves, who has worked with Amnesty International and other human rights groups through the course of his career. ""(Popular revolutions) don't always lead to good things."" Worse yet is what might happen if those pushing for change in places like Yemen, Syria, Bahrain and Iran fail after being beat back by ruling governments, human rights advocates say. Some leaders such as Libya's Moammar Gadhafi may become more defiant in the face of outside and internal opposition, while others may be emboldened if they survive popular dissent, experts say. The part of Amnesty's report about the Middle East and North Africa highlighted what it called ""governments' preoccupation with their political security, but neglect of their people's human security and failure to uphold the human rights on which it depends."" Already, these popular pushes for new governments have come at a stiff human cost. ""Those calls for democracy have led to violence,"" said Aceves, noting the real danger to human lives when people push for major reforms. ""There have been deaths in the thousands."" Another challenge for groups like Amnesty is determining how to promote a pro-rights agenda in places with authoritarian leaders and little in the way of democratic institutions or history. In its report, Amnesty touts technology, specifically social networking tools like Twitter and Facebook, with being a powerful, non-violent tool that didn't exist years ago. This allows people to circumvent censorship and communicate directly with one another, on an even platform. ""Information is a source of power, and for those challenging the abuse of power by states and other institutions, it is an exciting time,"" Shetty writes in the Amnesty report. But Aceves said that, at some point, rights' groups may have to wrestle with the merit of backing military efforts to overthrow totalitarian regimes. That might mean supporting airstrikes in Libya, for instance, that could lead to civilian casualties. The Amnesty report makes a point to stress that its accounts of human rights abuses -- and the need for a movement to prevent them -- are not confined to the Middle East and North Africa. In 2010 alone, the group said it has documented specific cases of ""torture and other ill-treatment"" in 98 countries."" Its investigators, moreover, have recorded or investigated human rights abuses in 157 countries and territories. Amnesty alleges, for instance, that ""virtually any form of dissent was suppressed in Turkmenistan,"" while law enforcement were said to have attacked ""human rights defenders"" in Ukraine. The group alleges discrimination against immigrants in parts of mainland Europe, criticizing efforts to deport people in need. Crackdowns on journalists working to unearth corruption was a problem in many nations, according to Amnesty. Nearly 400 journalists were threatened or attacked last year in Latin America alone, the report contends. ""There has not been any accountability,"" said Javier Zuniga, a special adviser on human rights at Amnesty, on what has happened in parts of Central South America. ""That's why the situation is so bad so now, because that culture of impunity has been very, very unchanged."" Despite all the documented problems and challenges, Shetty -- Amnesty's secretary-general -- voices optimism that popular movements will ultimately prevail, with human rights becoming an even more universally recognized and realized value. ""The call for justice, freedom and dignity has evolved into a global demand that grows stronger every day,"" he said. ""The genie is out of the bottle, and the forces of repression cannot put it back."" CNN's Greg Botelho and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.","Amnesty International alleges human rights abuses in 157 countries and territories .

"(CNN) -- Ireland's Kevin O'Brien scored the fastest century in cricket World Cup history to help his country claim a sensational three-wicket Group B victory over England in Bangalore. O'Brien reached the magical three figures in just 50 balls, smashing the previous best mark of 66 deliveries set by Australia's Matthew Hayden against South Africa in 2007. The 26-year-old O'Brien hit six sixes and 13 fours on his way to 113, helping Ireland reach 329 for seven with five balls to spare, in reply to England's total of 327 for eight from their 50 overs. As well as O'Brien's remarkable innings, Ireland's victory marked the highest second innings run chase in World Cup history -- beating Sri Lanka's 313 against Zimbabwe in New Zealand in 1992 . Speaking after collecting his man-of-the-match award, O'Brien -- who also played in Ireland's famous 2007 World Cup win over Pakistan -- said: ""I don't think it's quite sunk in. ""It's probably the best innings I've ever played. I just hit the ball pretty well and got a bit of luck and things went my way. I just kept going and kept attacking."" England came into the match as hot favorites following their thrilling tie against India on Sunday and they looked to be firmly in control when Ireland were reduced to 111 for five. But O'Brien and Alex Cusack went on to score 162 in a superb six-wicket stand before Cusack was eventually run out for 47. However, O'Brien remained at the crease and when he was eventually dismissed with the score on 317, also by run out, Ireland needed just 12 runs from two more overs to secure a famous success. England captain Andrew Strauss told reporters: ""We thought we'd done a reasonable job with the bat and we got Ireland at five down and things were looking pretty comfortable. ""But we weren't reckoning on an outstanding innings from Kevin O'Brien. It was pretty brutal."" Earlier, England's Jonathan Trott equalled the record for the fastest 1,000 runs in one-day internationals. Trott's score of 92 meant he joined team-mate Kevin Pietersen and West Indies legend Viv Richards in taking just 21 innings to achieve that feat.","Ireland's Kevin O'Brien scores the fastest ton in cricket World Cup history .

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida judge dismissed a batch of potential jurors in the Casey Anthony murder trial Tuesday because several members had discussed the case in the jury room. The ruling from Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. came in the second day of jury selection in the trial of Anthony, 25, who is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. Perry asked the individuals whether another potential juror talked or asked about the case, and whether it went beyond just a reference to the case. At least a dozen raised their hand when asked if someone had spoken to them about Casey Anthony. ""Through no fault of your own I think it's best I let you go and return back to the central jury room,"" said Perry, who asked for more jury candidates Wednesday. The judge and lawyers are questioning potential jurors in groups of 50. They need 12 jurors and eight alternates. Perry tied the jury panel problem to a person, listed as a witness in the case, who had also been summoned for jury duty. That individual spoke with others in the jury room, the judge said. Concerns over Anthony receiving a fair trial led to the jury selection proceedings being moved to the Clearwater, Florida, courthouse, about 100 miles southwest of Orlando. Caylee's grandmother first reported her missing in Orlando in 2008, weeks after the girl was last seen, and five months before her body was found. Authorities moved the proceedings to Clearwater hoping to draw from a jury pool that was less likely to have seen and been influenced by the intense media coverage surrounding the case. Once jury selection is complete, the jurors will be transported to Orlando's Orange County for the trial, which is now scheduled to start May 17. Perry and lawyers have been asking jurors about possible hardships in hearing the capital case. ""Our system of justice depends on people like you willing to serve,"" the judge said Monday. ""You are being asked to perform one of the highest duties of citizenship."" Many excused jurors cited financial hardship -- saying they or their family would suffer if they couldn't work for two months. Others said they had to take care of loved ones. On a lighter note, a woman claimed hardship Tuesday due to her concern about a teen son who lives at home and worries about another son, 29, possibly throwing parties while she is on duty. Jurors also will be asked, one by one, for their take on the death penalty, which Casey Anthony would be eligible for if convicted on the murder charge. Lastly, the jurors will be quizzed on their knowledge of the case and other positions -- including if they have an opinion, prior to the trial, on Anthony's guilt or innocence. Throughout the selection process, Perry can weigh arguments from members of Anthony's legal team and state prosecutors and decide to exclude certain men and women from the jury pool. Casey Anthony also faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement. In Session's Jean Casarez and Michael Christian contributed to this report.","NEW: The judge says a witness in the case also was summoned for jury duty .

"(CNN) -- Three Pakistan cricketers who were banned from the sport for five years announced on Monday they will appeal their suspensions in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Mohammad Amir, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif have launched their challenges after the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), found them guilty of ""spot-fixing."" Amir, 18, and Asif, 28, were found to have deliberately bowled no-balls during a Test match with England in August 2010 -- a match Pakistan lost -- while Butt was said to have been aware of the arrangement. Butt, 26, received a 10-year ban of which half was suspended, right-arm bowler Asif was hit with a seven-year exclusion with 24 months suspended and fast-bowler Amir was banned for five years. ""CAS has registered the appeals filed by Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Salman Butt against the ICC Anti-Corruption Tribunal's decision of 5 February 2011,"" a CAS statement read. ""The CAS will not comment any further on these matters until a panel of arbitrators has been constituted and a procedural calendar established."" The trio were also told last month they will face criminal charges in Britain, along with their agent Mazhar Majeed, for conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments, and conspiracy to cheat.

"Ireland kept alive their Six Nations championship hopes with a narrow 21-18 win over Scotland at Murrayfield Sunday. It leaves them with two wins against one defeat but they owed victory to veteran fly-half Ronan O'Gara, who scored 11 points with a try and three conversions. Recalled to the starting XV to claim his 106th cap, the 33-year-old Munster star inspired the Irish, who also scored first half tries through Jamie Heaslip and Eoin Reddan. Scotland kept in the game thanks to the boot of Chris Paterson, who kicked five penalties and a Dan Parks drop goal, but they have now suffered three defeats and are battling Italy for the wooden spoon. On Saturday, England beat France 17-8 to stay on course for the grand slam with three straight wins and six points, while Wales edged Italy 24-16 in Rome. The win seed Ireland join France and Wales on four points, while Scotland are now staring down the barrel of a likely wooden spoon showdown with Italy having lost three in a row. First half tries from Heaslip and Reddan, both converted by O'Gara, always kept their noses in front, despite Paterson's usual metronomic kicking. When O'Gara  went over under the posts for his try, which he converted, the visitors led 21-9, but two more penalties from Paterson after the drop goal from Parks set up a nervy finish as Andy Robinson's men scented a late comeback. But the Irish withstood a late onslaught and O'Gara was delighted. ""It was very tight, but that has been our tournament so far with just one score difference in all three matches,"" he told AFP. Ireland next face Wales in Cardiff in two weeks time before entertaining England in Dublin in a match which could decide the championship and the grand slam.","Ireland beat Scotland 21-18 in the Six Nations rugby union at Murrayfield .

"(CNN)  -- From the Nintendo 3DS's ability to grab titles on demand to the increasing popularity of retail sites like Steam and Direct2Drive.com, downloadable games will be everywhere in 2011. The days when you had to visit your local store, buy a title and insert a disc into your console to play a game are long gone. Thanks to new episodic titles (""Back to the Future,"" ""Jurassic Park""), popular indie PC games (""Minecraft,"" ""Recettear"") and a growing range of smartphone apps and console-exclusive downloads, digital game distribution continues to grow. Whether you're playing on your PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360 or mobile handset, here are five new and upcoming titles that exemplify the expanding breadth of what online game downloads have to offer. ""X-Men Arcade"" (PlayStation Network/Xbox Live Arcade) Revisit your misspent adolescence with a conversion of the popular side-scrolling 1992 arcade brawler starring Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and other comic book favorites -- before they became movie icons. High-definition multiplayer cartoon action for up to six players takes top billing, as you use fists, laser beams and super powers to bludgeon Magneto's crew of villains, including Juggernaut, Pyro and The Blob. ""Gemini Rue"" (Wadjet Eye Games) A sci-fi point-and-click adventure set in a dystopian future that's drawn comparison to genre classics like ""Beneath a Steel Sky,"" this retro-futuristic, film noir-flavored tale harkens back to PC gaming's early '90s heyday. It's available February 24, and anyone who owned an Amiga or IBM-compatible should appreciate its nostalgic pixel graphics and ""Blade Runner""-style vibe. ""Full House Poker"" (Xbox Live Arcade)   Arriving on the heels of interactive game show ""1 vs. 100"" comes Microsoft's next multiplayer social gaming experiment, which makes online poker tournaments possible for up to 30 players. Texas Hold 'Em showdowns, staffed by avatars, can be played for virtual chips, with hidden surprises -- including new tables, decks and outfits to unlock -- and the ability to compete against professional players. ""MotoHeroz"" (WiiWare, RedLynx) Following upon the success of popular speedster ""Trials HD,"" developer RedLynx hopes to bridge the gap between side-scrolling platform hoppers and arcade racing with this candy-colored interactive rally for up to four players. Offbeat physics set the stage as you compete on more than 100 levels, with daily competitions, online leader boards and, oddly enough, single-player story options. These should provide a ready excuse to put pedal to the metal. ""Bionic Commando Rearmed 2"" (PlayStation Network/Xbox Live Arcade) This game picks up where the last downloadable mix of combat and grappling arm-powered action (and 1988 NES game) left off, adding a jump button, items to equip (love the grenade launcher!) and enhanced graphics. With puzzles to solve and bosses to battle, it should provide old-school fun for anyone who's ever dreamed of playing a disgruntled cyborg.","Digital game distribution continues to grow, thanks to new titles and smartphone apps .

"(CNN) -- Sony Computer Entertainment is making a big play in internet-connected hand-held gaming with a 3G-enabled PlayStation portable system and smartphone game platform unveiled Thursday. In addition to cell and Wi-Fi chips for accessing online services, the new PlayStation gadget looks like its predecessor but has a 5-inch touch-screen and a second analog stick, which is useful for controlling first-person shooters like ""Call of Duty."" Speaking of which, ""Call of Duty,"" alongside other gun-play franchises like ""Killzone"" and ""Resistance,"" will have versions for the new system. Other games include ""Uncharted,"" ""LittleBigPlanet"" and ""Wipeout."" Games come on memory cards, and some can be downloaded directly to the device. Sony is doing away with the mini discs it pushed with the original PlayStation Portable. The new system is tentatively being called Next Generation Portable, or NGP, but that will likely change before it launches late this year. Weirdly, NGP also has a touch-sensitive pad on the back of the device, which game developers can consider when thinking up all kids of wacky applications. Motorola, another mobile hardware maker, tried something similar with the Backflip smartphone, but the concept didn't take off. The PlayStation system's finger-friendly back is really the frosting on an array of sweetly stacked ingredients in this high-tech gadget. The system has a blazing fast, quad-core processor to help move those graphic-intensive games. It has cameras on the front and rear and a microphone. There are also sensors inside for detecting location and motion, like those found in top-of-the-line smartphones. With a holiday launch window still quite a long way off, Sony was mum on details such as a firm release date, price and, as you've probably noticed, a definitive name for the thing. The announcement, made during a news conference in Tokyo, Japan, Thursday, didn't come as a surprise to gadget enthusiasts. Several images of different hardware concepts leaked to blogs. Peter Dille, a Sony executive, told CNN in October that the current PSP system is limited by not having cell connectivity. During the news conference, where Sony announced the system, the company also provided some tidbits on a smartphone-focused game platform. Called PlayStation Suite, the software will work on Android devices approved by Sony, which will probably include phones and tablets from Sony Ericsson. Details were scarce, but the platform would presumably provide phones with access to high-quality games and perhaps movie downloads. PlayStation phones and the upcoming PlayStation hand-held, with its built-in 3G service, will have a major focus on social networking features, Sony said.","Sony unveils a new PlayStation portable system to launch late this year .

"(CNN) -- Pandora is making some noise about its future plans. Pandora Media aims to eventually expand its internet radio service to other countries and move into areas beyond music, such as news, talk and sports. The long-term goals, along with illuminating details about the company's financials and adoption rates, were outlined in a proposal for an initial public offering filed on Friday. The service, currently focused exclusively on music, is all about catering to each listener's unique tastes. After signing up for an account, users can type in the names of favorite bands, and Pandora will create a customized radio station that spins similar songs. But there are limitations, such as the number of tracks by a single musician that can be played during a set period. While Pandora suggested that music will remain its core focus, the new filing shows that the company is looking to other areas for growth. ""Many radio listeners are drawn to sports, talk, news and other forms of content beyond music,"" the company wrote. ""We think there is an opportunity over the long term to offer these types of content in addition to music."" Pandora founder Tim Westergren named these as possible areas the service could cover in the future, he said in a little-seen video posted in August 2009. Offering news, talk and sports content is ""something that we've talked quite a bit about as a company and something we intend to deliver to listeners eventually,"" Westergren said. Not surprisingly, the service would personalize programming for each person. In this case, the ZIP code tied to your account or information from your phone's GPS could trigger the service to provide local news or updates about a hometown sports team. ""I think one of the very interesting things about doing that in an internet radio is we actually will know something about where you are,"" he said. ""So we'll be able to deliver sports, weather, news that's actually relevant to your particular area."" Opening the service up to regions outside the United States is another long-term goal, the company said. Spotify, another streaming music service that has a radio personalization component, has quickly dominated in the areas of Europe that it operates in. The company is planning a U.S. expansion, which it projects will launch in ""coming months."" While Spotify already has a tight-knit relationship with Europe's music executives and has spent the last couple of years entrenched in negotiations with U.S. publishers and labels, Pandora's ties to the industry aren't as tight. Pandora licenses the more than 800,000 tracks it has rights to play from a government agency, not directly from publishers. In Pandora's IPO proposal, the company also included statistics about its rise. More than 80 million people have registered to use the service. On average, a user has created 17.5 stations, logged feedback in the form of 100 thumbs up or down song ratings, and listens to more than 10 hours per month. Pandora generates much of its revenue from advertising but has yet to turn a profit.","Pandora plans to eventually launch in other counties and offer sports, talk and news .

"(CNN) -- There's a new URL in town, and it has the potential to help hundreds of thousands of unemployed Americans still trying to regain their footing in a slow economy. The site, at www.universe.jobs and recently expanded by the DirectEmployers Association, is a clearinghouse of job listings that aims to create both a unified platform and one-stop shopping for both employers and employees. What makes the initiative different from more commonly known sites such as monster.com and careerbuilder.com? Employers pay big money on these sites in order to reach a broader audience. The .jobs universe is free to both small and big business. The aim, according to Tom Embrescia of Employ Media, which is the licensed operator of the .jobs doman, is to create ""a trusted, valued source where job seekers and the people who have the jobs -- the employers -- can connect seamlessly under one intuitive URL."" Here's how it works: . Companies build their own websites on the .jobs domain, and the sites are updated daily. Potential employees can then search those listings, but they do so under specific links depending on both region and the type of work they seek. For instance, a professional looking for new employment in the city of Boston would search under www.boston.jobs. Atlanta? www.atlanta.jobs. And so on. Cities with a population of 5,000 or above are searchable. Only interested in listings in the technology field? Type www.technology.jobs in your browser. There were about 40,000 .jobs domains that were functioning at the end of January, all through universe.jobs. According to Bill Warren, executive director of DirectEmployers -- a nonprofit human resources consortium -- 580 Fortune 1000 companies have already responded and are actively posting jobs on the site. In turn, the passive or active job seeker will know that these listings come from a ""highly trusted source...where they can go and feel that they are not getting jobs that are duplicates or scams, older or expired jobs,"" Warren said. Listings are updated at a minimum of once a day, and 41 states are currently represented on the site. Eventually, programmers aim to expand throughout the globe. Major corporations are responding. Some, such as not-for-profit Providence Health Services, see this as a way for companies to look outside the realm of candidates they normally recruit, giving them a much broader audience, said Rhonda Stickley, a spokeswoman for the company providing health care services in Alaska, Washington state, Montana, Oregon and California. And Brandy Ellis, a recruiter at Colorado-based Level 3 Communications, a provider of IP transit networks, said gone are the days when companies simply posted their listings and then looked around for ways to fill them. Now, ""we're starting to build a talent pool of people that, even if you aren't right for that immediate job today...you might be in the future. We are trying to change the way we approach the job seeker,"" Ellis said.","Universe.jobs aims to create a unified online jobs platform .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has hailed Manchester United as ""extraordinary"" after Alex Ferguson's side all but secured the English Premier League title with a 2-1 victory over nearest challengers Chelsea on Sunday. Guardiola, whose Barca side will face United in the Champions League final at Wembley on May 28, told reporters: ""They have a great team, extraordinary players."" Guardiola, who was at Old Trafford to see United beat German side Schalke 4-1 in the second leg of their Champions League semifinal last week, added: ""They played a Champions League semifinal with a team full of reserves and they won 4-1 -- that says everything you need to know about the quality they have."" Following Sunday's victory over Chelsea, United now need just one point from their remaining two games against Blackburn and Blackpool to claim the Premier League title and overtake Liverpool's overall record of 18 league wins, a figure they currently share with their north-west rivals. Meanwhile, Guardiola, said his attention is primarily focused on his side claiming the Spanish La Liga title at Levante on Wednesday, ahead of their meeting with United later this month. And Barca midfielder Xavi Hernandez added: ""We're almost there and we want to win it as soon as possible so we can have our heads focused on Wembley."" Captain Carles Puyol, who has been out of action for several weeks with a knee injury, is expected to be fit enough to face United at Wembley. ""He was out for three months and the doctors decided he wasn't in shape to play, but he is building up his fitness and will feature more in the next few games,"" Guardiola added. Barcelona inched towards claiming a third consecutive title after beating city rivals Espanyol 2-0 at the Nou Camp on Sunday, with goals from Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique.","Pep Guardiola calls Manchester United ""extraordinary"" after their 2-1 win over Chelsea .

"New York (CNN) -- A new emergency alert system that sends notifications to cell phones in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack will be implemented in New York and Washington by the end of this year, officials said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday unveiled PLAN, the Personal Localized Alerting Network, which is expected to provide residents with timely information ""alerting them to imminent safety threats in their area."" Mobile phone users will receive ""geographically targeted, text-like messages,"" according to a written statement from the Federal Communications Commission. ""Every weekday our population of 8.4 million residents swells to more than 12 million as commuters and tourists come to town,"" Bloomberg told reporters. ""Under the PLAN program, we'll be able to broadcast (emergency) messages to any of them who are within our target area."" Mobile customers will receive three types of alerts containing 90 characters or less, ranging from presidential alerts to child abduction bulletins. Phone carriers may allow subscribers to block all but presidential alerts, officials said. A special chip is needed to allow phones to receive the notifications, though many ""smart"" phones already have the new technology, said FCC spokesman Neil Grace. ""We're a mobile society,"" said Craig Fugate, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator. ""How many of us are sitting there listening to a radio or television when these (traditional) alerts come out?"" ""This system will send it to your phone."" It will also be able to send messages when cell phone towers experience network congestion, overriding other calls in an effort to deliver the notification. High mobile phone traffic and downed cell phone towers are considered primary reasons for service disruption in New York in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""There are many lessons to be learned from 9/11,"" said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski. ""One of them is that we were under-utilizing communications technologies in emergencies."" PLAN is expected to be expanded to the rest of the country by April 2012 and was made possible by a 2006 congressional bill called the Warning Alert and Response Network Act. ""It would have been great if we had something like this available as recently as last month for the tornadoes in the south,"" Genachowski added. A record number of tornadoes swarmed through much of the Midwest and the South in April, killing hundreds of people and devastating many regions. Meanwhile, flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys -- largely the byproduct of torrential rains -- has left many local residents in search of higher ground.","A special chip is needed to allow a phone to receive the notifications .

"Washington (CNN) -- Another air traffic controller apparently fell asleep while on duty, a problem that is prompting the government to put an extra staffer on midnight shifts at more than two dozen control towers across the country. The latest incident occurred Wednesday morning at Reno-Tahoe International Airport in Nevada ""when a controller fell asleep while a medical flight carrying an ill patient was trying to land,"" the Federal Aviation Administration said. The flight originated in Mammoth Lakes, California, according to the FAA Pacific Division. ""The medical flight pilot was in communication with the Northern California Terminal Radar Approach Control and landed safely. The controller, who was out of communication for approximately 16 minutes, has been suspended while the FAA investigates,"" the FAA said in a statement. FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt expressed outrage, saying ""we absolutely cannot and will not tolerate sleeping on the job. This type of unprofessional behavior does not meet our high safety standards."" ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. It would be the sixth incident this year involving a sleeping controller that the FAA has disclosed. One occurred at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, another at McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee, and three incidents involving the same person occurred at Boeing Field/King County International Airport in Seattle. The FAA said it also suspended two controllers in Lubbock, Texas, for an incident in the early hours of March 29 in which they failed to hand off control of a departing flight to the Fort Worth Air Traffic Control Center, and responded only after several attempts by the same center to hand them control of an arriving flight. The FAA statement did not indicate whether the Lubbock controllers were thought to have been asleep. Babbitt and LaHood said the FAA will assign an extra air traffic controller on the midnight shift at 27 control towers staffed with only one controller during that time. The FAA said Babbitt and National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Paul Rinaldi ""are launching a nationwide 'Call to Action' on air traffic control safety and professionalism"" and will visit air traffic facilities to underscore the need for safety and professionalism. The move will include ""an independent review of the FAA's air traffic control training curriculum and qualifications and the expansion of NATCA's Professional Standards committees."" The FAA is also reviewing staffing and scheduling. Nevada's senior senator, Harry Reid, said it was ""a miracle that everyone is OK. We're glad that they are."" ""Last night's near-tragedy reminds us that state-of-the-art structures and the best technology work only as well as the people operating them,"" Reid said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""If those people fall asleep on the job, they risk the lives of the millions of Americans who fly into and out of our airports every day."" Krys Bart, president of Reno-Tahoe International Airport, said the pilot of the Sierra Life Flight plane -- a Piper Cheyenne twin turboprop -- tried to make contact with the Reno tower at about 2 a.m., but got no response and began to circle the airport. After repeated failed attempts to reach someone in the tower, the pilot evaluated the situation and decided to land. In his remarks on Capitol Hill, Reid said the pilot ""tried to call the tower not once or twice, but seven times. The controller slept through every one of those calls."" A federal government source on Wednesday confirmed to CNN the figure of seven attempted calls to the tower. Bart said it is her understanding that there was only one controller on duty at the time. She added that she is pleased with the FAA's response, and issued a statement to clarify that air traffic control staffing is entirely in the federal agency's domain: . ""We have a brand-new, state-of-the-art air traffic control tower, three runways and two instrument landing systems in place to help guide pilots on landing, take-off and ground control,"" Bart's statement said. ""But what the airport has no control over is the staffing levels and personnel in the control tower. ... this is an FAA issue, the Airport Authority does not control what happens in the air traffic control tower."" However, Republican Rep. John L. Mica, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the move to increase tower staffing ""misdirects our resources and focus away from congested air traffic control facilities."" ""Only in the federal government would you double up on workers, averaging $161,000 per year in salary and benefits, that aren't doing their job,"" the Florida congressman said. Mica and other committee leaders plan to meet with FAA officials behind closed doors to discuss what his office described as ""a spate of near misses, runway incursions and incidents of sleeping on the job.""

"(CNN) -- Tuesday's fourth stage of the Giro d'Italia was turned into a tribute to tragic Belgian Wouter Weylandt, who died in a horror crash during Monday's third stage. The 26-year-old Weylandt, who suffered a fatal accident on the descent of the Bocco climb, was honored by the peloton who refused to race the entire 216km stage from Genoa to Livorno -- effectively neutralizing the stage. Before the stage, the peloton held a minute's silence for Weylandt, and along the route the streets were packed with people paying their respects to the rider, who had won the corresponding stage of last year's Giro. Team Leopard rider Weylandt dies in Giro d'Italia crash . Leopard-Trek's remaining eight-man squad came over the finish line together, accompanied by Garmin rider Tyler Farrar, a training partner and close friend of Weylandt. And Farrar issued a statement saying: ""I am unbearably saddened by the loss of Wouter. As many know, he was my friend, training partner, and in many ways, another brother to me. ""His death marks an irreparable change in my life but more importantly, in the lives of his family and most loved. ""I can only convey my deepest of sympathies to everyone who cared about him as deeply as I did, especially his family, his friends, his team and his fans -- we celebrate his life and mourn his death in equal measure."" Farrar, who lived near to Weylandt in the Belgian city of Ghent, had already decided to leave the race following his friend's death and, late on Tuesday evening, the remaining Leopard-Trek riders also issued a statement saying they too were withdrawing from the race. ""The decision really needed to be taken by the riders, because they are the ones that participate in the race,"" said Leopard team manager Brian Nygaard. ""We have always said that we would stand behind their choice. We wish to thank the other teams, the race organization, the Italian authorities and all the fans on the road between Genova and Livorno on today's stage, as the peloton paid tribute to Wouter."" Team captain Fabian Wegmann explained the teams' decision. ""We have a lot of respect for the Giro d'Italia and for cycling, but we simply cannot continue racing given the circumstances. We are professional athletes, but we feel this is the right thing to do."" After many riders had expressed their sadness in an outpouring of emotion on Twitter, the peloton agreed to award all prize money from Tuesday's stage to Weylandt's family. Weylandt's partner Anne-Sophie -- who will give birth to the couple's first child in September -- also laid flowers at the scene of the tragedy, before traveling with Weylandt's parents to the hospital morgue in Lavagna, where his body is being held. Meanwhile, pathologist Armando Mannucci told the Ansa news agency that Weylandt had ""died instantly and did not suffer"" after carrying out a two-and-a-half hour autopsy on the his body. Dr. Mannucci concluded that Weylandt suffered fatal skull and facial injuries as well as damage to his pelvis and a broken leg after the accident -- which is believed to have occurred when the rider's left pedal briefly touched a wall at the side of the road, propelling him 20 meters to the ground below where he landed heavily on his face. Racing will resume in Wednesday's fifth stage, a 191km ride from Piombino to Orvieto, with Briton David Millar holding the race leader's pink jersey.","Tuesday's fourth stage of the Giro d'Italia is turned into a tribute to Wouter Weylandt .

"(CNN) -- New Wave rockers The Cars are on the road again, the first time in nearly 25 years. Their mission? To bring their brand of quirky, syncopated pop music to a new generation. The new album ""Move Like This"" hits shelves, or your favorite download site, Tuesday -- the same day the band begins an 11-city, coast-to-coast tour. So, how does the new model of The Cars sound? ""I think it sounds like The Cars in 2011,"" keyboardist Greg Hawkes said of the band that formed in Boston in 1976. ""It sounds like a modern album, yet it sounds like The Cars."" It's hard to argue with Hawkes. The first two songs -- ""Blue Tip"" and ""Sad Song"" -- off the new album sound instantly familiar. The Cars always have been a bouncy combination of understated guitars, layered synthesizers, punchy rhythm section and songwriter Ric Ocasek's often-cryptic lyrics dancing among them. The genesis of the project began nearly a year and a half ago. ""I think about January of last year, I got a call from Ric saying, 'What do you think about doing a Cars album?' I was surprised to say the least,"" Hawkes said. As lead singer and primary songwriter, Ocasek was key to any Cars reunion. ""I think he sort of had a lot of songs that he had written and was sort of getting a backlog of material,"" Hawkes said. ""I think he was just thinking that a lot of them just might work in the context of a new Cars album."" Ocasek stayed busy in the interim years, recording six solo projects and producing albums by a variety of artists, including Weezer, Guided by Voices and Bad Religion. The Cars were a radio staple in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with hits like ""Just What I Needed,"" ""Drive,"" and ""You Might Think."" The band's eye-catching videos also were a hit in MTV's formative years. The combination fueled more than 23 million in U.S. album sales, according to figures tallied by the Recording Industry Association of America. The recording sessions were the first for the band since bass player and vocalist Ben Orr died from cancer in 2000, making The Cars a four-piece band. In addition to Hawkes and Ocasek, the other original members are Elliot Easton on guitar and drummer David Robinson. ""We missed him a lot,"" Hawkes said. ""We were talking about him a lot during the time that we were recording. His presence was definitely missed."" In Orr's absence, Hawkes took over bass duties in the studio. The Cars enlisted producer Garret ""Jacknife"" Lee for the project, who like Ocasek had worked with Weezer, to get the band motoring again. ""To have an outside producer helped,"" according to Hawkes. ""It was a good way to get us working with each other."" The result is 10 new Cars songs, half produced by Lee and the rest by the band. The trick with The Cars, Hawkes said, is for each member to add their own musical personality to the Ocasek-penned songs. ""I usually go in with a few sort of things that I want to do or try,"" he said. ""The other inspiration sort of comes from spur of the moment kind of messing with sounds and seeing what fits with the track as it gets created."" But will any of their old fans be waiting after a quarter-century hiatus? ""I guess there is that danger,"" acknowledged Hawkes, who said he's up for the challenge of trying ""to win over some new ones."" The Cars also are attempting their comeback in a music industry that has largely imploded since the band's last album in 1987. The companies that market music are mere skeletons of their former selves as the digital age has changed the dynamics. ""The Internet has made it so that a lot of bands are kind of making it on their own through their use of the Internet, without a traditional record company,"" Hawkes said. The new album is being released through Hear Music, a joint venture between Concord Music Group and Starbucks. The java chain is also marketing music by Paul Simon, Bonnie Raitt and K.D. Lang. ""It's kind of hard for me to know exactly where The Cars are going fit into that whole strange new world,"" Hawkes added with a chuckle. ""Hopefully there are a lot of people who will be curious to hear what The Cars are up to these days.""

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- The brother of Florida child murder suspect Casey Anthony acknowledged Thursday that he tried to coax information out of his sister during jailhouse visits, but denied police put him up to it. During a videotaped jailhouse conversation shortly after his sister's arrest, Lee Anthony promised to keep secret any letter she sent him while she was being held in connection with the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. ""(Did) you tell your sister that if she gives you a letter through this letter system, that you won't share it with anyone if she doesn't want you to?"" defense attorney Jose Baez asked Lee Anthony during the pretrial hearing Thursday. ""And say that to her from brother to sister?"" Lee Anthony told Baez he had. ""Were you lying?"" Baez asked. ""Maybe,"" Anthony said, as his sister looked away with a shrug. But Anthony said he was only trying to help find Caylee, whose body was found five months after her reported disappearance, and that police never forced him to do anything. Casey Anthony is charged with capital murder in the girl's death. Defense lawyers are asking a judge to throw out all statements she made to police, arguing that police failed to read her her rights when she was first arrested and that investigators tried to coax statements out of her through her relatives. Her brother, father and mother have all testified during the latest two days of pretrial hearings, with her father alternately tearing up and sparring with prosecutors during Thursday's session. ""I don't know why you're going in this direction, because right now, I wish you could change places with me,"" George Anthony, Casey's father, told prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick at one point. When Burdick objected to being challenged by the witness, he shot back, ""I will challenge you."" When Circuit Judge Belvin Perry told George Anthony to stick to answering questions, George Anthony replied, ""This is a very emotional time, sir."" Asked if he needed a recess, he said, ""I'm fine. I just want to get this over with."" Wednesday, Orange County Deputy Sheriff Ryan Eberlin said he handcuffed Anthony after he arrived at her parents' home following three 911 calls from the defendant's mother, Cindy Anthony. Cindy Anthony has said she called police to accuse her daughter of theft after learning her granddaughter had been missing for a month, hoping to get her daughter thrown in jail in hopes of finding out what happened. Prosecutors argue that all questioning was voluntary and that Anthony was free to leave if she wanted.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Politicians and foreign diplomats said they were doggedly working Friday to salvage a newly-minted Iraqi government power-sharing deal, a long-awaited agreement that threatened to unravel just hours after it was announced with great fanfare. Mahmoud Othman, an Iraqi Kurdish lawmaker, told CNN mediation efforts by Kurdish officials, Americans and the Arab League began Thursday after a dramatic walkout by Sunni Arab lawmakers and will continue ahead of Saturday's scheduled parliament session. Saying that the walkout stemmed from political misunderstandings and deep distrust among politicians, Othman said he hopes the power-sharing agreement will not fall through, but if the situation is ""not amended"" and ""they don't come back I am afraid it will."" Othman believes that Saturday's session will be a key indicator of the deal, hammered out to meet the demands of Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Kurds. The compromise announced Thursday was designed to end an eight months' long stalemate that drew fears of a resurgence in sectarian and insurgent violence in Iraq. The Sunni walkout, staged by lawmakers in the Iraqiya bloc, was prompted by what it said was the failure of parliament to actually cast a vote on the power-sharing agreement. It threatened to undermine political amity and lead to the formation of a government without adequate Sunni representation. The squabbling, regarded as a political hiccup by some politicians, was considered possible disaster by others. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials praised the power-sharing agreement. ""There are still challenges to overcome, but all indications are that the government will be representative, inclusive and reflect the will of the Iraqi people who cast their ballots in the last election,"" Obama said at a Friday news conference at the G-20 summit in Seoul, South Korea. But Ayad Allawi, the former Iraqi prime minister who heads the Sunni-backed and cross-sectarian Iraqiya, told CNN that he scorned what he viewed as a political double-cross. ""This is a new dictatorship that is happening in Iraq,"" said Allawi, a secular Shiite who walked out with his Sunni allies. Under the proposed deal, the three major governmental positions were to have been filled by three members of the country's largest ethnic groups -- the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunni Arabs. Politicians forged a compromise that left Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite, and Jalal Talabani, the Kurdish president, in power for another term. The deal created a powerful new office that was expected to be headed by Allawi, his rival. That office would be called the National Council for Strategic Policies and it would be a check on al-Maliki's power. Iraqiya also issued demands, including that legislators pass a law within 30 days forming the national council and form a committee to review the files of people illegally detained, a great concern for Sunni Arabs who have accused Iraq's Shiite-dominated government of persecuting them. It also called for a final agreement on outstanding legislation and for canceling a ban on several Sunni Arab politicians from running in elections. Those politicians have been accused of ties to Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baathist movement. After lawmakers elected Talabani for a second term, the president gave al-Maliki 30 to 45 days to form a government. Parliament also elected Osama al-Nujaifi, a Sunni Arab from the Iraqiya bloc, to be the parliament speaker. But Sunnis walked out when parliament didn't accept its demand for a vote on the actual power-sharing agreement and decided to go ahead and make the key vote for a president. Shiite lawmakers said the vote for power-sharing couldn't be taken because it was not on the agenda, but Allawi disputed this. ""The proceedings were going in the right way. Then suddenly they said we are going to elect the president,"" Allawi said. ""We said, 'Wait a minute here we agreed that there are points that we agreed that are going to be announced and voted on.' "" ""I was very surprised, I was extremely surprised. This agreement was done after talking to Obama, the Arab League."" Allawi said. ""It's a joke in a way. What this reflects really, it reflects the intentions of these guys. They don't have the intention to really work on a power sharing formula."" ""We don't want to be puppets for a government that does not respect the will of the people, that does not respect power sharing. After all the compromises I am not going to be a puppet running around being a false witness to history."" But Othman said what happened in parliament Thursday was a result of a ""misunderstanding"" between the country's leaders. He said al-Iraqiya was under the impression that a U.S. -brokered agreement between al-Maliki, the Kurdish region's president, Massoud Barazani and Allawi would be formalized in a parliamentary vote, while the other blocs thought it was a political deal that would not go to parliament. Othman said the scenario on Thursday reflected a state of ""widespread mistrust"" among the political groups and a result of hasty negotiations and a deal that was put together very quickly. He said while Iraqiya had the right to demand a parliamentary vote, he said their timing was off kilter. He said Iraqiya got its choice for speaker elected and it should have waited for the Talabani to be voted on before pushing for their demands. Allawi said on Friday he expects the boycott to continue and that he doesn't see himself accepting a role in the new government. ""I personally have made up my mind. I will not be a part of this theater,"" he said. ""I am thinking of forming a council for opposition from inside parliament to start building the issues that we think are right for this country and to use all possible peaceful means to achieve the objectives.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles police have linked three people arrested Wednesday to nine shotgun robberies and two murders, including Sunday's fatal shooting of an MTV producer, a police spokeswoman said Thursday. Investigators connected a string of robberies and killings because of similar descriptions for the robber and the use of shotguns, which a police official called ""a rare weapon to use in a street crime."" The crimes happened in just blocks from Olympic Boulevard, in and around the Wilshire section of Los Angeles over the past two weeks, police said. The suspects are Jabaar Vincent Thomas, 26, Destiny Young, 29, and Richard Edward Anderson, 33, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mitzie Grasso said Thursday. The three were taken into custody Wednesday after police spotted a car fitting the description of the getaway vehicle in a liquor store robbery involving a shotgun Tuesday night, Blake said. The robber was unsuccessful because of thick bullet-proof glass protecting the clerk, he said. MTV music coordinator Gabe Ben-Meir was killed by a shotgun blast to his head early Sunday, police said. A neighbor found his body on a sidewalk near his apartment hours later. Initially, detectives did not know whether robbery was involved in Ben-Meir's killing, but a pattern of shotgun crimes in the same section of the city since April 29 pointed toward a possible connection. Another man was killed by a shotgun blast on April 30 after he refused to give a robber his money, Los Angeles Police Capt. Matt Blake said. A third person who resisted a robber barely escaped harm when a shotgun blast missed him in another early morning hold-up, Blake said. All the street robberies were ""in the wee hours"" of the morning, Blake said. Three hold-ups were at small businesses, including two doughnut shops and a liquor store, he said. A security camera took a photograph of a shotgun robber at a doughnut shop last week. The photo was handed out to reporters at a police news conference Wednesday. Ben-Meir, 30, worked as music coordinator and production coordinator on several MTV shows, including ""Punk'd"" and ""Nitro Circus,"" an MTV spokesman said. ""We are shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Gabe Ben-Meir, who was a valued member of the MTV family and a beloved and dedicated colleague and friend,"" MTV Senior Vice President Nathaniel Brown said. ""Our hearts go out to his family.""","Three suspects were arrested Wednesday in the killing of an MTV producer .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United has been named as the world's most valuable football club for the seventh year in a row by Forbes, while its former star David Beckham is once again the highest-paid player. The U.S. business magazine's Forbes 2011 Soccer Valuation survey ranked the English club at $1.86 billion ahead of Spain's Real Madrid ($1.45 billion). Fellow Premier League club Arsenal came in third at $1.19 billion, with Germany's Bayern Munich at $1.1 billion and Spain's Barcelona down one place to fifth on $975 million. Forbes, which will release the full list in its May 9 issue, said the average value of the top 20 clubs increased by 1.3% to $640 million, while average operating income rose 25% to $40 million. It based its ratings on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Manchester United owners report huge financial losses . United's parent company posted record pre-tax losses of $178 million last month, due to the huge debts the Glazer family incurred in buying the club for almost £800 million ($1.33 billion) in 2005, but it has consistently posted healthy operating profits. Forbes cited United's ""powerful global brand with 333 million supporters worldwide, including 193 million in Asia, and 9.5 million Facebook fans."" It said United's value had risen 12.5% in local currency, with commercial revenue of $122 million growing at a double-digit annual rate following new deals with Turkish Airlines, Betfair and several telecommunications companies. Real Madrid's income of $537 million last year was the second-highest of any sports team in the world, behind the New York Yankees baseball franchise, and $109 million more than United's. President Florentino Perez has sanctioned huge spending sprees on players since taking over for a second time, including a world-record $130 million on Cristiano Ronaldo. Arsenal, which is in the middle of a takeover bid by American Stan Kroenke, has a more conservative financial model. Forbes said it had boosted its worldwide appeal by agreeing a deal with the largest regional sports channel in U.S., YES Network. Barcelona is on course for a third successive Spanish title, but its increasing debt problems have diminished its value. Forbes also pointed to doubts over Barca's lucrative broadcasting deal with ""financially distressed"" MidiaPro. Italy's AC Milan was rated sixth on $838 million, but suffered from a drop in average attendances of 15,000 per home game last season which meant that match-day revenue reduced by 6%. English club Chelsea was ranked seventh on $658 million as Forbes considered the €726 million ($1 billion) loan from owner Roman Abramovich that the club converted to equity two years ago is still repayable to the Russian. Former England captain Beckham's career is in its final stages as he plays out his five-year contract with Los Angeles Galaxy, but he still earned $40 million last season according to Forbes. It said the 35-year-old former United and Real midfielder added Pepsi and Electronic Arts to his list of endorsements, which is headed by his deal with Adidas -- which Forbes described as the biggest in world soccer. Real Madrid's Ronaldo,  the most popular athlete on Facebook with more than 24 million followers, was second on $38 million thanks to his contracts with sponsors such as Nike, Armani, Coca-Cola and Castrol. Barcelona's two-time world player of the year Lionel Messi was third on $32 million. The Argentina star has deals with Adidas, Lay's, Konami, Audemars Piguet, Chery and AirEuropa worth half of his total income. They were followed by Brazilian duo Kaka ($25 million) and Ronaldinho ($24 million). Thierry Henry, like Beckham now based in the United States, was sixth on $21 million. Forbes said the Frenchman Henry bought a $14.9 million New York City apartment after joining Major League Soccer's Red Bulls team last year. However, his earnings will be down this year as his lucrative Gillette deal has now ended. United's Wayne Rooney was seventh on $20 million, but while he still endorses Nike and Electronic Arts the England striker's $1 million-a-year deal with Coca-Cola has ended. Samuel Eto'o is the only African on the list, with the Inter Milan striker ranked 10th by Forbes with earnings of $15 million behind Chelsea's Frank Lampard and AC Milan's Zlatan Ibrahimovic (both $17 million). A four-time African player of the year, the Cameroon international has deals with Puma and Ford.","Manchester United tops Forbes' football rich list for seventh year in a row .

"(CNN) -- Rebel forces defending the Libyan city of Misrata from government troops are making ""meter-by-meter"" gains despite heavy shelling and rocket attacks, a Western journalist inside the city said Tuesday. Units that remain loyal to longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi have been firing rockets and artillery shells into residential neighborhoods, leaving a nearby emergency room full of women, children and old men, Marie Colvin, the Middle East correspondent for Britain's Sunday Times, told CNN. ""The rebels are very much trying at a minimum to push back Gadhafi's lines so he simply can't do that,"" Colvin said. Meanwhile, the rebels are asking why NATO forces aren't targeting the pro-Gadhafi gunners. NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi's forces since March as Gadhafi's troops try to quash a nearly 3-month-old revolt against his regime. In Misrata, two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city's port have prevented most aid ships from docking there, leaving the city ""at the forefront"" of U.N. humanitarian concerns, a top U.N. official told the Security Council on Monday. A ship carrying aid from the International Committee of the Red Cross docked in Misrata on Tuesday, but the ongoing fighting has deterred many captains from trying to enter the port, Colvin said. The ICRC said the vessel carried medical supplies, spare parts to repair water and electrical supply systems and 8,000 jars of baby food. Meanwhile, on the front lines of the battle, bullets are whizzing past ""like very angry hornets,"" Colvin said. At least 70 rebels have been wounded -- but they have held their line, ""and meter by meter were able to advance,"" she said. ""They're defending their homes. They're defending their families, and they are not giving up an inch. They are fighting,"" Colvin said. The first shipment of nonlethal aid from the United States to the Libyan opposition arrived Tuesday in Benghazi, U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. It included more than 10,000 MREs -- meals ready to eat -- that are halal, permissible under Islamic law. Other items en route from the U.S. Defense Department include medical supplies, tents, uniforms, boots and personal protective gear. U.S. officials are coordinating with the opposition Transitional National Council ""to determine what additional assistance requirements we might be able to support in the coming weeks,"" Toner said. Almost 750,000 people have fled the country amid the fighting, and another 58,000 are displaced within Libya, Valerie Amos, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council on Monday. Another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings between Libya, Tunisia and Niger, Amos said. Others have tried to flee by sea, but one such attempt appears to have ended in disaster for hundreds of refugees as their ship capsized off the capital, Tripoli. Somalia's ambassador to Libya, Abdelghani Mohamed Oweys, said the vessel that overturned Friday was carrying more than 600 asylum seekers from various Arab and African nationalities, including 240 Somalis. The total number of casualties is unknown, but Oweys said at least 54 Somalis were dead or feared dead Tuesday. Laura Boldrini, spokeswoman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Italy, said 16 bodies had been pulled out of the water from the Tripoli harbor. ""From what refugees are telling us, the Libyan authorities are facilitating the departures of non-Libyan citizens from Libyan coasts,"" Boldrini said. ""Refugees are not considered at all as humans. Trips are organized on unlikely vessels, and they leave Libya without considering the weather forecast."" Since the end of March, two vessels departing from Libya have disappeared -- one carrying 320 people and the other 160, Boldrini said. In addition, ""We know of a shipwreck on April 4, where 250 people died,"" Boldrini said. Fighting between government and rebel troops also raged on in al-Brega, a key oil town in eastern Libya. Three rebels have died in clashes with Gadhafi forces since Monday, according to rebel spokesman Mostafa Bozen and a rebel fighter on the front lines, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. Al-Brega is held by pro-Gadhafi forces, and the rebels have made multiple unsuccessful attempts to enter the town, the sources said. CNN's Nima Elbagir, Jomana Karadsheh, Antonia Mortensen, Sara Sidner and Amir Ahmed and journalist Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","NEW: Gadhafi's gunners pound Misrata neighborhoods, journalist says .

"(CNN) -- A new Consumer Reports survey reveals that air travelers want comfort without emptying their wallets -- and many airlines don't deliver. US Airways landed at the bottom of the list for overall satisfaction, also receiving the lowest marks for cabin-crew service. The airline was also ranked lowest in 2007, when the last Consumer Reports airline rankings were released. A US Airways spokesman questioned the methodology of the Consumer Reports survey and pointed out a 70 percent improvement in baggage delivery since 2007. The airline scored a 61 out of 100 in overall satisfaction on the Consumer Reports scale. Scores above 60 mean those surveyed were ""fairly well satisfied,"" according to the ratings guide. Southwest Airlines topped the rankings for overall satisfaction, with JetBlue Airways coming in second in the survey of nearly 15,000 passengers. JetBlue and Southwest also scored highest in seat comfort. The remaining eight of the 10 airlines scored low marks for comfort. Baggage handling, check-in ease, cleanliness and in-flight entertainment were some of the other factors rated. The passengers shared their experiences from a collective 29,720 domestic flights from January 2010 to January 2011. Southwest and JetBlue battled to top each other. While JetBlue was the only airline to outscore Southwest in seat comfort, Southwest was rated the ultimate for check-in ease and cabin-crew service. JetBlue topped the in-flight entertainment ratings, with 36 channels available on each seatback screen. These survey results were compiled before cracks were discovered in some of Southwest Airlines' planes. The pileup of added fees during or after check-in is contributing to many travelers' decisions to fly less, according to the survey. Of the respondents who said they've cut back on flying, 40 percent cited fees as the major reason. While most Southwest Airlines travelers -- 93 percent --  managed to avoid extra fees, passengers flying with Continental Airlines, JetBlue, Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways, Alaska Airlines and Frontier Airlines had to pay fees. AirTran's multiple fees were rated the worst.","A new Consumer Reports survey shows air travelers want cheap, comfortable flights .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored his second hat-trick in successive matches to help Real Madrid thrash city neighbors Getafe 4-0 on Tuesday and keep alive their slim hopes of winning the Spanish Primera Liga title. The Portuguese winger scored four goals in Saturday's 6-2 thumping of Sevilla, and his latest treble puts him on 36 league goals for the season -- five ahead of nearest Golden Boot challenger Lionel Messi and within sight of the record goals tally of 38 in a season jointly held by Hugo Sanchez (Real Madrid) and Telmo Zarra (Athletic Bilbao). Ronaldo's treble sees Madrid move to within five points of Barcelona, but Pep Guardiola's side need just one point from their final three league games to win the title for a third successive season -- and will be crowned Spanish champions if they draw at Levante on Wednesday. Real took the lead on 23 minutes when Mesut Ozil's superb cross from the right was powerfully headed home by Ronaldo. And German international Ozil set another up for Ronaldo on 57 minutes when he cut the ball back for his teammate to stroke into an empty net. Substitute Karim Benzema added a third with 20 minutes remaining and Ronaldo completed his hat-trick with a late penalty. In other matches on Tuesday, Deportivo La Coruna edged closer to avoiding relegation with a 2-1 victory over Athletic Bilbao -- a result that lifts Depor out of the bottom three. Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid suffered a surprise 2-1 defeat at Racing Santander, while Malaga made it five consecutive league wins for the first time in their history with a 2-0 home victory over relegation rivals Sporting Gijon. Brazilian Julio Baptista scored for the fifth successive game to help Malaga move six points clear of the relegation zone and to the brink of safety. Meanwhile, in Italy, newly-crowned Serie A champions Milan have failed in their bid to win the league and cup double after losing 2-1 at Palermo in the second leg of their Coppa Italia semifinal. The tie was finely poised after the first leg at the San Siro ended in a 2-2 draw, but this result means the Sicilian side will now face either holders Inter Milan or Roma in the final on May 29 as they go in search of their first-ever silverware. The home side went ahead in the 63rd minute with a Giulio Migliaccio diving header from a corner and they doubled their advantage 10 minutes later when Cesare Bovo scored from the penalty spot after Mark van Bommel was sent off for bringing down Josip Ilicic in the area. Bovo himself was then sent off for a high challenege on Alexandre Pato and Milan scored a late consolation goal when Zlatan Ibrahimovic converted Antonio Cassano's deflected pass.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores a hat-trick as Real Madrid thrash Getafe 4-0 .

"(CNN) -- A proposed high-speed rail line in Florida may not be dead after all. Florida Gov. Rick Scott rejected $2.4 billion in federal funding last week for a high-speed rail line between Tampa and Orlando, but the project has not run off the tracks yet. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood met with Scott Friday morning to discuss the plan in an attempt to keep it alive. Touting jobs the project would create and the potential economic growth for the state of Florida, LaHood said in a written statement that Scott ""asked me for additional information about the state's role in this project, the responsibilities of the Florida Department of Transportation, as well as how the state would be protected from liability."" The Republican governor had cited potential cost overruns, long-term operating costs and questions about the projected use of the line as a reason for canceling the high-speed rail project. The statement said that LaHood wanted to give Scott additional time to examine the details of an agreement crafted by officials from Tampa, Orlando, Lakeland and Miami and to consult with the staff at Florida's Department of Transportation before making a final decision. LaHood said he expected a decision by the end of next week. High-speed rail is a focal point of the Obama administration's plan to invest in the nation's infrastructure as a way to create jobs and grow the nation's economy. But in recent months, newly elected Republican governors in Wisconsin and Ohio rejected proposed high-speed rail projects in their states. In New Jersey, Republican Gov. Chris Christie canceled a long-planned rail tunnel project that would have expanded commuter rail service between his state and New York. Scott seemed to be following their lead. States scramble for rejected rail cash . Many local politicians urged Scott not to turn down the federal transportation funds. Even Florida Congressman John Mica, the Republican chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee who has expressed skepticism over the Obama administration's high-speed rail plans, was critical of Scott's decision. In his written statement, LaHood said, ""I feel we owe it to the people of Florida, who have been working to bring high speed rail to their state for the last 20 years, to go the extra mile.""","Florida governor last week rejected $2.4 billion in federal funding for the project .

"Washington (CNN) -- Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has voiced support for the killing of al Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces, saying it was legally justified. In remarks Thursday evening at his alma mater, Northwestern University, the 91-year-old former justice said the order by President Barack Obama for the covert mission by U.S. Navy SEALs was ""to remove an enemy who had been trying every day to attack the United States,"" according to two people who attended a symposium and dinner that was closed to the media. Stevens said he was pleased the president took the risky decision to launch the May 2 commando assault on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. The justice added, ""I must say I was very proud of the SEALs."" No sitting member of the Supreme Court has commented on the bin Laden killing and is not likely to, since current or related executive branch issues may someday come before them. There have been legal questions surrounding whether U.S. and international law would permit a unilateral executive decision to kill a terrorist leader with no ties to any government. Attorney General Eric Holder said the day after the mission, ""It's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field."" As founder and head of al Qaeda, bin Laden was viewed by the administration as a combatant actively involved in past and current hostilities against the United States and other countries. The insistence by Obama officials that the killing was justified come despite bin Laden not being armed when commandos stormed his third-floor room. Those officials insist the Saudi native ""resisted"" and made no clear indication he would surrender. Stevens said based on his knowledge of the facts, ""I haven't the slightest doubt it was entirely appropriate for American forces to act"" as they did. ""It was not merely to do justice and avenge September 11."" The Wall Street Journal Law Blog first reported Stevens' remarks. He stepped down from the high court last year after nearly 35 years on the bench, and was replaced by Justice Elena Kagan. Unusually for a retired justice, he has been outspoken on current hot-button cases his former colleagues are considering and on other news events. He voiced support in November for a planned Islamic community center near the site of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York, urging religious and ethnic tolerance. He announced this week he has almost completed writing a memoir of sorts, a look at the five chief justices he has known and worked with over the past 64 years. Called the ""Five Chiefs,"" and to be published by Little Brown this October, the book will also give an inside look at the court and Stevens' personal insights on colleagues past and present, including current Chief Justice John Roberts. Before retiring, Stevens had been a consistent supporter of limited rights for terror suspects in U.S. custody overseas to challenge their detention in federal courts. In the first terrorism case to arise in the high court from the 9/11 attacks, Stevens said foreign-born terror suspects captured abroad and held at a Navy-run prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, did have some basic rights. ""What is presently at stake is only whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to determine the legality of the executive's potentially indefinite detention of individuals who claim to be wholly innocent of wrongdoing,"" he wrote in 2004. Stevens is a World War II veteran. He served as an intelligence officer in Hawaii, where his work included supervising the cracking of secret Japanese codes. He was speaking in public Friday to graduates at his old law school in Chicago, where he graduated in 1947 at the top of his class.","""I must say I was very proud of the SEALs,"" retired Justice Stevens says .

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- After another marathon session of questioning about everything from their news-watching habits to criminal records, the Florida jury that could decide Casey Anthony's fate started rounding into shape Friday. By day's end, eight men and women had made it through various stages of the process at the Pinellas County courthouse and were still considered viable candidates to be on the jury in the trial of the Florida mother accused of killing her toddler. A total of 12 -- plus eight alternates -- will eventually be seated on the jury, which will be moved to and sequestered in Orange County, where the alleged crime happened and where the trial will take place. Friday marked the fifth day of jury selection in the case. Anthony, 25, is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. She faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement. Jury selection was moved from Orlando to Clearwater amid concerns that the intense media attention surrounding the case could make it difficult to select an impartial jury in Orange County. While the process this week has gone somewhat slower than expected -- as evidenced by the fact court proceedings will likely go through 5 p.m. Saturday -- Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. said Friday that it is imperative to seat a jury as quickly as possible. ""The cry was pretrial publicity. In a free society, I cannot stop the press from reporting, broadcasting, and reporting,"" said Perry, the presiding judge in the case, explaining the need to pick a jury in Clearwater soon, before more potential jurors are swayed by the media coverage. ""The longer we wait, the more dangers there are."" Once there are 12 jurors, Perry will ask the defense and prosecution teams if they want to use their preemptory challenges -- allowing them, at the judge's discretion, to disqualify certain men or women from the jury pool. If they opt not to use the challenges, jurors can be sworn in. The goal is to have everything finalized for opening arguments Tuesday in Orlando. That would be followed by testimony by investigators, experts and others involved in the case -- including Casey Anthony's father, mother and brother, who have testified in pretrial hearings. But this week, it's been potential jurors who have been grilled on the stand. As they did Thursday, defense attorneys asked them whether they'd be willing to take into account ""verbal, emotional or sexual abuse,"" should they convict Anthony and be asked to decide whether to give her the death penalty. Besides the ""history of sexual abuse,"" the defense also hinted again Friday that Anthony's ""dysfunctional family"" might be proposed as a ""mitigating circumstance"" if she is convicted of murder, as might be ""a lack of impulse control or brain development."" The comments touched again on the Anthony family's rocky relationship with one another. Casey Anthony made allegations of sex abuse against her father and brother in a letter from jail last year. In an interview with NBC News afterward, her father, George Anthony, denied the claims and criticized Jose Baez, another of his daughter's attorneys, for questioning him about the allegations. Friday's questioning also delved into the prospective jurors' knowledge of the Anthony case, including what and from where they had heard about it. Caylee was last seen in June 2008. Police began to look for her a month later after Cindy Anthony -- Casey's mother -- made three 911 calls expressing her worry about her granddaughter's disappearance. The girl's skeletal remains were found in December of that year, in woods about one-quarter mile from the Anthony home. Prosecutors have said they plan to show Casey Anthony lied repeatedly about her daughter's fate, contending she used ""a substance"" to kill her daughter. Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The defense has strongly combated the prosecution's attempts to enter into evidence and hear from an expert claiming that she stashed Caylee's body in the trunk of her car and dumped it.","By day's end, 16 potential jurors have been selected as viable candidates .
A total of 12, plus 8 alternates, must be picked before Casey Anthony's trial .

"London (CNN) -- An increasingly bitter dispute between the United Kingdom and Iceland over billions of dollars lost when banks collapsed is likely to end up in court, a top British government minister said Sunday. The British government has ""an obligation to get that money back, and we will continue to pursue that until we do,"" said Danny Alexander, the chief secretary of the Treasury. He was speaking Sunday after Iceland's people voted to repeal a law aimed at solving the dispute. Six out of 10 voters in the referendum on Saturday opposed the law, the government said in a statement Sunday, saying turnout was high. Alexander called Saturday's Icelandic vote ""disappointing,"" adding, ""We have a very difficult financial position as a country ... This money would help."" ""There is a legal process going on and we will carry on through these processes,"" he said on the BBC's ""Andrew Marr"" show. The battle results from the collapse of an Icelandic internet bank in October 2008. Britain and the Netherlands came up with more than $5 billion to bail out savers in their own countries who lost money in the failure of Icesave -- an online retail bank branch of Landsbanki. They are now trying to claim the money back from Iceland. Some payments will go ahead later this year, Iceland's government said Sunday, explaining that they were not affected by the vote. ""These partial payments are expected to cover close to a third of priority (depositor) claims. Moreover, latest figures on its assets indicate that the estate (of Landsbanki) will be able to pay over 90% of claims for deposits,"" the government said in a statement. Under a European Union directive, Iceland owes compensation to Britain and the Netherlands. The Icelandic government has said it will honor its international obligations. Netherlands Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager is ""very disappointed about the decision of the Icelandic electorate not to agree with the agreement reached between Iceland, the U.K. and the Netherlands,"" the Netherlands Finance Ministry said in a statement Sunday. ""The time for negotiations is over,"" de Jager said in the statement. ""Iceland remains obliged to repay. The issue is now for the courts to decide."" The Netherlands Finance Ministry said it is consulting with the United Kingdom about further steps. The International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $2.1 billion in November 2009, and said repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments was a requirement of the loan. Iceland has begun moves toward applying for European Union membership, which Britain and the Netherlands could block. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: The Netherlands says it is consulting with the United Kingdom on further steps .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Palestinian Authority's president has called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League over the escalation of conflict between the Israeli military and Gaza-based militants, the Palestinian Authority-run news agency WAFA said on Saturday. President Mahmoud Abbas asked the Cairo-based organization to convene on Sunday, PLO Executive Committee member Saeb Erakat said, according to WAFA. In the latest fighting on Saturday, Israeli air force struck and killed three Hamas personnel in southern Gaza, according to both the Israeli military and Palestinian medics. The Israel Defense Forces said the people were a senior Hamas military wing leader and his two bodyguards. In another incident, a Palestinian man died of wounds in an early evening airstrike in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City. About 42 rockets and mortars had been fired into Israel on Saturday, including 10 longer-range Grad rockets, but no injuries have been reported, said Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. The IDF said in a statement about 50 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel since Saturday morning. It said aircraft and armored forces targeted 11 squads of ""terrorists"" in the northern and southern Gaza Strip and 15 ""terror activity sites,"" including ""terror infrastructure sites, Hamas outposts, smuggling tunnels and weapons manufacturing and storage facilities."" The developments are the latest in a three-day tide of intensified violence that began on Thursday, when Hamas militants attacked an Israeli school bus that critically wounded a 16-year-old boy and prompted Israeli retaliatory strikes against fighters in Gaza. The three-day death toll in Gaza rose to at least 18, 10 militants and eight civilians. Since Thursday, Palestinian militants have fired dozens of mortars and rockets into southern Israel. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack on a civilian bus ""crossed the line"" and that ""whoever tries to hurt and murder children will have no immunity."" The mounting death toll in Gaza represents the highest number of Palestinian casualties since the 2008-09 Israeli military offensive, when more than a thousand Palestinians were killed. The offensive was prompted by daily missile bombardments from Gaza into southern Israeli communities, which Israel intended to end. Now, there is increasing speculation in both Israeli and Palestinian media that another large-scale Israeli military operation could be launched soon. In a Friday letter to the U.N. Security Council, Riyad Mansour -- permanent observer of Palestine to the United Nations -- charged Israel with using ""indiscriminate and excessive force"" and asked for the world body to intervene to ""prevent the slaughter of more innocent civilians."" A Hamas official vowed Saturday to widen the scope of the group's attacks on Israel if Netanyahu did not agree to halt airstrikes on Gaza. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri blamed Israel for the surge in violence and said Hamas would do what was needed to protect Palestinians in Gaza. Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Hamas military wing, the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam Brigades, told reporters in Gaza City on Saturday that his group would continue to wage a fight until Palestinians cast off the Israeli occupation and wrested away their lands. He said it was impossible to speak about any sort of calm between Hamas and Israel while there was aggression being committed against the Palestinian people. Israeli officials have cited various precautions to avert casualties. They include early warning systems, road closures near the Gaza border and the use of bomb shelters, Rosenfeld said. The Israeli military said Saturday that its newly deployed anti-rocket defense system known as the Iron Dome successfully intercepted Grad rockets that had been fired from Gaza Friday and Saturday. Over the past 48 hours, ""terrorist organizations"" in Gaza have fired more than 120 Grad missiles, rockets and mortars at Israel, the IDF said. In a statement released Saturday, the Israeli military said it ""continued striking terror sites in the Gaza Strip"" in coordination with Israel's domestic security agency, the Shin Bet.

"(CNN) -- The score was tied. The game was in overtime. The mood, electric. Number 35 came charging up to the net and hit a last-moment winning layup for his undefeated Fennville High School Blackhawks to end the regular season Thursday night with a perfect 20 wins. The other players hoisted their star, 16-year-old Wes Leonard, on their shoulders. The screaming crowd charged the court to hug him. It was the biggest moment in memory for the tiny Michigan town of Fennville. And then it all turned to black. Silence fell under the harsh glare of the florescent lights. Leonard lay still on the court, pale in his school colors. His family and coaches surrounded him. He wasn't breathing, his friend Arista Sauceda recalled. His heart had stopped cold. After attempts to revive the varsity player in the gym, an ambulance transported him to nearby Holland Hospital. Doctors worked on him for an hour and 20 minutes. They could not save him. By 10:40 at night, when Leonard should have been out celebrating with his classmates, he was dead. An autopsy Friday determined that Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, said a statement from Dr. David A. Start, the Ottawa County chief medical examiner. As news of Leonard's death spread, a small community on the banks of Lake Michigan convulsed in shock. A moment of enormous school pride was reduced to irrelevance, a moment of joy turned into the opposite. A Facebook memorial page -- R.I.P. Wes Leonard -- created Friday, quickly filled with thoughts and prayers. ""Blackhawk Down,"" the page said. Sauceda described Leonard as an affable guy, popular for his smile and jokes. He excelled in athletics, scoring 1,000 career basketball points and playing quarterback for the school's football team. She said Leonard's family moved to Fennville when he was in middle school. His mother, Jocelyn Leonard, teaches music and is the drama director at Fennville, and Sauceda said the family had helped bring the school community together. Jocelyn Leonard had canceled Thursday night's performance of ""How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying"" because she wanted to watch her son play in the game, reported CNN affiliate WOOD. It was a make-up game to compensate for blizzard-canceled events last month. Everyone had so looked forward to Thursday's game -- not only was it the last of an undefeated regular season, but it pitted Fennville against Bridgman, a school that beat them by just one point last year. It was revenge, as Sauceda put it. Fennville was down 14 points but came back to tie the game at 53. Leonard scored his team's last four points for the 57-55 victory. Sauceda had screamed her lungs out during the game. She was running toward Leonard to hug him when he went down. Tim Breed, a spokesman for Holland Hospital and a 1977 Fennville graduate, was also in the gym. He doesn't normally attend games, but thought he could not miss his alma mater's perfect season closer. When Leonard collapsed, the crowds were asked to leave the gym. Breed was on his way home when he was paged by a local newspaper reporter. He rushed to the hospital to find medical teams trying to resuscitate Leonard. Shortly after that, a text message appeared on Sauceda's phone from a friend at the hospital. Sauceda was about to go to sleep. Instead, she was jolted awake, the shock so severe she wasn't even able to immediately cry. In the morning, she stayed home from school. And wrote on Facebook: . ""Wes, you were taken from our lives too soon ... you were the most amazing friend, I will never forget you, and how you have changed us all, I am so thankful to have been apart of your life. Please watch over us, and cheer us on as our boys win state! RIP # 35 WES LEONARD.""","Wes Leonard was a star athlete and a popular student .

"(CNN) -- Three of the largest Sikh advocacy groups in the United States are opposing airport passenger screening measures they say require hand-searches of turbans, despite the use of electronic imaging technology. The Sikh Coalition, United Sikhs and the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund are lobbying members of Congress in an effort to pressure federal transportation authorities to re-examine a policy they say unfairly scrutinizes members of the Sikh community. ""Sikh Americans are already looked at differently in this country,"" said the Sikh Coalition's director of programs, Amardeep Singh. ""Once you start pulling Sikhs aside for extra screening, it sends a message that the government is suspicious of them for the same reasons [other passengers] are suspicious of them."" The U.S. Transportation Security Administration adjusted security procedures in 2007 to include provisions for ""bulky"" clothing that includes headwear, according to an agency statement. Removal of all headwear is recommended, it said, but the rules are meant to accommodate passengers who may not want to remove the items for religious, medical, or other reasons. Transportation officials would not confirm whether ""advanced imaging technology"" can sufficiently see through turbans, citing security reasons. Despite the advent of the advanced technology, transportation security officers are permitted to use ""professional discretion"" in determining if a particular item of clothing should be subject to further screening, according to the statement. Authorities say the policy has remained unchanged since 2007, but Sikh advocacy groups argue that airport security procedures were recently ramped up to include extra screening for all turban-wearing passengers. Singh said U.S. Sikh groups that had once observed ""a patchwork of [airport security] policies"" are now witnessing a process in which ""all turbans are searched."" CNN was not able to independently verify that claim.","Sikh groups oppose airport screening rules they say now require searches of turbans .

"Sendai, Japan (CNN) -- Long lines at grocery stores and gas stations along with continued aftershocks and power outages greeted many in Japan on Sunday morning, nearly two days after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that left hundreds dead and missing. Supplies of food and gas were running out in Sendai, the northern coastal city close to the epicenter of Friday's quake. Those who survived the earthquake and chose to remain in the city were enduring two-hour waits at the supermarket, according to a CNN iReporter in Sendai with the username joeyjenkins. ""They have waited for I don't even know how long to get gas, as the gas station manually pumps the gas since there is no electricity,"" joeyjenkins wrote, adding they were without power until early Sunday. Schools and hospitals and Sendai have been turned into shelters, and volunteers were handing out bottles of water, CNN correspondent Kyung Lah reported from the city. Fears of power outages in Tokyo, about 200 miles south, sparked a run on flashlights, said iReporter Jessica Tekawa, 26. ""I think last night, there must have been something on the news about a power outage,"" she told CNN, ""because when we went, with my friend, we were trying to get flashlights and they were sold out everywhere."" Water, too, was sold out in every store she went to after similar reports of possible water contamination, she said. Kenneth Cukier, the Japan correspondent for The Economist magazine, said the government announced managed power cuts will start Monday in certain regions of the country -- including suburban areas of Tokyo -- to give businesses enough power to operate. A seemingly endless barrage of aftershocks from Friday's 8.9-magnitude quake was still rattling nerves Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey reported more than 140 such quakes -- magnitude 4.5 and higher, with the strongest coming at a 6.4 -- in, near, or off the east coast of the Japanese island. There have been ""many aftershocks,"" said Yasue Schumaker, a Sendai native who now lives in Hawaii, but was visiting her mother in a Sendai hospital when the quake struck. ""The day it happened, it was constantly aftershock, and last night was better, but still we are having quite big ones,"" Schumaker said. The aftershocks are a ""constant reminder of what's happened, and what could happen in the future,"" Wall Street Journal reporter Yoree Koh told CNN from Tokyo. Such aftershocks are also producing tremendous anxiety for earthquake survivors, reported CNN's Gary Tuchman, driving from the western coastal city of Shonai to Sendai in the east. ""People are wondering, could there be an aftershock that's greater than the original earthquake?"" Tuchman said. ""Each time you feel it, there's an element of fear."" The Japanese military was working in at least one neighborhood of Sendai on Sunday morning to search for anyone trapped in the rubble. ""A few hundred"" people were still unaccounted for in one part of town Sunday, Lah reported. Search-and-rescue helicopters buzzed over Sendai as workers walked through the muddy streets wearing hard hats and carrying shovels. At least one person was winched by chopper from a damaged house. The city was still littered with debris and standing water from the tsunami. Two to three miles inland, houses were destroyed or simply gone, cars were stacked on top of each other, and brown mud covered the ground, Lah said. An iReporter with the username xeynon, who described himself as an American living and working in Sendai, said ""there are still many friends and acquaintances living along the coast we have not been able to contact."" Schumaker, her voice quivering, said those people should be the priority. ""People who lost their homes, or the people who are still needing help, they are the ones who need help,"" she said. ""We don't have any electric, water, gas, and the city just announced it could take 30 days to get gas set up for everybody. But we definitely need water and food, but please help the people who lost their homes and still ... on top of the buildings asking for help.""

"(CNN) -- The Canadian woman who was rescued last week after being stranded and alone for 49 days in a Nevada wilderness was upgraded to good from fair condition Tuesday, an Idaho hospital spokesman said. Rita Chretien, 56, is tolerating solid food very well, continuing her physical therapy and showing high spirits, according to a statement by St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center in Twin Falls, Idaho. Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for her husband, Albert, who left his wife in their van on March 22 so that he could find help. ""She is enjoying solid foods and had a dinner of salmon, rice and green beans last night,"" the spokesman's statement said Tuesday. ""This morning she had a breakfast burrito with homemade salsa. A 'bowl of soul' coffee was brought to her from a local coffee house. It included a sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg and a dollop of whipped cream, which Rita said was delicious."" Doctors said the indicators of her recovery are ""very good,"" the spokesman said. Scores of men and women had searched for the Chretiens since the Penticton, British Columbia, residents were last seen March 19 leaving a Shell gas station convenience store in Baker City, Oregon. On Friday, more than a month later, hunters wandered into the area where the van was sitting. Rita Chretien shot up from her spot in the 2000 Chevrolet Astro's back seat when she heard them outside, mustered strength to open the door and stepped out shoeless. She waved. While the odds are dwindling that Albert Chretien will be found alive, authorities haven't ruled it out. Rita Chretien lived off the little food she had -- beef jerky, some trail mix, fish oil pills and one piece of hard candy per day. She went outside for a walk once a day, using the sunlight to melt snow for drinking water and going to a nearby stream. She read a few books (some several times) and the Bible and recorded her thoughts in a journal. The Chretiens were en route to a trade show convention in Las Vegas when they turned off the highway onto a forest service road that led into Nevada, intending to enjoy the ""scenic route,"" her son said, who'd heard the full story from his weakened mother. The couple took some wrong turns and had thought, based on their map, that their road was better than it was. Pictures released by the sheriff's department show the van in an extremely remote area with no visible roads. The van was stuck in caked mud, with a shovel pictured near the back of the van, indicating that someone had been trying to free the vehicle from the mud. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this story.","Rita and Raymond Chretien got lost in the Nevada wilderness March 19 .

"(CNN) -- FIFA will meet with Interpol on Monday as soccer's governing body continues its bid to stamp out illegal gambling and match-fixing, it announced on Friday. FIFA president Joseph Blatter and the international crime-fighting organization's secretary general Ronald Noble will then face the press later that day. The announcement came after British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported that FIFA's investigation centered on a Singapore-born convicted match-fixer who was based near London's Wembley Stadium -- the home of England's national football team. ""The threat from match-fixing to the integrity of the global game is significant,"" FIFA's head of security Chris Eaton told the paper. ""England is the home of football and London is a global financial center so it does not surprise me that the financial aspects of this activity lead to London."" FIFA investigates officials amid match-fixing claims . More than 300 club and international matches are under scrutiny, including two friendlies involving Bolivia, Latvia, Estonia and Bulgaria in Turkey in February. ""Interviews with those involved have told us that that fixers can spend upwards of $300,000 to stage a friendly international and they do that with the expectation of a significant profit margin,"" said Eaton, who formerly worked for Interpol. ""Our information is that we are talking about tens of millions of dollars in profit from each successful fix."" The Telegraph said the main suspect at this stage was Raj Perumal, who was convicted of match-fixing in Singapore in 1995 and fled his home country last year. He has been held in Finland since February, the Telegraph said, and has been linked to the two matches in Antalya that month that saw all seven goals scored from the penalty spot. Blatter plans final term as Bin Hammam calls for change . Meanwhile, former FIFA executive committee member Amos Adamu has appealed against his three-year suspension for allegedly agreeing to accept bribes in the build-up to the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments. The Nigerian has turned to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in order order to overturn the FIFA Appeal Committee's decision to ban him from any activity related to football at national and international level. CAS said that Ahongalu Fusimalohi, former general secretary of the Tonga Football Association, had also appealed against his two-year ban by FIFA for similar offenses. FIFA suspend officials amid allegations of World Cup bid corruption . The ""bribes for votes"" scandal took another twist earlier this week when the president of the South American football confederation claimed he received an invitation to last month's British royal wedding the day before the December 2 ballot in Zurich. Nicolas Leoz said he received it when he had breakfast with Prince William, who is president of the English Football Association and was a key figure in the nation's ultimately unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 event. ""No-one from FIFA was offered an invitation to the wedding in return for their vote, I can categorically state that,"" a spokesman for the prince told the UK Press Association on Wednesday.","FIFA expected to make announcement on match-fixing probe after Interpol meeting .

"(CNN) -- Marisol Valles Garcia, the former police chief of Praxedis G. Guerrero, Mexico, who took office when she was just 20 years old, is in the United States, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN Monday. ""Marisol Valles Garcia is in the United States and she will have the opportunity to present the facts of her case before an impartial immigration judge. Absent a signed privacy waiver, there are no additional details,"" the official said. Authorities in the municipality of Praxedis last week denied published reports that she was in the United States and would seek asylum. Earlier Monday, Valles Garcia was fired because she failed to show up for work on the day that a personal leave she was given expired. At that time, town secretary Andres Morales told CNN he did not know anything about her whereabouts. There are reports that Valles Garcia left Mexico to seek asylum in the United States because of threats, but local authorities in Mexico have not confirmed that. Valles Garcia grabbed international attention last year when she took over the top job in a police force whose officers have been abducted and killed. City officials have said that Valles Garcia, a criminology student, was on personal leave because her 8-month-old baby is sick. They expected her back Monday. But because she didn't show up or ask for an extension, the mayor terminated Valles Garcia, according to a town news release. She had asked for a leave from March 2 to 7, the news release said. Valles Garcia was named police chief in October 2010. Over the weekend, several of her neighbors told CNN it is an open secret that she had fled to the United States. Many said they were afraid to give their names to a reporter, as violence related to drug cartels is rampant in the region. Last year, Valles Garcia was the only person who accepted the top police job. There was good reason for the fear. Around the time she took the post, a 59-year-old local mayor, Rito Grado Serrano, and his 37-year-old son, Rigoberto Grado Villa, were killed in a house in which they were hiding in nearby Ciudad Juarez. Another area mayor was killed in June. Nationwide, the Mexican government says there have been more than 34,600 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006.

"Washington (CNN) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich made it official Wednesday: He's running for president. The Georgia Republican announced via Twitter that he is formally seeking the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Gingrich is widely viewed as the most serious official Republican candidate so far. ""I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States because I believe we can return America to hope and opportunity,"" the former speaker said in a campaign video posted online. ""We Americans are going to have to talk together, to work together, find solutions together, and insist on imposing those solutions on those forces that don't want to change."" The candidate called for more jobs, a balanced budget and decentralized government. ""There are some people who don't mind if America becomes a wreck so long as they dominate the wreckage,"" Gingrich said. ""But you and I know better."" ""Let's get together, look reality in the face, tell the truth, make the tough choices and get the job done,"" he declared.  ""There's a much better American future ahead."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said earlier Wednesday that ""the discussion around the presidential race will obviously increase"" when Gingrich entered the race for the GOP nomination. ""I think Gingrich has always been an ideas man, and I'm sure that will provide a lot of positive input to the debate,"" Cantor said. Gingrich's online announcement followed a recent trend by national politicians to make major announcements through the Internet. Barack Obama first announced his selection of Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 on his campaign website and in a text message to supporters. Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton announced her presidential candidacy in 2007 with the release of a statement and video on her campaign website. Asked about his embracing of technology to make his announcement, Gingrich told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Wednesday night that ""there are a lot of principles that haven't changed."" He came out swinging against Obama, the ""elite"" media and Hollywood. Obama should be ashamed of himself for ""dishonest scare tactics"" in comments about Republican approaches to the budget and immigration, Gingrich said, adding he wanted to ""clear away the liberal policies."" The candidate has traveled to key early voting states trying to build a network of support and has met with fundraisers. He has assembled a campaign team and told supporters he aims to raise $100 million. During his appearances, the former speaker has pushed a wide array of policy proposals in his bid to lay the foundation of a campaign and prove he is a serious candidate, not just a symbol of the past. ""I expect the American people in the end will be remarkably fair. They'll render judgment, and they'll decide whether or not Newt Gingrich is somebody that they think can solve the country's problems and be the kind of leader they want for this country,"" Gingrich told Fox News in March. He has given his audiences a lot of political red meat and has not shied away from controversy. Speaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition event in March, he said there is a difference between a majority of Americans and ""the secular socialist people around (President Barack) Obama and the degree to which they do not understand America, cannot possibly represent America and cannot lead us to success."" Gingrich has an agenda the includes overturning the health care reform bill, eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency, pushing more development of energy sources and advocating tax cuts. ""He is a polarizing figure (who) comes with a fair degree of baggage,"" Ford O'Connell, who worked on the 2008 McCain-Palin ticket, told CNN. He said Gingrich has to make himself relevant to the current political climate. ""He does represent the past but has to show why he represents the future,"" O'Connell said, adding that he thinks right now Gingrich is having difficulty doing that. ""If he can demonstrate why he is relevant to the future in the current political climate,"" O'Connell said, ""the baggage will dissipate."" Some Republican activists not affiliated with a campaign have said Gingrich might not be disciplined enough to focus his ideas to run a successful campaign. Pollster David Winston, who worked with Gingrich during his years in the House, said he can. ""There isn't any question Newt Gingrich is a person with lots of ideas,"" Winston told CNN. ""The step for Newt here is to not just merely focus on the future ... (but to) focus on the problems the country is most worried about."" Gingrich told Hannity he is better equipped to be president than when he left office 12 years ago. ""It's fair to say I am more mature,"" he said. ""I have had time to reflect on what worked and what didn't work."" He declined to list who his strongest Republican foe might be, instead saying the focus is on the president. The former House speaker, who converted to Catholicism, the religion of his current wife, has especially reached out to the social conservative wing of the party, a segment critical to success in the key states of Iowa and South Carolina. Many of those activists are skeptical of Gingrich because of his two divorces. ""There's no question at times of my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate,"" Gingrich explained to the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody. After the Georgia Republican lost two runs for Congress in the 1970s, his third attempt in 1978 was successful. He was aggressive and rose to the second spot in the House Republican leadership. He was instrumental in helping to craft the 1994 Contract with America, a blueprint that helped the Republicans take control of the House. He was elected speaker but, after a disappointing GOP showing in the House elections in 1998, he decided to retire in 1999. He then went about rehabilitating his political career, forming a conservative policy think tank called American Solutions, starting a string of successful businesses and becoming a political commentator. He has an impressive record of fundraising, he has developed a large network of supporters and he has authored almost two dozen books and produced movies on a wide range of topics. Gingrich still has some work to do on his reputation. Forty-four percent of those surveyed in a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said they had an unfavorable opinion of him, while 30% said they had a favorable one. That gives him one of the largest unfavorable rankings of the GOP presidential contenders, although it also shows he has high name recognition. When Republicans are asked who they favor for the nomination, 10% choose Gingrich, tying him with Rep. Ron Paul of Texas but behind Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, Donald Trump and Mike Huckabee. ""He brings a lot to the debate. But there are a lot of candidates in the process of going through a presidential primary. We'll sort out the good from the bad, and we'll end up with a good candidate,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on NBC's ""Today"" show Tuesday regarding a Gingrich candidacy. It has not been all smooth sailing as Gingrich tested the waters. He admitted his advisers flubbed the initial announcement in March that he was exploring a run and starting a website, when expectations were built up that they would announce a more formal step. ""It led to unfortunate confusion,"" he told the Des Moines Register. ""I wish we had been a little more structured ... but I don't take it as a serious problem."" Gingrich also drew some criticism for not giving a coherent critique of the Obama administration's policy on Libya. He told Fox News on March 7, when asked what he would do, that he would ""exercise a no-fly zone this evening."" But later, after a no-fly zone was put in place, he said on NBC's ""Today Show"" that ""I would not have intervened. I think there are a lot of other ways to affect (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi."" For his part, Gingrich has denied he flip-flopped, saying he was just commenting on the circumstances as they changed. He posted on his Facebook page: ""President Obama said publicly that 'it's time for Gadhafi to go.' Prior to this statement there were options to be indirect and subtle to achieve this result without United States military forces."" ""The president, however, took those options off the table with his public statement,"" he continued. ""That's why during a March 7th Greta van Susteren interview, I asserted that the president should establish a no-fly zone 'this evening.'

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- After a second day of jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial, more prospective jurors facing weeks and possibly months away from home, family, work and school have been excused. While a few were dismissed for expressing opinions about the defendant, most were let go after revealing compelling hardship issues during questioning by the judge and lawyers from both sides. One woman in her 50s, who works at a hospice, said she cannot go weeks without an income. Her employer would not compensate her during the trial and she said she would not be able to pay her mortgage. Another woman said she is in school and would have no one to care for her 4-year-old daughter. The obstacles to serving represent a vivid cross-section of everyday struggles for Americans, especially in a fragile economic recovery. Financial difficulties, chronic illness, single parents trying to care for children while earning a living were among the excuses offered in court. The judge in the case, Belvin Perry, previously ruled that the jury would be sequestered throughout the trial. Perry wants to shield the panel of 12 and eight alternates from media coverage of the trial and other factors that could sway the outcome. ""Black's Law Dictionary"" defines jury sequestration as ''the custodial isolation of a trial jury to prevent tampering and exposure to publicity.'' Other major cases that have been sequestered in recent years include the O.J. Simpson double murder trial in Los Angeles and the trial of Mary Winkler, found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of her husband, a minister in Selmer, Tennessee. Casey Anthony's 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, disappeared in the Orlando area in 2008. After a protracted search amid national news coverage, a repairman found the toddler's remains in woods near her parents' home. That the case is so high-profile makes it difficult to find a jury without prejudices. Legitimate personal hardships -- universally considered grounds for dismissal in U.S. courts -- present an extra challenge. A male juror said Tuesday he is one of four nurses on a 24-hour rotation for treating heart attack patients. His co-workers would have to ""scramble"" without him on the job, he said. Others included a middle-aged woman who may need surgery; a man who runs group homes for delinquent youths and is getting married this summer; a man who wants to see his dying uncle in Puerto Rico, and a woman who is the sole caregiver for her disabled husband. She brings him to doctors and reminds him ''to take his pills.'' A woman in her 40s pays her children's college tuition and works two jobs to supplement her income. She said she would have to borrow money or ''pull funds from other places'' to avoid falling behind on her mortgage. But not every juror claiming hardship was released. A man in his 30s said he runs a family-owned Ace Hardware store. His father has had heart attacks and strokes over the past several years, leaving his son to manage the business on his own. The man, who has two dogs, no children and no wife because he hasn't ''found the right woman yet,'' said leaving the store for eight weeks would be a big problem, even though he has 34 employees. None of them are trained as managers, he said. However, when asked what else is on his calendar in the next several months, he said he has a business and pleasure trip to Panama. That's when he lost his argument. Cheney Mason, Anthony's lead defense attorney, said if the man can go to Panama, he has someone to take care of the store. According to authorities, Casey Anthony took about a month to report her daughter's disappearance to police. Widely known as ""Tot Mom"" from media coverage, Anthony was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. She could face the death penalty if convicted. Anthony was transported to Clearwater, Florida, and booked into the Pinellas County Jail for jury selection. Perry is holding jury selection in this Tampa Bay Area city of more than 100,000 to avoid assembling a panel that is likely to be more familiar with the case. Anthony will return to Orlando, about 100 miles to the east, for the trial, which could kick off next week. Lawyers have also dismissed several potential jurors who expressed opinions about the case during voir dire, questioning to ensure jurors are not biased. The old French phrase means to speak the truth. Jury selection is scheduled to resume Wednesday morning. Belvin dismissed a panel of candidates on Tuesday, saying they were contaminated by a prospective juror overheard discussing the case. By sheer coincidence, the juror is a witness in the Anthony case and was serving in Pinellas County. After screening for hardship, the court will ask remaining prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case, whether they could set that aside and if they were to find her guilty could they impose the death penalty. In a moment of limited levity on Tuesday, Belvin asked one potential juror who planned to visit Savannah, Georgia, with his wife in June for their wedding anniversary whether he would ''be in the dog house'' if the trip were put on hold. ''I think she'd be a bit more upset than I would at this point,'' he said.","Casey Anthony case indicates how many need every paycheck .

"(CNN) -- ""Celebrity Apprentice"" will stay on the NBC prime-time schedule even if Donald Trump hits the presidential campaign trail, the network's entertainment chairman said Sunday. The show's ""big success"" is ""due in part"" to Trump, Bob Greenblatt said, but he predicts it can go on without him.

"(CNN) -- Formula One teams may try to take control of the elite motorsport when the rights agreement expires at the end of 2012, Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo told CNN in an exclusive interview. Bernie Ecclestone has run F1 on behalf of CVC Capital Partners since selling his rights in 2006, but speculation is growing that the Concorde Agreement -- the settlement between the private equity firm and the teams -- will not be renewed. Last month, media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Italian investment firm EXOR released a statement confirming they were ""formulating a long-term plan for the development of Formula One in the interests of the participants and the fans."" Montezemolo said that the teams had three options: to renew with CVC; find a new partner; or follow the lead of basketball's NBA and create their own company to run the sport. Would F1 be better off with different owners? ""I think we have to be very pragmatic. At the end of 2012, the contracts of every single team with CVC will expire. So, we have three alternatives,"" the 63-year-old Italian told CNN. ""We renew with CVC, or we theoretically -- as the basketball teams did in the U.S. with great success -- we create our own company, like the NBA. Just to run the races, the TV rights and so. ""And third, to find a different partner. Bernie Ecclestone did a very good job but he has already sold out three times, so he doesn't own the business anymore. It is CVC that will sell. It will be the teams' decisions. ""At the end of 2012, the contract will expire, so theoretically CVC doesn't own anything. I think it is important to have alternatives. We will see. We have time to do it."" Murdoch's News Corp finds partner for potential F1 bid . Montezemolo hopes to continue the expansion that Ecclestone helped to usher in. ""We have to invest in the U.S. We have to improve new technologies in F1 for the people watching the television, for iPad, for the Internet. So I think we are in front of a very important moment,"" he said. ""We will race in Russia and India. F1, thanks also to Bernie Ecclestone, has become a worldwide sport. Now we have to find the best solution. It is important to invest for the future and the other teams."" Di Montezemolo is adamant that F1 needs a new direction, and claims that rule changes in recent years have made the sport confusing for the teams and fans alike. Latest F1 championship standings . ""We have gone too far with artificial elements. It's like, if I push footballers to wear tennis shoes in the rain. To have so many pit-stops -- listen, I want to see competition, I want to see cars on the track. I don't want to see competition in the pits,"" he said. ""A little bit, yes -- but in the last race there were 80 pit-stops. Come on, it's too much. And the people don't understand anymore because when you come out of the pits you don't know what position you're in. ""I think we have gone too far with the machines, too many buttons. The driver is focalizing the buttons, when you have the authorization to overtake. We have gone too far. ""Ferrari will push a lot with the authority -- with the respect that we have to the federation and the other teams -- to avoid going too far with F1. Because I think it can create problems for the television people and on the racetrack."" Domenicali: Ferrari have been too conservative this season . Montezemolo admitted he was frustrated with the present limits on testing too. ""We are not able to do testing, to do training.

"(CNN) -- Two-time runner-up Roger Federer must wait another year before he can win his first Rome Masters title after suffering a shock third-round defeat on Thursday. The Swiss third seed's French Open build-up suffered a blow when he was beaten by Richard Gasquet for the first time in the last nine meetings between the two players and just his second overall. The French 16th seed triumphed 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-4) in a match lasting two hours 20 minutes as he earned a quarterfinal clash with Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych at the clay event. ""I had multiple chances. That is how it goes,"" 16-time grand slam champion Federer told the ATP Tour website after his second loss against a player outside the top three this year. Djokovic's No. 1 dream is fast becoming reality . ""Sometimes it is unfortunate because I was playing well and then it didn't happen at all anymore, so it was a disappointing end to the match. ""But it will not affect my preparation and work for the French Open, I will be fine. I definitely think I should not have lost this match, and that is kind of annoying."" World No. 1 Rafael Nadal bounced back from his poor showing in beating Italian qualifier Paolo Lorenzi in three sets on Wednesday as he disposed of fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez. The five-time Rome champion won 6-4 6-2 in just 86 minutes to set up a quarterfinal against Croatia's Marin Cilic, who beat American 11th seed Mardy Fish 7-6 (8-6) 6-3. Nadal, seeking a third successive title, must beat Cilic to prevent Novak Djokovic taking his title as the world's top player. ""I had a fever this morning but I feel better now. Certainly I didn't really understand why yesterday I felt slow and without energy, and I understand now better today,"" said Nadal, whose two-year winning streak on clay was ended by Djokovic in the Madrid final. ""That is that and I am here to fight and to try my best like I have always done. I am ready for everything."" Second seed Djokovic extended his unbeaten run to 34 matches this year with a 6-4 6-1 victory over Stanislas Wawrinka, who he also beat in the 2008 final. The Serbian, who is closing on John McEnroe's record of 42 straight wins at the start of 1984, needed just 93 minutes to move past the Swiss 14th seed. Djokovic, who turns 24 on May 22, will face Swedish fifth seed Robin Soderling in the last eight. Soderling, the French Open runner-up for the past two years, battled past Spanish ninth seed Nicolas Almagro, winning 6-3 3-6 6-4 in just over two hours. British fourth seed Andy Murray also moved into the quarterfinals with a 6-2 6-3 win over Italy's Potito Starace. He will next play unseeded German Florian Mayer, who beat Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela 7-5 6-4. If Murray and Djokovic both reach the semis, it will mean a rematch of January's Australian Open final -- which the Serbian won. Meanwhile, former women's world No. 1 Serena Williams will not make her long-awaited comeback at the French Open, which starts later this month. The American has not played since winning her 13th grand slam singles title at Wimbledon in June 2010, after which she badly cut her foot in a freak accident in a restaurant. The 29-year-old, whose only title in Paris came in 2002, was further delayed in returning to action when she suffered a pulmonary embolism in February. ""While I am making good progress, unfortunately I won't be able to compete in Roland Garros,"" she said in a statement on Thursday. ""I am grateful for every moment I have and the fact that I have returned to the court. I am hopeful that I will be back competing this summer. Thank you all for your continued prayers."" Current No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki reached the quarterfinals in Rome after beating Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer 6-1 7-6 (7-4) on Thursday.

French Open champion Francesca Schiavone came from behind to beat Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova 3-6 6-2 7-5. The Italian second seed set up a rematch of the 2010 Roland Garros final with Australian No. 6 Sam Stosur, who defeated Slovenian qualifier Polona Hercog 6-3 6-4. Chinese fourth seed Li Na booked her place in the last eight with a 6-2 6-1 win over Australia's Jarmila Gajdosova.

"(CNN) -- The swollen Red River that forms the border between Minnesota and North Dakota crested near 40 feet in Fargo, North Dakota, a spokesman for the City of Fargo Fire Department said Sunday. The river is expected to remain swollen for the next few days, said spokesman Jesse Schmidt. Rain forecast for Sunday had raised flooding fears along the Red River, where recreational boating was barred in several counties. But the worst of the predictions seems not to have materialized. The area could get up to half an inch of rain Sunday, Schmidt said. The region usually has seasonal flooding after warm weather and rain melts snow in early spring. Officials in Moorhead, Minnesota, across the border from Fargo, also were coping with the flooding, a repeat from 2010 and 2009. The Red River crested at nearly 41 feet in 2009. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, talked Saturday about improved levees and preparations. Still, she said, three people have died in Minnesota because of the flooding. ""This is a ferocious river,"" Klobuchar said. ""We have to continue to be careful."" Other Minnesota officials talked about the need for more flood mitigation. The U.S. Coast Guard said one of its crews rescued rescued five people along the Red River Saturday -- one resident and four responders. In Cass County, north of Fargo, residents placed sandbags along flooded streams and roads and used all-terrain vehicles to reach their homes.","Seasonal flooding has hit communities in upper Midwest .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility Friday for suicide attacks on a military training facility in the nation's northwest, saying they were carried out in retaliation for the killing of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. The twin suicide bombings killed at least 80 people, nearly all of them military recruits who had just completed their training, said Bashir Ahmad Bilour, a senior provincial minister. About 140 others were wounded. ""Pakistani and the U.S. forces should be ready for more attacks,"" said Ihsan Ullah Ihsan, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, who accused the Pakistani military of having alerted the United States to bin Laden's location. ""Osama was our great leader and the killers of Osama will have to pay its price,"" he said. The back-to-back explosions took place shortly after scores of recruits had left the Shabqadar Fort, a training facility in the district of Charsadda, said Jahan Zeb Khan, a senior police officer. Afterward, video of the blood-soaked ground outside the training facility showed it littered with burned vehicles and broken glass. The recruits had just completed a nine-month training program when the attackers struck. The district of Charsadda borders Mohmand Agency, one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. Mohmand is believed to be a hideout for Taliban fighters and al Qaeda-linked militants fleeing last year's military operation in the district of South Waziristan and ongoing U.S. drone strikes in North Waziristan. The Pakistani army has carried out numerous ground and air operations in Mohmand but it has not been able to stamp out the militants. The Pakistani Taliban represent a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, said Bill Roggio, military-affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. Those fighters attack targets in Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan. The group, which is headquartered in Quetta, is different from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, he said. Last December, some 150 militants ambushed six security checkpoints in Mohmand, killing 11 Pakistani soldiers, officials told CNN. Earlier in December, a twin suicide attack targeting a government building in Mohmand killed at least 40 people. ""They're clearly trying to disrupt our bilateral relationship through this attack,"" State Department spokesman Mike Toner told reporters. ""But it's also clear that they are going to carry out these kinds of attacks no matter what."" But Imran Khan, a Pakistani opposition party leader, said the attacks show that the Pakistani government is doing a poor job managing the crisis. ""Unfortunately, we do not have a trustworthy, credible government,"" the chairman of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) Party told CNN. ""That's why I'm calling for the resignation of our own government, free and fair elections and a new, credible government,"" he said. He cited government figures that cite 34,000 deaths and a $68 billion loss to the nation's economy as a result of terrorism. ""The people of Pakistan are dying under this war on terror,"" he said. Khan said Pakistan would be in a better position if it would simply decline U.S. aid. ""Unfortunately, if Pakistan is considered a hired gun of the U.S., it reduces its capability to win this war on terror,"" he said. ""If this becomes Pakistan's war, I think Pakistan will win the war. But if it's perceived that the Pakistani army is a mercenary army of the U.S., we have no chance of winning."" He added, ""They target Pakistan because Pakistan is perceived as America's agents. That's why you see the sort of carnage that's taking place today."" Prior to 2004, there were no suicide attacks and no militant Taliban in Pakistan, he said. But things have changed. ""Here's a country that had 500 bomb blasts last year."" The vast majority of the fighters are tribal people who are neither terrorists nor religious fundamentalists, he said. ""They are fighting as a result of Pakistani military operations in the tribal area. So a credible government should have peace talks with them and then isolate the al Qaeda, which has worried the West.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Tokyo Electric Power Co., the company that owns the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, said Tuesday it is going to stick to its previously announced timetable of six to nine months in bringing an end to the crisis. But the company says it will have to change strategies in cooling the No. 1 reactor after it learned last week that water levels in the reactor were much lower than previously  believed. Tokyo Electric first laid out the six to nine month timetable for bringing an end to the crisis in mid-April. But the company said last week that the water levels in the No. 1 reactor were much lower than previously believed, and that it suspects the fuel rods had melted and fallen into the coolant at the base of the reactor pressure vessel. The company also said it suspects that the pressure vessel was leaking fluid into the surrounding concrete containment vessel. It was not clear where the leak was located or how bad it was, but the discovery could complicate efforts to restore normal cooling systems in the reactor. Three reactors at Fukushima Daiichi overheated after the plant was struck by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out the units' cooling systems and unleashed the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Over the weekend, residents began evacuating from two villages which had originally been outside the danger zone drawn around the plant. The towns of Iitate and Kawamata were downwind of the plant in the early days of the disaster, and radiation levels there are high enough to raise the long-term risk of cancer for those remaining, the government said. ""I know that they are having to endure great hardships, and their life in evacuation going forward will be a very harsh one,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Monday. ""We truly regret that this had to happen."" Radiation levels in Iitate, about 40 km northwest of the plant, were nearly 40 times normal background levels Monday, according to data released by the country's Science Ministry. Someone who spent eight hours a day outside would get the government's maximum allowable dose of 20 millisieverts in about six months at those levels. Residents of those towns and all or part of three others were given orders to start packing in April. Five more areas have been put on notice to await evacuation orders, and the government says it will decide whether those residents will be allowed to return around the time the crisis is resolved.

"(CNN) -- His father is a nuclear engineer and his uncle was a high-ranking politician in Montenegro, but Milos Raonic is forging an entirely different career path with his own kind of power. At an imposing 6ft 5in tall, he has burst onto the tennis scene this year with a fast-developing all-round game based upon his booming serve -- he has already registered the third-fastest delivery on record. The 20-year-old is the highest-ranked Canadian tennis player in the history of the ATP Tour listings, he has won his first top-level tournament, and reached the fourth round of only his second grand slam event in Australia in January. These are impressive numbers at such a young age, but they pale in comparison to the statistics of the man who has had a massive influence on Raonic's burgeoning career. Pete Sampras won 14 grand slam crowns, 64 singles titles and spent a record 286 weeks at No. 1. He also helped launch Raonic's career in February when they met in San Jose at a tournament where the American legend himself triumphed twice. Will bigger balls slow down the rocket men of tennis? ""I met him and then went on a nine-match winning streak, so it was a very inspirational moment,"" Raonic told CNN Open Court's Candy Reid of his breakthrough victory and subsequent final appearance in Memphis. ""It was another level of an experience for me, getting to meet someone you looked up to so much and watched for so many hours, getting to meet the person in the face to see what kind of person he is."" Raonic was so struck by that meeting that he still carries on tour a picture of the two that Sampras signed and framed for him. ""I looked up to him, I looked at all his matches, watched everything more than once -- he really was an inspiration. He was an inspiration for putting so much time behind that serve,"" he said. The fabled Sampras serve. Raonic has an impressive arsenal of his own. As well as its pace -- clocked at 153 mph (246 kph) in a Davis Cup tie at altitude in Mexico in March -- he has a variety that many opponents will struggle to counter, according to America's new No. 1 Mardy Fish. ""He's got all the serves that anyone else that I've ever seen does,"" Fish said after losing to Raonic in the Memphis semis. ""From the waist down he has the strongest legs of anyone I've seen. You can tell he still has some growing to do in his upper body, and it's a scary thought to think he's got ways to improve."" Fauna fight: The battle over Roland Garros . Andy Roddick, Raonic's final conqueror that week and formerly the world's fastest server, was also impressed. ""The good news for him is he's going to be able to learn on the job because that serve is going to win him a lot of matches. It's one of the bigger serves I've seen,"" the American said. But Raonic knows that a lightning serve is not enough to guarantee success against the world's elite players. ""There is a lot of effort going into the rest of my game. I'm trying to develop for those days when you play number one, two, three, four, five in the world and they get all those serves back. I'm preparing myself as much as possible to be at the top of the game."" If he hadn't made the jump from junior ranks, and that was by no means a certainty when he began this year ranked 156th with doubts about his fitness and on-court attitude, Raonic might have been pursuing a different profession. ""I was big in academics so I think I'd be sitting behind a desk calculating with numbers. I want to finish university, I want to get a degree in finance,"" said the Montenegro-born player, who turned down a scholarship at the University of Virginia to focus on tennis. ""I want to at least have that education so I could have those options and choices because I really did enjoy that, especially with the calculator."" Is Nadal's clay domination good for tennis? It was a tempting option, as he was not a top name among the juniors, but Raonic's career developed under the tuition of Frederic Niemeyer and he has taken a big leap since Tennis Canada sent him to work with former Spanish professional Galo Blanco last October. ""When we initially set my goals at the beginning of the year we set a top-50 goal by the end of the summer, so a lot of things came a lot quicker than planned,"" said Raonic, now ranked 25th and likely to be seeded at the French Open. ""I worked on a lot of things in the offseason which helped me a lot. Mentally was the biggest change, I was able to control a lot more of the situations. I was able to stay humble and calm and kept my head level with everything that was happening. ""I wasn't the superstar in the juniors, for me it just came recently. People talked a lot about potential with me, there were some believers but not too many believers. The way this came I surprised everybody and I surprised myself. ""The goal now is I want to keep developing and progressing, make sure I'm playing better this month than I was last month, and if I can do that the ranking will go up on its own."" While Canada-born Greg Rusedski reached the heights of world No. 4 after gaining British citizenship in 1995, Raonic said he would remain loyal to his adopted country, having moved to North America from Montenegro at the age of three. ""They have been very supportive. I grew up through the last three years with their national center and they are thriving, and I think there's a lot I can give there from a development and growth of the sport,"" he said. ""We have many great athletes but tennis is not the main thing they look up to -- they look up to hockey. I hope I can keep doing well and help the sport grow so we can have a few more players at the top.""","Big-serving Milos Raonic has become the highest-ranked Canadian tennis player .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that Israel was willing to stop attacks on Gaza if the Palestinians stop firing into southern Israel. ""If they stop firing at our communities, then we will stop firing. If they stop firing altogether, then there will be quiet,"" Barak said in an interview on Israel Radio. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned shortly afterward that the converse was also true. ""Our policy is clear. If attacks against Israeli civilians and Israeli soldiers continue, the response will be very harsh,"" he said before the weekly Cabinet meeting Sunday. Barak's offer comes after a particularly intense few days of hostilities following a Hamas rocket attack on an Israeli bus that left a teenager critically wounded on Thursday. Netanyahu said Sunday the victim, Daniel Wiliech, ""is fighting for his life. We, along with the entire nation, pray for him."" Israel responded with a series of strikes on Gaza that has left at least 18 people dead, the largest number since a major Israeli incursion into the territory in 2008-09 in response to Palestinian rocket attacks. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas Saturday called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League in the face of the upsurge in violence, according to the official Palestinian news agency. The Arab League plans to request that the United Nations Security Council ""consider the aggression against the Gaza Strip"" and impose a no-fly zone over Gaza to protect civilians, Hisham Yousef, the Arab League's chief of staff, said Sunday. Palestinians fired nine mortars and rockets into Israel Sunday morning, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said -- a significant drop from the level of the past few days. On Saturday, the Israeli air force struck and killed three Hamas personnel in southern Gaza, according to both the Israeli military and Palestinian medics. The Israel Defense Forces said the people were a senior Hamas military wing leader and his two bodyguards. In another incident, a Palestinian man died of wounds in an early evening airstrike in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City. Rosenfeld said about 42 rockets and mortars were fired into Israel on Saturday, including 10 longer-range Grad rockets, but no injuries were reported. The military put the number of rockets and mortars fired Saturday at 50. It said aircraft and armored forces targeted 11 squads of ""terrorists"" in the northern and southern Gaza Strip and 15 ""terror activity sites,"" including ""terror infrastructure sites, Hamas outposts, smuggling tunnels and weapons manufacturing and storage facilities."" The three-day death toll in Gaza includes at least 10 militants and eight civilians. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack on a civilian bus ""crossed the line"" and that ""whoever tries to hurt and murder children will have no immunity."" In a Friday letter to the U.N. Security Council, Riyad Mansour -- Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations -- charged Israel with using ""indiscriminate and excessive force"" and asked for the world body to intervene to ""prevent the slaughter of more innocent civilians."" A Hamas official vowed Saturday to widen the scope of the group's attacks on Israel if Netanyahu did not agree to halt airstrikes on Gaza. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri blamed Israel for the surge in violence and said Hamas would do what was needed to protect Palestinians in Gaza. Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Hamas military wing, the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam Brigades, told reporters in Gaza City on Saturday that his group would continue to wage a fight until Palestinians cast off the Israeli occupation and wrested away their lands. He said it was impossible to speak about any sort of calm between Hamas and Israel while there was aggression being committed against the Palestinian people. Israeli officials have cited various precautions to avert casualties. They include early warning systems, road closures near the Gaza border and the use of bomb shelters, police spokesman Rosenfeld said. The Israeli military said Saturday that its newly deployed anti-rocket defense system known as the Iron Dome successfully intercepted Grad rockets that had been fired from Gaza Friday and Saturday. Over the past 48 hours, ""terrorist organizations"" in Gaza had fired more than 120 Grad missiles, rockets and mortars at Israel, the IDF said. In a statement released Saturday, the Israeli military said it ""continued striking terror sites in the Gaza Strip"" in coordination with Israel's domestic security agency, the Shin Bet.

"(CNN) -- With 33 consecutive wins and six straight titles in 2011, Novak Djokovic is closing in on his lifetime goal. The Serbian's explosive start to the new tennis season has seen him battle and bruise two of the game's modern greats and former untouchables in Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. His run in the current campaign has seen him beat both Federer and Nadal three times each -- consigning the Spaniard to his first clay-court defeat in nearly two years in Madrid -- en route to entering the top 10 of all-time ATP winning streaks. His win at the Australian Open and present hot streak finds him ranked second in the world, but Djokovic has his sights firmly focused on achieving a long-held goal. If he wins his seventh crown at the Rome Masters ahead of his 24th birthday on May 22, and No. 1 Nadal fails to make the semifinals, Djokovic will proudly sit atop the rankings for the first time in his career. He told CNN's Open Court show: ""It is my lifetime goal, my highest ambition, my dream as well, but I'm still 23, 24 this year. I still believe that I can play for many more years to come in this high level in the ATP Tour. ""If I really want to be one of the candidates for the top spot, I have to play consistently well throughout the whole year, because that is what Rafa and Roger will do and that's what they have been doing the last five years, winning major events, being at least in the semis for every major event. ""If I want to compete with them and keep up with them, I will have to do the same at least."" If Djokovic's rise to prominence in the game from 2005 onwards was steady, his leap into Nadal and Federer's place at the top table of tennis has been dramatic. He secured his first major title back in 2008 at the Australian Open, and solidified his position as world number three, but the glut of grand slam titles many had predicted did not materialize. He reached the quarterfinals, or better, in each of 2010's four slams and again finished the year third behind Nadal and Federer, but after leading Serbia to a landmark Davis Cup triumph over France in December, Djokovic hasn't looked back. His 33 wins have included three final defeats of Nadal, the most notable coming in the recent Madrid Masters, when Djokovic inflicted the Spaniard's first reverse on clay in 38 matches. So, what is the secret to his blistering start in 2011? ""Everything kind of came together,"" he told CNN anchor Pedro Pinto. ""Everybody is wondering what the secret is -- there is no secret. ""I had the team of people I've had for the last two or three years, it just took time for me to get all the things right and kind of have this necessary life experience in tennis."" Djokovic's imperious form has sent confidence levels soaring, and he attributes his success to a solid mental approach. ""There is this saying that players use, that when you're so confident that the tennis ball looks like a watermelon, so it probably is the case with me in the last couple of months,"" he explained. ""I am playing the best tennis of my life and I'm on an incredible run. Did I expect that? No, definitely not, but I am trying to keep up with this momentum and trying to keep up with this high level of performance as much as I can."" Despite his mesmerizing run during the first five months of the season, Djokovic insists Nadal is still favorite to retain his French Open crown next month and make it six wins in seven years. And while the Serb says he won't retain his winning streak throughout the entire year, he does admit he is going into the tournament a transformed man. ""I don't expect myself to not lose a match throughout the whole year, but I am confident that I am a different player from last year,"" he said. ""I'm emotionally stable, I'm very confident, I am fast on the court and I am just consistent.""","Novak Djokovic tells CNN's Open Court show his lifetime goal is to become world No. 1 .

"(CNN) -- Japan's national sport of sumo wrestling was rocked by a match-fixing scandal on Thursday after it was revealed three wrestlers had admitted to rigging bouts. ""Three sumo wrestlers have admitted to match-fixing,"" Yoshiaki Takaki, the country's minister for education and sport, announced to a parliamentary panel. ''Sumo is our national sport. If match-fixing has occurred, it is a very serious betrayal of the people,'' Naoto Kan, the country's Prime Minister, added. Japan's Kyodo news service claimed that Tokyo Police had found suspicious messages on a number of wrestlers' phones that suggested the outcome of several fights had been planned. The messages exchanged between wrestlers discuss how fights would be arranged and also the amount of money that would change hands. ""I'll hit my opponent head on,"" was one message reported in British newspaper The Guardian. ""For 20 more I will concede. After the meet, I need to make at least 50 or I'll be in serious trouble,"" read a further text which discussed the financial rewards for one wrestler. ""You fall when I move to tackle,"" read another message reported by Japanese news wire Jiji Press. Japan Sumo Association chairman Hanaregoma told a news conference that 13 people who had been mentioned in the messages would be investigated. ""It's a betrayal of sumo fans. If this is true. It would be something that rocks (sumo) to its foundations. We will investigate thoroughly,"" Hanaregoma said. It is the latest controversy to hit sumo after a gambling scandal emerged in July last year when 34-year-old wrestler Ozeki Kotomitsuki is said to have illegally bet on baseball games.","Japan's national sport of sumo wrestling facing a match-fixing scandal .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- NASA announced Tuesday the new retirement homes for the four remaining space shuttles -- three historic orbiters and the program's test vehicle. The space shuttle Atlantis will be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida; the Endeavour, at the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Discovery, at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia; and the test shuttle, Enterprise, at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York, NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden Jr. said during a ceremony at the Kennedy Center. The announcement was made on the 30th anniversary of the space shuttle program's first flight, made by the subsequently ill-fated Columbia orbiter, and the 50th anniversary of Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space. More than 20 locations around the country sought one of the orbiters because of the potential tourist draw. The drama mirrored the bidding to host an Olympic games. Supporters of sites that were rejected expressed disappointment. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the Johnson Space Center in Houston should have been one of the retirement homes for an orbiter, ""but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet,"" he said in a statement. He noted that Houston ""played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle."" ""Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASA's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the space shuttle orbiters,"" Cornyn said. ""There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters -- even Administrator Bolden stated as much. Today's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the state of Texas, and I'm deeply disappointed with the administration's misguided decision,"" Cornyn said. In Los Angeles, shortly after NASA's announcement, California Science Center President Jeffrey Rudolph told reporters that the Endeavour would boost the center's annual 1.4 million visitors to about 2 million people a year. The center plans to use the orbiter as the centerpiece to a new air and space gallery, which would cost $200 million and is part of the center's 25-year master plan, Rudolph said. That price tag includes the $28.8 million that the center must pay NASA to prepare and relocate the orbiter to Los Angeles, he said. The center hasn't hired an architect yet to design the new facility and is now planning a fundraiser, he said. ""Obviously, we were thrilled. We got the word this morning, shortly before the announcement,"" Rudolph said of his reaction to winning one of the shuttles. ""The fact that the shuttle was created here in California had a lot to do with giving us a leg up"" over the competition, Rudolph said. ""It's a fitting place for this national treasure."" The center, which also features a Los Angeles charter school, is the most attended museum in southern California and one of the most attended in the country, Rudolph said. The Los Angeles center's existing air and space gallery is now home to the Mercury-Redstone 2 capsule that carried Ham, a chimpanzee, on a suborbital flight, and the Gemini 11 capsule flown by astronauts Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon on an orbital flight. U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer said she and Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- both California Democrats -- wrote to NASA's Bolden last year asking that California become home to one of the shuttles because the state has a long history with the shuttle program. Beginning in 1972, all five space shuttle orbiters were fabricated in Downey, California, and assembled in Palmdale, California, Boxer said in a statement. All of the space shuttles were tested at Edwards Air Force Base just outside of Palmdale, where 53 of NASA's 133 shuttle missions landed, she said. The Endeavour will take its final flight on April 29, and prior to this launch, it will have been used on 24 missions, orbited the earth 4,429 times and traveled 103,149,636 miles, Boxer said. ""California has a long history of supporting the shuttle program and we are proud to welcome this inspiring symbol of American scientific achievement and ingenuity to the Golden State,"" Boxer said in a statement. Audience members at the Kennedy Space Center cheered when Bolden announced the Atlantis would be assigned to that launch facility. Many people in the gallery were center workers, some of whom are likely to lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends. Because the announcement was being made at Kennedy, expectations were high that the visitor center would be awarded one of the shuttles. The Museum of Flight in Seattle also wanted one. In fact, one wall of a new space gallery where a shuttle would be housed was already erected in anticipation. Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the museum's president, Doug King, said museum officials didn't have any inside information. ""I think that confident may be too strong a word. I think that hopeful is probably a better one,"" he said. But on Tuesday, Washington state Gov. Chris Gregoire also said he was disappointed that the NASA didn't select the Seattle museum for one of the retired shuttles. ""The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest. As the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fit,"" Gregoire said in a statement. ""However, the full fuselage trainer, that every astronaut including Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on, will soon call the Museum of Flight home,"" the governor said. ""The largest of the trainers, this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get. Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum."" Facilities in Chicago, New York, Dayton, Ohio, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, also put in requests for an orbiter, with hopes that such a historic artifact would inspire countless children in those areas to explore careers in science and engineering. Becoming home to an orbiter promises to be a boon for a community. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex estimates a shuttle will bring in 200,000 more guests every year. The economic impact to the area is estimated at about $15 million. At New York's Intrepid Museum, Executive Director Susan Marenoff told CNN, ""Figure over 300,000 people additional (due) to the Intrepid, to New York City. Couple that with $106 million in economic benefit. We think that's a pretty good deal."" Each winning location has to fork over $28.8 million to NASA for delivery of the vehicles. They also must guarantee a climate-controlled building will be constructed to house their shuttle. That's still a bargain, officials at the bidding locations said, because of the return on investment they expect. One of the orbiters -- Discovery, the oldest -- was largely regarded as being Smithsonian-bound. That was confirmed by Tuesday's announcement. The Enterprise, a test shuttle that never flew in space, is there now. It was be reassigned, at a discounted price, to one of the locations that didn't get either Endeavour or Atlantis. That location turned out to be the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. Only two more shuttle flights are scheduled: Endeavour on April 29 and Atlantis on June 28, wrapping up a program in which the vehicles launched satellites, built a space station, and launched and repaired an orbiting telescope. After that, they become museum pieces. Two other shuttles were destroyed in flight accidents. The Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on January 28, 1986, and the Columbia disintegrated during re-entry on February 1, 2003. CNN's Stan Wilson, Ed Lavandera and Irving Last contributed to this report.","The shuttles Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis carry historic and economic value .

"(CNN) -- She was named after her mother's friend and not the doomed French queen, though at this moment in Ivory Coast's history, some might think it unfortunate. But Marie Antoinette Singleton doesn't care what people think of her -- it's her parents' names that she wants to clear. Singleton, 37, watched as images of the capture of Laurent Gbagbo and his wife, Simone, flashed across her television screen Monday. It was difficult for her to see her stepfather and mother appear weak, haggard and, as she says, bearing signs of abuse. ""It's disrespectful and humiliating,"" she said in a phone interview from her home in Washington, D.C., where she worked in the Ivory Coast embassy until February. She wasn't going to serve a rebel government, she said as defiantly as her stepfather had declared his intention to remain in office. So she stopped going to work. Gbagbo insisted he won Ivory Coast's disputed November presidential election. The international community, however, did not see it that way. The United Nations, the United States, France and other global powers threw their support behind Alassane Ouattara, a man who Singleton said has haunted her family for many years. A four-month political standoff turned bloody and this week, everything ended for Gbagbo when forces stormed his residence and detained him, Simone and several of his children. The grandeur that had graced the West African nation's first couple quickly faded as Ouattara's security forces took them away -- a tired, feeble man seen on television in a white undershirt and a wife in a sundress and disheveled braids. Singleton was sure her father had been beaten. ""This is tragic -- not just for my family but for the people of Cote D'Ivoire,"" Singleton said. All her life, she had known parents who she viewed as determined to pull their nation up from the remnants of a brutal colonial history. All her life, she had known parents who gave their time for building a multi-party system. The well-educated Gbagbo -- he earned a Ph.D in history -- stood up to Ivory Coast's first president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, known as the father of the nation. Gbagbo despised Houphouet-Boigny's strong alliance with France, the former colonial power. Singleton recalled a campus protest in the early 1990s in which her stepfather and mother were arrested. Ouattara was then Houphouet-Boigny's prime minister. ""It has not been easy to be in opposition,"" Singleton said. ""They have been doing it almost all their lives. ""So this is nothing new,"" she said of this week's events. Ouattara, she said, remains a puppet for the colonialists and international players who want to profit off her nation. Gbagbo, she said, paid the price for standing his ground. ""When an African leader comes and says, 'I want to serve my people,' they don't want to hear that,"" she said. ""So from the start they wanted to get President Gbagbo out of office."" Singleton has not been back home to Ivory Coast in two years. But she had been calling her parents as they hid in the basement of their residence. She worried about their safety, but they said they were fine. ""It made me proud they are not quitters. They are true to the vision for Cote D'Ivoire ... for independence. Because we are not independent."" But on Monday, the phone calls stopped going through. She imagined her parents' phones had been confiscated, cut off even, because she kept hearing a message from the phone company. She said she has had no word of her family since their capture. There are many who believe Gbagbo should stand trial for allegations of human rights violations. He may even face investigation by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. So on Wednesday, Singleton assembled a legal team that includes Jacques Verges, who defended Nazi Klaus Barbie and once offered his services to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Singleton has asked the lawyers to look into the arrest of her family and the legality of the French army's intervention. She is hopeful the world will eventually see him the way she does. The world has called Gbagbo a monster. Singleton described him as affable, a man who likes to tell jokes all the time. The world has portrayed Gbagbo as power-hungry. Singleton said he was modest and humble and loved for those virtues. She thought this week of her childhood and how her parents used to insist their children have lunch with them every day. At night, her parents dabbled in politics. But the midday meal gave them time to delve into the loves and tribulations of their children. ""They would not start lunch until we came back home,"" Singleton said. If she was out at a friend's house, her father sent someone to fetch her. And, if there was no rice at the table, there was no meal, she said. He also loved sardines. She told these stories of her father to explain that her father is the opposite of what he has been made out to be. Really, she said, he is not complicated. She quoted the Bible when she said no weapons formed against her parents shall prosper. The Lord, she said, will take care of her stepfather.","Marie Antoinette Singleton contradicts the international potrayal of Gbabgo .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova boosted her hopes of winning a first French Open title next month by beating last year's runner-up Samantha Stosur in the final of the Rome Masters on Sunday. The Russian, who counts clay as her least favorite surface, triumphed 6-2 6-4 in just 83 minutes in a match delayed by rain. It was the former world No. 1's first title since winning a minor event in Strasbourg a year ago, and her first in a top-level clay tournament. She had lost her previous four WTA Tour finals. Sharapova, seeded seventh, followed up her semifinal win over current top-ranked woman Caroline Wozniacki as she beat the Australian for the eighth consecutive time in their first encounter on the red dirt. ""I'm so happy to be the champion. It means so much to me to add this title to the ones I already have,"" she told the crowd after collecting her 23rd career crown. ""Rome is such a special place and I've dreamed of holding up this trophy. There are a lot of tournaments coming up, and this is a great start to everything. I can't wait to be back next year."" The 24-year-old has won three of the four grand slams, but this year could be her best chance to succeed at Roland Garros with the Williams sisters Serena and Venus not playing, Justine Henin retired and Kim Clijsters recovering from injury. Stosur will again be one of the contenders, having reached her first final since losing to Francesca Schiavone in Paris nearly 12 months ago. Seeded sixth in Rome, she beat the Italian before eliminating China's Australian Open runner-up Li Na in the semifinals on Saturday. However, Stosur made a poor start against Sharapova as she won only one of the first 15 points and quickly found herself 4-0 down. She had a double break-point at 5-4 down in the second set on Sharapova's serve but hit the net, then returned long before her opponent won it with a forehand.","Maria Sharapova beats Samantha Stosur 6-2 6-4 in final of the Rome Masters .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan bounced back from the disappointment of missing out on a domestic double by beating Cagliari 4-1 on Saturday, with Robinho scoring twice. Milan wrapped up the Serie A title last weekend but were denied a place in the Coppa Italia final following a 2-1 defeat by Palermo in the second leg of the semi on Tuesday. However, Massimiliano Allegri's team scored three goals in the first 35 minutes -- two of them going to Brazilian forward Robinho -- to subdue the visiting Sardinians.

Cagliari went into the match in 11th place and in no danger of being relegated, but suffered a fourth successive defeat. Lazio moved up to fourth and a possible Champions League place after beating 10th-placed Genoa 4-2 earlier in the day to end a run of three defeats. Brazilian Hernanes scored twice in the second half after goals from Giuseppe Biava and Tommaso Rocchi to lift the Rome side a point above Udinese, who visit 12th-placed Chievo on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo equaled the Spanish league scoring record with two more goals in Sunday's 3-1 victory at Villarreal. The Portugal captain took his tally in La Liga to 38 ahead of next weekend's final match at home to relegated Almeria, with Real's title hopes having ended in midweek. His closest rival is Lionel Messi on 31, but the world player of the year was rested for Barcelona's 0-0 draw against lowly Deportivo La Coruna ahead of the May 28 Champions League final against Manchester United. Barca, who clinched the title on Wednesday with two matches to play, were presented the La Liga trophy in front of their home fans after a low-key match. Barcelona crowned Spanish champions after Levante draw . Ronaldo is now level with the 1951 effort of Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra, which was matched by Real's Hugo Sanchez in 1990, after scoring nine times in the last three matches. Both against Villarreal came from free-kicks, with the first soon after Marcelo's 17th-minute opener and the second in time added on at the end of the match. It took him to 51 goals in all competitions this season, one behind Messi's Spanish record, while Real have now netted 94 times to Barca's 92 in La Liga. Fourth-placed Villarreal, who reduced the deficit through Ruben Cani six minutes after halftime, will have to go through the Champions League qualifying round next season. Valencia clinched third place for the second time in a row with a 0-0 draw against local rivals Levante to secure a group-stage place in Europe's top tournament. Athletic Bilbao, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla will battle for the two Europa League places next weekend, with all three clubs on 55 points. Bilbao were held 1-1 at home by 10-man Malaga, while Sevilla beat Real Sociedad 3-1 and Atletico won 2-1 against relegated Hercules in manager Quique Sanchez Flores' final home game in charge of the 2010 Europa League champions. Six clubs will battle to avoid filling the final relegation spot next week, with Zaragoza on 42 points, Deportivo and Getafe on 43 and Mallorca, Sociedad and Osasuna on 44. Robinho double helps champions Milan rebound . In Italy, deposed champions Inter Milan secured second place with a round to play after a 1-1 draw with Napoli that ensured the home team will finish third and enter the Champions League draw at the group stage. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o put Inter ahead with his 21st league goal this season, while Colombian defender Juan Camilo Zuniga equalized on halftime. The battle for a berth in the competition's qualifying draw will go to the final round after Udinese won 2-0 at Chievo to reclaim fourth place from Lazio. Sixth-placed Roma's Champions League hopes ended with a 2-1 defeat at Catania, leaving the side three points behind capital rivals Lazio. Seventh-placed Juventus lost 1-0 at Parma, so must beat Napoli next weekend and hope Roma lose to Sampdoria in order to qualify for the Europa League. Sampdoria dropped out of the top flight just a season after qualifying for the Champions League following a 2-1 defeat at home to Palermo. The club finished fourth in 2009-10 but followed Brescia and Bari in going down to Serie A.

"(CNN) -- A British woman beheaded in an apparently random supermarket attack in Spain's Canary Islands has been identified as grandmother Jennifer Mills-Westley. She was retired and living between Tenerife in the Canary Islands and France, where a daughter and grandchildren live, her family said in a statement Saturday. ""She was full of life, generous of heart, would do anything for anyone,"" said her daughter, who was only identified as Sarah. The family is ""devastated by the news of her death,"" her daughter said. ""We now have to find a way of living without her love and light,"" she added. Mills-Westley was a retired county council worker in Norfolk, eastern England, council leader Derrick Murphy told CNN. Murphy said he did not know her personally, having joined the council after she retired, but that he planned to have current and former council employees put together a tribute to her. A knife-wielding man attacked a Mills-Westley in a supermarket, eventually cutting off her head and running away with it, government officials in Tenerife said Friday. The man entered a shopping center in the town of Arona, in the Cristianos area of Tenerife, and stole a knife from the supermarket before attacking the apparent stranger, a central government spokeswoman said. Shopping center security guards were alerted and chased the man, subduing him until police arrived. The man, whom national police in Tenerife identified as a Bulgarian, was apparently known in the shopping area, the government spokeswoman said. The British Foreign Office confirmed Friday that a British national had died in Tenerife. British officials there are in contact with Spanish authorities about the incident, the Foreign Office said.

"(CNN) -- A 1-year-old suffering from a deteriorating neurological condition whose family had been in an ongoing debate with a Canadian hospital about his care has been transferred to a children's hospital in the United States. Joseph Maraachli, widely known in the media as Baby Joseph, was airlifted on Sunday evening to SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, a Catholic hospital in St. Louis, where he is being examined by Dr. Robert Wilmott, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, hospital spokesman Bob Davidson said. A team of physicians will formulate a treatment plan and provide an update on what's next for the child in a news conference Tuesday morning, Davidson said. Baby Joseph, who was born in January 2010, had been in the care of the London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario, since October. His doctor, in court papers, said that ""all cranial nerve functions are now absent"" and there is no hope for recovery. He recommended that the infant's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die. The child's parents, Moe and Sana Maraachli, sought instead to have their son receive a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation so that he could be transferred home, where he would be cared for by his family. The child's Aunt, Samar Nadar, has said that in 2002 the Maraachli's daughter died at home with a tracheotomy after suffering a similar condition. In January a Canadian Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the hospital, saying it could remove the child's breathing tube without a replacement, along with a do-not-resuscitate order and recommendations on palliative care. The Maraachlis then been fighting to have their son relocated to a U.S hospital for a second opinion. The London hospital said it would not perform a tracheotomy because it is an invasive procedure typically recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. In a statement on the hospital's website, it says Baby Joseph's transfer on Sunday happened ""despite the strongest possible medical advice to the contrary from medical experts."" The Maraachli case gained the attention of pro-life groups including Priests for Life and the Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network, who organized prayer vigils and rallies in support of the family. The situation intensified in February when the hospital began receiving threats and increased security to protect its staff. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, flew to Ontario Sunday night to help with the transfer. He issued a news release saying: ""After around-the-clock negotiations, this really became a race against time."" Joseph ""needs to be in a hospital that cherishes life over the bottom line,"" he said.","The child has a deteriorating neurological condition .
His Canadian doctor and his parents disagreed on his treatment .
The case attracted the attention of pro-life groups ."
"(CNN) -- Alassane Ouattara aspired to be president of Ivory Coast for decades. Now, after four long months of post-election turmoil and the capture of his political rival, the job is indisputably his. ""Finally, we have reached the dawn of a new era of hope,"" Ouattara said in a televised address. But by even the most optimistic assessments, Ouattara faces a daunting task in forging a peaceful and stable path forward. Chief among his challenges, said longtime observers, will be to unite a severely divided nation and ensure justice for those who committed grave human rights violations in the nation's political vacuum. That includes people from his own camp who stand accused of heinous acts. Most of the blame for the bloodshed rests squarely on the shoulders of Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to cede power plunged Ivory Coast into crisis, said Jendayi Frazer of the Council on Foreign Relations. The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, is now poised to investigate alleged war crimes instigated by Gbagbo. Ouattara will have to delicately balance such a probe with reconciliation. After all, said expert Alex Vines, Ouattara did not win in a landslide. Gbagbo won 45.9 percent of the vote and as such, Ouattara will have to reach out to his rival's supporters, perhaps even welcome them into his government without jeopardizing justice, said Vines, head of the Africa program at the British think tank Chatham House. But even more significant may be the way Ouattara handles his own dirt. Though he emerged in the Western media as the good versus Gbagbo's evil, Ouattara, too, has been accused of having blood on his hands. Human Rights Watch published a scathing report Saturday about abuses perpetrated by pro-Ouattara forces on their offensive to Abidjan. People interviewed by the monitoring agency ""described how, in village after village, pro-Ouattara forces summarily executed and raped perceived Gbagbo supporters in their homes, as they worked in the fields, as they fled or as they tried to hide in the bush."" ""Ouattara should fulfill his public pledge to investigate and prosecute abuses by both sides if Côte d'Ivoire is to emerge from this horrific period,"" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. In the United States, Ouattara's critics questioned his right to rule. ""It is now clear, based on U.N. reports coming from Cote d'Ivoire, that mass killings have occurred at the hands of Alassane Ouattara,"" Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, said earlier this month. ""This calls into question his legitimacy to lead that country,"" said Inhofe, who has visited Ivory Coast nine times and made no secret of his support for Gbagbo. ""Ouattara is on a rampage, killing innocent civilians, and he must be stopped before this becomes another Rwanda."" Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson said Ouattara's moment in the spotlight could quickly dim without adequate investigations into the abuse allegations against forces loyal to him. ""Mr. Ouattara should also be investigated because of the evidence that his troops did commit rapes and abuse en route to Abidjan,"" said Robertson, a former president of the U.N. special court for Sierra Leone. Such a probe could answer questions about what amount of control Ouattara exerted over the forces fighting under his name and whether he deliberately failed to stop them, Roberston said. In his favor, Ouattara has been viewed for some time as a hard-working man, an honest politician who favors transparency. He hailed from northern lands dominated by Muslim immigrants who came to work in Ivory Coast and eventually grew into influential businessmen and traders. The U.S.-educated Ouattara quit his International Monetary Fund job to run for president in 2000 and might have met Gbagbo on the ballot then, except that he was marked as an outsider -- his mother was from Burkina Faso -- and barred from participating in the election. The pro-Gbagbo newspaper Notre Voie accused Ouattara of backing a failed 2002 coup against Gbagbo's government, which triggered the 2002 civil war. Ouattara's critics blame him for the deep split that Ivory Coast has yet to mend. Vines said the rebels who fought in the 2002 civil war, the Force Nouvelles, formed a large part of the pro-Ouattara forces fighting Gbagbo's troops in the latest crisis. The United Nations has repeatedly cited the armed group for breaking the arms embargo imposed on Ivory Coast and human rights groups have sounded alarms about its abuses. The moral high ground in Ivory Coast, said Vines, is that the election result is clear and in favor of Ouattara. ""After that it gets gray and in the last few weeks, it's gotten very opaque indeed,"" he said about the recent spate of killings, especially the massacre in the western town of Duekoue, where the International Committee of the Red Cross said 800 people were slaughtered. The United Nations blamed many of the deaths on Ouattara's forces. Ouattara, said Robertson, must conduct a swift inquiry into the allegations and punish the perpetrators. Otherwise, Robertson said, Ouattara will ""himself be vulnerable to prosecution in The Hague."" And the future of Ivory Coast will be more tenuous than ever.","The International Criminal Court is poised to investigate Laurent Gbagbo .
But human rights monitors accuse pro-Ouattara forces of atrocities as well .
They want Ouattara to conduct a probe into the crimes without delay .
Ensuring justice in Ivory Coast will be critical to its future, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- Wladimir Klitschko has told reporters that he is finally looking forward to silencing David Haye, when the two face each other for their eagerly-awaited heavyweight showdown in Hamburg on July 2. The pair gave their first press conference on Monday ahead of the fight, and 35-year-old Klitschko made it clear that he has had enough of the insults thrown at him by his British opponent. Klitschko, who holds the International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO) versions of the belt, said: ""All this hype and interest is great for the division. ""But there will come a time when the talking stops and we find out who is the real champion,"" added the Ukrainian, who has now recovered from an abdominal injury that has troubled him recently. ""The man has been promoting himself and insulting the Klitschko brothers in a disrespectful way -- but this fight is exciting for the division and I am thrilled it will happen. ""I still have to give a lot of respect to David Haye, he is a really exciting fighter, he is a really good puncher, he's very quick. ""It's not going to be an easy job for me, but I know what to expect and I know what to do. ""They will be 12 long rounds and I hope he won't give up or get knocked out. My plan is to hold him up until the final fight and then knock him out,"" added Klitschko. Meanwhile, Haye, who holds the World Boxing Association (WBA) version of the title, continued his onslaught on Klitschko, saying: ""I believe he is a fraud, down to the fact he wears shoulder pads into the ring and he only picks the guys who he knows he can beat. ""I am good at exposing frauds, as I showed in my last fight,"" added Haye, who beat ex-Olympic champion Audley Harrison inside three rounds last November.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein announced Wednesday he intends to indict Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman on charges of fraud, money laundering, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. Weinstein decided not to charge Liberman with bribery as police recommended due to lack of evidence, he said. A final decision on whether to indict Liberman is pending on a formal judicial hearing. Liberman is suspected of illicitly obtaining about $3 million through a number of shell companies. The alleged crimes date back to before Liberman became foreign minister in 2009. ""I have always operated according to the law and I have no reason to worry,"" Liberman said Wednesday in reaction to Weinstein's announcement. ""After 15 years I will finally have the chance to prove that I have always acted according to the law,"" he said. Liberman received the news of Weinstein's decision while attending a conference for his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, in Jerusalem. He is not expected to resign from his position before a final decision is made. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement saying Netanyahu ""hopes Liberman will prove his innocence.""

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II is due to visit Croke Park stadium in Dublin Wednesday on the second day of her landmark tour to Ireland. The visit to Croke Park is another significant symbolic gesture of reconciliation -- British troops opened fire on a crowd watching a Gaelic football match there in 1920, killing 14. On Wednesday morning the queen met the Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny and senior cabinet ministers at Government Buildings as part of her state tour, the first by a UK monarch since the country gained independence in 1921. Gerry O'Regan, editor of the Irish Independent, said: ""This is a triumph of really careful planning and shows a strong intent on both sides to make it work."" On Tuesday the queen laid a wreath at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin in a joint ceremony with Irish President Mary McAleese. The Garden of Remembrance honors those who fought for Irish freedom from British rule. During her stay, the queen will also visit the National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge and on Wednesday evening, accompanied by British Prime Minister David Cameron, the queen will attend a state banquet at Dublin Castle. The visit has prompted police to mount a major security operation amid threats of dissident republican violence. Ireland has spent $42 million on security for the visit, according to officials. On Tuesday scuffles between protesters and police broke out in central Dublin, 22 people were arrested. The Irish military Tuesday defused a bomb Tuesday morning on a bus headed to Dublin. The military had stopped a private bus in Maynooth, evacuated the passengers and found a ""viable device"" in the luggage compartment, a spokesman for the Irish national police said. The queen's visit is one that many in Ireland believed would never happen, and marks the reconciliation between two neighboring countries that once viewed each other with suspicion and hostility. Ireland's fight to free itself from its former imperial master is likely to form much of the narrative of the visit. There will be constant reminders of the violent past. The queen's plane touched down, for example, at Casement Aerodrome, a military airfield named after Roger Casement, who was executed for treason in 1916 for conspiring with the Germans. His fate was sealed when the queen's grandfather, George V, refused to commute his death sentence. The Irish War of Independence that the killing was a part of directly led to the partition of Ireland in 1921. The majority of the island gained independence, but six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK and largely Roman Catholic nationalists who want the North to be reunited with the rest of Ireland exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The ensuing three decades of violence between the Irish Republican Army and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border, and while the Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998, effectively ended the conflict, suspicions remain. It is for this reason that the queen's visit is more than symbolic. Under the terms of the accord, terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and political allies of both sides now work together in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. The change has been so rapid that, even as recently as the late 1990s, one journalist said he could never have imagined a state visit by the queen. Toby Harnden, who covered Ireland for the Daily Telegraph, said while some people on both sides still have their doubts over the visit -- for different reasons -- more significant is the peaceable language used in the debate. ""Some Catholics will see this as Britain cementing its claim over the Irish territory of the six counties of Northern Ireland,"" Harnden said. Meanwhile ""the Protestants will see the queen's visit as ratification of a state that they believe is constitutionally hostile to any British presence in Ireland. So on both sides there'll be qualms."" Gerry Adams, a pivotal figure in Northern Irish history as long-time leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, said the queen's visit was ""premature."" Compared with incendiary language he had used in the past, Adams' comment speaks volumes, Harnden said. For instance, ""when the queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was killed by the IRA in 1979, (Adams) said it was an execution that was fully justified."" ""When I was there the IRA cease-fire had collapsed, there was violence and killings, no surrender, no compromise. In those days there was no likelihood of the queen ever visiting.""

"(CNN) -- Jupp Heynckes ensured his job at Bayern Munich will be a little bit harder after ending his two-season stint at Bayer Leverkusen on a winning note on Saturday. Leverkusen needed a point in the final match of the Bundesliga season at Freiburg to clinch second place ahead of Bayern and condemn the defending champions to the qualifying rounds of the 2011-12 Champions League. The Bavarians kept up the pressure to the last, beating Stuttgart 2-1 under caretaker coach Andries Jonker, but Leverkusen secured automatic European qualification with a 1-0 victory. Freiburg, coached by Heynckes' imminent successor Robin Dutt, finished in ninth place after losing to a deflected goal just before halftime as Cedric Makiadi diverted Hanno Baltisch's header from Renato Augusto's corner into his own net. It was an eventful closing round as champions Borussia Dortmund sent Eintracht Frankfurt down to the second division with a 3-1 home win, while 2009 champions Wolfsburg escaped relegation by beating Hoffenheim 3-1. St. Pauli also went down as bottom club after losing 2-1 at fifth-placed Mainz, who had already qualified for the Europa League. Hannover will also be playing in Europe's second-tier competition next season, finishing two points clear of Mainz after a 3-1 win over sixth-placed Nuremberg. Borussia Monchengladbach face a relegation playoff against a second division side after drawing 1-1 draw at eighth-placed Hamburg. Dortmund clinched a first German league title since 2002 at the end of last month, but had to come from behind against Frankfurt to ensure a proper party in front of their home fans in a match featuring two missed penalties and a red card. Top scorer Lucas Barrios saw his 12th-minute spot-kick saved by visiting keeper Ralf Fahrmann, and Sebastian Rode gave Frankfurt hope with a header just after halftime. Lukasz Piszczek's backheel set up Barrios for a 68th-minute equalizer, then Marco Russ put the ball into his own net soon before things got even worse for Frankfurt when Marcel Titsch-Rivero was sent off less than a minute after coming on as a substitute. Brazilian defender Dede was given the chance to take the resulting penalty after coming on as a replacement in his farewell matched, but his 81st-minute effort was also saved. However, Barrios sealed victory with a late header from Robert Lewandowski's cross, being the Paraguay striker's 16th goal this season. Bayern Munich's Mario Gomez finished top of the Bundesliga scoring charts after adding his 28th this season at home to Stuttgart. The Germany striker put Bayern level in the 37th minute after being set up by Arjen Robben as he canceled out Shinji Okazaki's opener. Bastian Schweinsteiger headed the winner with 19 minutes to play from a cross by substitute Toni Kroos, while Gomez also hit the bar before being replaced as Bayern finished three points adrift of Leverkusen. Heynckes led Bayern to titles in 1988-89 and the following season, and was caretaker coach after Jurgen Klinsmann was sacked in April 2009. Wolfsburg stayed up despite Brazilian playmaker Diego walking out of the team hotel after being left out of the starting line-up by Felix Magath. Roberto Firmino put Hoffenheim ahead early in the second half, but two goals from Mario Mandzukic gave Wolfsburg the edge and then striker Grafite unwittingly deflected in a shot by teammate Sascha Riether. Magath's former club Schalke ended the season two points above Wolfsburg after losing 2-1 at Cologne despite a late goal from Raul. Schalke, who reached the semifinals of the Champions League this season, will play second division Duisburg in next Saturday's German Cup final. Cologne earlier announced that former Copenhagen coach Stale Solbakken will take charge next season. The Billy Goats had been under the interim control of director of sport Volker Finke, who will make way for the 43-year-old Norwegian after guiding the team to 10th place. Promoted Kaiserslautern finished a creditable seventh after a three-goal first-half blitz set up a 3-2 win over Werder Bremen.","Bayer Leverkusen's win means Bayern must play in Champions League qualifiers .

"(CNN) -- This year's Fuji Rock Festival in Japan could be the most difficult for Masahiro Hidaka. He's the festival's organizer who over 15 years has faced down typhoons and musicians' monstrous egos to successfully host the annual three day music festival in the picturesque mountains of western Japan. But with the aftermath of the March earthquake and tsunami still unfolding in the northeast of the country, Hidaka is looking for ways to mark the gravity of the situation while allowing the thousands who visit each year to unwind and enjoy themselves. ""I think it will be a very emotional time for my staff and the audience,"" he says. ""We watched, like everyone else, the whole thing on TV. It is very hard to put into words my feeling as I have many friends in the disaster region and it's my country. Nobody deserves such horror."" ""Jishuku"" (self-restraint) has been added to the collective somber mood across the county and like many businesses in Japan, public events and festivals have suffered as a result. Hundreds of local cultural events and festivities have been cancelled or postponed indefinitely in the few months following the disaster. The Kabuto Metal Festival and Punkspring music festival were called off and it was reported that Japan's biggest classical music concert, La Folle Jouree au Japon, saw a large number of its musicians pull out. While some have been cancelled out of respect for the suffering of those in the disaster-hit area, some have been affected by the apprehension of some to visit Japan in troubled times; tourism to Japan has been hit hard, with a drop of 50% in visitor numbers in March 2011 compared with 12 months earlier. Johnny ""Fingers"" Moylett, Hidaka's co-producer of Fuji Rock, says that none of the bands has pulled out of their event scheduled for the end of July because of fears surrounding the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. However he admitted that ticket sales over the past couple of months had been much slower than in previous years. Hidaka says he had to reassure many international bands that it would be safe for them to play at the festival, yet many of them responded really positively to the crisis with some joining the ""Benefit for Nippon"" charity concert that took place in London last month. In many ways Hidaka believes the festival will be more vital than ever this year. ""(It will be) the first major gathering and a time for release of all the terrible times and tension that has been winding up inside.""","Natural disaster and nuclear crisis has affected Japan's collective mood .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tensions mounted Tuesday when NATO helicopters flying in eastern Afghanistan fired across the border into Pakistan after being fired on twice, according to a NATO official. NATO's International Security Assistance Force later received reports that two Pakistani soldiers were wounded. Two coalition helicopters supporting operations at U.S. Forward Operating Base Tillman in Afghanistan were fired upon from the Pakistani side of the border, said the NATO official, who did not want to be identified because the information has not yet been released publicly. After being fired upon a second time, the helicopters returned fire, the official said. Tillman is a few kilometers from the Pakistan border. The NATO-led force issued a brief official statement saying the alliance is ""aware of the incident and is assessing it to determine what happened."" Pakistani officials confirmed that two soldiers were wounded. The Pakistani military said it has lodged a ""strong protest"" and called for a meeting of the two sides. A NATO spokeswoman offered little detail about the incident. ""We're aware of a cross-border incident. We're still assessing the situation,"" said Lt. Commander Kaye Sweetser, a spokeswoman for the coalition troops. Pakistani intelligence officials said the incident started when a NATO fighter jet entered Pakistani airspace near the border with Afghanistan. Pakistani troops began firing at the jet from the ground, said the officials who did not want to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The jet retreated and then returned, accompanied by helicopters, and fired on a military check post in a village in North Waziristan, the officials said. The incident comes at a time of increased tension between Pakistan and the United States. Pakistani officials have bristled over an unauthorized U.S. raid into Pakistan to kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan have also been a source of concern, as Islamabad says the strikes have killed civilians. The Pakistani parliament recently condemned the raid and adopted a resolution calling for a review of its counterterrorism cooperation agreement with the United States. The resolution also ordered the immediate end of drone attacks that targets militants in a tribal region of Pakistan near the Afghan border. U.S. Sen. John Kerry has been visiting Pakistan this week and said Pakistan on Tuesday will return the tail of a U.S. helicopter damaged during the bin Laden raid -- a move aimed at improving cooperation between the two nations. The helicopter crashed during the May 2 raid of the al Qaeda leader's compound. Navy SEALs were able to destroy much of it, but the tail remained largely intact. In photos of the wreckage, aviation experts said they saw several telltale signs of stealth technology. Kerry said Monday that the United States need not apologize to Pakistan for the raid but said it's important the countries find a way to heal their relationship.

"(CNN) -- Australian motorcyclist Casey Stoner claimed his second victory this season while chaos reigned on the track behind him at the French Grand Prix on Sunday. The 2007 world champion moved up to second place in the overall standings above Dani Pedrosa, who was taken to hospital with a broken collarbone after a collision with Marco Simoncelli. The Spaniard had won the third race this season last time out in Portugal after recovering from shoulder surgery, but his championship hopes suffered a blow after 17 of the 28 laps at Le Mans. Pedrosa was passed by Simoncelli but clipped the bike of his fellow Honda rider when he tried to retake second place. Stoner sets MotoGP pace at Le Mans . The Italian was later handed a drive-through penalty for an illegal move, relegating him to fifth place and denying the 24-year-old his first podium position. ""I leave here with a broken collarbone and he with a ride-through penalty, good for him! Yet again I come out worse off,"" Pedrosa told the MotoGP website. ""We only just recovered from the nightmare of the last operation and now I'm hurt again. It is very unfair, I don't deserve it. ""I was having a good race, the goal was to ensure another podium and I had it in my grasp. Now it counts for nothing. Simoncelli overtook me, I passed him back and I had the better line. He just came into me, releasing the brakes, and I could do nothing. "" That incident left seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi as Stoner's closest chaser, but he was beaten to second place by fellow Italian Andrea Dovizioso. It was still Rossi's best finish since leaving Yamaha for Ducati, but he trails former teammate Jorge Lorenzo by 31 points. World champion Lorenzo finished fifth to be 12 points clear of Stoner and 18 ahead of Pedrosa as he became the youngest rider to start in 150 grands prix in all classes. The 24-year-old Spaniard had a bad start to the day when he crashed in practice, injuring his finger and wrecking his bike. The race featured several casualties as home hope Randy de Puniet, Loris Capirossi and Cal Crutchlow crashed out -- as did the latter's Yamaha teammate Colin Edwards, but the veteran American returned to the track to finish 13th. Stoner, in his first season with Repsol Honda, triumphed by more than 14 seconds as he continued the dominance he showed in practice and qualifying to win for the first time at Le Mans. The 25-year-old won the opening race of the season in Qatar, but failed to finish in Jerez as Lorenzo triumphed on home soil, and was third in Portugal as Pedrosa led a Spanish 1-2.","Casey Stoner avoids mayhem behind him to run away with French MotoGP race .

"Miami (CNN) -- Two southern Florida imams accused of supporting the Pakistani Taliban appeared briefly in a Miami federal court Monday, before a judge pushed back the legal proceedings into next week so the suspects could sort out their legal representation. The two men -- Hafiz Khan and his son Izhar Khan -- were arrested Saturday in South Florida, the Justice Department said. Another of Hafiz Khan's sons, Irfan Khan, was arrested that same day in El Segundo, California. Later Monday, he likewise remained in federal custody after putting off entering a plea during his own initial court appearance at the Roybal Federal Building in Los Angeles. Three others in Pakistan also have been indicted: Khan's daughter Amina Khan, Khan's grandson Alam Zeb and Ali Rehman. All six defendants face a four-count indictment that alleges they conspired to provide material support to a conspiracy to kill, injure and kidnap people abroad. It also alleges that they provided support to the Pakistani Taliban. About a dozen representatives of the two imams' Florida mosques -- Flagler Mosque in Miami for Hafiz Khan, and Jamaat Al-Mu'mineen Mosque in Margate for his son Izhar -- attended Monday's court session to support the men and hear the accusations against them. ""He was their spiritual leader, so it is a shock, everyone is in shock,"" said Nezar Hamze, executive director of the south Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, of Hafiz Khan from the Miami court. The two were expected to be formally arraigned Monday, with the possibility of bail being set. But at the defendants' request, Magistrate Judge Barry Garber said that would instead happen on May 23. Izhar Khan, 24, had requested a public defender, but did not meet the court's financial requirements to do so. He asked for more time to find his own lawyer, a request that Garber granted. His father, 76-year-old Hafiz Khan, was represented by Khurrum Wahid, a Pompano Beach, Florida-based lawyer who has ""represented scores of individuals detained by the government since"" the September 11, 2001, attacks, according to his firm's website. Wahid told the magistrate judge he was temporarily representing Khan, and requested more time to assess the case. Afterward, Wahid said his primary concern was the imam's health, adding he hopes to get him home and out of the federal detention center at next week's session. He described Hafiz Khan -- who appeared frail Saturday, with white facial hair and thick glasses -- as in poor health because of a heart condition, high cholesterol and borderline diabetes, among other problems. ""My primary concern right now is getting him out,"" said Wahid. The attorney added that his client plans to ""challenge the evidence,"" if and when it is presented in court. ""At this stage, we don't have anything other than what is written on a piece of paper by the U.S. Attorney's office,"" Wahid said. In Los Angeles, meanwhile, Irfan Khan appeared before Magistrate Judge Paul Abrams clad in a tan sweater vest over a dress shirt. He briefly answered a series of questions before delaying entering a plea on the charge that he is facing. Abrams then continued the legal proceedings involving Irfan Khan to Thursday. The indictment and all six arrests were not linked to the May 2 killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, two U.S. officials said Saturday. The charges relate to alleged crimes committed between 2008 and 2010. Authorities said their investigation focused on leadership at the mosques. The indictment describes a number of occasions when Hafiz Khan transferred money to Pakistan. ""Khan solicited and distributed funds for the Pakistani Taliban, both personally and on behalf of others, and worked with the co-defendants and others to support the Pakistani Taliban's jihad,"" the indictment says. The court documents also state there were several conversations between Hafiz Khan and the other defendants in which Hafiz Khan called for attacks against the Pakistani government and asked whether money had been delivered to the Pakistani Taliban. Hafiz Khan also built a madrassa in Pakistan's Swat Valley that provided shelter for the terrorist group, the indictment states. The term ""madrassa"" traditionally refers to any Muslim school, but in recent years news stories about madrassas radicalizing Islamic students cast the word in a negative light. ""The main defendant Khan operated and controlled a madrassa to shelter members of the Pakistan Taliban and to train children to become military fighters for the Mujahedeen,"" U.S. Attorney Wilfredo A. Ferrer said. He said authorities are aware of several unindicted co-conspirators in the United States and Pakistan. The Pakistani Taliban represent a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, said Bill Roggio, military affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. Those fighters attack targets in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban, which is headquartered in Quetta, is different from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, Roggio said. On Monday, Hamze from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said it was ""too early to speculate"" on what will be proven in the upcoming legal proceedings. Regardless, he said it should not be seen as an indictment of Muslims in the United States. ""This is my community, we are peacefully in south Florida (and) we are all American,"" Hamze said from Miami. ""We love the United States.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Irfan Khan, a Florida limo driver accused of conspiring with his imam father and brother to funnel tens of thousands of dollars to the Pakistani Taliban, was denied bail Thursday in federal court. Khan, 37, was also ordered to be transferred to Miami, where the indictment against him originated. Khan resides in Miami but was arrested in El Segundo, California, over the weekend. His transfer to Miami has yet to be scheduled. Khan and four members of his family -- led by his father, an imam in south Florida -- are facing a four-count indictment charging them with providing financing and other material support to the Pakistani Taliban, which the U.S. government has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. A sixth person also is named in the indictment. In denying bail for Khan, U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Abrams said he ""reluctantly"" agreed with prosecutors that Khan is a flight risk and a danger to the community. Khan wore a white prison jumpsuit to court Thursday, and was intently whispering and looking over documents with his federal public defender, Jill Ginstling. Ginstling vehemently argued Khan is a man of simple means and a married father of two young children. He poses no threat to flee, she argued. She also strongly implied Irfan Khan was paying for the alleged sins of his father. ""They should not hold someone responsible for the things his father said,"" Ginstling told the court. She said her client sent money wires totaling less than $3,500 to Pakistan, implying this was hardly the means to support terrorism. But federal prosecutor Chris Grigg argued Khan and his alleged co-conspirators provided money that the Pakistani Taliban could have used to buy explosives and weapons for various attacks. ""It's the money given to groups like the Pakistani Taliban that allow them to conduct their operations,"" Grigg said. ""This is a group that is active now,"" Grigg added, even citing a CNN.com article about the Pakistani Taliban carrying out a revenge attack for the death of Osama bin Laden. Grigg also argued a network of family members in Florida and Pakistan could help him flee the country. Khan was arrested at an El Segundo hotel, and his lawyer said he was on a six-week business trip and was transitioning from being a limo and cab driver to the information technology business. Khan's father, Hafiz Khan, 76, of Miami and his brother, Izhar Khan, 24, of North Lauderdale, Florida, were arrested Saturday in south Florida. The three other people named in the indictment now reside in Pakistan: Amina Khan, who is the daughter of Hafiz Khan; her son, Alam Zeb; and Ali Rehman. They remain at large, authorities said. All six defendants are charged with a conspiracy to murder, maim and kidnap people overseas, as well as conspiring to provide material support to the Pakistani Taliban. Family patriarch Hafiz Khan, Rehman and Zeb are also charged with providing material support to the Pakistani Taliban. All the defendants are originally from Pakistan, prosecutors said. Hafiz Khan is the imam at the Miami Mosque, also known as the Flagler Mosque, in Miami. His son, Izhar Khan, is an imam at the Jamaat Al-Mumineen Mosque in Margate, Florida. The indictment does not charge the mosques with any wrongdoing, prosecutors said. The case isn't linked to the May 2 killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, two U.S. officials have said. The charges relate to alleged crimes committed between 2008 and 2010. The indictment describes a number of occasions when Hafiz Khan transferred money to Pakistan. Hafiz Khan ""solicited and distributed funds for the Pakistani Taliban, both personally and on behalf of others, and worked with the co-defendants and others to support the Pakistani Taliban's jihad,"" the indictment says. The court documents recount several conversations between Hafiz Khan and the other defendants in which Hafiz Khan allegedly called for attacks against the Pakistani government and asked whether money had been delivered to the Pakistani Taliban. Hafiz Khan is accused of building a madrassa in Pakistan's Swat Valley that provided shelter for members of the group, the indictment states. The term ""madrassa"" traditionally refers to any Muslim school, but in recent years news stories about madrassas radicalizing Islamic students cast the word in a negative light. Hafiz Khan operated and controlled a madrassa to shelter members of the Pakistani Taliban and ""to train children to become military fighters for the mujahedeen,"" U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer said last weekend. He said authorities are aware of several unindicted co-conspirators in the United States and Pakistan. The Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, according to Bill Roggio, a military affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. Those fighters attack targets in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban, which is headquartered in Quetta, is separate from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic emirate in Afghanistan. But both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, Roggio said.","Irfan Khan is accused of providing money to the Pakistani Taliban .

"(CNN) -- More than 8,000 people -- most of them women and children -- fled into Tunisia during the weekend to escape fighting between Libyan government troops and opposition forces, the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees said Tuesday. The refugees arriving in Dehiba, in southern Tunisia, are predominantly from ethnic Berber tribes that have long been persecuted by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, a spokesperson for the U.N. aid agency said. Nearly 40,000 Libyans have fled the country's western mountainous region in the past month as pro-Gadhafi and opposition forces have fought for control of the border crossing point, according to the U.N. UNHCR staff in Dehiba said the situation of the refugees was being made worse by a violent sandstorm that has battered the area. Hundreds of tents and two huge portable warehouses, set up in an effort to accommodate the exodus, were destroyed. Opposition forces continue to have control of the border crossing despite fighting that has spilled into Tunisian territory, the agency spokesperson said, adding that UNHCR will give tents to Tunisian authorities, which they can distribute to residents of Dehiba should they need to relocate farther from any further border skirmishes. Most of the Libyan refugees are arriving in Tunisia in tribal groups. Many are choosing to stay in the camps for a few days before moving on to stay with Tunisian families. UNHCR, and partners, including the World Food Programme and other agencies, are planning to distribute food and relief items to the refugees and their host families. The situation in Libya has become increasingly precarious for civilians and migrant workers, who have been caught in the crossfire of the conflict that has killed tens of thousands and left thousands more wounded since it began two months ago. NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians. More than 550,000 people, mostly migrant workers, have fled Libya for neighboring countries. It has been difficult to track the exact number of Libyans who have fled, because few have claimed asylum, UNHCR has said. The agency said that there have been more than 8,000 ""irregular arrivals"" on Italian territory from Libya since March 26. Another 1,132 people have arrived in Malta on boats from Libya since mid-April.","U.N. agency: More than 8,000 Libyans fled into southern Tunisia last weekend .

"(CNN) -- Five years ago, to show her gratitude for U.S. troops serving overseas, teenager Kaylee Radzyminski started sending them donated CDs and DVDs. The project grew into her nonprofit, Tunes 4 the Troops, and she was recognized as a CNN Hero in 2008. At the time, she and her team had collected and shipped 200,000 discs. This week, Tunes 4 the Troops celebrated a major milestone when it prepared its 1 millionth disc for shipment. Radzyminski, now 19 and on an Army ROTC scholarship at Tennessee Tech University, spoke with CNN's Danielle Berger about reaching this goal. Danielle Berger: Did you do anything special to mark this milestone? Kaylee Radzyminski: We had a very special guest. One of the guitarists from Lynyrd Skynyrd (Mark Matejka) showed up at our packing party to actually pack the 1 millionth CD. The CD was actually a Lynyrd Skynyrd CD, and he signed it to the troops. Berger: Where will these discs be headed? Radzyminski: These CDs and DVDs will be going places all over the world. I know for a fact that we have boxes going to the Horn of Africa, which many people don't know (that) we do have troops there. They'll be going to Iraq and Afghanistan. Some of the boxes are going to military hospitals in Germany. These CDs are going to all four military branches. They're going to everybody, because they all serve our country and are all greatly appreciated. Berger: Why was it important to you to continue this work when you went on to college? Radzyminski: With all the hard work that I had put in, I wanted to make sure it would continue after graduation from high school. The troops have always had a special place in my heart. I'd do anything for them ... because they sacrifice so much. Even when I graduate (college), there will still be troops serving overseas. When I graduate, I'll be one of them. Berger: Tunes 4 the Troops is now based at Tennessee Tech. How does it work? Radzyminski: Tunes 4 the Troops is part of the Service Learning Center here at the university, so there's basically a staff and student workers who volunteer for community service hours that are able to work on Tunes 4 the Troops. So this way, Tunes 4 the Troops will be able to continue even once I graduate. It's a wonderful feeling. I'm very grateful for Tennessee Tech University. If I could do Tunes 4 the Troops all over again, there's absolutely nothing I would change, because it has made a difference in so many people's lives. Berger: Around the holidays last year, Tunes 4 the Troops was included in a story on CNN.com about ways people could donate to charities without giving money. Did you see much response? Radzyminski: After the CNN article on the 12 ways of giving, we got an increase in donations that helped us reach our 1 million goal. That was definitely one of the big things that helped us knock six months off our goal of collecting 1 million CDs and DVDs. (And) we got some local artists and major record labels to donate as well. It got the word out there that we are still doing this. To donate to Tunes 4 the Troops, visit its website at www.tunes4thetroops.org.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Heavy fighting continued Tuesday in Yopougon between forces loyal to President Alassane Ouattara and militiamen loyal to former President Laurent Gbagbo even as he was said to have accepted his loss of power. The military operation was launched Monday by pro-Ouattara forces to crush the last pocket of resistance remaining after the militias turned down a call from Ouattara to disarm or face force. The new violence erupted after a delegation of mediators led by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan completed a two-day visit to Ivory Coast intended to encourage reconciliation and healing. Annan was joined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland. Their visit followed post-election violence that claimed the lives of hundreds of people and led nearly a million others to flee the city of Abidjan, according to aid groups. ""I was locked into my house for the past two weeks with no food to eat,"" said Sery Gregoire, a resident of Yopougon. ""But this morning, we were able to escape."" Mathieu Mimi was not so lucky. ""We are trapped in guerilla warfare,"" he said Tuesday. ""The militiamen are mobile and melt into the populations. It is hard to catch them."" The mediators visited Gbagbo, who remains under house arrest in the country's north. Annan said they were pleased to hear Gbagbo say that he wants the country to return to normal as soon as possible. ""He seems to have accepted that Ouattara is the new president,"" Annan said. ""We are encouraged by the president's willingness, and that of many of the people we met, to move forward in a spirit of reconciliation, but much of society is still polarized."" The mediators asked the government to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Gbagbo, his wife and all other detainees, as soon as possible.","Gbagbo said to have accepted his loss of power .

"(CNN) -- The United States is slamming the Sudanese president's assertion that his government would not recognize the new state of South Sudan if it claims the disputed oil-rich region of Abyei. South Sudan voted to split from the north and is scheduled to declare its independence in July. In a speech broadcast on state television Wednesday, President Omar al-Bashir said the disputed region of Abyei belongs to the north. ""Abyei is a part of the north and will remain a part of the north,"" he said, according to the Sudan News Agency. A top U.S. envoy criticized the remarks. ""Those comments are not helpful at all, and they only serve to inflame and heighten tensions,"" said Johnnie Carson, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs. ""It is important that both sides ... focus intensely on trying to resolve the key issues that have not been completed under the CPA. Abyei is one of them."" The CPA refers to a comprehensive peace agreement reached in 2005 that allowed South Sudan to vote in a referendum on whether to split from the north. The referendum was part of an agreement that ended two decades of violence between the north and oil-rich south. The unrest led to the deaths of 2 million people, many from starvation. South Sudan voters overwhelmingly approved the split in January. Al-Bashir has said he will honor the results, though analysts are concerned he might not keep his word. During his news conference with reporters Thursday, Carson urged al-Bashir and President of South Sudan Salva Kiir to meet and resolve outstanding issues before July. Journalist Isma'il Kushkush contributed to this report.","Oil-rich region of Abyei has been a flashpoint between the north and the south .

"(CNN) -- Police have arrested Scotland international striker Garry O'Connor on suspicion of possessing cocaine, according to the UK Press Association. The striker, who is currently without a club, has recently been training with Glasgow side Celtic and has played for Birmingham City in the English Premier League and Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia. He was allegedly caught with the Class A drug in the early hours of Saturday morning in the Scottish capital Edinburgh. O'Connor, who is from Edinburgh, was reportedly detained by police but released without charge pending further enquiries. After being released by Barnsley, who play in the second tier of English football, O'Connor has been training with Neil Lennon's Celtic, who narrowly missed out on the Scottish title to city rivals Rangers on Sunday. He has 16 Scotland caps. The UK Press Association also reported that two players from Edinburgh club Hearts were allegedly caught with an illegal substance. It said Ian Black, 26, and Robert Ogleby, 19, had been detained on suspicion of possessing a Class A drug and later released. A spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders Police said: ""We had two people detained, both were cautioned and charged.""","Scotland international Garry O'Connor arrested on suspicion of possessing cocaine .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the United States prepares to take some troops out of Afghanistan this July, an ambitious program to persuade Afghanistan insurgents to leave the fight has managed so far to attract only 1,700 converts over the past 10 months, according to a general leading the ""reintegration"" effort. But the killing of Osama bin Laden may convince more to turn, the general says. The United States and its allies have contributed $141 million to the program of amnesty and reintegration. And estimates are that 20,000 to 25,000 fighters remain in the field, despite efforts to persuade both Taliban leaders and foot soldiers to cross over. ""It is gaining increasing authenticity. People know they can step out of the fight,"" British Maj. Gen. Phil Jones said Thursday in a video link from Afghanistan to the Pentagon. He heads up the allied reintegration effort for the International Security  Assistance Force (ISAF). Jones said Afghanis have talks underway with 40 to 45 Taliban and insurgent groups, representing maybe a total of 2,000 additional fighters. He said there had been new interest after U.S. commandos killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan early this month. ""We were talking to some officers from the (Afghanistan) National Directorate of Security this morning and they were quite clear that that the expressions of interest of low level and mid level groups to join the program has picked up considerably over the last couple of weeks."" Jones said. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said soon after the raid that bin Laden's death opens the door to Taliban parting ways with al Qaeda. ""If that could happen at the same time we're keeping military pressure on the Taliban, keep them from taking back what you guys seized from them, expand the security bubble, you may actually next winter have the potential for reconciliation talks that are ... meaningful in terms of going forward, because one of the red lines for both us and the Afghan government (is) the Taliban disavowing any role with al Qaeda,"" Gates told Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina on May 12. Potential recruits to the reintegration program are interviewed, photographed and fingerprinted, and they can be sheltered in safe houses and receive a stipend before returning to their villages. But Jones admitted problems with the program. ""Inevitably if you start with a paper document and you have to build this airplane as you fly it, so to speak, then you are going to have challenges meeting demands."" For some fighters, leaving the battlefield can be an impossible step. ""There still is a sense among a lot of the fighters that this smacks too much of surrender and their honor and dignity as fighting men ... can't quite take it as yet,"" Jones said. ""There is still that psychology playing out there."" Another problem is what Jones described as ""the predatory reach"" of insurgents who cross the border from Afghanistan to punish and kill those they see as disloyal. And he denied problems with fighters taking refuge in the program, only to return to the insurgency. ""Thus far the people who have come -- the 17 hundred who have come in recent months -- have shown no signs of recidivism yet. There is no sense they are coming in to wait out the fighting season and go back,"" Jones said. In the long term, success of reintegration will depend on overall military and political momentum in the country. There are no certainties in Afghanistan -- that is one of the things we have learned over the past 10 years,"" Jones said, predicting a tough fighting-season in coming months. ""At its heart this is a very human process. It requires people on both sides of the divide to make really courageous and life-changing decisions.""","""People know they can step out of the fight,"" says a British general .
About 1,700 insurgents have entered the reintegration program, he says .

"(CNN) -- A prominent Syrian opposition figure was arrested in a suburb of Damascus on Friday, according to witnesses and his wife, and protests sweeping across the country left at least 21 civilians and 10 security officers dead. Riad Seif, a one-time Syrian lawmaker once said to have the appeal and charisma of South African statesman and former freedom fighter Nelson Mandela, was arrested during demonstrations close to the Al Hasan mosque in Maydan, a suburb of the capital. This comes as government troops have been battling pro-reform protesters across the country over the past month and a half, and clashes between security forces and protesters have intensified on Friday after weekly Muslim prayers. The tenacious demonstrations and the fierce government crackdown has garnered widespread international attention from many nations, the European Union and the United Nations. The White House press secretary Friday condemned the Syrian government's use of violence and mass arrests and saluted ""the courage of Syrian protesters for insisting on their right to express themselves and we regret the loss of life on all sides."" In a statement, the press secretary's office made reference to recent sanctions against top members and elements of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad responsible for overseeing the recent violent crackdown against protesters. Human rights group Amnesty International says more than 500 people have been killed during the clashes and thousands more were rounded up for questioning. Seif's wife, Pelican Mourad, told CNN: ""His nephew witnessed Riad being arrested among tens of other protesters and taken in a bus."" Mourad said her husband was released from prison only last August. He had been arrested in January 2008 for convening a meeting of what was called the ""Damascus Declaration,"" a pro-democracy group. Seif was a member of the Syrian Parliament in the 1990s before being detained in 2001, when he organized a seminar that called for political reforms and democratic elections. He also was stripped of his parliamentary immunity. It was the first of many times over the following decade that he was held. A U.S. diplomatic cable written in 2006 suggested that Seif could become a rallying figure for the opposition. The cable, written at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, was obtained by WikiLeaks. It said the regime regarded Seif ""as a potential Mandela-type figure on the Syrian political scene."" The cable suggested that the government was scrambling to minimize his influence and split the fledgling opposition movement. After his arrest Friday, his wife said she is very worried for his health. ""Riad is sick with cancer for which he needs a daily medicine,"" she said. She added that she was trying to find out which branch of the security forces had detained him so she could deliver his medication. Seif has been battling prostate cancer for several years. In 2007, the U.S. State Department called on the Syrian government to allow Seif to leave the country so that he could receive urgent medical treatment. Demonstrations broke out across many provinces and cities in Syria, with security forces relying heavily on the army and the regime's guard to disperse demonstrations. A human rights activist told CNN at least 21 civilians died in two Syrian cities when security forces opened fire on civilians Friday. At least 15 people were killed in Homs and six others were killed in Hama, according to Ammar Qurabi, chairman of the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. Ten Syrian soldiers and policemen were killed in Homs by ""armed terrorist groups,"" according to state-run news agency SANA. Some members of the groups were killed as well, SANA said Friday. State TV reported that about 50 people took part in ""acts of hooliganism"" in Damascus. They blocked roads, threw stones and started fires, the report said. In the Damascus suburb of Barzah, army tanks are present and the western city of Banias is surrounded by tanks and army presence is heavy. In Jableh, security forces opened fire and there have been reports of injuries. In Tal, there are reports of demonstrators taking fire from security but there have been no reports of casualties. State TV reported that the Syrian military began pulling out of Daraa on Thursday after a mission to ""restore security and calm,"" but an activist told CNN that the troops still remain in the city. In the past seven days alone says 3,000 people have been arrested. So many people were arrested that the central stadium in Daraa has been transformed into a makeshift prison by the army and Syrian security forces. A European Union official who doesn't want to be named told CNN that the EU has agreed to impose sanctions on 13 Syrian officials involved in the regime's crackdown on protesters. The sanctions include asset freeze and travel ban, and will be enforced early next week said the official. President Bashar al-Assad is not on the list, the official said, ""but we keep the list under constant review and we can always add names if necessary."" Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague, who said sanctions are against 14 individuals, said the EU ""is sending a clear message that we will act against those who brutalize peaceful protesters and seek to repress their legitimate aspirations for reform."" U.N. officials said on Friday a U.N. humanitarian assessment team will enter Syria in the next few days, with the flashpoint city of Daraa as a destination. Humanitarian agencies Friday brought two truckloads of food, baby milk and medical supplies to Daraa residents, hard-hit by the government's security clampdown. A 15-member team from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies entered the city. CNN has not been granted access into Syria and is unable to independently verify witness accounts. But CNN has spoken with witnesses, some of whom have also reported what they see via social networking sites and have posted homemade videos. Reports also have been compiled by human rights organizations. CNN's Rima Maktabi and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","NEW: White House press secretary condemns Syrian government .

"(CNN) -- A judge in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday sentenced an American to one month in jail for being in possession of police handcuffs, his lawyer said. Adam Foster, 30, of Burdett, New York, was taken into custody at the conclusion of the hearing in Dubai to begin serving his sentence, his lawyer, Yousuf Khalifa Hammad, told CNN. Foster had been detained for more than two months in the UAE on charges of stealing police handcuffs, an allegation he vehemently denied and said he only confessed to after being tortured. ""I can't say he was happy. But he didn't show any (anger). He accepted the judgment,"" Hammad said. The judge's ruling brings to an end a case that was the focal point of a grassroots writing campaign organized via Facebook. Nearly 2,000 people wrote letters to the UAE's ambassador to the United States on Foster's behalf, demanding his release. ""Thanks to everyone that who has supported me during all of this,"" Foster wrote in a brief message late Wednesday on Facebook. ""I can't stress enough how much that means to me. Court is in less than 12 hours.. not going to get much sleep tonight."" Foster faced up to seven years in prison on charges of theft of government property, possession of police paraphernalia and theft at night. Officials in the UAE did not responded to multiple requests by CNN for comment. Foster has been given credit for four days served during his initial detention and could have an additional seven days shaved off his sentence for good behavior, Hammad said. The U.S. State Department has confirmed that Foster has been detained since February 26. American consular officers met him on February 28 before UAE authorities released him on bail March 1. Investigators claim Foster stole a pair of official police handcuffs during questioning in an unrelated matter at a Dubai police station the night before he was due to leave the city, according to his attorney, Hammad. Foster has said it was a coincidence, saying he was brought in for questioning because he was in possession of a bottle of Korean rice wine -- a parting gift from colleagues. He was released without charges. Foster said he found the handcuffs a day earlier on the ground at a mall parking lot, about a mile and half from the police station where he was questioned. ""I was thinking 'souvenir,'"" Foster told CNN last week. ""They were lying on the ground. So I picked them up."" Foster, who was on his way home after a six-week stint as a contractor for Dubai Energy Water Authority, was arrested after authorities found the handcuffs in his luggage during a routine security screening at the Dubai airport. After hours of maintaining his innocence during police questioning, he was beaten and forced to confess, Foster said. He claims he was told to take off his shoes and socks, and handcuffed to a chair while one of two officers used a coil to whip the bottom of his feet. He also said he was punched in the face. Foster said he then signed a confession written in Arabic. Foster said he recanted his confession after he was released from jail. Nearly 2,000 people appealed to Yousef al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, and Jeffrey D. Feltman of the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to intervene on Foster's behalf. ""Thinking of you and praying for strength for you and your family!"" wrote Facebook user Christin Cherkis Bresett. Hundreds of others have posted messages of support. Last year, UAE authorities detained Nicholas Moody of Nevada for more than three months on charges of possessing weapons accessories -- parts that could accompany a gun, though no firearm itself. Moody was arrested during an 18-hour layover in Abu Dhabi while heading back from Iraq. A judge later dismissed the charges.","NEW: Adam Foster was taken into custody in court to immediately begin serving sentence .

"(CNN) -- Ryder Cup captains past and present joined family and friends of golfing legend Severiano Ballesteros Wednesday for the funeral in his hometown parish church in the northern Spanish village of Pedrena. The 2012 European Captain Jose Maria Olazabal, and past European Ryder Cup captains Nick Faldo, Bernard Gallacher, Colin Montgomerie, Sam Torrance and Ian Woosnam, attended to pay their last respects to Ballesteros, a European Tour spokesman said. Ballesteros died Saturday from complications related to a brain tumor, his website said. He was 54. The European Tour website said all of Spain's 422 golf clubs will observe a minute's silence, while the flag sticks at the Pro-Am of the Iberdrola Open in Majorca will have black ribbons attached. A procession from Ballesteros' home to the nearby village church was led by a bagpiper. The golfer's three children came just behind, carrying an urn with his ashes. Ballesteros' website said someone also carried a three iron, the club he used when he started playing golf as a child. Crowds gathered outside the small San Pedro de Pedrena church to watch the funeral on big-screen televisions. Ballesteros won a record 50 tournaments on the European Tour before retiring in 2007. A three-time British Open champion and two-time Masters champion, Ballesteros was often credited for transforming European golf. Ballesteros first made his name as a 19-year old in 1976 when he finished second at the British Open -- one of golf's four major tournaments. That year he also went on to win the European Tour's money list for the first of six times. His triumph at the 1979 British Open made him the youngest winner of the event that century and the first non-British European to do so since 1907. He was twice a victor at the Masters in Augusta. As well as his success in stroke play tournaments, Ballesteros was also a mighty competitor in the match play format, winning the world title five times. He helped beat the United States in the 1985 Ryder Cup to begin two decades of dominance and also led his team to victory in Valderrama, Spain, in 1997 -- the first year that the teams event was hosted by Europe outside of Britain and Ireland. Ballesteros was diagnosed with a brain tumor after losing consciousness at Madrid Airport on October 5, 2008. He underwent surgery. In June 2009, he established the Seve Ballesteros Foundation to fight cancer. The Roman Catholic funeral mass was officiated by three local parish priests. ""Seve stated that he wanted to be treated like any other neighbour during the ceremony,"" the family website stated. After the funeral, his ashes were carried from the church back the family estate and placed next to a magnolia tree, Ballesteros' website said. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","The funeral was held in Ballesteros' hometown church .

"(CNN) -- The main airport in St. Louis is expected to operate a full flight schedule Tuesday, less than four days after a powerful tornado tore through the facility, airport officials said. But restoration efforts are far from over at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, where the Friday night storm shattered windows and ripped off part of a roof. ""It obviously just took a couple of minutes for the damage to occur,"" Airport Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It will take weeks, maybe a couple of months, to clean up all of it."" Still, Hamm-Niebruegge said efforts to get the facility up and running again have been ""miraculous.""

American and Cape Air were among the hardest hit after the storm, which devastated the airport's C concourse. The tornado damaged 750 homes near the airport, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said. And preliminary National Weather Service estimates released Saturday show the tornado packed winds between 111 and 165 miles per hour when it hit the airport. There were no fatalities reported -- a fact that Nixon characterized as ""absolutely amazing."" Tornado cripples St. Louis airport . At the airport, Hamm-Niebruegge said the facility's design -- and the way people responded to warnings -- played a key role. ""It is a historic building, and it's built very, very well. I think that had a part to do with it, but we also had very early warnings,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Federal officials are investigating a ""potential conflict"" between two planes at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, which happened shortly after Vice President Joe Biden's plane landed. ""It has nothing to do with Biden's plane,"" a Federal Aviation Administration official said. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board will look into the incident Monday morning between an ExpressJet plane taking off from one runway, while a SkyWest jet was preparing to land on an intersecting airstrip, an official told CNN Homeland Security correspondent Jeanne Meserve. The SkyWest aircraft, which was coming in behind the other jet, was ordered to circle around the airport after an air traffic controller recognized the potential conflict, the official said. It made an otherwise normal landing. The ExpressJet takeoff was not altered. The flights were being handled by different air traffic controllers, according to the official, who said there was ""no operational error"" -- a term used when flights get too close to each other. The official did not say how close the planes were. The incident took place shortly after Biden's plane landed at the airport for the inauguration of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.","The incident took place shortly after Vice President Joe Biden's plane landed .

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board hopes air traffic controllers may soon benefit from long-standing research into worker fatigue by implementing strategies that include intentional sleeping on the job, the use of caffeine and other methods shown by science to deal with the overnight shift. ""A controlled nap can boost performance significantly,"" said NTSB board member Mark Rosekind at a briefing with reporters Monday at agency headquarters. Citing a 1995 study from NASA that has been backed by other research, he said, ""A 26-minute nap improved performance 34% and alertness 54%."" The study prompted an advisory that has been adopted by some international air carriers to keep pilots more alert in the cockpit. The measures were not moved forward by the Federal Aviation Administration. Congressional lawmakers may soon consider legislation reauthorizing the FAA that includes provisions addressing the problem of fatigue. The NTSB's recommendations Monday followed a listening tour of air traffic controllers around the country. The board's advice is issued to federal and other agencies. Inside an air traffic controller's life . Referring to a variety of transportation workers who unintentionally fall asleep on the job, the NTSB official said, ""We have many circumstances of documented, uncontrolled spontaneous sleep episodes,"" including incidents among air traffic control, long-haul trucking and railroads. According to the research, ""A short nap can boost performance, a long nap can make you groggy,"" Rosekind explained, saying the tactic of catching a few winks is but one element in a comprehensive plan. Although U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood directed the FAA to increase overnight staffing in air traffic control towers in response to unplanned sleeping on the job, Rosekind says that alone won't solve the problem of fatigued controllers. What's going on with air traffic controllers? ""If you don't have a fatigue management plan, and you just throw more people at it, then you've got more tired people on,"" he said. ""However many people you throw at the problem, you're still gonna have the fatigue risk."" The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also hopes the FAA will implement scientifically validated improvements to fight fatigue in the control tower. In a written statement, NACTA President Paul Rinaldi said, ""There is nothing groundbreaking about these recommendations. They are common-sense solutions to a problem NATCA and fatigue experts have consistently raised for years while past administrations turned a blind eye."" Rosekind says the NTSB identified the problem of fatigue among air traffic controllers 30 years ago, but only within the past 15 years or so has the research revealed what fights the problem. He used the example of sleepy drivers who turn up the radio and roll down a window to try to stay awake on the road. ""They only work for 10 minutes or so,"" he said, saying the research suggests greater benefits from pulling over for a short nap. ""Napping, caffeine, light physical activity, light levels, engagement -- social engagement -- can work,"" Rosekind said. And addressing the economic issues of improved staffing and the cost of scheduling people more in line with their sleep clocks, Rosekind said, ""Most people focus on the cost of the fatigue risk when an accident happens. ""What people don't quantify is what they're losing in productivity and performance before that,"" he added.","""Controlled napping"" may help those on the overnight shift stay awake .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona took a big step towards setting up a semifinal showdown with Spanish rivals Real Madrid by beating Shakhtar Donetsk 5-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday. The Ukrainian champions are unbeaten at home in more than two years ahead of next week's return leg, but the 2009 titleholders took control of the quarterfinal with a typically dominant display in the Catalan capital to match Real's four-goal demolition of Tottenham on Tuesday. Andres Iniesta, playing further forward than his usual midfield role, settled any signs of nerves for the home fans inside two minutes when he pounced to score after Lionel Messi's intended pass to strike partner David Villa was deflected into the 2010 World Cup match-winner's path. The Spain star then set up Daniel Alves for the second goal in the 34th minute with a clever pass over the defense that the Brazilian fullback pushed wide of goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov and flicked into the net with the outside of his right foot. Real Madrid overpower 10-man Tottenham . Alves turned provider eight minutes after halftime with a low corner that allowed central defender Gerard Pique to fire in a deflected shot after pulling back to lose his marker. It was Pique's second goal in as many matches, having volleyed the winner from Alves' flicked-on corner against Villarreal on Saturday that put Barca eight points clear of Real in the La Liga title race. Shakhtar reduced the deficit in the 59th minute when defender Yaroslav Rakitskiy stole in at the near post to put Darijo Srna's freekick past goalkeeper Victor Valdes with his knee. But Pep Guardiola's team responded within 60 seconds as top scorer Messi surged towards the penalty area and teed up Seydou Keita, who smashed a superb left-foot shot into the top corner of the net. Mourinho record falls -- but will it ever be beaten? Brazilian striker Luiz Adriano almost made it 4-2 with nine minutes to play but his shot from a tight angle hit the post and bounced safely into the arms of a relieved Valdes. Messi had the ball in the net soon after, but his provider Pedro -- who made his return from injury as a 70th-minute replacement for Villa -- was ruled to be offside. However, the fifth goal came soon after when Alves made his way into the box and provided a perfect low cross for midfielder Xavi -- another player returning from injury -- to steal in unmarked and sidefoot into the net.","Barcelona crush Shakhtar Donetsk 5-1 in home leg of European quarterfinal .

"(CNET)  -- In an attempt to move beyond drab typography on the Web, Google on Wednesday released 18 freely usable fonts and an open-source tool designed to smooth over browser issues in displaying downloaded fonts. A number of Web designers -- if not all readers -- are excited that newer browsers support downloadable fonts so sites can use more than the handful that it's safe to assume are installed already on people's computers. For every eyeball-searing grunge font and blood-pressure-raising instance of Comic Sans, there's a tasteful use of an artful logo or distinctive text. But font licensing rules mean a Web designer can't necessarily upload any old font for a site. This is where Google's move, announced at its Google I/O conference, comes in. The company released 18 fonts and also announced an interface that lets Web sites use them. ""Google has been working with a number of talented font designers to produce a varied collection of high quality open source fonts for the Google Font Directory,"" said Raph Levien and David Kuettel of the Google Font API team in a blog post. ""With the Google Font API, using these fonts on your web page is almost as easy as using the standard set of so-called ""web-safe"" fonts that come installed on most computers."" The way to Web fonts was paved with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) formatting standard and more recently the Web Open Font Format technology that helped encourage Web typography support from traditional font licensing companies. But even with those foundations, there are copyright concerns that might put off Web developers. Google's fonts are free of copyright restrictions, though. ""Since all the fonts are open source, you can use them any way you like. We also have a separate project hosted on Google Code for downloading the original font files. Since they're open source, they can be used for just about any purpose, including for print,"" the Google font team members said. In addition, Google announced an open-source project called WebFont Loader to supply Web developers with code to deal with differences in how browsers handle downloaded Web fonts. The software, a collaboration with Small Batch's TypeKit project, includes JavaScript code to control how Web pages display types for a uniform experience across different browsers, Google said.","Newer browsers support downloadable fonts so sites can use more .

"CLEVELAND, Tennessee (CNN)  -- At 14, while attending the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet camp in Florida, Kaylee Marie Radzyminski asked one question to troops returning from overseas military service. Their simple answer spurred the small-town teen into action. Kaylee Marie Radzyminski, center in black shirt, spends her Saturdays sorting CDs and DVDs for troops overseas. ""I asked, 'What was the number one thing they missed?' "" recalls Radzyminski. ""The first thing was, of course, their families. But second to that was entertainment."" They described limited access to Internet and satellite service, with some soldiers sharing just a few DVDs or CDs with an entire unit. So Radzyminski returned home and gathered her CDs and DVDs to send to the troops. What started as an individual project at home is now 16-year-old Radzyminski's nationwide nonprofit, Tunes 4 the Troops. Since 2005, she and volunteers have organized the collection and delivery of more than 200,000 CDs and DVDs to deployed service members around the world. ""My mission is not about supporting or opposing the war, it's about supporting the troops,"" says Radzyminski, whose own family has a military background. ""They sacrifice so much for us, why can't I do a little bit to give back to them?"" Reaching out to friends, classmates and community members for donated discs of all kinds, Radzyminski's own community joined her cause. She made disc donations easy by placing Tunes 4 the Troops collection boxes at football games, churches, neighborhood events, and community centers. Her own Cleveland High School helped out by setting up an account for the school's management of financial donations -- for disc purchases, packing supplies, and shipping costs. ""It first started with my collection, then my friends chipped in with their music and movies, and it just spread and spread through my community -- and now, nationwide,"" says Radzyminski. ""It's great to see the amount of people that care."" When she receives a CD or DVD, Radzyminski first sends a hand-written ""thank you"" to the donor. Then she separates all discs into genres and combs through them to ensure there is no explicit, burned or copied material. Each disc to be sent is branded with a Tunes 4 the Troops sticker, which allows a soldier who has never heard of her organization to request more items. ""That way, if they get sent to a unit, and then that unit gives it to another unit, that unit can always request a box,"" explains Radzyminski. Watch Radzyminski explain the way she and volunteers support troops overseas » . Each Saturday, the teen tapes, wraps and labels boxes before spending about two hours at the post office. Radzyminski originally stored donations and materials in her home, but in 2006, her local Home Depot donated a small shed for Tunes 4 the Troops operations. Today, the organization has about 200 satellite locations across the United States and has collected more than $3 million worth of donations. They also hold yearly Outback Steakhouse fundraisers, which have grossed close to $5,000 for each of the past two years.

But she says her own sacrifices pale in comparison to those made by thousands of American soldiers everyday. Watch soldiers overseas describe the impact Tunes 4 the Troops has had on them » . ""I love what I do because it's not just affecting me, it's affecting thousands of other people,"" she says. ""To have such a large outcome of happy soldiers is so worth it."" Radzyminski's goal?

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona and Real Madrid lock horns Saturday in the first of four 'El Clasico' showdowns in 18 days which will define their respective campaigns in Spain and the Champions League. Barcelona go into the La Liga match at the Santiago Bernabeu with an eight-point lead in the standings and with only seven games remaining. But the motivation for Jose Mourinho's Real will be to disrupt their arch-rival's serene progress to the Spanish title ahead of further matches in the final of the Copa del Rey and then the two-legged Champions League semifinal. Victory for Barca will complete a league double over Real, who they routed 5-0 earlier in the season in the Nou Camp, and all but wrap up the title. It was the heaviest defeat of Mourinho's stellar managerial career and clearly still smarts as he refused to answer questions at his pre-match press conference Friday and offered up his assistant Aitor Karanka to the anger of journalists. ""Every time he talks, it's blown out of context,"" Karanka told the reporters, who exited in droves when it became clear Mourinho had snubbed them and would not answer their questions. ""He prefers being relaxed and calm and it isn't the first time that I've given the press conference. It's just our way of working,"" added Karanka. But Madrid's record signing Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 28 league goals this season, believes they can reverse the result in their home stadium. ""It is completely different to the first game (when Real lost 5-0),"" Ronaldo told AFP. ""We have to think it is possible (to win) because they (Barcelona) are not from another planet. ""They are one of the best footballing sides but we are in good shape and have to be confident that the best team will win."" Barcelona have won the last five El Clasicos, scoring 16 goals against just two, but coach Pep Guardiola is taking nothing for granted. ""We won't make the mistake of going to the Bernabeu thinking nothing is lost if we lose,"" he said Guardiola. ""We have the opportunity to take a decisive step towards the league title."" Guardiola has defensive problems with captain Carles Puyol injured and Eric Abidal recuperating from surgery on a liver tumor. He must decide whether to use midfielder Sergio Busquets or draft in Gaby Milito in central defense. But all eyes will be on the free-scoring Barcelona attack, led by Lionel Messi, who has scored a club record 48 goals this season. Messi, who was in superb form in the earlier league victory, will be looking to score for the first time against a team managed by Mourinho. In other La Liga action at the weekend, Valencia travel to bottom side Almeria on Saturday looking to cement third place after their 5-0 rout of local rivals Villarreal last Sunday.","Real Madrid and Barcelona meet in first of four El Clasico showdowns in 18 days .

"(CNN) -- In a joint opinion piece to be published Friday, the leaders of the United States, Britain and France lay out in stark terms their contention that Libya's future must not include its leader, Moammar Gadhafi. ""It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government,"" said the article, titled ""Libya's Pathway to Peace,"" by U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. ""It would be an unconscionable betrayal."" The article, which is slated to appear in the International Herald Tribune, Le Figaro, and Times of London, was sent to reporters by the White House. Because Gadhafi has lost the consent of his people, ""any deal that leaves him in power would lead to further chaos and lawlessness,"" it says. ""We know from bitter experience what that would mean. Neither Europe, the region, or the world can afford a new safe haven for extremists."" The leaders called for an end to violence and for the regime's forces to pull back from the embattled cities of Ajdabiya, Misurata and Zintan, which have been besieged by Libyan government forces. ""However, so long as Gadhafi is in power, NATO must maintain its operations so that civilians remain protected and the pressure on the regime builds,"" they wrote. ""Then a genuine transition from dictatorship to an inclusive constitutional process can really begin, led by a new generation of leaders. In order for that transition to succeed, Gadhafi must go and go for good."" Clinton: Terms for Gadhafi ""non-negotiable"" At that point, they added, ""the United Nations and its members should help the Libyan people as they rebuild where Gadhafi has destroyed -- to repair homes and hospitals, to restore basic utilities, and to assist Libyans as they develop the institutions to underpin a prosperous and open society."" The decision about who will replace the current Libyan leaders will be left up to the Libyans themselves, they said.","""Gadhafi must go, and go for good,"" leaders of U.S., U.K. and France say .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The owners of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi power plant must start paying up to 1 million yen ($12,000) per household to residents displaced or forced indoors by the nuclear accident there, Japan's government ordered Friday. The Tokyo Electric Power Company will start handing out checks ""as smoothly and as early as possible,"" hopefully by April 28, its president, Masataka Shimizu, told reporters. Sole residents will receive 750,000 yen and multi-person households will get 1 million, Shimizu said, with the company's interim cost estimated at about $600 million. A government committee ordered the payments as an advance on the compensation that Tokyo Electric will owe nearby residents and businesses for the month-old crisis at Fukushima Daiichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Friday. Edano said the government hopes to have payments in residents' hands by Japan's ""Golden Week,"" a string of national holidays that begins April 29. Tokyo Electric offered a token payment to residents of 10 municipalities around the plant in early April. But officials in one of those towns, Namie, rejected the offer, saying it amounted to about $12 for each of its roughly 20,000 residents. Tokyo Electric has no timetable for resolving the accident, and the yet-unknown cost of compensation has called the survival of Japan's largest utility into question. The Japanese government has agreed to support the company to keep power flowing to its 25 million customers without big rate increases, Deputy Finance Minister Fumihiko Igarashi told CNN, but he said a government takeover of the utility was unlikely. ""The way the government will approach that is still in the decision process,"" Igarashi said. The utility reported 2010 profits of more than 1.4 trillion yen ($17 billion). About 78,000 people living within 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) of the plant were ordered out of their homes in the days after the March 11 accident, which now is ranked at the top of the international scale for nuclear disasters. Those living another 10 kilometers out were told to remain indoors as the plant belched radioactive particles into the environment from three damaged reactors. Monday, Japanese authorities told residents of five municipalities in that outer belt and beyond to evacuate within a month, due to lower levels of radioactive contamination that are likely to pose a long-term health hazard. Other towns have been put on notice that evacuations may be required soon, bringing the total number of people directly affected so far to about 146,000, according to Japanese government estimates. But in Washington, the U.S. State Department on Friday lifted a departure recommendation for families of U.S. diplomats in Japan. While it still advises Americans to stay more than 50 kilometers from the plant, the latest notice calls the situation ""dramatically different"" than in mid-March. ""Today, while the situation remains serious, and there is still a possibility of unanticipated developments, cooling efforts are ongoing and successful, power, water supply, and back-up services have been partially or fully restored, and planning has begun to control radioactive contamination and mitigate future dangers,"" the travel alert states. Plant workers have been battling to cool the cores of reactors 1-3 at Fukushima Daiichi, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, for a month. The plant was swamped by the tsunami that followed March 11's historic earthquake, knocking out normal coolant systems. All three cores are believed to have been damaged by overheating in the aftermath of the tsunami, but a Friday report by the Atomic Energy Society of Japan painted a fresh picture of the extent of the damage. The zirconium alloy sheaths that surround the fuel rods in the reactor core are believed to have ruptured in all three units, sending molten uranium fuel pellets tumbling to the bottom of the reactors. The pellets are since believed to have cooled and solidified at the reactor bases or in the framework of the fuel assembly, according to the report. The Atomic Energy Society is an association of nuclear engineers, scientists and professors. Its deputy director, Takashi Sawada, called the new account the clearest picture to date of conditions inside the damaged reactors. ""It's our best effort to imagine what the core looks like,"" he said. About 70% of the fuel rods in the No. 1 reactor have been damaged, the report states. In reactor No. 2, that figure is 30%, and in No. 3, 25%. In addition, the pools that house used but still-energetic spent fuel assemblies are an ongoing concern, Sawada said. Hydrogen explosions blew apart the reactor buildings at units 1 and 2, while the No. 4 reactor building has been damaged by fires of still-unknown origin -- leaving the pools exposed to the environment. ""If there's water enough, there's no problem,"" he said. ""But if some of the fuel is damaged, fission products will come out from those pools."" At the plant on Friday, efforts continued to drain highly radioactive water from the basements and service tunnels of the reactor units' turbine plants -- a necessary first step to restoring normal cooling systems. Japanese authorities drew the ire of fishermen and some of their country's neighbors by authorizing the dumping of thousands of tons of less-contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean last week. The 10,000-plus ton discharge was billed as an emergency measure aimed at making room for the more dangerous fluid, some of which is believed to be leaking from the No. 2 reactor. More than 9,000 tons of that came from a waste treatment facility at the plant, which could hold up to 30,000 tons now that it's empty, Tokyo Electric officials said. Crews have been laying fresh pipes to the treatment center and hope to start transferring water from unit 2 on Sunday, the company said. But its capacity could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements, and engineers are still pouring hundreds of tons of water into the reactors every day to keep them cool.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- For all the talk in diplomatic circles this week of finding peace for Libya, one thing remained clear Saturday: The war is raging unabated in Misrata. In the city under siege from Moammar Gadhafi's forces and mostly inaccessible for journalists, other than those on government-organized tours, residents reported disturbing new developments Saturday. An opposition council member told CNN that loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles. Photographs suggested they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas. Either way, they were proving lethal. The council member said Saturday that people have had their limbs blown off and children have been killed. The report comes a day after Human Rights Watch reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode Thursday night over Misrata's el-Shawahda neighborhood. Researchers with the activist group inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings, the report said. ""We hear explosions that sound like one big explosion followed by many smaller ones. We were told this is a cluster bomb,"" said the council member. He, like many other Libyans, did not want to be identified for safety reasons. The Libyan government has denied the use of such bombs, which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians even after a conflict ends. Ahmed Hassan of the Misrata opposition council said at least five people were killed and 44 others were wounded Saturday, after one witness saw a hail of rockets fall on the central Libyan city. Gadhafi's forces also bombed several food and dairy production factories, including ones that produce milk and oil, Hassan said. Terrified residents are going out in groups of 20 or 30 to fetch bread. They are too scared to venture out alone. ""No one and nowhere is safe in Misrata,"" Hassan said. Medecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata. Most were suffering war-related injuries. The boat arrived in Zarzis, Tunisia, on Saturday. The international medical humanitarian group (known as Doctors Without Borders in English) said ongoing fighting has cut off people from medical assistance and hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with casualties. ""For weeks now, health structures have been struggling to cope with the influx of patients,"" said Dr. Morten Rostrup, an MSF doctor who participated in the evacuation. ""With the latest heavy bombardments in Misrata, the situation is worsening as hospitals have to discharge patients before their treatment is completed in order to treat those wounded by fighting,"" Rostrup said in a statement. The International Organization for Migration said Saturday that a chartered boat filled with hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid was heading to Misrata. The group's first boat rescued 1,200 migrant workers and their families who had been stranded around the city's port, which has been bombarded daily by Gadhafi's forces according to witnesses. Deeper inside the city, witnesses for weeks have reported dire conditions, including food shortages and the persistent fear of pro-Gadhafi snipers taking aim at anyone walking on the streets. A clinic director told CNN at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in Misrata two months ago. Meanwhile, a Misrata opposition council member accused Gadhafi of using Libyan state television as an effective command-and-control center after NATO airstrikes damaged lines of communications and made troop control difficult. The council member said Gadhafi has been sending orders to his troops through coded messages aired on state television and the rebels have been trying to decode them in order to defend themselves. He gave these examples: . -- An anchor claimed that a bird laid a green egg in an area of Benghazi. The anchor hailed this as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi's forces. The next day that exact area was attacked by what the councilman described as sleeper cells in Benghazi. -- During the weather forecast, a map indicated a large storm over the port area of Misrata. No storm ever appeared, but the next day Gadhafi's forces attacked Misrata by sea. -- An anchor claimed that a honey bee spelled out Moammar with honey in Darnah. Once again, it was hailed as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi's forces. The next day, sleeper cells in Darnah launched an attack. Despite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets, Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing. He remains as defiant as ever despite calls this week again from global leaders attending a Libya conference in Qatar and a sternly worded newspaper opinion piece by U.S. President Barack Obama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron. But how to protect civilians has become an increasingly complex question. At a news conference in Benghazi, the deputy chairman of Libya's Transitional National Council appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy. He said 1.5 million Libyans were under attack every day. ""We already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians,"" Abdul Hafiz Ghoga told reporters. ""The international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of. The destruction in Misrata and other cities is unacceptable."" In Tripoli, four thundering explosions were heard Saturday evening -- believed to have been caused by NATO airstrikes -- followed by about 30 minutes of sustained anti-aircraft fire. Later that night, hundreds gathered outside Gadhafi's compound in the capital, with some saying they'd be willing to act as ""human shields"" as long as NATO warplanes targeted the manpower and infrastructure being used in support of the Libyan leader. ""Everyone here will die for Moammar Gadhafi,"" one young man told CNN. On the eastern front lines of the battle, rebels were still fighting to regain control of the oil town of al-Brega, which has changed hands several times already. ""We need weapons to defend our people,"" Ghoga said. NATO has said it needs more precision fighter jets because loyalist maneuvers have made airstrikes much more difficult without harming civilians. ""Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas, where before many targets were easier to get to,"" said NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen earlier this week. ""To avoid civilian casualties, we need very sophisticated equipment. So we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions."" A witness in Misrata said NATO planes were flying overhead Saturday, but he had not seen evidence of bombing.

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- Jury selection in the case of Casey Anthony, who is charged in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, continued Tuesday as attorneys removed several people from the viable jury pool. The day was a setback for Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. of the Orange County Superior Court, who has said he wants to seat a jury as quickly as possible. The selection process has so far lasted eight days. The goal is to have everything finalized for opening statements this week. Attorneys and the judge have rejected potential jurors for reasons ranging from financial hardship to bias. Anthony, 25, is charged with capital murder in the death of her daughter Caylee. The young girl's skeletal remains were found in woods near her family's home in December 2008 after she went missing for six months. Anthony has pleaded not guilty. She faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement. Jury selection is taking place at the Pinellas County courthouse in Clearwater, Florida. Attorneys on both sides struck several jurors Tuesday, whittling the potential pool of vetted candidates to just 11 -- six women and five men. Monday ended with 17 such candidates. Those remaining could still be cut before they are sworn in to serve. Twelve jurors and eight alternates were expected to be seated on the jury, which will be moved to and sequestered in Orange County, where the alleged crime happened and where the trial will take place. However, Perry on Monday raised the possibility the trial could move forward with fewer than eight alternates. ""We will have what we will have,"" he said. Perry had said previously he would begin swearing in jurors once the number of unrejected candidates reached 15. Jury selection was moved from Orlando to Clearwater amid intense media coverage of the case, which could make it difficult to select an impartial jury. Prosecutors have said they plan to show Anthony used ""a substance"" to kill her daughter. Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, the parents of Casey Anthony are working to obtain trademarks for ""Caylee Anthony"" and ""Justice for Caylee,"" according to their attorney, in a bid to prevent people from selling products that use their granddaughter's name. Mark Lippman, who represents George and Cindy Anthony, said they have also sent a demand letter, the first step in filing a claim for libel, to CafePress, a California-based online retailer that markets such products.

"(CNN) -- A war crimes tribunal for Rwanda sentenced the African nation's former army chief to 30 years in prison Tuesday for his part in the 1994 genocide that killed 800,000 people. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) found Augustin Bizimungu guilty on six counts of genocide, crimes against humanity for murder, extermination and rape and violations of  the Geneva Conventions. During the genocide, soldiers and police under Bizimungu's command directed the extermination of tens of thousands of Tutsi civilians who had taken refuge in churches, hospitals and schools, according to Human Rights Watch. Soldiers and police also ordered civilian officials and ordinary citizens to join in hunting down and killing the Tutsi and punished them if they failed to do so, the human rights monitoring group said. Bizimungu fled to Angola, where he was arrested in 2002 and transferred to the tribunal. In 2004, he was charged with directly ordering brutal acts against Tutsis and failing to halt the acts of his subordinates. He denied the charges. The tribunal also convicted two other senior officers -- François-Xavier Nzuwonemeye and Innocent Sagahutu -- who each got 20 years in prison. The Rwandan genocide was triggered by the April 6, 1994, shooting down of a plane carrying the nation's Hutu president. Ethnic violence erupted and Tutsis were killed systematically by Hutus. The United Nations estimates that some 200,000 people participated in the perpetration of the Rwandan genocide. In all, 800,000 Tutsi men, women, and children -- as well as moderate Hutus -- perished.","A war crimes tribunal found Augustin Bizimungu guilty on 6 counts .

""Piers Morgan Tonight"" airs weeknights on CNN/US at 9 p.m. ET and on CNN International at 0200 GMT (live simulcast), 1200 GMT, and 2000 GMT and HKT. CNN -- Donny Osmond was the Justin Bieber of his day. And while the show biz veteran has not yet met his 2011 pop star counterpart, he has some advice for him. ""Put the seat belt on, buddy, because it's going to be a bumpy ride."" Donny and Marie Osmond are guests on Monday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The brother-sister duo joined the CNN host from the stage of the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas where they perform.  ""That kind of success at that age can really bite you in the shorts as it were -- the proverbial shorts so to speak,"" continued Donny. ""I look at the experiences that I've gone through as a teeny bopper. You know ... I look at Justin Bieber ... and my heart breaks for him, because I know what he's going to go through. He knows. Everybody knows."" Donny went on to say that Bieber is ""going to go through so much heartache, 'Baby, baby, baby. Oh my' he's going to hate that. He probably hates it right now just as much as I hated 'Puppy Love.'"" Both Donny and Marie agreed that many young entertainers today ""just jump into the business,"" that they ""get a lot of fame and fortune,"" and ""feel entitled."" ""They forget about getting out there and working and doing all those little gigs -- 366 days a year and going through the work, going through the motions,"" said Donny. The pair said that their strong work ethic was instilled in them by their father, who Donny said taught them ""if there's something worth doing, it's worth doing well."" Marie told Morgan she feels ""blessed"" to have grown up working with Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin and Elvis Presley. ""They didn't look at it as being a celebrity,"" Marie said. ""They looked at it as being an entertainer. It was their job."" Donny said that the ""mark that a lot of people miss nowadays"" is that ""they leave out the heart and soul. And that's what I learned from Sammy Davis Jr., from Frank Sinatra, is when you went to ... those shows, you got to know them."" Donny recalled seeing Presley's closing show at the Hilton in the 1970s, the night before he and Marie were set to open on that same stage. ""I remember watching the 'King' onstage. He could do no wrong. I mean the -- the attitude was in the palm of his hand."" Presley came to visit him in his dressing room the following evening, Donny said, and politely said ""'Hi, everybody. I'm Elvis Presley. I just wanted to come say hi and good luck.'"" ""The king of rock and roll just walked through the door, and he's a real person,"" said Donny. ""It taught me a lot about leaving the star onstage. When you go onstage, you're just another person."" Donny said that an entertainer's genuine love for the audience is missing from many of today's acts. He said he and Marie go to great lengths to make sure their audiences ""walk away feeling that they got to know us better."" Donny said Davis once told him, ""The day you stop caring about your show is the day you should quit."" Marie also spoke about her recent remarriage to her first husband, Steve. The couple married 29 years ago but divorced after three years. She wore her original wedding dress, and the couple's 28-year-old son -- who went through his entire life with separated parents -- served as a witness. Marie said that when she broke the news of the engagement to her son, he hadn't been aware his parents were even dating. ""I was recording an album. It's out. It's my first inspirational album. ... There's a song on there called, 'Tell Me to Breathe.' ... I went to my son and I said, 'I'm going to marry your father again and I need a song that says my love to him.' And so he helped write that song. And that's my song to my husband, Steve."" The couple married in Las Vegas, and Marie chose the birthday shared by her mother, Olive Osmond, who died in 2004, and her son Michael, who committed suicide last year. ""That way they could all be there kind of symbolically,"" said Marie. ""As a matter of, we took a picture with -- I took a picture with Steve and all the kids. And I had Donny stand in for Michael. Then we're going to take -- put Michael's face on his body."" Marie said she will never get over the loss Michael, who was 18 when he died. ""There's always a place that is set in your heart at the dinner table,"" said Marie. ""There's always a celebration when he's there."" She said the proceeds from her inspirational album will go to the Children's Miracle Network on Michael's behalf. Donny, who has been married for 33 years, told Morgan that his marriage was ""the only thing that kept me sane.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has issued a strongly-worded statement condemning a deadly, suspected U.S. drone strike in the country's tribal region. ""Drone attacks have become a core irritant in the counter-terror campaign,"" a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday. ""We have repeatedly said that such attacks are counter productive and only contribute to strengthen the hands of the terrorists."" Pakistan's Foreign Secretary has lodged a strong protest with the U.S. Ambassador, according to the statement, and the government has ""taken up the matter with the U.S. at all levels."" Six suspected militants were killed Wednesday when a suspected drone fired two missiles at a hideout in South Waziristan, Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN. The officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Drone strikes are now carried out autonomously by the CIA, a senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN earlier. ""It's unilateral action,"" he said as he expressed dismay at Wednesday's strike. The U.S. does not officially acknowledge the Central Intelligence Agency's secret drone program in Pakistan, but it is the only country operating in the region with the capacity to carry out such strikes. It was once widely believed that the program had the tacit approval and cooperation of Pakistan's intelligence agency. Pakistani intelligence officials say Islamabad has asked the U.S. to curtail its drone strikes in remote tribal areas. ""We are not necessarily saying stop. What we are saying is irrespective of tactical games, this is not useful in the long run,"" one source told CNN. ""We need a relook and to not be too trigger happy and be selective."" Wednesday's strike is the first since March 17, when a drone strike in North Waziristan killed 44 people -- most of them civilians, two Pakistani sources said. It's the 19th strike this year, according to a count by CNN's Islamabad bureau. Such strikes have inflamed tensions between Pakistan and the United States. Pakistan has formally asked the United States for an apology. On Monday, Pakistan's intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with CIA Director Leon Panetta at CIA headquarters to voice his government's complaints about CIA activities in his country. U.S.-Pakistani relations have been strained for some time because of ongoing American intelligence operations within Pakistan's borders. Tensions came to a head recently when when CIA contractor Raymond Davis was arrested after killing two Pakistani men in Lahore. Although the United States said Davis was a security officer assigned to protect CIA officers, the Pakistanis maintained he was actually a spy whom they had been unaware of prior to the shooting incident. Pakistani officials insisted this week that the United States give them details about other CIA contractors in the country.","Pakistan calls U.S. drone strikes ""counter productive""

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Morocco's Facebook youth movement Fevrier 20 has called on civil society groups the length of the country to participate in a nationwide demonstration Sunday. The youth group's main aim is to draw massive attention to the subject of corruption in this North African country, which was recently ranked at the 89th most corrupt in the world by Transparency International. Despite a government initiative to crack down on corruption with a two-year plan -- rolled out in October -- and a recent law to protects whistle-blowers, most Moroccans believe that graft is a key issue that needs to be tackled head-on. Government initiatives are widely regarded as ineffective. Corruption accounts for a loss of about 2% of Morocco's GDP, officials have said. More important, it deters vital foreign direct investment from flowing into Morocco, they say. The 45,000-strong movement is said to be supported by most of Morocco's non-governmental organizations, according to press reports. ""We call to demonstrate peacefully in all the towns to put an end to corruption, to injustice and for a real democracy in our country,"" explained one youth on a video posted on the movement's Facebook page. The movement, which is often criticized as having been infiltrated by mainstream politicians from various parties, is expected to put as much pressure as possible on King Mohammed VI. He recently pledged a considerable overhaul of the country's political setup, including the election of a prime minister, rather than appointment, and the shift of power from the capital to the regions. The king is widely revered in Morocco, yet many Moroccans are skeptical about whether real reforms will be implemented in a new political landscape he hopes to unveil in mid-June, after a special constitutional commission finalizes its work on the blueprint. Many world leaders, such as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, see the plan as a bold example for other Arab countries to follow. Clinton recently said that the move represented a ""model for others in the region"" that holds ""great promise first and foremost for the Moroccan people."" Yet few Moroccans are so upbeat about the new constitution, as there seems to be little in it to give hope to many who want concrete initiatives to reduce corruption. ""The main areas of concern when we talk about corruption in Morocco are the judiciary, police and hospitals,"" Transparency International's local chief Rachid Filali Meknassi said. ""We need a real followup to a lot of initiatives which were taken in previous years so that political corruption can no longer infiltrate the justice system."" Judges in Morocco are appointed by the justice minister and the king in theory but in reality are installed by their own political parties, which in turn advise them on how to conclude cases. ""To give you an idea how bad it is in the judiciary,"" Filali Meknassi said, ""we conducted a survey in 2005 and found that the majority of judges and lawyers in Morocco have no faith in the system being free of corruption. We also know through our own call center that in some cases, judges can be individually persuaded with incentives."" Despite numerous reports commissioned by the government on corruption in the judiciary, along with the establishment of an anti-fraud body and a special ""accountability"" court, not one prosecution has been processed against a judge. In 2008, the Ministry of Justice processed about 6,000 corruption cases across all government departments, although there were few obvious results. In the same year, the accountability court conducted 245 audits of national governmental offices and 198 of local authorities. The court's report focused on graft in the Health Ministry, the National Investment and Development Fund and several local mayors. There were also no prosecutions by the year's end. Fevrier 20 hopes that Sunday's demonstrations will attract more than 300,000 people in all major Moroccan cities and present an unprecedented stand against the present rhetoric attached to the new constitution. But the group doesn't specifically want to target corruption in government ministries. ""We want a new constitution, which will define exactly what the new rules and regulations are in place to stop corruption,"" explained Said Benjebli, one of the movement's architects who edits the main Facebook page. ""All we have at the moment is speeches, and the laws are not working,"" he said. ""There are people in Morocco who have become millionaires due to being given public contracts just through their contact with the king. This has to stop. But then even smaller-scale corruption, like those who can't get a job despite having the qualifications, is also important.""","The group Fevrier 20 calls for nationwide demonstrations Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A deal designed to end months of anti-government protests in Yemen suffered a setback Sunday when embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh rejected the opposition signature, officials said Sunday. Saleh, who was due to sign the deal Sunday, refused to recognize the opposition signature on it from the day before. ""President Saleh invited the JMP (opposition alliance) to sign the ... proposal at the presidential palace at 3 p.m. today. We hope the JMP accepts President Saleh's invitation,"" said Tareq Shami, a spokesman for Yemen's ruling party, the General People's Congress (GPC). He insisted that the demand is not a complication, but rather common sense. ""Any agreement should never take place in closed-door meetings. This is commonly known and Saleh does not want to start the transition period in such a way,"" Shami said. Opposition officials rejected Saleh's proposal. ""This is Saleh. His words are never trusted. No agreement is respected by him,"" said Mohammed Qahtan, a spokesman for the JMP. Yemen, a key al Qaeda battleground and U.S. ally, has been roiled by protests for most of the year amid the background of anti-government demonstrations across much of the Arab world.","President Ali Abdullah Saleh wants the opposition to sign the agreement at the palace .
They refuse, saying he is not to be trusted .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is ""recovering well"" after skull surgery Wednesday, officials at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston said. The Arizona Democrat had a cranioplasty procedure, officials said. Doctors will discuss the procedure and Giffords' next step in rehabilitation at a Thursday morning press briefing. Jared Lee Loughner is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket where Giffords was meeting with constituents in January. Six people -- including a federal judge -- were killed and 13 others were wounded in the attack. After the shooting, surgeons in Arizona cut a hole in Giffords' skull to give her brain space to temporarily swell. The congresswoman later was transported to Houston for further treatment and rehab. Dr. Dong Kim told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen before the surgery he would implant a piece of synthetic bone made specially for the congresswoman. ""More than just getting the bone back, it is a marker for where we are"" in Giffords' recovery, the neurosurgeon said. Kim told Cohen that a shunt may have to be inserted to carry excess fluids from the brain to the abdominal cavity.","The Arizona Democrat has an operation on her skull .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The nightmare in Libya's war-torn city of Misrata intensified Monday amid more shelling on the city and desperate measures to get medical care, an opposition spokesman said. ""The aid coming from outside is not enough. There is no hospital,"" said the spokesman, who wanted to be identified only as ""Mohammed"" for safety reasons. He said 23 people were killed and 104 were injured in shelling Sunday in Misrata. Another person was killed and nine were injured Monday, Mohammed said. ""The shelling and destruction by Gadhafi's forces has not stopped since yesterday,"" he said. ""They are shelling mortar shells, cluster bombs and splinter mortar shells. The splinter mortar shells explode and throw lethal shrapnel, which has caused most of the tragedies."" The shelling was happening around residential and industrial areas of Misrata, the witness said. Monday's shelling also fell on the city's critical port area, Misrata's lifeline to humanitarian aid. With a city hospital taken over by pro-government forces, makeshift clinics have popped up to treat the wounded. And in a city where access to food, water and electricity has been scarce, Mohammed said, people have been using cell phones for light during surgery. Latest developments, country by country . ""(With) all of this happening, we haven't seen NATO,"" Mohammed said, referring to the alliance that has led airstrikes against Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi's military resources. ""There have been no strike for four days in Misrata."" Misrata residents are ""disappointed and let down"" by NATO, he said. ""They hear NATO flying above, but Gadhafi's forces do not run from them anymore. Gadhafi's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore. The NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues."" As the battle between pro-Gadhafi forces and rebels demanding an end to Gadhafi's four-decade rule forges ahead, a United Nations official said Monday that her meeting with Gadhafi regime members did not end with a promise to stop attacks. Map: Libya's civil war . Valerie Amos, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, spoke to reporters Monday in the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi. She said she visited Gadhafi regime officials in Tripoli on Sunday. ""Let me be absolutely clear. I got no guarantees with respect to my call for the overall cessation of hostilities to enable people to move, to enable us to deliver supplies,"" Amos said. ""I did get an assurance from the government to carry out a needs assessment in Misrata."" She added, ""I have to say, in that instance, we got no guarantees at all that the violence would cease."" iReport: Unrest in the Arab world . Britain will help 5,000 people trapped in Misrata ""escape the besieged city and will provide vital medical assistance to those who remain in towns across western Libya,"" the UK Mission to the United Nations announced Monday. The evacuations ""will get foreign workers who have managed to reach Misrata's port safely out of the town,"" the mission said in a statement. Meanwhile, a British official met with U.N. leaders Monday to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Libya. ""Agencies working inside (Misrata) report shortages of critical supplies and attacks targeted against civilians and medical facilities,"" according to a statement from the UK's Department for International Development. The statement said International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell would travel to the United Nations for ""urgent talks"" Monday. Misrata isn't the only city deluged by violence. On Sunday, forces loyal to Gadhafi shelled the city of Ajdabiya from 40-50 kilometers (25-31 miles) away, Libyan rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said. The loyalists who were targeting the city ""have no problem with the weather conditions there,"" referring to unconfirmed reports that NATO airstrikes were halted in the area due to weather conditions. Gadhafi's forces were using missiles and mortars, ""and sometimes we feel that NATO wants to use any excuse out there so they don't carry out their duties,"" Abdulmolah said. Read CNN Arabic's coverage . ""We can't understand (NATO's) excuses. We want to save our population from being murdered by (Gadhafi's) merciless death squads,"" he added. NATO did not immediately respond to a CNN inquiry about its operations Sunday. Earlier, however, the NATO press office said that it does not discuss ongoing operations and would not confirm or deny any reports. An official report from NATO said the alliance conducted 142 sorties on Saturday, of which 42 were strike sorties. NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians. The alliance has said Gadhafi's forces started hiding resources in civilian areas, making airstrikes much more difficult to carry out without harming civilians. Misrata remained in control of the rebels Sunday, Abdulmolah said, though they were fighting about 200 to 300 Gadhafi troops inside the city. Rebel fighters pushed Gadhafi's squads back to a shoe factory, from where they were shelling residential areas in the city, he said. NATO refused to bomb the shoe factory because it is a civilian facility, he said. In the end, the rebels pushed the loyalists out of the shoe factory, which they burned. Despite the incessant struggle, Abdulmolah said he was optimistic the rebels could overcome Gadhafi's forces. ""We are confident that we will be able to liberate the city completely and rescue our civilians who are being targeted by the madness of Gadhafi's death squads,"" he said.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The fiery crash that brought down a Concorde supersonic jet in 2000, killing 113 people, was caused partially by the criminal negligence of Continental Airlines and a mechanic who works for the company, a French court ruled Monday. Continental Airlines was fined 202,000 euros ($268,400) and ordered to pay 1 million euros to Air France, which operated the doomed flight. Mechanic John Taylor received a fine of 2,000 euros ($2,656) and a 15-month suspended prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter. The aircraft manufacturer EADS was also found partly responsible for the crash and ordered to pay 30% of damages to victims involved in the case. Air France has already paid an unspecified sum in damages to the families of most of the victims of the only crash ever of a Concorde. The mechanic was the only person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel in the Paris suburb of Pontoise. He was not present for the verdict. His former supervisor, Stanley Ford, and three French officials were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Henri Perrier, Jacques Herubel and Claude Frantzen were responsible for the design, testing and certification of the Concorde. The charges had said the engineers could have acted much earlier to correct well-known design flaws in the plane. Lawyers for Continental and Taylor rejected the guilty verdicts. ""I am shocked by this verdict, Taylor's lawyer Francois Esclatine said. ""I haven't had a chance to speak with my client yet, but I will tell him that he should appeal."" Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for Continental, said the airline ""will not let itself be pushed around in this way and we will definitely appeal."" The airline called the verdict ""absurd"" in a statement. Saying that the airline and Taylor were ""the sole guilty parties shows the determination of the French authorities to shift attention and blame away from Air France,"" which operated the flight and maintained the aircraft, Continental said. ""To find that any crime was committed in this tragic accident is not supported either by the evidence at trial or by aviation authorities and experts around the world,"" the statement said. Air France, which was a plaintiff in the Concorde trial, posted a statement on its website saying, the French national carrier ""welcomed the decision of the criminal court which recognizes Continental's full criminal and civil liability in the Concorde accident."" The Concorde burst into flames and smashed into a hotel on takeoff on July 25, 2000. Air France stopped flying the supersonic jets in 2003. A Continental Airlines plane that took off shortly before the doomed flight was found to have played a key role in the crash. A titanium strip allegedly fell off a Continental DC-10 which took off just before the Concorde. Judicial investigators say the strip was improperly installed on the DC-10 engine, prompting the charges against the airline, Ford and Taylor. A lawyer for the American airline had argued that Concorde's problems were apparent decades before the crash and that Continental was not to blame. An investigation revealed a tragic chain of events that brought down Air France Flight 4590 shortly after takeoff from Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport: a tire under the left wing blew on takeoff when it struck the small strip of titanium on the runway. The blown tire sent debris into the wing, causing the fuel tank to rupture and sparking the catastrophic fire that led to the crash that killed 100 passengers, nine crew and four people on the ground. CNN's Ayesha Durgahee contributed to this report.","NEW: Aircraft maker EADS is also ordered to pay damages .

"(CNN) -- You've just finished a round of golf on a floating course in the middle of the Indian Ocean. An underwater tunnel leads you to the clubhouse, where a glass elevator drops down to a main bar that doubles as a spectacular natural aquarium. It might sound far-fetched, but a $500 million development in the Maldives is set to make the world's biggest water hazard a reality -- and at the same time offer a potential long-term solution to the threat of climate change in the area. Designed by floating architecture specialists Dutch Docklands, the proposed site is just a five-minute speedboat ride from Maldives capital Male, and will offer 27 holes of golf, set upon three interlinked islands. The government-approved development will also boast around 200 villas, 45 private islands and a conservation center -- and all at little or no cost to the wildlife-rich coral reefs it will call home, according to the people behind it. ""We told the president of the Maldives we can transform you from climate refugees to climate innovators,"" said Paul van de Camp, CEO of Dutch Docklands. ""And we have a way of building and sustaining this project that is environmentally friendly too. This is going to be an exclusively green development in a marine-protected area."" With over 80 percent of their 1,190 coral reef islands no more than a meter above sea level, the Maldivian government is at the forefront of the battle against climate change. As sea levels reach dangerous levels, one option is to build defense walls, as they have around Male. Another is to buy land from other countries and effectively move their population to other areas. The third is to live on floating landscapes. ""Climate change is upon us and the Maldives are feeling it most. That's why they're leading the way in trying to find a way to combat the problem."" said Mark Spalding, senior marine scientist at the Nature Conversancy. ""But building on floating islands clearly comes with a risk of pollution. Golf courses need pesticides and you need to deal with that properly to make sure it doesn't get into the ocean. There's also the issue of desalinating the water to irrigate the course. That has to be done cleanly too."" Dutch Docklands appear to have a green solution. They plan to capture pesticides in concrete troughs, and recycle them in a fresh water ""sweet lakes"" in the middle of the golf course afterwards. That same water will then be used to irrigate the course. When it comes to the environmental cost of constructing the islands and developments in the first place, the solution is far more straightforward. ""We'll be building the islands somewhere else, probably in the Middle East or in India,"" said designer Koen Olthuis, the man whose vision will be realized when work officially starts on the project later this year. ""That way there's no environmental cost to the Maldives. When it comes to the golf course, the islands will be floated into position first, and then the grass will be seeded and the trees planted afterwards."" Troon Golf, who will be lending their expertise to the project in designing the course itself, stressed the economic benefits that could result from the construction in a release issued from their headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. ""The scar less development, which has zero footprint on the Maldives region will include state-of-the-art golf courses that look set to bring a wealth of new tourism and investment to the country,"" said managing director Bruce Glasco. But Spalding is not getting carried away. With some of the world's most valuable coral reef real estate at stake, he plans to watch the development closely and treat all environmental claims with caution. ""I just hope the Maldives government have been wise enough to not just fall for rhetoric,"" he said. ""In an ideal world a development like this would be on land, but the world is changing. I just hope they get it right. If they do, this type of development could be a harbinger of things to come."" If things go to plan, Van de Camp expects the golf course to be ready for play by the end of 2013, will the full development set to launch in 2015. And he's in no doubt visiting golfers will be in for a treat. ""This will be the first and only floating golf course in the world, and it comes with spectacular ocean views on every hole,"" he said. ""And then there's the clubhouse. You get in an elevator and go underwater to get to it. It's like being Captain Nemo down there.""","A $500 million floating golf complex development is planned for the Maldives .
The golf course will be laid out on three islands, connected by underwater tunnels .

"(CNN Student News) -- May 17, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Israel  • Pakistan  • Memphis, Tennessee . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: An economic face-off, a special graduation speaker, and a look at what happened on this day in history. I'm Carl Azuz, and CNN Student News is ready to take flight. First Up: Shuttle Launch . UNIDENTIFIED NASA ANNOUNCER: ...liftoff for the final launch of Endeavour. Expanding our knowledge, expanding our lives in space. AZUZ: The space shuttle Endeavour taking off on its final endeavor. The launch was delayed due to mechanical problems, but NASA officials said those were all fixed. The shuttle and its crew are headed to the international space station. This is a 16-day mission and the next-to-the-last mission for the space shuttle program. Mae Jemison has flown on Endeavour before. On that mission, she became the first African-American woman to travel into space. She said yesterday's launch brought up mixed emotions. DR. MAE JEMISON, FORMER ASTRONAUT: It's very bittersweet, because it was a wonderful, beautiful launch. I was on the second mission of Endeavour. And things are transitioning. When we spoke last year, we were there talking about the fact that the shuttle era was coming to an end, and now the United States was putting more of its research money into how to do interplanetary travel, how to come up with the kinds of engines that are needed to go, to taking us to an asteroid. So, that transition is great, but it's sort of hard to see the shuttle program ending. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Fulton's business class at Shepton High School in Plano, Texas! Which of these words means failing to make required payments on time? Is it: A) Arbitration, B) Bankruptcy, C) Collusion or D) Default? You've got three seconds -- GO! When you default, it means you haven't made your payments on time. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Debt Ceiling . AZUZ: There's a chance the U.S. government could default on its debt, money that it has borrowed. Congress actually sets a limit on how much money the government can borrow. It's called the debt ceiling. It's kind of like the limit on a credit card: once you've maxed out, you can't borrow any more. And the government is there, at that maxed-out limit: $14.294 trillion. If it can't borrow any more money, the government might not be able to pay its bills. That's not a good thing. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress yesterday that there are ways to keep things running for a few months, but he's urging lawmakers to raise the country's debt ceiling. That's something lawmakers have been debating for a while now. Maggie Lake looks at some of the arguments from both sides. (BEGIN VIDEO) MAGGIE LAKE, CNN ANCHOR AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK: Republicans want trillions in cuts and no tax hikes. Democrats say tax hikes should be included in the mix. And they caution against tying the debt limit too closely to deficit reduction. JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We believe that we can reach an agreement on significant deficit reduction within the same time frame that Congress needs to take action to raise the debt ceiling. But it simply would be folly, as I've said before, to say that if we don't get an agreement, or if we don't get the agreement we want, then we're just not going to raise the debt ceiling, come what may. LAKE: As politicians squabble, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has vowed to take ""extraordinary measures"" to allow the U.S. to continue paying its creditors, including borrowing from federal pension plans. Because of this, the U.S. will not default on its debt immediately. But Geithner says he'll run out of options in early August. Many in the Capitol believe Congress must act by then, and creditors will be watching every step of the way. Creditors like China, which holds more than $1 trillion worth of U.S. treasuries, and Japan, which holds more than $890 billion worth of debt. Over the years, the U.S. has been forced to raise the debt ceiling 74 times since 1962 to pay for tax cuts, foreign wars and other spending increases. In fiscal year 2000, total national debt stood at $5.5 trillion. Since then, debt has almost tripled. Most in Washington agree, not raising the debt ceiling, and defaulting on debt, would trigger a spike in borrowing rates and a loss of confidence in the ability of the U.S. government to honor its obligations. A high stakes game of political chicken is underway, and the national debt clock is ticking. Maggie Lake, CNN, New York. (END VIDEO) This Day in History . AZUZ: On this day in history, May 17th, in 1792, 24 stockbrokers and merchants signed the Buttonwood Agreement. That established the New York Stock Exchange. In 1875, Oliver Lewis rode Aristides to victory. It was the first running of the Kentucky Derby, now one of the world's most famous horse races. And in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case of Brown vs. The Board of Education, saying that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional. Border Violence . AZUZ: Increased tension around the nation of Israel after protesters who support the Palestinian people fought with Israeli forces on Sunday. The violence broke out on ""Nakba Day."" Nakba is Arabic for ""catastrophe."" The day marks the time in 1948 when Arabs were moved out of their homes after Israel was established. At least 12 people were killed in the fighting on Sunday. Hundreds of others were injured. Officials from Syria and Lebanon -- two of Israel's neighbors -- accused Israeli troops of firing on protesters. Israel said the protesters were illegally crossing the border. Israel's prime minister said he hoped for a quick, peaceful resolution. But he added that Israel is determined to defend its borders. U.S. & Pakistan . AZUZ: There's also been some tension between the United States and Pakistan recently, especially after U.S. forces killed terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. The country accused the U.S. of violating Pakistani law by launching the attack on bin Laden inside of Pakistani borders. The U.S. has questioned how bin Laden lived near a Pakistani military academy without being discovered. Yesterday, U.S. Senator John Kerry, who's the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, traveled to Pakistan. During the visit, he said the U.S. doesn't need to apologize for the raid that killed bin Laden. But he said that it's important for the two countries to find a way to resolve their differences, and he pointed out that the U.S. and Pakistan still share the same goal. SEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: We must never lose sight of this central fact: we are strategic partners with a common enemy in terrorism and extremism. Both of our countries have sacrificed too many citizens and troops in the fight, and many too many to consider abandoning this important relationship for one reason or another. Far too much is at stake here. Commencement Contest . AZUZ: Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis, Tennessee had a high-profile graduation speaker for this year's ceremony: President Obama. He was there because the school won this year's Race to the Top Commencement Challenge. Public high schools across the country were judged on how they prepare students for college and for careers. Booker T. Washington used this video to show off some of the school's achievements. That includes test scores higher than the state average and the school's dramatically improved graduation rate. At yesterday's commencement, President Obama said that Booker T. Washington's progress should be an example for schools around the U.S. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today, Booker T. Washington is a place that has proven why we can't accept excuses -- any excuses -- when it comes to education. In the United States of America, we should never accept anything less than the best that our children have to offer. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, we offer for you a little case of identity crisis. Golden retrievers are supposed to hunt ducks. This one adopted them! They even follow her around, as if she's their mother. For instance, when it gets warm outside, they all cool off by pooling their resources. Though with any other retriever, these feathered friends would be duck soup. The retriever will raise them for two months with dogged determination before they leave the nest... or the pool. Goodbye . AZUZ: Of course, the dog could've ducked that kind of responsibility, but that kind of behavior wouldn't fit the bill. Oh yeah: duck puns! You can't deny it: they quack you up.

"(CNN) -- A businessman accused of helping facilitate the November 2008 terrorist attacks that killed as many as 164 people in Mumbai, India, goes on trial in a federal courtroom in Chicago on Monday. Prosecutors accuse Tahawwur Hussain Rana of allowing his office, First World Immigration Services, to be used a front for a co-conspirator traveling abroad to scout possible locations for the terrorist attacks, according to court records. Rana is also accused of taking part in a plot to bomb the offices of a Danish newspaper that had published irreverent cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed and angered Muslims across the world. Rana, who denies the allegations, is listed among seven co-defendants in the indictment, five of whom are unnamed and considered to be at large. Prosecutors allege the co-defendants are members of the terrorist group, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, or ""Army of the Pure."" David Coleman Headley, the only other defendant named in the suit, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges last year and is expected to testify against Rana. If convicted, Rana could be sentenced to life in prison. According to the indictment, Rana helped Headley obtain a fake visa to travel to India as well as approve the opening of a First World office in Mumbai. Headley, who is Pakistani-American, ""misrepresented his birth name, (his) father's true name, and the purpose for his travel,"" on the visa, the indictment states. Between September 2006 and July 2008, Headley made repeated trips to Mumbai where he made video recordings of potential terrorist sites, the indictment states. In July 2008, according to the indictment, Rana allegedly passed messages from another plotter to Headley. On November 26, 2008, a group of 10 attackers armed with guns, grenades and other explosive devices launched attacks on various targets in Mumbai, including two hotels, a train station and a Jewish center. Those killed in the attacks included six U.S. citizens, the indictment states. After the Mumbai attacks, according to prosecutors, Headley again obtained Rana's permission to use his company's name as a cover to conduct surveillance on a Danish newspaper that had publish the offensive cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Those attacks were never carried out. Journalist Ben Smith contributed to this report.","Defendant accused of letting his company be used as a cover for terror plot .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the wake of the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East and North Africa, President Barack Obama will pledge U.S. economic assistance to Egypt and Tunisia on Thursday in a speech highlighting his administration's revised policies toward the changing region. The highly anticipated address at the State Department will touch on all the Middle East-North Africa flash points -- the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Libya, Syria, Iran and the recent killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- with a focus on Obama's plan for how the United States can help the region develop through political and economic reforms, according to administration officials. New bin Laden audio tape released . Obama ""will be laying out a vision tomorrow for the region of what it can be long-term and its role in the world, and as part of that, we'll be announcing a series of initiatives to support that long-term vision,"" a senior administration official said Wednesday. He was one of three senior administration officials who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name. Want to reach Arabs Mr. President? Try this . The speech comes nearly two years after a 2009 address in Cairo, the Egyptian capital, by Obama that called for ""a new beginning"" between the United States and the Muslim world. Now many in the Middle East and North Africa consider the Cairo speech a collection of lofty ideals that lacked sufficient follow-through, and they want Obama to signal substantive and concrete policies that support the aspirations of the region's people. Marwan Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister and longtime advocate of Arab reform, said the Middle East is a new environment now, where young men and women are laying their lives on the line for democracy throughout the region. They need to be told their cause is just and how the United States will support them. ""If this is going to be another Cairo speech, forget it,"" said Muasher, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It was great two years ago, and even then the feedback was mixed because people wanted to see what he would do. If he doesn't have much to add this time, people will not be fooled by it."" Obama's do-over on the Middle East . Gigi Ibrahim, a 24-year-old Egyptian activist and blogger, said that Obama's words will have little impact in her country. ""At this point, whatever President Obama will address will really be irrelevant to what the situation is now because we're really building democracy from the bottom up,"" Ibrahim said, adding that ""America is not the model of democracy that we are striving for."" She called U.S. policy on the Middle East ""hypocritical"" because, she said, the United States ""will support a dictatorship if it's aligned with its interests."" That attitude is rife throughout the Middle East and North Africa, noted CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. With Egypt facing economic crisis, the Libyan conflict at a stalemate, an ongoing harsh crackdown on demonstrators in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at a standstill, there is little belief in the region that Obama or the United States can do much to help, Gergen said. ""I think it's going to be very difficult in the near term to generate excitement about his policies in the Middle East,"" Gergen said. What's next for the Arab Spring . In an effort to start changing such perceptions, the Obama administration on Wednesday imposed tough sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and six other senior Syrian officials in an effort to stop the regime's fierce crackdown on anti-government protests. The sanctions also target two top Iranian officials whose unit was a ""conduit for Iranian material support"" to Syrian intelligence, according to a copy of the executive order issued by the White House. According to the senior administration officials, Thursday's speech will focus on the opportunity for the United States to help people in the Middle East-North Africa region gain a say in their future governance through the changes they have launched. Obama will emphasize U.S. principles such as freedom of assembly, the right to self-determination and respect for human rights while promoting economic development as a significant contributor to helping people of the region realize their aspirations, the officials said. ""It's important to note that some of the protests in the region are deeply rooted in a lack of individual opportunity and economic growth, as well as a suppression of political rights,"" one of the senior administration officials said. ""We also know from our study of the past that successful transitions to democracy depend in part on strong foundations for prosperity, and that reinforcing economic growth is an important way of reinforcing a democratic transition."" That means that ""one of the most important areas for us to focus on is supporting positive economic growth that again can incentivize and reinforce those countries that are transitioning to democracy,"" the official continued. ""We see this as a critical window of time for the United States to take some concrete action to demonstrate our commitment to their future and to again reinforce their democratic transition with support for a broader base of prosperity,"" the official added. In particular, the senior administration officials focused on economic aid for Tunisia and Egypt intended to bolster the democratization and economic development efforts of two countries at the vanguard of political reform. Will there be aid for Arab Spring nations? Obama will announce several programs intended to increase U.S. and international investment, create jobs and spur economic growth in the two countries, the officials said. The goal is for Tunisia and Egypt to serve as models for a region undergoing change, so that other countries have incentive to undertake similar reforms, according to the officials. Specific programs include relieving Egypt of up to $1 billion in debt over the next two to three years so the money can be invested by the Egyptian government in economic development plans, and providing $1 billion in loan guarantees to finance infrastructure development and job creation, the senior administration officials said. In addition, programs through international banking and funding organizations such as the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be worth a few billion dollars, the officials said. ""One of the most important things we can do is empower positive models"" in Egypt and Tunisia, one of the officials said. ""That will have a positive impact beyond their borders."" The United States also will work with international groups and allies to help Middle East-North African countries modernize and integrate trade policies, according to the senior administration officials. Currently, nations in the region of 400 million people export about the same amount of goods as Switzerland, a country of 8 million people, if oil is removed from the equation, said a White House background document on the speech. Obama's speech comes in a week when the White House has focused on Middle East issues. He met Tuesday with Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House and will meet Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After his talks with King Abdullah, Obama said it was ""more vital than ever that both Israelis and Palestinians find a way to get back to the table and begin negotiating a process whereby they can create ... two states that are living side by side in peace and security."" However, former Sen. George Mitchell unexpectedly submitted his resignation as the president's Mideast envoy Friday, and deadly clashes broke out Sunday between pro-Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces. Ongoing Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and Palestinian steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart since Obama took office. They have also placed new obstacles in the path of the administration's push for a mutually acceptable two-state solution. Arab Spring not good for Israel? Additional doubts about the viability of the stalled peace process were raised this month in the wake of a formal reconciliation agreement between the two largest Palestinian factions: President Mahmoud Abbas' party, the West Bank-based Fatah; and the Islamist group Hamas, which rules Gaza. Both Israel and the United States consider Hamas a terrorist organization and have voiced strong opposition to the inclusion of the group in any unity government, demanding that it first renounce violence, recognize the state of Israel and abide by all previous agreements. Netanyahu has called on the Palestinian Authority to pull out of the deal, saying it jeopardizes prospects for a peace agreement. The Obama administration has ""made it clear that Hamas must stop its outrageous use of terrorism and must recognize Israel's right to exist,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""Any participation in a Palestinian government would require that it abides by those standards in our view."" In other engagement in the region, Obama helped push Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from office in February and subsequently committed U.S. forces to a NATO air campaign in support of the rebel movement in Libya. The administration has repeatedly called for an end to strongman Moammar Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. The White House has been much less vocal, however, in dealing with allies such as Bahrain, a small Persian Gulf state that is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet.

"(CNN) -- The captors of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, two Americans currently being held in Iran on suspicion of espionage, allowed them to telephone home over the weekend, according a statement released Monday by members of their families. The Sunday calls, the third received by the families in more than 21 months, lasted less than five minutes, according to the statement. Bauer, Fattal and Bauer's fiancee, Sarah Shourd, were arrested July 31, 2009, while hiking along an unmarked border between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan. Shourd was released last year. U.S. officials have repeatedly said the charges against Bauer and Fattal are meritless and have called on the Iranian government to release the two men. A trial for the men was supposed to take place earlier this month, but it was delayed without an explanation after Bauer and Fattal were not brought to the courthouse. The statement from the Bauer and Fattal families said the men sounded ""reasonably well."" However, the detainees told family members they had been on a 17-day hunger strike to protest their captors' refusal to give them letters sent from home, according to the statement. Last week, Cindy Hickey and Laura Fattal, the respective mothers of Bauer and Josh Fattal, announced they were going on a hunger strike to protest their sons' treatment. In the Monday statement, both women said they would continue their ""open-ended, rolling hunger strike"" until their sons are released. ""Their inhumane treatment has to end with their immediate release,"" the family statement read.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate rejected a Republican measure Wednesday to expand offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. coastal waters, signaling a continued partisan stalemate over energy policy and, more specifically, how to respond to rising gas prices. The bill was defeated in a 42-57 vote.  Sixty votes were required for passage. Five Republicans -- Alabama's Richard Shelby, Louisiana's David Vitter, Maine's Olympia Snowe, South Carolina's Jim DeMint, and Utah's Mike Lee -- voted against the bill. One Democrat, Montana's Max Baucus, didn't vote. On Tuesday, the Senate rejected a Democratic measure to strip major oil companies of about $20 billion in tax subsidies over the next 10 years and use the savings to pay down the federal deficit. Among other things, the GOP bill would have required the Interior Department to complete a number of offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Virginia and Alaska.  It also would have extended lease terms by one year for Gulf contracts suspended by the drilling moratorium imposed by the Obama administration in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster. The GOP bill would have established a 30-day review period for drilling permit applications, and allowed for default approval if an application wasn't rejected within 60 days. The Interior Department would have been required to provide a rationale for rejecting a permit application. ""At a time of near-record gas prices, this is a modest approach, a good first step that takes everyone's concerns into account so that we can actually achieve a practical result,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""It's time to stop holding Americans back with moratoriums, fees, bureaucratic roadblocks, and the ever-expanding reach of a president who seems to think that business owners in this country need to get his permission first if they want to create jobs."" Top Democrats argued that the GOP plan would do little to ease the country's long-term energy crisis. ""We can't lose sight of the fact that our great country uses more than 25% of the oil (consumed in the world) on any given day, and we have less than 3% of the oil reserves,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday. ""We need to do everything we can to increase domestic  production, but there's a limit to what we can do,"" Reid said.  The Republican measure ""on its face doesn't make a lot of sense,"" he said. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group, called the bill a ""misguided attempt to expand drilling and weaken safety and environmental oversight."" Some senators from oil-producing states argued the bill didn't go far enough. Republican Vitter and Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, claimed it would actually ""slow down the permitting process instead of streamlining and accelerating it."" The bill ""would add an unnecessary and burdensome new layer of regulation regarding containment plans just when energy companies have figured out how to comply with the administration's new requirements,"" they argued in a joint statement. President Barack Obama used his weekly address last Saturday to push what he called ""safe and responsible"" oil production. Administration officials have said they are working to speed up the leasing process for the Alaska National Petroleum Reserve, while also giving oil companies better financial incentives to use and extend certain existing leases in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. The president also has indicated he backs steps to accelerate the testing of areas off the East Coast for possible future drilling. At the same time, however, Obama also has announced the formation of an interagency working group to oversee Arctic drilling projects to make sure they meet health, safety and environmental standards. The president opposes controversial plans for drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. GOP leaders argue the White House has not done enough to bring down gas prices, which are now topping $4 a gallon in many parts of the country.","The Senate has rejected a GOP bill to expand offshore oil and gas drilling .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexico's Sinaloa state has named a new target in the government's war on organized crime: bars, restaurants and night clubs that play songs glorifying drug trafficking. Those that do will have their licenses revoked, according to new rules published in the state's official register. ""They can play other types of songs, but nothing that incites violence or justifies crimes,"" Sinaloa Gov. Mario Lopez Valdez said as he announced the measure this week. The popular ballads, known as narcocorridos, tell of shootings, police chases and armored cars . Federal lawmakers have suggested banning them, but the proposals haven't passed. Elijah Wald, author of the book, ""Narcocorrido: A Journey into the Music of Drugs, Guns, and Guerrillas,"" has documented dozens of past attempts by politicians to stop the songs. ""The pattern seems to be, when anything happens in the real world, let's crack down on the fantasy world,"" he said. ""You know, it's nutty, but it makes a certain amount of sense, because it's something that the government can do, whereas the real violence is completely out of control."" A top Mexican official praised the Sinaloa governor's move. ""Narco-corridos justify crime .... Good for (Mario Lopez Valdez),"" national security spokesman Alejandro Poire said in a Twitter post. On Thursday, he said silencing the songs is a key part of Mexico's ""cultural fight"" against violence. ""The rhythm they dance to is that of the violence that harms many families in Mexico,"" Poire wrote in a blog post on an official government website. ""It is not a matter of censorship because it isn't a moral matter; it is a matter of legality and stopping the growth of the culture of indifference and violence,"" he said. The owner of a night club in the state capital of Culiacan said he was annoyed by the government's decision, which he said would take a toll on his business. ""We live in a state and a city where this music is played and the people like it,"" said the night club owner, who declined to give his name due to security concerns. The government is unfairly targeting the songs rather than dealing with crime, he said. ""There are people that are doing bad things, and they are not going to stop doing them because we listen to cumbia or disco,"" he said. CNNMexico.com and CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Krupskaia Alis contributed to this report.","The popular songs tell of shootings, police chases and armored cars .

"(CNN) -- Advancing Sudanese troops have prompted a massive evacuation by inhabitants of the oil-rich city of Abyei, a humanitarian medical group said Monday. The organization, Doctors Without Borders, said many of the evacuees have fled 40 kilometers (24 miles) south to Agok. That includes 42 people wounded in violent clashes over the weekend who are being treated at the aid group's hospital there. ""This morning, the entire population of Abyei town fled the city, which is now almost empty,"" the organization said in a statement. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the military wing of the movement that governs Southern Sudan confirmed Sunday that Sudan's military had taken control of the oil-rich region. ""Abyei has been under attack by the Sudanese armed forces from air and ground,"" said Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) spokesman Philip Aguer. Southern Sudan in January voted to split from the north, and is expected to officially become an independent nation in July. However, the fate of the oil-rich Abyei region remains a flash point. The Sudanese armed forces said the military in Southern Sudan was behind the attack, but the SPLA denied responsibility. A statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's press office noted that the U.N. compound was shelled by mortar rounds, leaving two peacekeepers injured. The release, from Ban, also asked for ""justice"" following earlier attacks May 19 on a U.N.-escorted convoy and on U.N. troops May 10 in Goli. At least 22 people were killed in the more recent attack, which was on Sudanese armed forces and U.N. peacekeepers, according to Sudanese army sources. ""The Secretary-General remains deeply concerned for the safety of the civilian population of the area, the vast majority of whom (have) been forcibly displaced due to the fighting,"" the U.N. statement said Sunday. ""The Secretary-General calls on both parties to immediately cease their military operations, withdraw all forces and armed elements from Abyei and desist from further acts of antagonism."" The Commission of the African Union responded to the latest developments in Abyei ""with very grave concern,"" according to a prepared statement released Sunday. ""The AU Commission would like to urge all the parties to immediately withdraw all the unauthorized forces from the area ... and to restrain from any provocative actions,"" the statement read. ""The AU Commission calls on the parties to resume the dialogue towards a political settlement on Abyei by returning to the negotiating table."" Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir issued a decree Saturday dissolving Abyei's administration. The area had been governed by representatives from the north and south. The United Nations said this month that violence in the Abyei region will jeopardize relations between the two sides as they gear up for a permanent separation July 9. Its peacekeeping mission in Sudan issued a statement Saturday urging ""all parties in Abyei to resume dialogue towards reaching a lasting political settlement."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the recent spike in violence. ""I call on all sides to cease hostilities immediately. All unauthorized forces should be withdrawn from the entire area of Abyei in accordance with past agreements by the parties,"" he said in a statement Sunday. In a statement Saturday, the White House called on the Sudanese Armed Forces to stop its offensive in Abyei and withdraw forces. ""Failure to do so could set back the process of normalizing relations between Sudan and the United States and inhibit the international community's ability to move forward on issues critical to Sudan's future,"" the statement said. A U.N. Security Council delegation had arrived in Khartoum, Sudan, on Saturday to discuss the ongoing peace process with government officials.

"(CNN) -- They stood and squatted for hours, crammed into two sweltering semi-trailers, clinging to ropes so they would not fall as the trucks traveled through winding mountain roads. Mexican authorities say the more than 500 illegal immigrants they detained Tuesday wanted to reach the United States and each had paid $7,000 to get there. But by Wednesday, a day after X-ray equipment detected them at a highway checkpoint, the majority of them had been deported to their home countries in Central and South America. In a migrant detention center surrounded by high walls near Mexico's southern border, the remaining 23 immigrants, who hailed from countries as nearby as the Dominican Republic and as far away as Nepal, will wait as officials arrange their deportation. Immigrant detentions are nothing new in the southern Mexican border state of Chiapas, where at least 25,000 immigrants were apprehended last year. But the large number authorities found in two vehicles Tuesday was a startling reminder of the desperation that drives immigrants to risk dangerous conditions. The case drew national attention in Mexico, where the country's interior minister announced he would begin following the ""migrant's route"" through Mexico on Wednesday. The three-day trip was scheduled to include meetings on immigration with local officials and his Guatemalan counterpart. The vast majority of the immigrants detained Tuesday were from Guatemala, and all 410 of them had been handed over to Guatemalan police by Wednesday afternoon, according to Mexico's National Migration Institute. The 80 detained immigrants who hailed from El Salvador, Ecuador and Honduras were scheduled to be deported Wednesday evening. The immigrants who hailed from the Dominican Republic, India, Nepal, China and Japan awaited their fate Wednesday in Tapachula, Chiapas, at the recently renovated 21st Century Migration Station, Mexico's largest immigrant detention center. Experts say the passage of Central American immigrants through Mexico on their way to the United States is hardly a 21st century phenomenon. Immigration of Central Americans into the United States began to grow in the early 1980s, said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. And for at least 15 years, American authorities have been pushing Mexican officials to crack down on ""transit migration."" ""Going back to the 1990s when we start to engage Mexico, this has been one of the two main goals of our conversation,"" Papademetriou said. But the Guatemala-Mexico border was easy to cross until recently, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""There's more of a federal presence today than there's ever been, for two reasons,"" he said. ""One, because Mexico has been trying to make a case that the country is secure, and that they're doing their part on terrorism and on illegal immigration; but also, in part, because Mexico is very concerned about crime on the southern border."" That hasn't stopped immigrants from embarking on the journey, despite the dangers. ""People are going to keep coming,"" Selee said. ""As bad as the economy has been in the U.S. over the past couple years, there are still people willing to take the risk of not finding a job because they also see no prospects where they are.""

"(CNN) -- In 1990, Garen Staglin received a phone call that would change the course of his life. Between his freshman and sophomore years at Darmouth College, Staglin's son Brandon had schizophrenic break -- a mental episode that is often followed by a diagnosis of schizophrenia. From the moment they learned of their son's illness, Staglin and his wife, Shari, took on the disease and delved into the world of mental disorders in an attempt to end brain disease and the cultural stigmas attached to them. The Staglins delved into piles of medical resources and found a dense array of research, studies and multiple professional options to the point that they were overflowing with information. As they waded through the options and got their son care he needed, the family realized the need for continued scientific advancements to understand the development of mental illness. So the Staglins, who own Staglin Family Vineyards in Rutherford, California, decided to throw their own small benefit for mental health in their backyard. In 1995, a small concert series began that harnessed top scientists, donors, and an array of entertainment, fine dining and of course wine. What started out as a community gathering to discuss mental health has turned into a major annual event with celebrity performances, top professionals and a sold out dinner that has raised more than $114 million for research efforts. In 2008, with the growing success of the concert events, Staglin co-founded the International Mental Health Research Organization (IMHRO) which allows for additional financial support across the nation and increases the ability to fund and propose research opportunities that might not otherwise be studied in the field of mental illness. The Staglins wanted to not only to raise cash for fundraising for brain disease but remove the stigma of admitting you or a loved one suffer from one. ""What we need to do is study and get all the basic circuits of the brain identified and understood, and once we have that super highway of information, the off ramp of these illnesses will be much more evident and much more proximate to us,"" Staglin told CNN's Sanjay Gupta. Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who comes from one of the most recognizable American families, has been vocal of his battles with addiction and depression. It seemed only natural that when the two men met they would find friendship around a topic that has affected them both personally. Kennedy and Staglin will unite together May 23-25 as they launch their new national initiative, ""The Next Frontier, One Mind for the Brain"" -- a new space for scientists, government, industry, academia, philanthropy, patients and their families. ""The Next Frontier"" is a reference to Kennedy's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, who embarked on a scientific mission of his own. Patrick Kennedy: Brain research is the new 'moon shot' This project aims to be a one-stop shop for the latest and best in specific development and treatments for those suffering from neurological diseases. ""Everything from Autism to Alzheimer's, the entire spectrum of brain disorders... we are going to unite the field,"" said Staglin. Domestic researchers, clinicians, scientists and policy makers will gather later this month in hopes of trailblazing a new map of the brain. Both Kennedy and Staglin hope this event can serve Americans in the same way the American Heart Association does. Brandon Staglin maintains websites for the winery and the family's nonprofit research efforts with IMHRO. After taking a year off from Dartmouth College and getting help for his schizophrenia, he graduated with a degree in engineering and is now doing his best to lead a normal life. Brandon Staglin is an example of the success that's possible with the right support, Garen Staglin said. ""He is a role model for what can happen with people with these kind of illnesses. He is on the right medications, he is medically compliant but he is also very conversant and not in denial about the illness -- and that is the biggest problem with many people. They don't really want to talk about their disorder; they want to mask it."" And that's what the Staglins and Kennedy hope to do for all Americans who suffer with brain disease -- allow those individuals access to the best information possible about treatment options so they can remedy their ailment and live their best life.","Family works to fund brain disease research, remove mental illness stigma .

""I know that Mark and his wife were the victim of a serious attack, and I hope that her health continues to improve,"" the pope said. Kelly thanked the pope for mentioning Giffords. The Arizona congresswoman was shot in the head in a January assassination attempt. The two men also talked about how technology used in space may be able to help relations between people on Earth. ""I think it must be obvious to you how we all live together on one Earth, and how absurd it is that we fight and kill each one,"" the pontiff said. ""We fly over most of the world and we don't see borders, but at the same time we realize that people fight with each other and there is a lot of violence in this world,"" Kelly said. Unlike on Earth, technology on the space station allows for almost unlimited power from the sun, he said.

"(CNN) -- Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a former top aide to President George W. Bush, ended his very public flirtation with running for president early Sunday with an e-mail to supporters that narrowed the field of plausible 2012 Republican challengers to President Barack Obama. ""The counsel and encouragement I received from important citizens like you caused me to think very deeply about becoming a national candidate,"" Daniels said in the message distributed through the Indiana Republican Party. ""In the end, I was able to resolve every competing consideration but one, but that, the interests and wishes of my family, is the most important consideration of all."" With top Republicans anxious about what many view as the underwhelming state of the Republican field, Daniels was pressed to enter the race by close advisers and former Bush administration officials who worked with him when he served as White House budget director from 2001 to 2003. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who is expected to announce Monday in Iowa that he will seek the Republican nomination, issued a statement Sunday praising Daniels. ""Mitch Daniels is a friend of mine and one of the best governors in the country,"" Pawlenty said.  ""While he may not be running, he is an intellectual powerhouse and will continue to play a leading role in the party's politics and the nation's policies."" Pawlenty also said he and Daniels ""agree that America's out-of-control national debt is a threat to our nation's future, and that the next president must restore fiscal responsibility in Washington, DC."" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a top contender in 2008, is also expected to run. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has declared his candidacy. ""Mitch Daniels is a great governor and a remarkable innovator,"" Gingrich said in a statement Sunday.  ""Mitch has brought successful reforms to Indiana that should be replicated across the country and in Washington.  He will continue to be an important leader in solving America's problems."" Radio host Herman Cain has declared candidacy as well. Jon Huntsman, who recently stepped down as U.S. ambassador to China and is mulling a White House run himself, said ""Mitch Daniels will be missed in this presidential debate, but his message about the most immediate threat facing our nation -- the massive debt -- will not go unheard."" In his statement, Huntsman said he has ""learned a lot from (Daniels') leadership"" and looks ""forward to working with him to promote long-term solutions"" to problems facing the United States. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican Party powerhouse, said last month that he would not run, and encouraged Daniels to go for it. Indiana Democrats used Daniels' announcement to knock the Republican contenders.  ""We've disagreed with Mitch Daniels myriad times, but there's no doubt that his decision not to enter this race is a loss for Republicans,"" the Indiana Democratic Party said in a statement Sunday.  ""Daniels would have brought a serious tone to a GOP field that's thus far been characterized by silliness and distraction."" The killing of Osama bin Laden by Navy SEALs in Pakistan gave President Obama's popularity a big boost.  But America's economic recovery remains sluggish. If it stays weak, some believe, Obama is beatable next year. In considering a presidential bid, Daniels had publicly fretted about his family's well-being. His dramatic marriage -- he and his wife Cheri divorced, then re-married in the 1990s -- had recently spilled into public view. The famously private Cheri Daniels spoke at a spring fundraiser for the Indiana GOP this month, an event political observers watched closely to see whether the Daniels family was prepared to leap into the presidential fray. Even after the speech, the Indiana first lady said she was ""nervous"" about her personal life becoming public fodder. Daniels, too, seemed reluctant to join the race and openly questioned whether he had the desire to survive the long and exhausting marathon of running for president -- indecision that led some observers to dub him ""The Hoosier Hamlet."" ""Maybe I could do that, maybe someone else could do it better,"" Daniels said recently when asked whether he wanted to run. It seemed throughout the decision-making process that his advisers and supporters wanted him to run more than he did. ""If I have disappointed you, I will always be sorry,"" Daniels wrote in the late night e-mail. ""If you feel that this was a non-courageous or unpatriotic decision, I understand and will not attempt to persuade you otherwise. I only hope that you will accept my sincerity in the judgment I reached."" Daniels, who became Indiana governor in 2005, would have presented himself as the most fiscally conservative choice among the Republican presidential candidates. He flipped a state budget deficit into a surplus, reduced tax rates and passed a sweeping education reform package in the most recent legislative session. The announcement that Daniels will not run in 2012 comes a week after former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee announced he would not seek the nomination. Huckabee won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses in 2008 and was considered a top contender this time around. Flamboyant television personality and real estate magnate Donald Trump also said this month he would not seek the Republican nomination after appearing to position himself for .","NEW: Pawlenty, Gingrich, Huntsman praise Daniels .

"(CNN) -- Seven-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has once again denied claims from a former teammate that he used drugs during his cycling career. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drugs abuse in recent years with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Now, 39-year-old Armstrong has come out fighting once again, in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News ""60 Minutes"" show by another American Tyler Hamilton. Speaking on his Twitter page, Armstrong said: ""I have had a 20-year career, 500 drug controls worldwide, in and out of competition, and never a failed test. I rest my case."" In the CBS interview, to be aired on Sunday, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting substance EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton told the American news program. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" Hamilton added: ""Armstrong took what we all took -- the majority of the peloton took. There was EPO, testosterone, blood transfusions."" Armstrong, Hamilton and Landis were all members of the US Postal squad that is now the subject of a probe by U.S. federal investigators, who are trying to determine if their success came via a systematic doping program. Meanwhile, Armstrong's lawyer Mark Fabiani blasted the ""60 Minutes"" report, releasing a statement saying: ""Tyler Hamilton is seeking to make money by writing a book. ""He has completely changed the story he has always told before so that he could get himself on ""60 Minutes"" and increase his chances with publishers."" Fabiani continued: ""Greed and a hunger for publicity cannot change the facts: Lance Armstrong is the most tested athlete in the history of sports: He has passed nearly 500 tests over 20 years of competition."" Meanwhile, defending Tour de France champion Alberto Contador will find out next month whether he will be banned for doping. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and world's cycling's governing body (UCI) are appealing the Spanish cycling federation's (RFEC) decision to acquit the Spaniard over a failed doping case. Contador tested positive for a tiny amount of banned muscle-building substance clenbuterol during last July's Tour. But he was cleared to compete when the RFEC accepted the rider's claim that he had unknowingly eaten contaminated meat. The case has now gone to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which will decide Contador's fate on June 6-8. Meanwhile, on the road, Contador continues to blaze a trail in the Giro d'Italia, finishing second to Venezuela's Jose Rujano in the mountainous 13th stage to extend his overall advantage. Contador is now three minutes and nine seconds ahead of Tour of Spain champion Vincenzo Nibali in the general classification, following the arduous 167km stage up to Grossglockner in the Austrian Alps .","Lance Armstrong denies claims from a former teammate that he used drugs .

However, the Japanese Football Association was persuaded to revise its April 3 decision to pull out of the July 1-24 tournament, and had hoped to participate with a squad made up of its overseas stars. ""It is a great pity that we won't be able to take part in the tournament as the local people were preparing to welcome us,"" JFA president Junji Ogura told his association's website on Wednesday. ""We realized that we would not be able to form a squad good enough to play in the Copa America, and on that basis we had no choice but to give up the opportunity to play in the tournament."" JFA technical director Hiromi Hara met with officials at 11 clubs, but was told that they could not release the players because next season will start earlier than usual due to the mid-2012 staging of the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine. ""Many of our players have become top players at these clubs, and that is something to be pleased about,"" Hara said. ""Club officials told me they would understand if this was the Asian Cup or a one-off charity match, but they had a problem with it being the Copa America."" The JFA has made alternative plans to prepare for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers in September. The Samurai Blue will play Peru and the Czech Republic in the Kirin Cup in early June, and then take on South Korea in August in a friendly. Japan won the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar in January, beating Australia in the final under the guidance of coach Alberto Zaccheroni. ""This year has turned to be an exceptional year following the East Japan disaster, and we have been put into a situation where we have had to make a difficult decision,"" the Italian said. ""However, we would like to move on to set our full focus on our preparations for our important World Cup qualifiers."" The Copa America tournament traditionally features two guest nations and 10 from South America. Costa Rica will replace Japan, while Mexico will be the other team from outside the CONMEBOL federation.","Costa Rica to replace Japan at the Copa America football tournament in July .

"(CNN)  -- Bernard Hopkins erased the legendary George Foreman from the record books when he became boxing's oldest world champion with a points decision over Canadian Jean Pascal to win the World Boxing Council (WBC) light heavyweight title. Hopkins, who is 126 days beyond his 46th birthday, won the unanimous verdict of the judges after 12 rounds in the Bell Centre arena in Montreal Saturday night. The two had fought to a draw in December 18 in Quebec to deny Hopkins the crown. ""I have always fought with heart and courage to get a guy out of there,"" Hopkins told gathered reporters. ""You save the best for last. I want to go out a winner and not beat up, punch drunk and not broke."" Hopkins (52-5-2) is 24 days older than Foreman was when his fellow American defended the International Boxing Federation (IBF) title against Germany's Axel Schulz in 1995 with a split-decision victory. Foreman had claimed claimed the title the year before when he knocked out Michael Moorer in the 10th round to win the IBF and World Boxing Association (WBA) heavyweight crowns on November 5, 1994. Hopkins built up a big points lead through the middle rounds, but came under pressure in the closing stages as the 26-year-old Pascal rallied with home support. ""I am going to fight until I am 50,"" said Hopkins. ""I didn't feel like I am 46 but closer to 36. ""I worked hard for this. I have been accused of being boring but I just wanted to buy time and buy years. Before I leave this game you are going to see the best fights of Hopkins' career."" Pascal acknowledged he had been beaten by the better fighter but said he would learn from his loss. ""He's a great champion. These two fights will help take me to the next level. I learned a lot from Bernard and his style""","Bernard Hopkins claims WBC light heavyweight title from Jean Pascal .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's 24-match unbeaten run this season came crashing to a halt in an extraordinary, record-breaking schedule of English Premier League fixtures on Saturday. The leaders lost 2-1 at bottom club Wolverhampton on a day that saw title rivals Arsenal draw 4-4 with Newcastle, as an unprecedented 41 goals were scored in eight matches -- the previous record for one day was 36. French striker Louis Saha netted four times in Everton's 5-3 win over Blackpool while Wigan edged a seven-goal thriller against Blackburn. United ended the day four points clear of Arsenal, with Manchester City another point back on 49 after beating West Brom 3-0 thanks to a first-half Carlos Tevez hat-trick. Chelsea are 10 points adrift ahead of Sunday's home clash with Liverpool, which should see new signing Fernando Torres face his former team. Fifth-placed Tottenham beat Bolton 2-1 in the day's other lowest-scoring match, alongside Wolves-United, and even that game featured a missed retaken penalty and another awarded and then wiped out. Despite losing England defender Rio Ferdinand to a calf injury in the warm-up, United made the perfect start at Molineux as Nani fired home a left-foot shot in just the third minute. But Wolves leveled seven minutes later as fullback George Elokobi, who gave the Portugal winger far too much time and space in the penalty area, made amends with a header from Matt Jarvis' cross. The Cameroon-born defender was also involved in the winner, credited to striker Kevin Doyle, after the duo lunged to meet a free-kick by Serbian playmaker Nenad Milijas five minutes before halftime. United's much-vaunted forward line of Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov could not breach the Wolves defense, with the Bulgarian replaced by Javier Hernandez with a similar outcome despite five minutes of time being added on. The visitors could have ended the match with 10 men, but veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs was lucky to stay on after kicking out at Doyle. ""It's disappointing, it's been a long run for us,"" United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters after his team's first loss in 29 league games going back to last season. ""But we didn't get going really in the second half today. Wolves are a handful at set-pieces and they proved that again today."" Arsenal led 4-0 at 10th-placed Newcastle, but had to settle for a draw after French midfielder Abou Diaby was sent off soon after the halftime break. England forward Theo Walcott and Johan Djourou scored inside three minutes, then a double from Dutch striker Robin van Persie on 10 and 26 gave the London side an apparently insurmountable lead. But Joey Barton -- who was at the center of Diaby's dismissal -- reduced the deficit in the 68th minute with a penalty and the midfielder added another on 83 for 4-3 after striker Leon Best bundled in Jose Enrique's cross (75). Ivory Coast midfielder Cheik Tiote then volleyed a spectacular equalizer with two minutes to play, and Arsenal held on with another five added on. Manchester City won for the first time in four matches as Tevez celebrated his 27th birthday with three goals in 19 minutes at home to West Brom, two of them from the penalty spot. The Argentina forward is now the league's second-highest scorer on 18, one behind Berbatov, and City have not lost in a game when he has netted. His first was a penalty in the 17th minute, having earlier hit the post, while David Silva set up his second before West Brom went further behind following handball by Jerome Thomas. The result left Roberto Di Matteo's team just two points above the bottom three. Tottenham went ahead with Rafael van der Vaart's sixth-minute penalty at home to Bolton, and should have doubled the lead soon after but the Dutchman was made to retake his second spotkick and promptly missed the target for what would have been his 13th goal this season. Referee Mark Clattenburg awarded Spurs another penalty before halftime before realizing that Peter Crouch had been flagged offside. Loan striker Daniel Sturridge leveled with his second goal in two matches 10 minutes after halftime, but Croatian substitute Niko Kranjcar snatched victory for Tottenham with an injury-time strike to leave Bolton in eighth place. Sixth-placed Sunderland trail Tottenham by seven points after a 3-2 defeat Stoke, where Germany defender Robert Huth scored two late goals to put his team ninth. Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan had given the visitors the lead with his ninth goal this season, but Huth netted from Jermaine Pennant free-kicks with seven minutes to play and then in time added on. Wigan joined West Brom on 26 points after holding on at home to 11th-placed Blackburn, with James McCarthy scoring twice. Ben Watson's penalty made it 4-2 before David Dunn replied in kind with nine minutes left to set up a tense finish. Everton moved up to 13th place as Saha's four-goal salvo condemned Blackpool to a seventh defeat in eight league matches. The 32-year-old former France international leveled the game at 3-3 with his hat-trick, then sealed victory after Jermaine Beckford's spectacular volley. Fulham remained above Everton on goal difference after the London side continued to improve under Mark Hughes with a 2-2 draw at Aston Villa that left their opponents a point ahead of Blackpool in 14th. American Clint Dempsey earned the point with his 10th goal this season with 12 minutes to play, after on-loan defender Kyle Walker put Villa ahead from long range.","Manchester United lose 2-1 at bottom club Wolves as unbeaten run finally ends .

"(CNN Student News) -- April 26, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Missouri  • Syria • Libya . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A color change, an egg roll, and an extraordinary talk show host. CNN Student News is back -- and so am I -- to bring you 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines from around the world. First Up: Storm Aftermath . AZUZ: First up, police in Poplar Bluff, Missouri are going door to door, telling people to get out. That's because of concerns about a levee on the Black River. Levees are barriers that are designed to prevent flooding. But according to an alert that went out yesterday from the National Weather Service, this levee ""is weakening by the minute and may fail at any time."" It's another way that the state is suffering from the effects of severe weather. Poplar Bluff is about 130 miles south of St. Louis, and that's where this damage happened. Parts of St. Louis hammered by a tornado over the weekend. If you're in the path of a tornado, you've probably heard the big safety tips, which might include get in the basement if you're in a building that has one. Dan Simon is about to show you why. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN SIMON, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This was the most destructive tornado of the season. This is what an F-4 twister looks like. That assessment was made, in part, by the damage you see here at this house and what you're seeing throughout the Harmon Estate subdivision, where we are in Missouri. I believe we're in the kitchen area, and the reason why I'm saying that is because we see that the refrigerator is right here. In any event, the guy who lives here has had a really rough time. He actually works at the airport. He was there when the tornado struck. He and his colleagues hunkered down there. Then he got a phone call saying that maybe his home was destroyed. He drove here and this is what he saw. And there's something I want to point out here, because this is worth showing here on camera. You know how they always say that you should go to the basement. This is exactly why you should go downstairs to the basement during a tornado, because while the upstairs is gone, the house is destroyed, the basement is basically intact. You have a little bit of the roof coming down here from the rain, but for the most part, this basement is intact. The guy who lives here has a couple of dogs. The dogs actually took refuge in the basement and are OK. But here's why you should go to the basement during a tornado. (END VIDEO) New Alert System . AZUZ: The U.S. government's updating its terrorism alert system to let Americans know about possible threats, and the new version goes into effect today. And you might be familiar with the old, color-coded system. It was put in place after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. There were five colors, from green through red, that indicated risks from low to severe. Under this new system, announced by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano last week, there will be two kinds of alerts: an elevated threat and an imminent threat. Napolitano said the goal of this change is to help people understand the threat better. That way they can know how to react. When she announced the new system last week, Secretary Napolitano said there is currently no threat that would qualify for either of the two new alert levels. This Day in History . AZUZ: On this day in history, April 26th: In 1865, John Wilkes Booth was tracked down and killed 12 days after he assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. In 1986, unexpected problems during a mechanical test at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union led to the worst nuclear accident in history. And in 1994, South Africa began its first multi-racial elections, which would lead to Nelson Mandela becoming the country's first black president. Syria Unrest . AZUZ: The United States is threatening penalties. United Nations Secretary Ban Ki-moon is calling for an investigation. All of it has to do with what's going on right now in Syria. People in the city of Daraa, in southern Syria, have been protesting against their government for weeks. What we know is that Syrian military troops went into Daraa yesterday morning. What we don't know is what exactly happened next. Some reports, including from the United Nations, say the military forces just started attacking residents, killing several people. But the Syrian government says residents asked the military to come to Daraa in order to protect them from supposed terrorists there. CNN hasn't been able to verify the reports out of Syria because CNN is not allowed inside the country. NATO Strike . AZUZ: This is what Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's compound looked like after an airstrike hit it yesterday. The strike was carried out by NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That's the group that's leading the military operation in Libya. NATO says the target of the strike was a communications center that Colonel Gadhafi used to direct attacks against civilians. But a Libyan spokesman said NATO was trying to kill Gadhafi. He added, ""The message that was sent by NATO in the early hours... was sent to the wrong address,"" meaning that the attack missed Gadhafi. He also said the Libyan leader was still in command of the country. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's shoutout goes out to Ms. Capilla's students at Madrid Middle School in El Monte, California! According to a famous saying, what is the best medicine? If you think you know it, then shout it out! Is it: A) Love, B) Laughter, C) Money or D) Happiness? You've got three seconds -- GO! Laughter is the best medicine. That's how the saying goes, so that's your answer and that's your shoutout! TV Host Inspires Others . AZUZ: It's an idea that Zack Anner is certainly familiar with. He's a comedian and filmmaker, and he's about to add another title to that resume: TV host. But one thing Zack says he doesn't want to be called is inspirational. He might not think so. But after watching this report from our Dr. Sanjay Gupta, you might disagree. (BEGIN VIDEO) ZACH ANNER, TV TALK SHOW HOST: I come from a very creative family. My mother is a playwright; my dad made videos, too. So, it was a great place to be. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: When he was growing up, Zach Anner always knew he wanted to work in film. ANNER: It was always like, whatever you want to do, we can find a way to do it. GUPTA: Now, at 26, he lives in Austin and spends his days writing, editing and brainstorming with his production and support team, his friends. A year ago, Austin -- and really, the rest of the country -- didn't know who Zach was. And then he decided to enter a contest to become Oprah Winfrey's next TV talk show star. OPRAH WINFREY, TV TALK SHOW HOST: How old were you when you figured out that you were different than the other kids? ANNER: I knew that I had a wheelchair, obviously. They didn't shield that from me. GUPTA: As a result of the contest, Oprah gave Zach his own travel show, scheduled to air later this year. ANNER: That's what the travel show is, taking life as it comes. And whatever you run into, you just learn to roll with it. GUPTA: And rolling with life's obstacles, well, that's just what Zach does. ANNER: You gotta have a sense of humor about everything. Because humor is just pain with perspective. GUPTA: You see, Zach has cerebral palsy. It's a neurological disease that affects the brain's ability to control body movements. But having CP never stopped him from doing what he wants to do. ANNER: Everybody has problems, is what I always say. And like, mine are no bigger than anyone else's. And I think that's the message that I want to get across. What I've got to deal with is really small in the scheme of things. GUPTA: Zach gives his family a lot of credit for not dwelling on his disability. And his TV show won't either. He hopes some day to be an inspiration to others, but says he is not there yet and has this advice. ANNER: I would say to anybody who feels really like they are bogged down by their obstacles, just really think of who you are without those. And imagine yourself doing what you love to do, because that will drive you to do things you never thought you were capable of. GUPTA: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, reporting. (END VIDEO) iReport Promo . AZUZ: Excellent story there. All right, next today: Teacher Appreciation Week. It's next week. We're gonna give you the chance to brag about your favorite teachers. You know you love them. So, bust out the camera, shoot a quick video, and tell us who your favorite teacher is and why. Then we want you to go here. This is our home page. You're gonna scroll down to the ""Spotlight"" section, which you see over here. Click on the ""Send Us Your iReport"" link. And then maybe you'll see yourself -- and your teacher appreciation message -- on CNN Student News. Before We Go . AZUZ: Finally, before we go today, we want to check out a White House tradition. It's the annual Easter Egg Roll! President Obama playing referee for the competition, but the entire first family was there. Although, of course, the Easter Bunny was introduced first. The event included readings from popular children's books and a special tent for cooking presentations. Guests also had the chance to do some yoga on the White House lawn and run through an obstacle course. Goodbye . AZUZ: So, I guess the egg roll included a dairy dose of exercise, too. All right! We're gonna roll on out of here. But we'll be back tomorrow with another egg-cellent edition of CNN Student News. You saw that coming. We'll see you tomorrow.","See how a basement stood up to a tornado that destroyed the house above it .

"(WIRED)  -- Amazon and Barnes & Noble are duking it out over the respective battery lives of the Kindle and the new touch-screen Nook. The field of battle is the ghostly ground of press releases and promo-page blurb, and the last word seems to have been had by B&N. After B&N laid out the specs for its new e-reader, Amazon took issue with the numbers, saying that B&N's claim rested on usage tests of just a half hour of use per day, with wireless switched off. Amazon's usage tests assume an hour of use per day, also with wireless switched off. So what did Amazon do? It simply doubled the battery life on the product page to reflect a half-hour daily usage. Sneaky. WIRED: Barns & Noble slims, simplifies Nook e-reader . B&N countered with a very detailed statement, outlining the exact tests made. It also looks like the Kindle was also tested in the same way: . ""With up to two months on a single charge, the all-new Nook has the longest battery life in the industry and superior battery performance to Kindle 3. In our side-by-side tests, under the exact same conditions, continuous use of the device resulted in more than two times Kindle's battery life. ""While reading at one page a minute, the all-new Nook battery lasts for 150 hours, where the Kindle battery, using the same page-turn rate, lasts for only 56 hours (both with Wi-Fi off). "" WIRED: Despite reports, Nook competes just fine, thank you . We've also done a continuous page turn test and at one page turn per second, the all-new Nook offers more than 25,000 continuous page turns on a single charge. I love that B&N calls 150 just ""two times"" 56, when it could easily say ""almost three times."" That shows some confidence. However this works out, it's certain that both e-readers have insane battery life compared to any other kind of gadget. And if you're basing your decision on this spec alone, instead of depth of catalog and ease of use, then you're probably looking in the wrong direction.

"(CNN)  -- French football has been hit a 'race quota' row with the country's sports minister demanding clarification from the national federation of their policy. Reports allege that senior officials have secretly approved limiting the number of black and Arab trainees to 30 per cent from the age of 12-13 and that national team coach Laurent Blanc had approved the quota. Both the federation and Blanc issued denials Friday but minister Chantal Jouanno is seeking guarantees that there are genuine equal opportunities. ""Discrimination has no place in sport, whether it's in the stands or in the training academies,"" Ms Jouanno said. ""I take note of the French football federation's denial about the existence of such a policy and I invite it to very quickly shed light on the allegations in the article,"" she added in a statement released to CNN. The French investigative website Mediapart broke the story about a supposed secret quota Thursday. Quoting ""scandalized"" sources within the French Football Federation (FFF), it said the alleged directive from its National Technical Direction (DTN) had already been sent out to training academies. It further alleged that senior FFF members, including Blanc, had knowledge of the quota. ""A genuine segregation applied to football,"" it said. But Philippe Tournon, media officer for the French national team, said Laurent Blanc was outraged by the allegation. ""[He] categorically denies that he could have supported selections based on ethnicity or skin color,"" Mr Tournon said. ""It goes against his philosophy."" FFF president Fernand Duchaussoy also denied the reports Friday. ""I heard about this on Thursday with a great deal of surprise, I was taken aback. I thought it was a joke in bad taste. These are terrible accusations,"" he told AFP. Race became a controversial issue again in French football after the shambolic performance of the national team in last year's World Cup, where the players briefly went on strike. Accusations were made that the team, which had six black players, had mutinied in South Africa because of race. It contrasted with the euphoria around the 1998 World Cup winning-side when the nation adored its multi-ethnic team of ""Blacks, Blancs, Beurs"" - blacks, whites and Arabs.","French football hit by 'race quota' row at its national training centers .

"(CNN)  -- Francesca Schiavone returned ""home"" to the scene of her French Open triumph last year with an emphatic victory in her opener against 19-year-old American Melanie Oudin Monday. Schiavone, who beat Samantha Stosur in last year's women's singles final, showed her liking for the red clay of Roland Garros with a 6-2 6-0 rout of the unfortunate Oudin. The fifth-seeded Italian will meet Russian Vesna Dolonts in round two and on the evidence of her victory on the Philippe Chatrier will take some stopping. ""I'm still shaking a little bit,"" Schiavone told gathered reporters after her swift win. ""That court is fantastic because it's compact and the court is perfect. It goes all around you. ""It's like when you go home and your mum does everything for you and you feel comfortable. I felt like this, but with a lot of adrenaline."" Top seed Caroline Wozniacki later made light work of Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm in their first round match, winning for the loss of just two games. The Dane is bidding for her first grand slam title. Another pre-tournament favorite, Russian third seed Vera Zvonareva, also reached the second round by beating Spanish veteran Lourdes Dominguez Lino 6-3 6-3 on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Zvonareva was a losing finalist at both Wimbledon and the U.S Open last year. Her fellow Russian and 26th seed Nadia Petrova was a first day casualty, going down 6-7 6-3 6-4 to Australia's Anastasia Rodionova.","Francesca Schiavone wins opening match of her title defense at Roland Garros .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan showed up three weeks early at a Los Angeles jail to begin serving her sentence for a theft charge, but it was determined that she would be allowed to serve her time in home confinement, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said Thursday. Lohan was sentenced May 11 to 120 days in jail, but overcrowding at the facility and state rules could reduce the time she must be confined to her Venice, California, home to about two weeks, according to information previously provided by the sheriff's office. Lohan, 24, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor theft charge stemming from a January incident in which she apparently left a Venice jewelry store wearing a gold and diamond necklace for which she had not paid. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner gave the actress until June 17 to begin the sentence, but Lohan reported to the jail early Thursday, Whitmore said. Once there, it was determined that she was eligible for home confinement instead of jail, he said. The actress was fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor her movements and ensure she stays at home, except as allowed by the court, he said. Early release formulas, required by a federal order to reduce jail overcrowding, will likely reduce the sentence to about 14 days, Whitmore said after the sentencing. ""Because of budget constraints and because we're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation, nonviolent offenders, lesser crimes, get 20% of their sentence,"" the spokesman explained. Sautner remarked that the discounts on the sentences ""seems to be like shopping at Costco."" As part of Lohan's sentence, Sautner also ordered that the actress remain on supervised probation until she completes 480 hours of community service. But the judge rejected Deputy City Attorney Melanie Chavira's request for substance abuse counseling for the actress. Sautner said drugs and alcohol are not the root of Lohan's legal troubles, but ""she's got other problems for which she self-medicates."" Lohan's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007. Since then, she's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehabilitation programs. After her sentencing, the court released a probation report that said the actress ""appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues."" ""It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity,"" the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines. Lohan was not at the May 11 hearing, but her lawyer entered a no-contest plea -- equivalent to a guilty plea -- to the misdemeanor theft charge on her behalf. ""I am glad to be able to put this past me and move on with my life and my career,"" Lohan said in a written statement released by her lawyer. ""I support the judge's decision and hold myself accountable for being in this situation."" CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Lohan could have waited until June 17 to start her sentence .

"(CNN)  -- Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel led from start to finish to win the Malaysian Grand Prix at Sepang Sunday. It was the second straight victory for the reigning Formula One world champion after he claimed the season-opener in Australia a fortnight ago. Jenson Button finished second in his McLaren with Nick Heidfeld rewarded for his brilliant drive in the Renault with the final podium place. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber of Australia made up ground after a poor start to finish fourth. Veteran Heidfeld moved ahead of Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton into second position on the first corner and was always among the front runners through the pits stops. It was the start of a disappointing afternoon for 2008 champion Hamilton, who crossed the line seventh behind the Ferrari pair of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso in fifth and sixth. But he was later penalized 20 seconds by race stewards following a collision with Alonso as they battled for third spot on lap 46. It meant he was relegated to eighth spot behind Japan's Kamui Kobayashi in his Sauber. Alonso, who was also penalized, stayed sixth. Can Ferrari find some trump cards? But this was another dominant display by Germany's Vettel, who has now won fourth successive F1 races, claiming the final two of the 2010 season to wrap up the title. He qualified in pole position and quickly opened up an advantage which he comfortably maintained without real challenge. ""It was a great day,"" he told the official post-race press conference. ""The start was crucial. I had a good one, and then I was surprised going into turn one when I saw the Renault alongside me. ""I think it was a good thing because it meant I could pull away. ""We now have to take the momentum into the next race. It's two out of two, which is perfect, but we have to keep our feet on the ground."" Vettel leads 2009 champion Button by 24 points in the drivers' standings with Hamilton and Webber a further four points adrift. Completing the minor points scoring, seven-time champion Michael Schumacher was ninth for Mercedes. Tenth-placed Paul Di Resta scored another point for Force India in only the second F1 start for the young Briton.","Germany's Sebastian Vettel wins Malaysian Grand Prix for Red Bull .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Diego Rivera's ""Man at the Crossroads"" The moral: Never hire a communist to do a capitalist's job. During the Great Depression, Mexican artist Diego Rivera was on a roll. In 1931, he painted a massive mural for San Francisco's Pacific Stock Exchange. And by 1933, he'd completed two more enormous murals of Ford's assembly line for the Detroit Institute of Arts. But there was a disconnect in Rivera's work. Although the artist was a vocal and committed communist, his art was decidedly capitalist. After a few friends pointed out the hypocrisy, Rivera decided to put his paintbrush where his mouth was. Opportunity knocked in 1932, when the Rockefeller family hired Rivera to create one of his signature paintings in the lobby of the new RCA Building in Rockefeller Center. Their suggested theme for the work was ""Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future"" -- an allusion to the crossroads between industry and technology. Rivera's final product depicted a crossroads, but hardly in the way the Rockefellers had intended. Instead, the sprawling 63-foot masterpiece illustrated two alternate futures: a communist heaven and a capitalist hell. Rivera might have gotten away with his political statement if it hadn't been for one detail -- he painted his personal hero, Vladimir Lenin, into the piece. When building managers realized Rivera was filling their lobby with Red propaganda, they ordered him to cease and desist. To preserve the art, the Rockefellers asked Rivera to morph Lenin's portrait into an unrecognizable worker. But when the artist refused (Rivera offered instead to balance the picture with a portrait of Lincoln), he was paid his full fee, then barred from the site. The mural was immediately covered, and months later, workers were ordered to destroy the piece altogether. It wasn't long before the artist got his revenge. Later that year, Rivera re-created the piece for the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Only this time, he added a portrait to the capitalist side; it was of Nelson Rockefeller, holding a martini glass, under a swarm of syphilitic bacteria. Mental Floss: 5 geniuses who renounced their work . 2. Robert Arneson's ""Portrait of George"" The moral: If you're going to put the Mayor on a pedestal, don't build that pedestal with Twinkies. In 1978, after mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated, the city of San Francisco wanted to commemorate its fallen leaders. Officials set about building a new convention center in Moscone's honor, and held a competition for a proper memorial sculpture to be displayed in the lobby. Artist Robert Arneson quickly won over the selection committee with his proposal for a grinning, oversize bust of the slain mayor. But when the sculpture was unveiled in 1981, it was met with gasps of horror. The audience wasn't shocked by Moscone's smiling head, but by its nearly 5-foot-tall pedestal, which was imprinted with five bloody bullet holes and graffiti that read ""BANG BANG BANG"" and ""HARVEY MILK TOO."" Arneson even included an image of a revolver and a Twinkie -- a reference to the assassin, Dan White, who'd tried to exonerate himself in court by arguing that junk food binges were to blame for his violent mood swings. Arneson claimed he was trying to portray the totality of the crime, but San Franciscans wouldn't have it. Mayor Moscone's successor, Dianne Feinstein, denounced the work, and the city demanded its money back. A handful of people did appreciate the sculpture, though. A private collector purchased the piece immediately, and in 1997, ""Portrait of George"" resold for $155,000. Today, even Feinstein agrees the work would be ""appropriate for a museum."" Just don't count on it showing up in the Moscone Center lobby anytime soon. 3. Horatio Greenough's ""George Washington"" The moral: Founding Fathers look less distinguished in the nude. In 1832, Congress commissioned a giant sculpture of George Washington for the 100th anniversary of the president's birth. They tapped artist Horatio Greenough for the job, and he seemed like a perfect fit. Not only did the Boston native come with a great reputation, but he'd also trained in Rome with the best European artists. Considering Greenough's background, Congress assumed that his work might be classically influenced. What they didn't expect was to see the Founding Father on a pedestal, almost naked as the day he was born. To be fair, Horatio Greenough had good intentions. Inspired by ancient depictions of Greek gods, the artist wanted to portray America's first president with the strength of Zeus, bestowing power on the people. But when Greenough unveiled his work in the Capitol rotunda, the audience didn't get it. Instead of greeting the statue with thunderous applause, onlookers simply gawked and snickered at the half-naked George Washington. Wrapped loosely in a toga, the president looked out of character with his nipples and belly button exposed. Worse still, Washington's arm was extended outward in a grand gesture, and many in the crowd joked that the embarrassed president was trying to reach for his clothes. Congress was outraged. They tried to relocate the piece, eventually sticking it on the east lawn of the Capitol. By 1908, however, politicians had acquired a sense of humor about the sculpture, and the statue was moved to the Smithsonian. Today, it can be seen in all its naked splendor at the National Museum of American History. Mental Floss: 8 times museum patrons mangled works of art . 4. David Cerný's ""Entropa"" The moral: Not everyone appreciates racist, nationalist humor. On January 1, 2009, the Czech Republic took over the revolving presidency of the European Union, and to commemorate the event, the government turned to Czech artist David Cerný. For his piece, Cerný proposed working with 26 other artists, one from each EU member nation, to create a grand monument. But when ""Entropa"" was unveiled on January 12, the international community was scandalized. Rather than celebrating Europe, ""Entropa"" mocked each and every country. ""Entropa"" is a huge map in which each nation is represented as a stereotype. Some are silly; others are blatantly offensive. Romania is depicted as a Dracula theme park; Germany is a network of motorways that resembles a swastika; Sweden is a large, IKEA-style box; Bulgaria is a collection of squat toilets. Upon seeing the work, the Bulgarian government immediately issued a formal complaint. The controversy grew when newspapers noticed that Cerný's ""team"" of international artists was nowhere to be found. Cerný soon admitted that they didn't exist; his only collaborators were his two assistants. Outraged, Czech officials accused him of misappropriating state funds, but Cerný insisted that he'd always intended to return the money. Three days later, when the work was ceremonially presented to the public, Cerný formally apologized to the Czech government. He said his intention was ""to see if Europe is able to laugh at itself."" Apparently, it can't. Mental Floss: 9 really dangerous pieces of art . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com . Entire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.

"(CNN) -- The father of the woman who was dragged away by officials loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi after telling journalists that some of his troops had beaten and raped her said Monday that his daughter is in Qatar. Eman al-Obeidy, who garnered worldwide attention for her vocal allegations against Gadhafi's regime, had told CNN she fled Libya, fearing for her safety. Her father declined to provide further details about her whereabouts, but said he spoke to her Monday and she told him she is in Qatar. Al-Obeidy told CNN in a previous interview that she crossed into Tunisia on Thursday with the help of a defecting military officer and his family. She said she left Tripoli in a military car, wearing a head cover that hid everything except one eye. Al-Obeidy said she entered at the Dahibah border crossing disguised ""in the local manner"" and was not challenged. She described the trip from Tripoli as ""very tiring."" Along the road to Tunisia, the car she was in was stopped several times at checkpoints, al-Obeidy said. The military officer would show his permit and they would be allowed to continue, she said. Al-Obeidy said she was able to make the crossing by using a refugee document. European diplomats drove her from the border region to Tunis, and gave her sanctuary there while she considered her future, according to Western diplomatic sources. She said she was afraid she was being followed and might still be in danger, adding that she hoped she could obtain protection from a Western government. ""I still do not know what I am going to do. Of course I'd like to see my family,"" she said, speaking in Tunisia. Al-Obeidy's mother learned about her daughter's escape after seeing news reports on TV, her father told CNN from the family's hometown of Tobruk, Libya, on Sunday. Atiq Al-Obeidy said that his wife then called him, and both parents were overjoyed. Atiq Al-Obeidy admitted he was ""not optimistic"" that his daughter would be able to safely leave Libya, thinking forces loyal to Gadhafi ""would do the worst to her, given his past."" ""I am extremely delighted, and I will be looking forward to more information about how she was able to escape,"" the woman's father said Sunday. Eman al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26, when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast. She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men. In an interview with CNN last month, she said she felt defeated and lived in fear that she would be punished gravely for her words. ""I usually get harassed when I have to show my Identification card to government officials somewhere and they find out who I am and that I have put complaints forward against Gadhafi's people,"" she said. ""They humiliate me to the point where other people gather around and start saying that it is shameful to treat a Libyan woman that way."" The legal proceedings in her rape case have not gone far, she said last month. She also had not been able to go home. CNN's Khalil Abdallah, Nic Robertson, Amir Ahmed and Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","Eman al-Obeidy accused Libyan security forces of rape in March .

"(CNN) -- An Al Jazeera reporter who disappeared after landing in the Syrian capital of Damascus last month to cover anti-government protests has been released, the network said early Wednesday. The network said Dorothy Parvaz was safe and well in Doha, where her fiance had gone to greet her. The journalist will head to Canada. Al Jazeera lost contact with Parvaz after she disembarked from a Qatar Airways flight from Iran on April 29. In a statement last week, Syria said the 39-year-old journalist was taken into custody after she arrived in Damascus with an expired passport and deported to Iran two days later. But Iran's state news agency IRNA quoted Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi on Saturday as saying the Islamic republic had ""no information"" about her. A statement that Parvaz's fiance, Todd Barker, posted on the ""Free Dorothy Parvaz"" Facebook page indicated she had been taken to Iran. ""She said that she was treated well in Iran. She sounded positive and grateful for the support - but a little embarrassed. We are very thankful to Iranian authorities for her release and good treatment,"" the statement said. Added an Al Jazeera spokesman: ""We are with her now to find out more about her ordeal over the last 18 days."" Syria has been roiled for six weeks by anti-government protests and has largely prevented foreign journalists from covering the unrest. Media organizations have been relying on social media, eyewitness accounts and cell-phone video to report the story. Thousands of supporters from around the world started a social media campaign on Facebook and Twitter in an effort to draw attention to her disappearance. Dozens of international journalists have been detained and expelled from Syria since March 15, when anti-government protests began, said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists in the Middle East and North Africa.","NEW: Her fiance thanks Iran for Parvaz's release .

"(CNN)  -- South Africa fought back after Sachin Tendulkar's 99th international century to claim an unlikely three-wicket win over World Cup co-hosts India Saturday. India looked set to run up a massive score in Nagpur but after Tendulkar went for 111 they lost their last nine wickets for just 29 to be bowled out for 296. Paceman Dale Steyn did the damage with a brilliant five-wicket burst but it was still a tough total to chase on a slow pitch. Jacques Kallis, Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers all scored half centuries to keep them in the hunt before Faf du Plessis and JP Duminy plundered late runs. But 13 were still needed off the final over by seamer Ashish Nehra with Robin Peterson on strike and du Plessis at the other end. Only four balls were needed as Peterson hit a four, a massive six and then two runs to pull the scores level. A boundary through the covers clinched victory and left the Indians, who still top Group B, crestfallen. Earlier, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag put on 142 in just 17.4 overs in an explosive opening stand. Gautam Gambhir (69) joined Tendulkar in another century partnership and a score well in excess of 300 looked on the cards. But Steyn, who was named man-of-the-match for his inspired spell, turned the game his side's way after their disappointing defeat to England in their previous match. Tendulkar has scored 48 one-day international tons to add to his record 51 Test match centuries. Meanwhile, England off-spinner Graeme Swann has been fined 10 per cent of his match fee for his conduct in his side's shock World Cup defeat to Bangladesh Friday. Swann was openly furious that the night-time dew at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury stadium made it difficult for him to grip the ball.","South Africa beat co-hosts India in World Cup cricket match in Nagpur .

"(CNN) -- Canada secured only their second-ever win at the Cricket World Cup on Monday with a five wicket defeat of Kenya. The match in the Indian capital of Delhi was between two nations searching for their first victory of the tournament, and it was Pubudu Dassanayake's Canada who came out on top after they reached a target of 199 with 27 balls to spare. The result leaves Kenya bottom of Group A, with Canada one place above them in seventh after picking up their first points of the tournament. Eldine Baptiste's Kenya team batted for the full 50 overs for the first time at this World Cup, with all-rounder Thomas Odoyo their top scorer after he hit 51 runs off 62 balls. Canada responded superbly though, and a fourth-wicket stand of 132 runs between captain Ashish Bagai and Jimmy Hansra helped them towards their triumph. The North American nation's only previous win at cricket's premier 50-over competition was against Bangladesh in 2003. Canada's next match is against New Zealand, who are currently fourth in Group A with four points, on March 13. Kenya will go up against reigning champions Australia on the same day at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. Meanwhile, England were hit with an injury blow after it was announced that key batsman Kevin Pietersen will miss the rest of the tournament. The South-Africa born opener will return to England in order to have surgery on a hernia injury. ""Sad to leave India.. Love the people & the hospitality,"" Pietersen, 30, said via social-networking website Twitter. The International Cricket Council have granted England permission to call up 24-year-old Eoin Morgan as a replacement. Morgan, who represented Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, was initially ruled out of the competition with a finger injury.","Canada win only their second-ever Cricket World Cup match after beating Kenya .

"(CNN) -- An explosive century from birthday boy Ross Taylor helped New Zealand crush Pakistan by 110 runs and go top of their group at the Cricket World Cup. Taylor hit an unbeaten 131 off just 124 balls as the Kiwis smashed an incredible 100 runs off the final five overs of their innings. New Zealand looked set to post a modest total as they labored to 164-4 with ten overs remaining but fireworks from Taylor -- who hit seven sixes -- and Jacob Oram saw them amass 138 more runs. Finishing on 302-7 off their 50 overs the Kiwis shell shocked Pakistan, who contributed to their own downfall with sloppy fielding and poor bowling. Pakistan then slumped to 23-4 in their reply and only a partnership of 66 between Abdul Razzaq (62) and Umar Gul (34 not out) added a modicum of respectability to their total of 192. The only negative for New Zealand was an injury to their captain Daniel Vettori who limped off after diving to stop a ball in the field. Martin Guptill got New Zealand off to a brisk start as he compiled 57 runs but it was Taylor who held the innings together. Brendon McCullum, Jamie How and James Franklin went for low totals but Scott Styris steadied the ship with 28 runs. At 164-4 though, New Zealand were looking as if they would post a below-par total. Taylor was dropped twice early in his innings, with wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal at fault, but he made the most of his reprieve with some devastating hitting, taking 24 runs off a Shoaib Akhtar over and 30 off one from Abdul Razzaq. Jacob Oram also chipped in with three sixes as New Zealand transformed their innings and finished with 302. Tim Southee then took three wickets as Pakistan faltered in their reply with Styris, Kyle Mills and Nathan McCullum also taking two wickets apiece. New Zealand are now top of Group A, replacing Pakistan. Elsewhere, England were dealt another injury blow after bowler Stuart Broad was ruled out of the World Cup. Broad is suffering from a side strain picked up in the win over South Africa and will return to England soon. His injury comes just two days after batsman Kevin Pietersen was forced to pull out of the tournament with a hernia. His replacement, Eoin Morgan, joined up with the England squad on Tuesday.","New Zealand beat Pakistan by 110 runs at the Cricket World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Ratko Mladic, the onetime Bosnian Serb commander accused of presiding over Europe's worst massacre since World War II, was in custody Thursday after more than 15 years in hiding, Serbia's president announced. Mladic was the highest-ranking war crimes suspect to remain at large from the wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. He was arrested in the Serbian town of Lazarevo after a three-year investigation, President Boris Tadic said in a dramatic and hastily announced news conference in Belgrade. ""All war criminals must face justice,"" Tadic said. He refused to give more details about the operation but said Serbian authorities continue to probe ""who aided and abetted Mladic ... and those people will face justice."" Mladic, now 69, led Bosnian Serb forces during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession from Yugoslavia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has charged him with leading a genocidal campaign against Bosnia's Muslim and Croat populations and with having ""direct involvement"" in the 1995 killings of nearly 8,000 men and boys in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. He was transferred from Lazarevo, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Belgrade, to courthouse in the capital for a preliminary hearing after his arrest, and the tribunal said it looked forward to his ""expeditious transfer"" to the Hague, Netherlands, for trial. Once there, he will be allowed to enter a plea to the charges against him, which include genocide, crimes against humanity and violating the laws of war, according to a statement from the court. ""The arrest of Mladic is a milestone in the Tribunal's history and brings the institution closer to the successful completion of its mandate,"" the tribunal said. The sole remaining fugitive from the court is former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic, ""and the Tribunal hopes he will be arrested in the very near future."" Mladic is accused of leading a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing,"" widespread killing, forcible deportations, torture, forced labor and physical, psychological and sexual violence during the Bosnian war. But he remains a hero to some of his former soldiers, said David Owen, a former European Union envoy to Yugoslavia, suggesting that his supporters had sheltered him in Serbia. The international police agency Interpol praised the arrest as ""a triumph for international justice."" Interpol officials had met with Tadic in January to discuss closer cooperation in the hunt for war crimes suspects, the organization's secretary-general, Ronald Noble, said in a statement on Mladic's capture. ""After today's arrest, no one should doubt Serbia's commitment to the rule of law and justice,"" Noble said. Tadic said the arrest will help the process of reconciliation throughout the Balkans and should pave the way for Serbia's entry into the EU. James Ker-Lindsay, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science, called Thursday ""an incredibly important day for Serbia."" ""Ratko Mladic was the person to get hold of. This totally transforms Serbian prospects for getting into the European Union,"" he said. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton hailed the arrest as a victory for ""the rule of law in Serbia"" and praised Tadic and his government for ""this courageous action."" Ashton called for the quick transfer of the suspect to the Netherlands for trial. But Tadic declined to say how long the extradition would take, explaining it was not up to him. Mladic had been on the run since the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended in 1995. The Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List was the first to report his arrest, saying police were doing DNA tests on a suspect to determine whether he was the notorious former commander. Mladic was the last fugitive from a triumvirate of Serbian leaders accused of genocide against Muslims and Croats as the three populations fought a brutal war over Yugoslav territory. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was toppled in 2000 and sent to face charges in The Hague. He died in 2006 while the trial was still going on. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in July 2008 and is now on trial in The Hague. Karadzic was removed from power under the Dayton Peace accords that ended three years of brutal fighting. He went into hiding, grew a full white beard and long hair, and was working in an alternative medicine clinic in Belgrade -- right under the noses of authorities -- when he was captured. Karadzic has insisted on defending himself at The Hague. Prosecutors accuse him of deliberately obstructing the trial with delaying tactics, and judges have threatened to impose a defense lawyer on him if he does not cooperate. The Bosnian war was the longest of the conflicts spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the Milosevic government, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations. The United Nations declared Srebrenica to be a safe haven, and tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims flooded in, expecting protection. But a small contingent of Dutch U.N. peacekeepers, lightly armed and aware that no reinforcements were coming, stood aside and allowed Mladic's troops to overrun Srebrenica, leading to the slaughter. NATO intervened in the conflict, bombing Bosnian Serb military positions. The United States brought the leaders of the warring factions to an agreement in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995, bringing the violence to an end. CNN's Joe Sterling, Moni Basu and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","NEW: Mladic has been transferred to a courthouse in Belgrade .

"(CNN)  -- They've already conquered YouTube. Now, a dream team of viral video superstars is hoping to hit the big screen. On Monday, the masterminds behind ""The Chronicles of Rick Roll"" released a four-minute trailer they hope will help them finish bankrolling a feature-length film. The video, an update of a shorter, more cryptic teaser trailer that has been circulating online for a few weeks, features Antoine ""Bed Intruder"" Dodson, Bear ""Double Rainbow"" Vasquez and Gary ""Numa Numa"" Brolsma among others. Executive producer Andrew Fischer estimates the half-dozen internet meme makers in the trailer have accounted for more than 2 billion page views combined (including, he said, copycat versions of their videos and views on sites other than YouTube). He said he's hoping the film, for which he said he's still pursuing additional financial backing, ""will quite literally market itself."" Others in the low-budget trailer include Brian ""Boom Goes the Dynamite"" Collins, Ben ""Leeroy Jenkins"" Schulz and Steven and Jack Quire, the brothers from the ""Freakout Kid"" video. No word on whether ""David After Dentist"" or the dramatic chipmunk were unavailable. Fischer, who also wrote the script and appears as title character ""Rick Rolland"" (a role he said he'd happily hand over to a more professional actor), said the trailer was shot in Colorado in January. ""Everyone was pretty excited from the beginning and everyone really enjoyed working together, too,"" he said. ""That's one of those dynamics -- you don't know how it's going to turn out, but it went really well."" All of the video stars were asked to stay quiet about the ultimate goal of the filming until now, Fischer said. ""We're obviously all hoping to be working again in the near future,"" he said. The trailer, which Fischer previewed for CNN earlier Monday, comes across as a tongue-in-cheek take on epic adventures such as ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""The Lord of the Rings."" In it, the main character is transported into a woodsy realm called ""Middle Internet"" to rescue a girl he met on a dating site. With the help of the viral stars, he battles evil creatures such as living, breathing pop-up ads. Fischer said he hopes the new trailer will help convince financial backers to jump onboard. He said he also hopes it will help dispel the theory that the whole thing is just a big joke. Some, including fans of the movie's Facebook page, have questioned whether it's all a setup. After all, the movie's name is a reference to a viral online trick. Fischer acknowledged a grand con would be fun but said that's not what's going on. He's put the name of his production company, NURV, behind it -- not to mention the money spent to record a theater-quality trailer, he said. ""That would be a lot of money to waste on a RickRoll,"" he said. ""We have a reputation to keep. We're not going to put something on IMDB, do all of these press interviews and put a trailer out just for a joke. I'd never be able to do anything again."" NURV, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, specializes in viral marketing, video production and editing and other media-related jobs. The movie effort isn't Fischer's first time embarking on a high-profile, unconventional Web-based venture. In 2005, Fischer grabbed international attention by auctioning off advertising space on his forehead on Ebay. The winners, a stop-snoring-fast company, paid him more than $37,000 for a temporary tattoo.","Dream team of viral video YouTube stars hopes to hit big screen in comedy-movie project .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The deadly protests in northern Afghanistan over a Quran burning spread to the country's war-torn southern region on Saturday, with provincial government officials reporting at least nine civilians dead and dozens injured. The violence struck the city of Kandahar when demonstrators took to the streets to protest the torching of Islam's most sacred book by a U.S. church. The unrest followed a demonstration on Friday in the northern town of Mazar-e Sharif, in which five demonstrators and seven U.N. employees were killed when an angry throng stormed the U.N. compound there. U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday extended condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in Mazar-e Sharif, but also decried the burning of the Quran. ""The desecration of any holy text ... is an act of extreme intolerance and bigotry,"" he said in a statement released by the White House. ""However, to attack and kill innocent people in response is outrageous, and an affront to human decency and dignity."" Besmellah Afghanmal, a Kandahar provincial council member, said hundreds gathered in Kandahar city to protest the Quran burning. ""Today the enemies of peace in Afghanistan killed and injured our people in Kandahar,"" said a statement from the office of the Kandahar governor. The demonstration started peacefully, but protesters turned violent, setting fire to a school and vehicles in Kandahar city, said Zalmai Ayoubi, spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province. Along with the nine deaths, 73 others were injured, the provincial government said. Ayoubi said Afghan security forces arrested 17 people, including seven who were armed and are suspected of shooting at protesters. Pastor Terry Jones sparked international controversy last year when his Gainesville, Florida, church planned ""International Burn a Quran Day"" on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Jones' church did not host a Quran burning on that day, but the Dove World Outreach Center's website announced an ""International Judge the Koran Day"" set for last month. Another post on the site's blog showed an image of a burning book and read, ""The event is over, the Koran was found guilty and a copy was burned inside the building."" Some witnesses in Kandahar said protesters were shot by police. ""I saw personally three people who (were) shot to death, and one of them was shot just next to me,"" protester Shah Meer said. But police said they neither shot at nor killed anyone. ""There (was) gunfire into the air in order to bring the people under control, and luckily not one has been killed as a result of the gunfire,"" said Zemarai Bashari, spokesman for the interior ministry. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Taliban said the group was not behind any deaths during the event. ""What happened in Kandahar today was the feeling of the nation, and the Islamic movement of the Taliban was not involved in any (violence),"" Zabiullah Mojahed said. ""It was the Afghan police that killed the innocent people of Kandahar while they were expressing their feeling against the burning of holy Quran in Florida."" The Mazar-e Sharif killings generated worldwide condemnation, from the U.N. Security Council to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 57-state group that calls itself the ""collective voice of the Muslim world."" Jones in a statement Friday called the assault ""a very tragic and criminal action."" Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the police in Mazar-e Sharif, told reporters that a number of suspects ""who might be the main organizers"" had been arrested from the Friday attack . The United Nations says the seven U.N. staffers killed were four Nepalese security guards and three civilians. A U.N. source said the three civilians were from Norway, Sweden and Romania. U.N. Peacekeeping Director Alain Le Roy said five demonstrators also were killed. He said no Afghan U.N. staff members were among the dead, he said. ""I understand there were hundreds, if not thousands, of demonstrators. Some of them were clearly armed and they stormed into the building,"" Le Roy said. He said the security guards tried their best to halt the demonstrators' advance, but were overwhelmed. Le Roy said it was not clear that the United Nations was the target. ""It happened to be the U.N. because the U.N. is on the ground."" Another 24 people were wounded, said Abdul Rauof Taj, security director of Balkh province. The U.N. Security Council met Friday and issued a statement condemning the attack, which occurred at the operations center of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA. Haji Sakhi Mohammad, a businessman in Mazar-e Sharif, said the incident began after Friday prayers, when many people joined a protest against the burning of the Quran. People calling ""Death to America"" marched to the U.N. compound and broke in, he said. Gunfire broke out, and ""I saw protesters shot to death,"" he said . A student in Mazar-e-Sharif said he and his friends joined the protesters, who numbered in the hundreds. ""When we reached the UNAMA office, we came under gunfire by Afghan security guards. Protesters became angry and stormed the building."" Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the Quran burning during a speech before Pakistan's legislature on March 22. ""May I, at the outset, strongly condemn on behalf of the people of Pakistan and on my own behalf the deliberate desecration of the holy Quran by a fanatic in Florida,"" he said, according to a transcript of speech. ""We condemn this act in the strongest possible words. ... It is a serious setback to the efforts at promoting harmony among civilized communities throughout the world.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese regulators discounted concerns about damage to the still-potent spent fuel from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's No. 4 reactor Thursday, saying high radiation levels reported earlier this week ""most probably"" came from outside debris. A high reading above the pool prompted the plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, to take a sample from the spent fuel pool on Tuesday. But the radiation levels are far lower than they would be if there were damage to the fuel rods, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, the chief spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Commission. ""We need more analysis to identify the precise status of the spent fuel in unit 4,"" he said. Tokyo Electric said Thursday night that the sample was the first time they have taken a reading off one of the spent fuel pools. The water temperature in the No. 4 pool was 90 degrees Celsius, more than twice a normal reading, and more coolant water was poured into the reservoir on Wednesday. The company said it suspects the fuel rods were damaged due to insufficient coolant at some point since the crisis began, but could not clarify the timing. Nishiyama told reporters Thursday evening that the fuel rods have not suffered ""any particular damage."" Officials are still looking at the readings from that water sample before reaching a final conclusion, but said the radiation reading was ""most probably due to debris"" blown into the badly damaged housing around the No. 4 reactor. The Tokyo Electric Power Company reported a cumulative radiation reading above the pool at 84 millisieverts on Tuesday, about a third of the annual allowable dose for plant workers during the emergency. Water samples from the pool showed a concentration of radioactive iodine-131, the most commonly measured reactor byproduct, at 220,000 bequerels per liter -- more than 730 times the amount considered safe for drinking water in Japan. Outside observers have expressed concerns about the status of the spent fuel in reactors 1, 3 and 4 several times during the month-long crisis at Fukushima Daiichi, about 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Temperature sensors in those pools have been out since mid-March, and workers have been spraying water into the damaged housings of those reactors on a near-daily basis to keep them topped off. The battle began March 11, when the tsunami that followed Japan's magnitude 9 earthquake knocked out the plant's cooling systems. Tokyo Electric estimated the height of that wall of water at 14 to 15 m (45 to 48 feet) -- a level Nishiyama said would be the new standard for barriers around Japanese nuclear power plants. The sea wall around Fukushima Daiichi was 5 m. In the aftermath of the tsunami, the cores of three of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors were damaged by overheating and resulting hydrogen explosions blew apart the buildings surrounding reactors 1 and 3. The vast amount of radiation released from the plant, largely in the first two weeks of the disaster, prompted Japanese authorities to rate the crisis at the top of the international scale that measures nuclear accidents. The Level 7 designation puts Fukushima Daiichi on par with the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the former Soviet Union, though Japanese authorities say their plant has spewed only 10 percent of the radioactivity that was emitted from Chernobyl. Plant workers have been pouring hundreds of tons of water a day into the three reactors that were damaged in the aftermath, and at least one of the reactors, in unit 2, is believed to be leaking highly radioactive water. Radioactive contamination spread across a wide swath of land around the plant and into the adjacent Pacific Ocean, though data released by government ministries has shown a decline in radiation levels in recent weeks. Engineers have taken steps this week toward containing the disaster, pumping radioactive water from service trenches and tunnels into a storage reservoir for No. 2 reactor's steam condensers. And they are laying the piping needed to transfer an estimated 10,000 tons into a facility designed for treating low-level radioactive waste Tokyo Electric said Thursday. The company dumped more than 9,000 tons of less-radioactive water into the Pacific last week to make room for the more-dangerous fluid believed to be leaking from reactor No. 2 -- a move Japanese authorities described as an emergency measure, but one that enraged the country's fishermen. The government issued expanded evacuation orders Monday for several towns outside the 30-kilometer radius that was declared a danger zone in the early days of the disaster, warning that prolonged exposure to radiation levels there could pose a long-term danger to human health. And Japanese government data this week reported finding low levels of radioactive strontium, another reactor byproduct, in two of those towns in the days after the disaster. Strontium-90 is considered a health hazard not only because of its 29-year radioactive half-life but because a portion of it gets absorbed by bone if ingested, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There is no acceptable standard for strontium under Japanese regulations, but Japan's science ministry said the reported figures were not high enough to pose an immediate danger to human health. The Japanese government has tried to limit the damage done to farmers in Fukushima and other prefectures where contamination from the plant has been found, lifting bans on farm products from surrounding areas if they pass three tests in three successive weeks. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the government's point man on the crisis, announced Thursday that kakina, a leafy green, from Tochigi Prefecture was now safe for shipment. The move follows a ban on outdoor-grown shiitake mushrooms from 16 towns and villages neighboring damaged plant to the country's banned food list Wednesday.

"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- Authorities in Missouri will release Friday an updated list of people who are still missing after the tornado that devastated the region. This list will be an update of the tally of 232 missing people the Missouri Department of Public Safety released Thursday. As officials worked to ensure the community was up-to-date, some residents got answers on the fate of loved ones following  the massive tornado that hit the Missouri city of Joplin on Sunday. Michelle Hare said she learned that her 16-year-old son had been confirmed dead. Lantz was ripped from a car Sunday night by winds exceeding 200 mph, and was one of the people named Thursday. Authorities also said 126 people had died from the storm, making the tornado the single deadliest  to touch down in the U.S. since modern record-keeping began  in 1950. The Hares had been among many around Joplin, still desperately searching for missing loved ones. But one of the frustrations was  a holdup  at the morgue. Some were told that they may have to wait for two weeks  before they can visit the morgue to search for relatives. A local coroner said that this will change for some Friday as some people will be allowed into the morgue to identify family members if they know unique characteristics such as tattoos. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said the sheer magnitude of the storm has made the process of identifying victims difficult and will mean that some of the bodies will have to be identified by DNA. ""This is not a series of bodies lying in a row that are easily identifiable. There are pieces of folks,"" Nixon told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""There are very, very difficult scenes. It's not as easy as walking down a row and being able to instantly identify."" And many of the people who survived the powerful storm had stories to tell. Aaron Cox said after the storm, he frantically tried to find his sister. Unlike many others in Joplin, Cox  said he found his sister while frantically searching through leveled streets that were barely recognizable. ""I've lived in Joplin my entire life. But everything was so leveled. You had no idea where you were... With the street signs gone. There was no houses, no trees, no nothing,"" said Cox, who documented his search for his sister on video. ""It was just completely barren.""

"Al-Zarqa, Jordan (CNN) -- Several civilians and scores of police officers were injured Friday when pro-monarchy supporters clashed with hard-line Islamic activists in this city a half hour northeast of the capital. The confrontation between government loyalists with dozens of Salafi jihadists -- followers of a strict interpretation of Islam who advocate jihad -- brought a violent end to what had been a largely peaceful demonstration during which protesters demanded the release of 200 jihadists being held in Jordanian prisons. The incident occurred as vehicles carrying Salafi activists came under a barrage of stones as they were leaving the city, the birthplace of former al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. As the clashes between stone-hurling loyalists and knife-wielding Salafis escalated, police fired tear gas to disperse them and traded a volley of stones with Salafi supporters, witnesses said. After the incident, Jordanian public security department chief Hussein Majali told reporters that 83 police officers sustained injuries -- including knife wounds -- in what he described as a ""premeditated attack"" by the Salafis. Of the total, 32 officers suffered smoke inhalation due to misfired tear gas, he added. Shiekh Saad Hneiti, a senior leader of the Jordanian Salafist movement, denied that there had been any premeditated attack, insisting that protesters picked up arms only in self-defense after coming under attack by pro-monarchy supporters. ""We were observing our right to peacefully express our opinions when we were attacked by plain-clothed security agents,"" Hneiti told CNN. He added that two members and a senior leader of the movement were hospitalized with mild to severe injuries following the incident. Hneiti vowed that Jordan's jihadists will continue to demonstrate in the streets until their demands are met. ""Our demands are pure and just and clear: we want our brothers freed from prison and to be governed by the Holy Quran, which most Jordanians support,"" Hneiti said. ""You can attack us, you can imprison us, but you can't stop the will of the Muslim nation."" During Friday's two-hour demonstration, held at al-Zarqa's Omar bin Khatab Mosque, some 1,000 participants chanted slogans including ""The people want Sharia law,"" ""Down with America,"" and ""No to democracy, no to racism, no to globalism, only Islam."" Salafi jihadists are among several groups taking advantage of newfound freedom in Jordan, holding demonstrations across the country over the past month, calling for the release of imprisoned jihadists, and for the implementation of Sharia law. Unlike pro-democracy activists who have held weekly demonstrations across the Hashemite Kingdom since early January, Salafis reject calls for political reform as they view the Jordanian regime as ""un-Islamic."" The scene in Amman was more peaceful. There, more than 1,000 people marched Friday demanding democratic and economic reforms, protesting corruption and calling for social justice and constitutional changes. The protesters, from many political parties and opposition groups, took to the streets of the capital city demanding governmental and constitutional reforms and an end to what many call government corruption amid tight security from hundreds of police and security personnel. Laila Naffa, 66, a leader of the Communist Party -- one of the main political parties demanding reform -- said that, amid ongoing revolutions across the Arab world, Jordanians too want change. ""Today with the revolutions sweeping the Arab world, Jordanians are taking to the street asking for the same slogans, freedom, social justice, because after the signing of the Wadi Araba Treaty with Israel, things have been deteriorating,"" Naffa said. The 1994 treaty normalized relations between the two countries. ""Now we are asking to reform the system, freedom rights for legalizing political parties and for getting rid of the current political parties law, calling (for) and demanding free elections under the auspices of the judiciary control, reform of the constitution. ... This should be done through national dialogue and by the king to assure this will be implemented,"" she added. Local media reported similar protests Friday in other cities, including Karak in the south and Irbid in the north. Jordanians have held regular protests since January. Most of them, unlike demonstrators in Arab countries that have seen uprisings, have not been seeking regime change but changes to the regime. In February, King Abdullah II sacked his prime minister and cabinet and instituted a number of economic measures and promises of political reform in an effort to appease those demands. But the protesters' list of demands grew longer as many Jordanians felt emboldened by the popular uprisings in the region. Although the protests in Amman have been largely peaceful, more than 100 people were injured and one person died last month when pro-government loyalists attacked anti government protesters with sticks and stones. A CNN team at the protest reported that police forces used water cannon and batons to disperse a sit-in in a main Amman square. Mohamad Khateeb, a spokesman for the public security directorate, said Friday's demonstrations in Amman were peaceful. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Kareem Khadder and Journalist Taylor Luck contributed to this story.","NEW: Several civilians and scores of police officers hurt in al-Zarqa .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Last night, Lady Gaga's ""Born This Way"" (out Monday) leaked online. The contents of the disc haven't been a total mystery -- Gaga's released four singles from the album, her third, since February, and has performed other songs from it in concert -- but she still managed to pack in some surprises. Here, Rolling Stone senior critic Jody Rosen goes through the album song by song. ""Marry the Night"" -- It begins big, with Gaga belting ""I'm gonna marry the night/I won't give up on my life"" over tolling, church-like synths. And it just gets bigger. And bigger. And bigger still. The chorus arrives in an eruption of drums and power chords; there's a pummeling funk-rock breakdown; and the touchstones are Eighties arena pop and hair metal: Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler, Bon Jovi. ""Born This Way"" -- Yeah, yeah: it's an ""Express Yourself"" bite. And yes: you've heard the song 700 hundred times in the last month. But Gaga's big hit sounds different in the context of the album that shares its name: like an experiment in the audacious plus-sizing of Eighties dance-pop. ""Government Hooker"" -- The requisite ""kinky"" song -- though what exactly Gaga is saying here isn't clear: ""I'll be your hooker/Government hooker,"" ""I could be Mom/Unless you want to be Dad."" But the techno-pop production, by DJ White Shadow, is gripping: a shape-shifting assemblage of buzzes, beeps and clattering beats. Choice couplet: ""Put your hands on me/John F. Kennedy."" ""Judas"" -- ""Wear an ear condom"" next time, Gaga sings in a track with one of the catchiest choruses on an album devoted to catchy choruses above all. Gagaologists will spend years pouring over the runes of that rapped bridge. (""But in the cultural sense/I just speak in future tense,"" etc.) The rest of us will be busy dancing to Red One's walloping production. (Watch the video.) ""Americano"" -- The campiest song Gaga's recorded yet, which is saying something. A disco-fied showtune with a pronounced ""Latin""-flavor, complete with flamenco guitars and castanets. Possibly about a star-crossed lesbian romance. Definitely set in East Los Angeles. Completely hilarious. ""Hair"" -- Gaga is not the first songwriter to link self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure. (Remember that rock musical called, um, ""Hair""? Remember ""Whip My Hair""?) But she's definitely the most committed. ""I am my hair!"" she cries. Red One supplies the gale force hair-tousling synths. ""Scheiße"" -- Gaga speaks a little German and intones some inspirational platitudes alongside some generic Eurodisco thump and a wisp of a chorus. ""Bloody Mary"" -- A sluggish tempo, goofy ""goth"" atmospherics and a lyric that sounds like bad high school poetry: ""We are not just art for Michaelangelo to carve/He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart."" ""Bad Kids"" -- In which Gaga reminiscences about her misspent youth and croons an ode to juvenile delinquents, set to forgettable Eighties synth-pop. ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"" -- Gaga does her best Springsteen. Or is it Meatloaf? ""Get your hot rods ready to rumble/'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight/Get your hot rods ready to rumble/'Cause we're gonna drink until we die."" Sublime schlock, with the biggest, thuddingest drum sound you've heard this century. ""Heavy Metal Lover"" -- More smutty talk, set against a wall of fuzzy synthesizer sound. ""I want your whiskey mouth/All over my blond south,"" Gaga commands. ""Electric Chapel"" -- It earns its title with some heavy guitar riffing and a squealing metal solo towards the end. The lyric holds out hope for monogamous romance: ""Together we'll find a way/To make pure love work in a dirty way."" ""You and I"" -- Gaga's signature power ballad -- a fan favorite since she first played it live in 2009 -- gets the treatment it merits. Produced by ""Mutt"" Lange, guitar solo by Queen's Brian May, with a torrid, sturm und drang vocal turn by Gaga. It's a confession. (Gaga watchers speculate it's about her on-again off-again boyfriend Luc Carl.) It's also the greatest Def Leppard song Lady Gaga has ever written. ""The Edge of Glory"" -- Those hooks! That chorus! That Clarence Clemons sax solo! ""Born This Way"" goes out in a blaze of shlock-pop glory.(Listen.)

"(CNN) -- At first, Dutch artist Christien Meindertsma thought she would pick one cow and document all of the uses to which it would ultimately be put. ""But when I thought about it more, I realized that in the Netherlands you see a lot of cows still standing outside in the landscape, but you never see a pig. I thought that was strange, because there are 12 million of them this very small country.

""What I learned from doing it is that the product world is more complicated then you can imagine and that we have no clue of what is in the products that surround us,"" she told CNN.

"(CNN) -- The tornado-ravaged city of Joplin, Missouri, is an authentic American crossroads, a truck stop and regional mecca with a rich mining heritage that straddles a cultural vein linking the Great Plains and the Ozarks. Hugging Missouri's southwestern border, Joplin is bigger and more influential than the dot on the U.S. map may indicate, and really can't be defined without recognizing its importance as a hub, its current and former residents say. The city numbers about 50,000, its two-county metro area in Missouri is about 175,000, and thousands more people live in neighboring regions of Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. In fact, the city says, there are about 400,000 people in a 40-mile radius of the city, making it Missouri's fourth-largest region. It is inextricably tied -- economically and culturally -- to the smaller communities around it, as people in nearby hamlets travel to Joplin for employment, medical care, a movie on Friday night, or a late night stopover on a journey. And, Joplinites have jobs in other towns outside the city. ""It's easy to look at us and say we're this little hillbilly town in southwest Missouri,"" said Virginia Laas, professor of history emeritus at Missouri Southern State University. ""I think it's unfair."" Founded in the late 19th century, the Joplin area and neighboring parts of Kansas and Oklahoma constituted a major center of zinc and lead mining, starting out with individual operators and followed by bigger companies. ""There's is a real spirit of individualism,"" Laas said, describing the mining industry's legacy. ""Taking care of yourself and doing for yourself."" It's a town with names that ring through American history, Joplin was a hideout for Bonnie and Clyde and their gang in the 1930s and the birthplace of African-American poet Langston Hughes. The mining industry and the gritty world of the 19th and 20th centuries have faded away and the region has been making the transition to different white-collar and blue-collar industries. But Jared Roll, a native of nearby Mount Vernon, Missouri, and now a history professor at the University of Sussex in England, said the character of the town is strongly linked with the tri-state mining region. Roll said the town's ""hardscrabble qualities"" give Joplin ""a wonderful sense of character, a wonderful sense of community, of local meaning."" ""It's quite surprising that it has remained as large as it is,"" he said. Trucking is a major industry in the region, and highways such as Interstate 44 and U.S. 71 carry drivers to and from big cities like St. Louis, Kansas City, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Little Rock, Arkansas. Another major place of industry is Missouri Southern State University, a revered institution spared by the tornado. But as in many American towns, people get an education at a place like Missouri Southern, and then they head out. ""We'd give young people from the area the tools to leave,"" said Larry Cebula, a history professor at Eastern Washington University who used to teach at Missouri Southern. ""It's the truth. A really bright young person with a college education would head off to Kansas City, Tulsa, St. Louis."" The hospitals are another major industry. There's Freeman Health System, which dodged the tornado bullet, and St. John's Regional Medical Center, which got slammed. ""It seems that most of the jobs requiring college education have to do with teaching, medical,"" said Lori Bogle, a history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who got her bachelor's degree at Missouri Southern. ""This is going to be a real blow."" There are other industries in and around Joplin: One is EaglePicher Technologies in Joplin, which designs and makes batteries and battery management systems for the defense and aerospace industries. ""EaglePicher's batteries helped bring the crew of the Apollo 13 home safely,"" its website says. Leggett & Platt, in nearby Carthage, is a diversified manufacturer that produces bed and furniture components and other items. Robert McKinzie, Leggett staff vice president of labor relations, said there are more than 2,100 employees in the Carthage area and many of them are from Joplin. Wal-Mart's home base is not far away in Bentonville, Arkansas, and there's Empire District Electric, which provides electricity to southwestern Missouri and parts of Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. There also are chicken farms and processing plants. ""The region is sort of a transition between the Ozarks and the Great Plains,"" Cebula said. ""Historically, (with) lead and zinc, like a lot of mining areas, it was sort of a boom and a bust,"" The region is largely white and Protestant, a town full of churches, Cebula said, and it is gritty and blue collar. He and others note a growth in the Mexican presence and other newcomers, such as Vietnamese. There is a Native American community and many people in the area have that ancestry. There is a small but long-standing black community. The city has historically appeared to be more tolerant than smaller nearby hamlets in the past, historians said. Roll said some African-Americans found their way to Joplin when they were driven out of neighboring communities last century. Bogle, who studied the integration of Joplin schools, said she found it wasn't as difficult as it had been in other cities. It has had more of a ""northern attitude"" and more of a sense of community, she said. 'It's sort of southern,"" she said. ""But it's not part of the South."" One part of life across this swath of America is the weather. Three years ago, a tornado ravaged the town of Picher, Oklahoma, 20 miles away, and continued into Missouri. Roll attended a wedding south of Joplin that day, and one casualty of the tornado was a man who had been scheduled to sing at the wedding but was killed in his car on the way. The aftermath of tornadoes evokes an eeriness, Roll remembers. ""It becomes very, very still, calm, sun-shining.""","Joplin is the hub of a four-state region .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Levels of radioactive iodine in seawater just offshore of the embattled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant spiked to more than 1,250 times higher than normal, Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency said Saturday. Samples taken Friday morning from a monitoring station 330 meters off the coast were significantly higher than results from the previous morning, when the level was 104 times above normal. The measurements also showed high levels of cesium and were taken outside the discharge canal for the plant's Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 reactors. Readings from a short distance away, outside the Nos. 5 and 6 units' discharge canal, showed lower but still high radioactive iodine levels some 284 times above normal. These high levels suggest there may have been some sort of leakage directly into the ocean -- unlikely to be because of atmosphere emissions or rain alone, said an official with the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the nuclear plant. A Tokyo Electric official told CNN that authorities are not sure why the levels spiked. The official speculated that the radioactive iodine may have been swept off the coast recently into the Pacific Ocean or the tainted water may have seeped from turbine buildings for two nuclear reactors that have shown the presence of radiation 10,000 times the normal amount. Still, an official with Japan's nuclear safety agency told reporters Saturday that -- while drinking such tainted seawater would be dangerous, given the radiation's potential to cause cancer -- the effect on aquatic life may be relatively minimal. That's because the radiation tends to dilute, the farther one moves away from the nuclear plant. Data posted on the Japan's education and science ministry website showed relatively small amounts of radioactive particles several kilometers offshore. The International Atomic Agency reported online Saturday that radioactive iodine and cesium was detected 30 kilometers (19 miles) offshore, but it said that these levels differed only slightly from the previous day. That said, its potential effect on Japan's fishing industry -- even if consumers stay away, for simple fear of contamination -- remains a major concern. So, too, is the fact that authorities have yet to pinpoint the exact source of the radiation, and thus to determine if it's stopped. The latest data, from Friday, posted online by Japan's education, science and technology ministry show continuing evidence of airborne radiation in prefectures around the nation. Still, in no cases is the exposure considered harmful to human health -- and, in fact, in many cases, radiation readings have gone down. In the Fukushima prefecture where the plant is located, officials had screened 87,813 people for radiation exposure as of Thursday, Japan's nuclear safety agency said a day later in a news release. Of those 98 people had tested above limits for exposure, but once their clothes were removed and other measures taken, the exposure levels dropped and there was no effect on health. The agency also said screeners have examined thyroid glands of 66 children ranging in age from 1 to 15 and found that the ""level of exposure of no problem."" The thyroid gland, particularly in children, can readily absorb radiation, health experts say. Meanwhile, authorities continue to monitor radiation levels in tap water around Japan. Information from Japan's education, science and technology ministry indicate the presence of radioactive iodine in the tap water of 12 prefectures. This does not include Fukushima and Miyagi, where measurements aren't being taken because of damage from the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The government of Ibaraki prefecture reported Saturday that radiation levels had fallen considerably in the past 24 hours -- to levels that now would be considered safe enough even for babies to drink. Levels of radioactive iodine, taken Friday from water treatment facilities that serve the cities of Tokaimura and Hitachi, range from 31 to 97 bequerels per kilogram of water. This is below the 100 becquerel threshold authorities advise it not be given to infants under 1 year old -- and well under the 300-becquerel threshold for adults. A day earlier, water samples from four sites in Ibaraki had levels between 119 becquerels of radioactive iodine to a high of 230 becquerels, all above the recommendations for babies. A second batch of data released Friday from Tokyo's waterworks bureau showed levels remaining steady at 51 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of tap water. There were 76 becquerels from samples from Asaka purification plant, which serves Saitama prefecture, according to data on the Tokyo government site. The previous day, Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara lifted the previously announced recommendation that babies not drink tap water after tests from Tuesday night showed levels of radiation more than twice the limit for babies. There was also good news Friday's in the Chiba prefecture, where all five water treatment facilities had levels of radioactive iodine less than 100 becquerels per kilogram of tap water. The previous day, two plants in Chiba had reported high levels.","NEW: Besides radioactive iodine, high levels of cesium are also detected .

"(CNN) -- Second seed Kim Clijsters suffered her earliest French Open exit in 11 years as she crashed out in the second round on Thursday. The Belgian, seeking to win the clay-court grand slam event for the first time, failed to capitalize on two match-points as she was eliminated by unheralded Dutchwoman Arantxa Rus. Former world No. 1 Clijsters was 5-2 ahead in the second set, but her 20-year-old opponent fought back to win 3-6 7-5 6-1 on center court. The 114th-ranked Rus, whose only previous match against a top-10 player was a three-set defeat by Maria Sharapova in Madrid this year, earned a clash with Russian 25th seed Maria Kirilenko. Rafael Nadal: Anatomy of a champion . The result means that Caroline Wozniacki will retain the No. 1 ranking, no matter her performance in Paris. The 20-year-old Dane moved into the third round with a nervous 6-3 7-6 (8-6) win over Canada's Aleksandra Wozniak on Wednesday and next faces 28th seed Daniela Hantuchova. Clijsters returned to Roland Garros for the first time since losing in the 2006 semifinals, with her preparations hampered by a two-month injury layoff. She comfortably won her opening match against Anastasia Yakimova of Belarus, but the 27-year-old failed to finish off a player who had never before got past the second round of a grand slam tournament. ""I'm still trying to figure it out,"" Clijsters, who lost in the first round of her French Open debut in 2000, told the WTA Tour website. ""I started doubting a little bit. That's definitely the wrong attitude to have, especially for me on clay. ""She obviously started building up more confidence, playing a lot better and putting me on my back foot all the time. I couldn't really play my aggressive tennis anymore in that third set."" Clijsters insisted that she had recovered from the shoulder, wrist and ankle injuries that had sidelined her since March. ""My ankle feels fine, that had absolutely nothing to do with it. If I felt like I wasn't as ready as I would have liked to be, I wouldn't have come here,"" the four-time grand slam winner said. ""Physically everything was fine. If I wasn't feeling I was able to play tough matches, I wouldn't have made the decision to come to Roland Garros. I'm not going to sit here and say maybe I shouldn't have come here. That's the attitude of a real loser, I think. I gave it the best I had with the abilities I had."" With the Williams sisters ruled out by long-term injuries, and four-time Paris champion Justin Henin retired for a second time, Clijsters was one of the favorites to take the title. Her exit is a boost to the chances of former No. 1 Sharapova, who survived a scare against 17-year-old world number 188 Caroline Garcia, who was playing in only her second tour level event. The seventh-seeded Russian was a set and 4-1 down but recovered to triumph 3-6 6-4 6-0. Afterwards she told reporters: ""She played unbelievable and the conditions were really tough."" Fourth seed Victoria Azarenka, from Belarus, took just 57 minutes to beat Pauline Parmentier 6-0 6-1. Chinese sixth seed Li Na moved into the third round with a 6-4 7-5 win over Spanish qualifier Silvia Soler-Espinosa. The Australian Open runner-up will next take on Romania's Sorana Cirstea, who knocked out 27th-seeded compatriot Alexandra Dulgheru 6-2 7-5. Czech ninth seed Petra Kvitova eased to a 6-4 6-1 win over China's Zheng Jie to set up a clash with American Vania King. Polish 12th seed Agnieszka Radwanska beat India's Sania Mirza 6-2 6-4, and could face Sharapova in the last 16 if she gets past Belgian No. 21 Yanina Wickmayer.","World No. 2 Kim Clijsters beaten by 114th-ranked Dutchwoman Arantxa Rus .

"(CNN) -- The last of Bernie Madoff's ill-gotten gains that remain in the hands of the U.S. Marshals Service will go on the auction block next week, authorities said Friday. A diamond watch, platinum diamond rings and artwork belonging to Madoff and his wife, Ruth, will be up for grabs on June 4, the Marshals Service said. Proceeds from the auction will go into a U.S. Department of Justice fund and be used to compensate the victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, described by authorities as the largest in history. He cheated thousands of people out of billions of dollars. Auctioneers in Miami will sell off 276 lots of property taken from the Madoff residences in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, the Marshals Service said. The auction will also be simulcast online, authorities said. Madoff was known as an aficionado of fine watches, and the auction will include a men's Audemars Piguet watch with a diamond dial. Other items will include an English rosewood apothecary; a carved wood bull sculpture; and a John Wootton oil painting, authorities said. The auctioneers are also putting 262 bottles of fine wine and liquor on the block, though some of the alcohol is more valued because of the scandalous background of its owner. ""As artifacts of history they are unique, which is why we have chosen to offer all of the bottles seized, including those which normally wouldn't pass muster and make it into our auction,"" Morrel Wine Auctions said in a news release. ""Some of the bottles are better viewed as conversation pieces rather than valued for their contents, but conversation pieces they are."" To date, about $23 million in property sales and $80 million in cash assets from the Madoffs have been recovered, the Marshals Service said. Madoff's scheme fell apart with his arrest in December 2008, and he pleaded guilty in federal court in New York in March 2009 to multiple federal counts of running the largest, longest-running Ponzi scheme ever. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison and is serving time at a federal facility in Butner, North Carolina.","Bernard Madoff was convicted of running the largest Ponzi scheme in history .

"(CNN) -- Torrential rain and massive floods that have been pounding Colombia this year have not let up, and dozens of people are dead amid widespread destruction, the Colombian Red Cross said Wednesday. Eighty-six people have died so far this year, it said, mainly in the central region that includes the provinces of Cundinamarca, Caldas and Antioquia. Fifty have been injured and 21 are still missing. In addition, 378,000 people have been evacuated in the South American country because their homes were destroyed by the floods, the Red Cross said. Affected areas include 1,001 municipalities in 28 of the 32 Colombian provinces. The Federal District, in which Bogota, the capital, is located, also has been affected. Sandra Calvo, a spokeswoman with the Colombian Red Cross, called the situation ""very complicated"" and a ""total emergency."" ""This is the longest rainy season we've had in the last 40 years and the one that has caused the most destruction,"" Calvo said. ""We've had everything from mudslides and flooding to rivers overflowing and destroying everything in their path."" After touring one of the most affected areas, the municipality of Puerto Nare in Antioquia province, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said more rain is expected, which will further complicate the situation. ""This tragedy has no precedent in our history. These mountains behind me are literally crumbling and that's going to cause many problems,"" he said. Santos also called on Colombians to ""work together,"" and ""coordinate our efforts"" to reduce the ""immense costs resulting from this tragedy."" Andres Gonzalez Diaz, governor of Cundinamarca province, said this is ""the worst catastrophe"" his government has faced. ""We have hundreds of destroyed houses and important crops that were swept away by the floods, but fortunately we've been able to minimize the loss of human lives,"" he said. Gonzalez also said that at least 20 people have died in Cundinamarca. A dozen people died in accidents resulting from roads and bridges left structurally unstable by floods and heavy rain. Antioquia is the province with the highest number of fatalities. The death toll there stands at 131, according to the Colombian Red Cross. This is the second consecutive year that Colombia has been devastated by torrential rain and massive flooding. Last year 408 people died in the nation and more than 2.8 million people were left homeless or affected in some way by the rain.","An intense rainy season brings mudslides and flooding, a Red Cross official says .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, everyone. I'm Carl Azuz, and you're tuned in to CNN Student News! It's Thursday, May 26th, and you can leave the next ten minutes to us. First Up: Speech to Parliament . AZUZ: First up, President Obama makes a speech that some people are calling the main event of his week-long trip to Europe. It happened in front of the British Parliament; it's a legislative group that's kinda like the U.S. Congress. During the speech, the president talked about a lot of world issues that the U.S. and Britain have faced together. That includes the economic crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the revolutions, protests and conflict happening right now in the Arab world, like in Libya. The president said the U.S. and U.K. should and will provide an example for other nations to follow. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The time for our leadership is now. It was the United States and the United Kingdom and our democratic allies that shaped a world in which new nations could emerge and individuals could thrive. And even as more nations take on the responsibilities of global leadership, our alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that is more peaceful, more prosperous and more just. AZUZ: All right, you just heard the president mention the alliance between the U.S. and U.K. Suzanne Malveaux looks back now at some of the recent moments in that close relationship. (BEGIN VIDEO) QUEEN ELIZABETH II: Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to celebrate the tried, tested and, yes, special relationship between our two countries. SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN ANCHOR: And it's that special relationship that has defined U.S. foreign policy for generations. Think Thatcher and Reagan. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Prime minister, the entire world salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation. MALVEAUX: Or remember former Prime Minister Tony Blair, sometimes criticized for being a little too friendly with President Bush. Their chumminess got Blair in political trouble at home. His support for the Iraq war won him more friends in the U.S. Congress than across the pond. TONY BLAIR, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: We will be with you in this fight for liberty. And if our spirit is right and our courage firm, the world will be with us. MALVEAUX: And now, the U.S. and UK have come together on two other wars: in Afghanistan and Libya. Beyond the battlefield, there are real economic ties that bind. Each country invests over $400 billion in the other's economy. And nearly 200,000 U.S. citizens live and work in the UK. So, for Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama, this relationship is not something either leader takes for granted. OBAMA: As Winston Churchill said on a visit to the United States, above all, among the English-speaking peoples, there must be the union of hearts, based upon convictions and common ideals. (END VIDEO) Libya Cave Hideaways . AZUZ: President Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron both discussed progress being made in Libya's civil war. But they also said that the conflict could last longer than people expect. Libya's long-time leader, Moammar Gadhafi, and his forces are fighting against rebels who want Gadhafi out of power. And there's concern about how Libya's civilians are being affected in all this. Nic Robertson traveled to the outskirts of one Libyan town to find out how living conditions -- and living locations -- can change in times of war. (BEGIN VIDEO) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: He's taking us to see some caves where we're told families have been hiding from the shelling. We've yet to see the caves, but we're certainly seeing a lot of children. And this is the only place in Zintan we've seen children. Look at them here: families and children. They've deserted the streets of the city and they're living out here on the edge. The caves, we're told, haven't been lived in by people for about 60 years, but because of the random shelling, they're now going back to hiding in them again. This is the old part of Zintan, right on the hills, on the edge. Down here? Steep. You really feel like you're going into the ancient city here. This is quite incredible. Look up here. These ancient homes here. You can see the power cable now, running inside here. The people can have electricity, some light at night. This is a whole underground labyrinth of caves. The roof is blackened by soot from fires, years of fires. They're black. Then you come out here into this, and the only way out of here is a ladder. It's an absolute labyrinth. Every side you look, there's an entrance here, here, here, here, another room here with a light bulb. This wasn't here 60 years ago. There's blankets in there if you take a look. Blankets, carpets, space for people to live and hide from the shelling. (END VIDEO) U.S. Severe Weather . AZUZ: To the U.S. now. Parts of the country's mid-section are struggling through a historic tornado season. Officials say more than 500 people have been killed in the storms. The latest round of severe weather hit Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and Arkansas. Oklahoma's governor declared a state of emergency in 68 of the state's 77 counties. That will help free up resources for recovery efforts. Emergency personnel were called out immediately after the storms. Some are searching for victims. Others are working to get power back up and running for the tens of thousands of people who lost it. Officials have determined that the tornado that hit nearby Joplin, Missouri was a 5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The scale measures tornado intensity based on how much damage they cause. A 5 is as high as you can get. Fleet Week in NY . AZUZ: A handful of U.S. Navy ships are sailing into New York. That's because it's Fleet Week! The Parade of Ships kicks off the annual event before the vessels drop their anchors at different spots around New York City. Fleet Week gives service members the chance for some R & R in the Big Apple. And it gives civilians the opportunity to go aboard these Navy ships. This week's Fleet Week also brings the USS New York back to New York for the first time since it was commissioned. Part of the ship was made from steel that was recovered from the Twin Towers that were attacked on 9/11 nearly ten years ago. New Fuel Labels . AZUZ: When you go to buy a car, the window sticker gives you a lot of information. But government officials want it to give you more, and in a year or two, that sticker will. New fuel efficiency labels will be required for all new cars starting in 2013. In addition to miles per gallon, you'll see how much you might save -- or spend -- on gas over five years, and how the vehicle stacks up against similar models. Environmental groups support the idea of offering consumers this extra information, but some of them wanted the new labels to assign each vehicle a letter grade. A, B, C, things like that. Critics thought the grades might be too confusing. CNN Teachers' Lounge & Blog . AZUZ: At CNNStudentNews.com, we are all about your input. First, you teachers.

AZUZ: A project with pennies is making some students angry in Washington state. And it's not because they're not worth much. MAYRA EVERSON, STUDENT: How has this gotten out of control? Why did this get out of control? Why wasn't there a stop to it? AZUZ: 14,300 pennies laid out on the cafeteria floor. She's not angry about the project. She's talking about what it represents: the U.S. national debt. Students spent four hours laying out the pennies, with each one symbolizing one billion dollars. The idea was to get other students thinking about the country's $14.3 trillion debt. Goodbye . AZUZ: Using pennies as a visual aid? It's an idea that makes a lot of cents. And it's definitely a change of pace from your normal economics lesson. And if you're out there groaning, just imagine how I feel. CNN Student News returns tomorrow.

"Dafniya, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces fired mortars and guns at rebel forces in an apparent effort to break through a stalemated line west of the rebel-held city of Misrata on Sunday, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from the scene. Rebels returned fire, and while some pulled back to seek cover from the incoming artillery shells, others moved forward toward the front line near the town of Dafniya, about 35 kilometers west of Misrata. Libya has been in the throes of a civil war for months, since Gadhafi dug in his heels against popular efforts to force him out of power as anti-government protests sweep the Arab world this year.","Rebels in Libya come under attack at a stalemated front line near a rebel-held city .

"(CNN) -- One woman was killed and another injured after they fell from a 10th-floor window at an Atlanta hotel, authorities said Saturday. According to Atlanta Police, witnesses said the two were attending a birthday party early Saturday at the W Atlanta-Midtown. The pair were ""play fighting"" when they accidentally crashed through the window around 3:15 a.m., according to a preliminary investigation, said department spokesman Officer John Chafee. It was unclear Saturday where they landed. The Fulton County medical examiner identified the woman who died at the scene as LaShawna M. Threatt of Atlanta. The cause of death is pending. The other woman, who was unidentified, was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in critical condition. Hotel manager Michael O'Donohue said information on the investigation must come from authorities. ""The incident at the W Atlanta early Saturday is very tragic and our thoughts and prayers are with the woman who was injured and the family and friends of the woman who died in the fall,"" he said in a statement.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The cherry blossoms are in full bloom, the skies clear and blue in this seaside town. Yet apart from the occasional bark of a dog or the moo of a meandering cow, the most glaring aspect about life in Tomioka is the lack of it. Japan's government five weeks ago mandated that everyone must leave the town, amid concerns about dangerously high levels of radiation emanating from the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant about eight kilometers (five miles) away. But Kazuhiro Shirato felt he had to go home. So, with a Japanese journalist and cameraman alongside, he got in a car and headed toward Tomioka, where he and many others hadn't been since the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck on March 11. They drove with ease past signs that read ""Forbidden Entry"" stationed 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from the power plant, meaning they'd entered the so-called ""evacuation zone."" Going farther, their main barriers were not police but occasional roads that had been cracked and heaved by the epic tremor. Cruising down Tomioka's tree-lined streets, Shirato saw many stores, residences and other buildings that, while damaged, were largely intact. But the eerie silence reminded him how it had transformed into a ghost town, save for a few animals left to fend for themselves. U.S., Japan announce joint rebuilding effort . ""There was nobody there, so I finally understood everyone had really left,"" he said. ""I could see dogs and cows belonging to my neighbor. I was surprised cows could get so skinny after just one month."" Shirato's first stop was his mother's house, closing windows and blinds that had been left wide open. Then, he moved on to the family business -- a funeral parlor -- where flowers for services that never took place littered the floor. His last stop was his own home, carefully stepping past his belongings, which had been flung everywhere by the earthquake. In between picking up his DVD collection and unplugging the electricity, Shirato searched for bank records and identification cards. As he returned to Tokyo, where he's been in government housing, Shirato couldn't help but feel that part of him -- his sense of security growing up in the shadows of the Fukushima Daiichi plant -- had been lost due to the nonstop nuclear crisis. Enduring psychological and emotional stress . He said he's angry with the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant and has led the often problematic recovery operation, for convincing him at a young age that the nuclear facility was completely safe. Beyond that, Shirato said he is losing hope that he'll ever return home for good. He is one of more than 78,000 people who lived within a 20-kilometer radius of Fukushima Daiichi who were ordered to flee, on top of another 60,000-plus in the next 10 kilometers who were told to shelter indoors. And Japan's government recently told residents of several towns outside that zone that they would soon have to evacuate, due to possible long-term health risks from radioactive particles. ""Two weeks ago, I thought I would be back home within six months,"" Shirato said Saturday. ""But the situation (at the nuclear plant) got worse and worse. ""Now I doubt I will ever be able to go back.""","Kazuhiro Shirato went to his hometown of Tomioka, Japan, which has been evacuated .

"(CNN) -- FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam wants the current head of world football Sepp Blatter to be included in the organization's investigation into bribery. Bin Hammam, who is the sole challenger to Blatter in presidential elections scheduled for June 1, is due to be quizzed by FIFA's ethics committee this weekend along with Jack Warner, who runs the CONCACAF federation covering Central and North America. The pair have been accused of bribery by FIFA executive committee member Chuck Blazer in relation to a meeting the two held with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) on May 10 and 11 this year. Bin Hammam, who is head of the Asian Football Confederation, denied any wrongdoing and has now demanded Blatter be included in the probe after claiming he was also named in evidence handed to the ethics committee. FIFA probes fresh bribery scandal . A statement sent to CNN by the Qatari read: ""Mohamed Bin Hammam, member of the executive committee of FIFA, was surprised by yesterday's accusations of bribery. He rejects these accusations and confirms that they are without substance. ""The accusations also contain statements according to which Mr. Blatter, the incumbent FIFA president, was informed of, but did not oppose, payments allegedly made to members of the Caribbean Football Union. ""Mr. Bin Hammam has therefore requested that the investigation by the Ethics Committee be extended to include Mr. Blatter himself. ""The timing of the accusations so close to the election of FIFA president on June 1 suggests that they are part of a plan to damage Mr. Bin Hammam and force him to withdraw as a candidate for the FIFA presidency.'' Bin Hammam added: ""I am not at all afraid to answer any questions that the Ethics Committee may have for me at the hearing next Sunday. As long as the committee guarantees a fair process, I have nothing to fear."" Warner has also been named in allegations made by David Triesman, the former head of England's 2018 World Cup bid, who claimed he was asked to provide money to the Trinidadian in exchange for his vote. Warner denies the allegations. Meanwhile, Blatter has insisted he ""takes no joy"" in seeing his election rival being hauled before the ethics committee, and rejected the idea he had anything to do with the situation. Writing for the Inside World Football website he said: ""To make a point very clear, let me say this: I take no joy in having to observe yet another ethics committee hearing and investigation. And I take absolutely no joy in seeing my friends and colleagues of many years dragged before the ethics committee. ""I take no joy to see men who stood by my side for some two decades suffer through public humiliation without having been convicted of any wrongdoing: nobody is guilty until a judge has found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt. ""To now assume that the present ordeal of my opponent were to fill me with some sort of perverse satisfaction or that this entire matter was somehow masterminded by me is ludicrous and completely reprehensible.""","Mohamed Bin Hammam wants Sepp Blatter included in probe into bribery claims .

"(CNN) -- An extraordinary thing is about to happen in my native state. More than three decades of communism is about to fall -- not through revolution or bloodshed but by the sheer power of the ballot box. Even as communism waned around the world with the disintegration of the Soviet empire, West Bengal's communists built up a political dynasty in India, winning seven consecutive state elections in the world's largest democracy. But if election results to be announced Friday are as predicted, one of the world's little-known bastions of communism will be no more. Exit polls this week confirmed what political analysts have been predicting for months. The Left Front, firmly entrenched in West Bengal since 1977, will go down in defeat to the populist Trinamool Congress. People have descended on the state capital, Kolkata, this week to watch the retreat of the red tide, to document for themselves a pivotal moment of Bengali history. Local media outlets reported record turnout in the state elections that were staggered over several weeks to ensure security and transparency. Word on the street from many who voted against the communists was this: We need change. We need it now. Led by the former Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee, Trinamool won support as the champion of the poor and through its alliance with the Congress Party that rules India. The fiery Banerjee, known affectionately as ""Didi,"" the Bengali word for elder sister, has pledged to revive industry and agriculture in West Bengal, a state that has seen its economy plummet under the communists. The communists rose to power on promises of land reform for the millions of the state's rural and impoverished residents. ""The Congress governments in the past were all urban oriented and connected with the landed gentry,"" said Shibashis Chatterjee, a professor of international relations at Kolkata's Jadavpur University. ""The idea was to economically enfranchise the rural poor who had been long neglected in the past."" The ideology was appropriate for the time, when huge numbers of people were marginalized, Chatterjee said. The communists gave them hope for a new life. But after three decades, many questioned the relevancy of their ideas in a modern, fast-growing India. Critics accused West Bengal's Marxist leaders of corruption, cronyism and failing to deliver what they promised to the people. ""I watched the city of my childhood steadily go to ruin,"" said political scientist Sumit Ganguly. ""Unions rose, industry fled, law and order deteriorated. It has a significant effect on my life and the lives of my family."" How much real change comes to the Indian state remains to be seen but one thing is for sure. Culturally, the end to a government dominated by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is sure to be huge. For decades, hammers and sickles have been plastered on buildings and billboards in Kolkata, where I was born. Workers were routinely called to my grandfather's house to remove the painted signage on our front wall calling for the people's support. We drove down Karl Marx road and past Vladimir Lenin's statue. Fidel Castro was a hero. And in a snub to Americans, the street where the U.S. consulate stands was renamed Ho Chi Minh Street after the North Vietnamese leader. We grew up with the power of labor unions and government employees who called bandhs, or strikes, that were frequent enough to paralyze the city, sometimes for days. The juxtaposition of communist ideology and India's thriving democracy was difficult to reconcile at times. ""This is a real anachronism that the world has moved on but this peculiar form of communism still persists in a corner of India,"" said Ganguly, who holds a chair of Indian cultures and civilizations at Indiana University. Perhaps even more so because it took hold in a corner of India that was known historically for its intellect, talent, skills. Bengal was the home for the Indian intelligentsia, the birthplace of Indian independence. At one time, West Bengal was considered a leading state in India. Now, the state has lagged behind other places that were once less successful. Kolkata, the old capital of the British Raj, has faded into history. It is a dying, run-down city, likely loved solely by natives like myself. Young people, including many of my relatives and friends, have fled in droves to seek jobs elsewhere in India. ""And here are some people clinging on to their ideas which have no significance almost anywhere in the modern world,"" Ganguly said of the communists. ""Even Hugo Chavez (of Venezuela) is a populist."" For the younger Bengalis, some of whom have always lived under communism, enough was enough. ""The younger generations seem fed up,"" Chatterjee said. ""They have no memories beyond the left to compare with."" But while many in West Bengal are eagerly anticipating the end of the Left Front, Chatterjee is not sure that communist ideology will vanish with the political loss of power. That is evident, perhaps, in the clout of groups like the Maosist rebels known as the Naxals, who have launched a violent insurgency in parts of India, including West Bengal. As long as there are millions of poor in India's still burgeoning population, Chatterjee said, there will be room for the ideas of Karl Marx.","CNN's Moni Basu writes as a native of West Bengal in India .

"Herat, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Suicide bombers targeted security forces and foreign civil affairs workers in separate blasts Monday in the western Afghanistan city of Herat, killing at least four people and wounding 26, a police official told CNN. The attacks occurred within minutes of each other just blocks apart in Herat, an area where U.S. military officials have hinted American troops would be withdrawn by July because it has been largely free of violence. The bombers targeted the Ministry of Transport in central Herat, and a compound that houses an Italian Provincial Reconstruction Team -- an outreach unit made up of civilian affairs and aid workers, said police commander Abdul Rauf Ahmadi. The first explosion occurred when a suicide bomber on foot detonated an explosive vest near at the Ministry of Transport, a busy section of central Herat, he said. Witnesses say there were civilian casualties, though it was not immediately clear whether anybody was killed in that blast. The second attack came minutes later when a suicide bomber, also on foot, blew himself up outside the main gate of a compound housing the Italian PRT team, paving the way for gunmen to launch an assault at the compound, Ahmadi said. Afghan and NATO-led forces battled gunmen, who had taken up position inside a building next to the compound, Harif Taib, a government official in Herat, told CNN. Ahmadi said the situation was under police control and the gunfight had ended, though witnesses said gunfire could still be heard hours after the initial explosions coming from direction of the compound. The Italian news agency ANSA reported 15 Italian soldiers were among the wounded in Herat. But none were among the dead, a government official said. ""We can reassure the families that among the dead, there are no Italian soldiers,"" Undersecretary of Defense Guido Crosetto told Rai1 radio. The blasts rattled Afghans in Herat, which has been considered one of the country's success stories with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force turning some of the primary security for the area over to Afghans. ""It's a big surprise,"" said Nemaqullah Rahimi, 22. ""We've haven't had a bombing in six months."" Rahimi, a driver-for-hire in Herat, said his girlfriend's uncle was among the wounded in the blast near the transport ministry. The number-two American commander in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. David Rodriguez, hinted in a CNN interview in February that Herat may be one location U.S. forces could begin to withdraw from as part of President Barack Obama's self-imposed deadline to begin bringing home troops by July 2011. The attacks come the same day that Army Gen. David Petraeus, commander of NATO-led troops in Afghanistan, joined two other generals in offering ""sincere apologies"" for an airstrike that killed nine civilians in southern Afghanistan. Maj. Gen. John Toolan, the head of ISAF command in southwest Afghanistan, said his apology was being made ""on behalf of the coalition"" and its top leaders, including Petraeus. Earlier, Afghan officials said that Saturday's attack in Helmand province killed a dozen children and two women. There was no immediate explanation for the disparity between this figure and the toll of nine civilians killed offered Sunday by Toolan, who also noted that a U.S. Marine was killed immediately before the strike. The strike provoked the ire of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who strongly condemned the airstrike and insisted he was warning the U.S military and government ""for the last time"" on behalf of the Afghan people about civilian deaths. He called the operation a mistake, but offered a different death toll, saying 10 children, two women and two men were killed. In the statement, Toolan pleaded with Afghans to not only forgive, but also to work with coalition forces in hopes of bolstering their security. ""I offer our heartfelt apologies to the families and friends of those killed,"" Toolan said in a statement. ""I ask that the Afghan people continue to trust and assist their security forces, so that together we can stop the senseless killing brought upon us by an enemy who wants to exploit the Afghan people through fear and violence. Journalist Jennifer Glasse contributed to this report.","NEW: Bombings rattle Afghans in Herat, which has been largely free of violence .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Chinese national living in California allegedly created a false Army special forces unit, providing recruits with false documents and uniforms and even marching with them in a parade, authorities said. Yupeng Deng, 51, also known as David Deng, was arrested Tuesday morning by agents from the FBI and the U.S. Department of Defense, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement. He faces 13 counts of theft by false pretenses, manufacturing deceptive government documents and counterfeit of an official government seal. Deng, of El Monte, California, a Los Angeles suburb, allegedly recruited more than 100 other Chinese nationals into the unit, dubbed the U.S. Army/Military Special Forces Reserve unit, telling them it was a path to U.S. citizenship, authorities said. He allegedly called himself ""supreme commander"" of the unit, created in October 2008. Recruits were allegedly charged initiation fees ranging from $300 to $450, with annual renewal fees of $120, according to Deputy District Attorney Richard Ceballos. In addition, authorities said, recruits could increase their rank in the fraudulent unit by making cash donations to Deng. The recruits were provided with phony U.S. Army uniforms, fake documents and fraudulent military identification cards, authorities said. Deng also allegedly instructed them to report to his office in the Los Angeles suburb of Temple City -- which authorities said was decorated to look like an official U.S. military recruiting center -- to undergo training and indoctrination, according to prosecutors. ""These recruits even marched in a parade in Monterey Park and took a tour of the USS Midway Museum in San Diego, all while dressed in uniform,"" the district attorney's statement said. Deng is to be arraigned Wednesday in Pomona Superior Court. If convicted as charged, he would face up to eight years and four months in state prison. In a separate case, Deng also was charged last week with one count of possession of child pornography, stemming from a search warrant executed at his home. Authorities investigating the document case allegedly found child pornography on a computer, prosecutors said. He is set for arraignment in that case April 18 and would face up to three years in state prison if convicted.","Police: Yupeng Deng called himself the unit's ""supreme commander""

"(CNN) -- Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville believes Sunday's trip to Arsenal on Sunday is ""the most difficult"" away game of the season for the English Premier League leaders. Alex Ferguson's United team lead third-placed Arsenal by nine points after Javier Hernandez's late goal earned a 1-0 win over Everton on Saturday, while Arsene Wenger's side slipped to a 2-1 defeat at Bolton Wanderers 24 hours later. Defeat at the Emirates Stadium would end Arsenal's hopes of securing the EPL title and a first major honor since victory over United in the 2005 FA Cup final. Victory would put the Red Devils within touching distance of a record 19th English league title. Has time run out for Arsene Wenger? ""Going to Arsenal is probably the most difficult game, and has been for many, many years,"" Neville, who announced his retirement in February aged 35, told CNN. ""Along with Liverpool and Chelsea, those games you can never tell if you're going to win. Anything can happen and, while we've had some good results there in the last couple of years, we've some bad experiences down there as well."" Former team captain Neville won eight league championships during a 19-year career with United, and the 85-cap England international said a draw against Arsenal would represent a good result for Ferguson's side. ""I think if we can get a point on Sunday, come out of there with something, it would be really important for us."" Neville, who was part of the 1999 European Champions League-winning squad and also won the FA Cup on three occasions, claimed the midfield area could be where the match is won or lost. ""The key battle against Arsenal is midfield. We've always gone into the games over the last five or six years making sure we dominate midfield. It's Arsenal's strongest area,"" he said. ""We always make sure we pack our midfield with strength, power and make sure we can get physical against them. If you let Arsenal play, they are the best football team in the country playing through midfield. ""If you win that battle, towards the end of the game you can start to show your strength."" Hernandez, also known as ""Chicarito,"" has enjoyed a successful debut season in England after arriving in Manchester from Mexican side Guadalajara. The Mexico striker has hit 12 goals in 24 league matches, and Neville has been impressed with the form shown by the 22-year-old. ""I don't think anyone had heard of him when we signed him at the end of last season. But then he played for Mexico at the World Cup and everyone started to think 'This kid doesn't look bad.' ""I think you'll see that United are developing a new young team, with the likes of Rafael (Da Silva), Fabio (Da Silva), Darron Gibson, Jonathan Evans, Chicarito, Chris Smalling ... That's what the manager does, he integrates young players. ""He lets them get the hunger for winning, see the work ethic, and I think Chicarito is an unbelievable example of how that's happened. Someone who cost $11.5 million and looks like one of the best center-forwards in the league.""","Gary Neville has described Manchester United's trip to Arsenal as their toughest test .

"(CNN) -- For the wife of at least one survivor of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, April 20, 2010 is the day she lost her husband. Meccah Boynton-Brown says although her husband Doug made it off the ill-fated rig, he will never be the same. ""There were more than 11 lives lost that day. Yes, there are 11 people that will never come home and see their families again, and my heart is so sad for them,"" Boynton-Brown said. But she added, ""I am married to a different person now. I will always stand by his side but it seems like his previous spirit and character will never return."" First 100 days of oil disaster . According to medical records provided to CNN, Doug Brown has been diagnosed with a litany of mental issues from the injuries he sustained and the horrors he saw onboard the Deepwater Horizon including post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and depression and anxiety. His wife Meccah says his near-constant cycle of anxiety, frustration, anger and depression has had a profoundly detrimental effect on them and their 11 year-old daughter Kirah. ""My life has come to a stop. My daughter's life has pretty much come to a stop . . . the first thing I think Doug wants is to sleep a whole night without having a nightmare,"" she said. Doug Brown worries about the welfare of his wife and daughter too. ""My family is suffering from it. My daughter even has asked Mommy, my wife, 'What's wrong with Daddy? He's not acting like he used to,'"" he said, adding, ""I just want to go sit in the corner and just cut off the world . . . so I don't hear or think about anything that has to do with that night."" Another survivor's wife, Amanda Barron, admits she feels guilt from knowing her husband Dan could've suffered a much worse fate while, at the same time, still lamenting that he's not the man she married. Commission spreads blame in Gulf oil disaster report . ""I love him and there's little glimpses of the old Dan, like his sense of humor, but it's his temperament and everything is totally different than what he was,"" she said. She added, ""I feel so guilty saying . . .'I don't have the same man' you know when they, the eleven [families] don't have their husbands, brothers, uncles anymore."" Dan Barron too has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression, according to medical records provided to CNN. He witnessed one of his good friends, who he calls a ""fallen brother,"" die right in front of him when a second explosion rocked the Deepwater Horizon rig. ""It literally picked him up . . . like a child would throw a toy . . . and he ended up bouncing off of the pedestal for the crane,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper last year shortly after the disaster. ""Just to see him get blown up like that, I mean, it was, it's heart wrenching,"" Barron also told Cooper. Barron says one night the psychological pain, and the guilt of surviving when so many friends did not, became overwhelming. Witness to explosion saw a ""bunch of smoke"" ""I had a 6-shot pistol, and I just wanted it to be over,"" he said. His wife was in bed, heard a clicking sound and jumped up in horror. ""I had a hard time getting it [the gun] from him,"" she said. ""It was like he was playing Russian roulette to see how many times it would take to click it until the bullet went,"" she said, adding, ""I still have nightmares."" Both survivors are suing Transocean for pain and suffering and loss of wages. While technically still employees of the company, they have not worked on a rig since the disaster and stopped getting paid by Transocean last December but do still get some health costs covered. Transocean does not specifically dispute their claims of injuries and a company spokesman told CNN in a statement, ""From the first hours Transocean has focused on providing support for its employees and the families of those who were lost aboard the Deepwater Horizon, including continued full pay and benefits for eight months following the incident and professional counseling for those in need."" Transocean suing Gulf oil spill widow . Both families worry how their children are being affected by the fallout from the disaster. The Barrons 11-year-old daughter Faith is autistic and so far seems unaware of changes in her father, but their 15 year-old son Austin has gone from being an exemplary student to getting C's and D's. Amanda Barron says the worst moment for Austin came when he found out his father attempted suicide. ""He had the hardest time with it because he loves his Dad so much,"" she said. For Doug Brown and Dan Barron, Wednesday's anniversary marks a year since their lives irrevocably changed and for their wives, a year since they lost the husbands they fell in love with. ""I don't know how she stays with me, you know? I really don't,"" Dan Barron said of his wife Meccah, adding, ""She's a saint."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Could Beastie Boys possibly give less of a (expletive) about trying to sound young? In a word, no. As Ad-Rock proudly declares on their excellent new ""Hot Sauce Committee Part Two,"" ""Oh, my God, just look at me/Grandpa been rapping since '83!"" The Beasties revel in their older-than-old-school references (""Be kind, rewind"") and cultural touchstones (""braggadocio"" rhymes with ""I'll make you sick like a Kenny Rogers Roaster""). Where they used to boast about rocking Adidas instead of Fila, now MCA has different footwear issues: ""I don't wear Crocs, and I don't wear sandals/The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles."" The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time: Beastie Boys . That's the kick of ""Hot Sauce"" -- the Beasties sound exactly like themselves, cutting loose without straining to fit anyone else's idea of relevance. Adam ""MCA"" Yauch, Michael ""Mike D"" Diamond and Adam ""Ad-Rock"" Horowitz originally scheduled ""Hot Sauce"" for release in 2009, until the project was derailed by MCA's battle with cancer. Now cheekily retitled ""Hot Sauce Committee Part Two,"" it's their first album in seven years, unless you count 2007's stoner-funk instrumental throwaway, ""The Mix-Up."" It's also a return to classic Beasties chutzpah: On ""Hot Sauce Committee,"" they're not sweating to impress anyone except one another. Video: Beastie Boys' Star-Studded 'Make Some Noise' Lead single ""Make Some Noise"" sets the tone with the group's feistiest and funniest groove since ""Intergalactic"" soundtracked the summer of 1998. (Have you listened to ""Hello Nasty"" lately? Even nuttier than you remember.) The Beasties ride vintage synths and cowbell, with MCA chanting, ""We gonna party for the mother (expletive) right to fight!"" Amid references to Rotary Connection and Ted Danson, Ad-Rock drops the best line: ""Can't tell me nothing, can't tell me nada/Don't quote me now because I'm doing the Lambada."" Photos: Beastie Boys Through the Years . The group's self-production has gained bounce since 2004's To the 5 Boroughs. They get guest shots from Nas (""Too Many Rappers"") and Santigold (the reggae detour ""Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win""). The music is full of signature touches, from the punk drum solo in ""Lee Majors Come Again"" to the low-end electro funk of ""Here's a Little Something for Ya."" MCA sounds as gruff as ever in ""Nonstop Disco Powerpack,"" giving it up to hip-hop pioneers like Rammellzee and K-Rob's ""Beat Bop,"" Afrika Bambaataa and Spoonie Gee (""The one MC who you can't deny""), while both the bass line and the distortion-filter vocals echo Spoonie's 1980 classic ""Spoonin Rap."" Beastie Boys were already old-school back when they were young-school, hyping an early-Eighties hip-hop revival on ""Paul's Boutique"" before the Eighties were even over. So it's no surprise that on ""Hot Sauce Committee Part Two"" they make no effort to accommodate or even acknowledge any of the latest hip-hop trends. Instead, we get the sound of master musicians in their comfort zone, doing everything their own way. Nobody would want to hear the Beasties try anything else.

"(CNN) -- When the dust settled on LinkedIn's IPO on Thursday afternoon, the company was valued at $8.9 billion, making it worth more than household names like JC Penney, Electronic Arts and Chipotle. As the biggest Internet IPO since Google and the first pure social networking site to go public, its jaw-dropping opening-day surge of 109% will also go down as a watershed moment for the Web, as historically significant as the debuts of Netscape in 1995, TheGlobe.com in 1998 and Google in 2004. Whereas Netscape's IPO symbolized the dawn of the dotcom boom, TheGlobe.com's epitomized the height of irrational exuberance and Google's ushered in a renaissance of tech innovation after the Internet bubble burst, LinkedIn's debut will be remembered as social media's arrival on the capitalist stage known as Wall Street. For starters, LinkedIn's lofty valuation by most anyone's standards (at Thursday's closing price of $94, it's trading at 36 times its 2010 revenue; Google trades at five times) will have venture capitalists scrambling to take their Internet investments public. As venture capitalist Albert Wenger put it on Twitter, ""LinkedIn is Netscape of this decade. IPO window blown wide open."" Further, the social dynamics that companies like LinkedIn thrive on offer something completely different from the first-generation Internet companies: incredibly rapid and organic growth. Whereas in the 1990s, Web companies shelled out tens of millions of dollars on advertising to find users, today's social media leaders like LinkedIn acquire new users through network effects -- their services become more valuable to users when their friends sign up. This trend isn't going away, and there are undoubtedly dozens if not hundreds of little-known or yet-to-be-founded startups that will go from zero to publicly traded juggernaut in remarkably shorts periods of time. Add to that the fact that Internet companies with a lot more sex appeal than LinkedIn -- including Facebook, Groupon, Pandora, Yelp and Zynga (makers of FarmVille) -- are all likely to go public within the next year, and you have LinkedIn taking the pole position in what will be a tidal wave of social media companies entering the public markets. Aside from the almost inevitable historical significance, however, is the new dynamic that will be created for social media companies that IPO. As entities that depend on their users to grow through word of mouth, there will suddenly be a need for community-centric services to balance the needs of their members with the expectations of Wall Street. There are only a few examples to draw on to predict how this may play out. In their ""Founders' IPO Letter"" in 2004, Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page wrote that their goal was, ""to develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible. In pursuing this goal, we may do things that we believe have a positive impact on the world, even if the near term financial returns are not obvious."" Indeed, the company's stock has been punished at times when investments in businesses that have become enormously important to Google -- like Android -- weren't showing results on the bottom line. In the long run, of course, this philosophy has helped Google's stock price increase by more than five times since going public. While some of today's soon-to-be-public social media companies might not be quite so aspirational, they certainly will face similar challenges. Will Pandora play more ads on its Internet radio service to beef up its numbers? Will the quality of Groupon's daily deals diminish as it looks to keep its tremendous growth rate intact? Will Facebook finally push the privacy envelope too far in the name of meeting earnings estimates? These are the types of decisions that the current generation of Internet companies will have to make when they enter the public markets. We've already seen one prominent example of a company not finding the right balance and the dire consequences that can result. While MySpace's fall from grace can be attributed to a variety of factors, there is no disputing that innovation and user experience languished after its 2005 acquisition by News Corp., paving the way for Facebook to swoop in and take the social networking crown. Returning to LinkedIn, while today's story about its IPO may be about whether it represents a new financial bubble in the Internet sector, the story in years to come will be its symbolism in changing the world in which social media companies operate. Let's hope, as Sergey and Larry put it so well in 2004, that the change leaves a positive impact on the world.","LinkedIn's stock market debut is the biggest Internet IPO since Google .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Torres finally ended his goal drought on Saturday as second-placed Chelsea won to boost the club's hopes of retaining the English Premier League title. The Spain World Cup winner had gone 13 matches without scoring since his $80 million move from Liverpool at the end of January, but netted the London team's second after coming on as a substitute in the 3-0 victory over bottom side West Ham. On top of that Chelsea streak, he had also failed to score in his last match for Liverpool and an international for his country in March. The striker was mobbed on the sodden pitch by his relieved teammates, including Didier Drogba -- who lost his regular starting place after the 27-year-old's arrival in a record fee between British clubs. ""I kept working and it's thanks to all my teammates that I scored. There's less pressure for me now, now I can enjoy it,"" Torres said. ""The fans have been very patient with me. I had more and more anxiety for them than for me. Hopefully this is the first of many."" The victory helped Chelsea reign in leaders Manchester United, who had moved nine points clear with a 1-0 win over Everton in the opening game of the day. United know that victory in their next two Premier League fixtures against third-placed Arsenal on May 1 and Chelsea on May 8 should clinch a record 19th title. Those games come either side of the Champions League semifinal ties with Schalke, the first being in Germany on Tuesday. Arsenal can also close to within six points again by beating Bolton on Sunday, after which the top three teams will all have four matches left. Chelsea's European involvement was ended by United in the quarterfinals, and since then Torres has been relegated to the bench by coach Carlo Ancelotti while Drogba has helped reignite the club's championship hopes. In a match played in pouring rain after Britain's recent spell of fine weather broke, man of the match Drogba was instrumental in setting up Chelsea's opening goal a minute before halftime. The Ivory Coast forward's neat pass helped fullback Ashley Cole burst down the left and cut back a perfect cross for his England teammate Frank Lampard to lash into the net. With conditions making defending difficult, both teams squandered chances before Chelsea defender David Luiz crashed an effort off the crossbar. Torres replaced Drogba in the 76th minute, and he ended his miserable run eight minutes later with a composed left-foot shot after pivoting when the ball got stuck in a puddle. France winger Florent Malouda settled the match in the third minute of time added on with his 13th league goal this season. The result left . Mexico striker Javier Hernandez edged Manchester United closer to a record 19th English top-flight title on Saturday with a late winning goal against Everton. It was the 22-year-old Hernandez's 12th league goal this season and United's 100th in all competitions, but the first the Old Trafford outfit had scored since the 2-1 European Champions League quarterfinal second-leg win against Chelsea on April 12. United and Beckham top Forbes' football rich list . United made five changes from the team which suffered a 3-0 FA Cup semifinal defeat against local rivals Manchester City last weekend, while England defender Rio Ferdinand played in a league game for the first time since February 1 after missing Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Newcastle. Hernandez had the game's first chance when his snapshot from 12 yards forced a smart save from Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard after neat play from Antonio Valencia and Wayne Rooney. David Moyes' visiting side appealed for a penalty on 34 minutes when Jonathan Evans tussled with Toffees striker Jermaine Beckford, but referee Peter Walton waved played on. Hernandez, also known as ""Chicarito,"" was heavily involved but he prevented United taking the lead in the 37th minute when he inadvertently blocked Nani's goal-bound shot. Everton rarely threatened, but came close to going ahead when veteran United goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar produced a fine finger-tip save from Jack Rodwell's low drive on 68 minutes. The breakthrough arrived with six minutes of regulation time left when Brazilian midfielder Anderson slipped a pass through for Valencia, whose deflected cross was headed home by Hernandez at the far post. Tottenham Hotspur failed to climb above fourth-placed City and into the final Champions League position, being held to a 2-2 draw at home by West Bromwich Albion. Peter Odemwingie's 13th goal of the season put Roy Hogson's side ahead after only five minutes before Russia striker Roman Pavlyuchenko netted an equalizer with a driven shot from the edge of the penalty area. Spurs took the lead with England's Jermain Defoe's 100th Premier League goal just past the hour mark, but Simon Cox secured a point for West Brom with nine minutes left after his sublime curling shot from the corner of the box beat goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes. Harry Redknapp's Spurs stayed in fifth position, one point behind City -- who travel to struggling Blackburn on Monday. A hat-trick from Maxi Rodriguez helped sixth-placed Liverpool to a comprehensive 5-0 victory over League Cup winners Birmingham City. Kenny Dalglish's Reds dominated throughout and went ahead in the sixth minute, when Rodriguez converted after visiting goalkeeper Ben Foster had failed to keep hold of Jay Spearing's shot. Dutch forward Dirk Kuyt also scored a rebound to make it 2-0, before Rodriguez grabbed a second with a close-range volley. The 30-year-old completed his treble with a well-struck left-footed shot, before former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole completed the scoring with his first EPL goal for the club in the closing moments as Liverpool closed to within three points of Spurs, having played one more match. Sunderland moved back into the top-10 after recording a first three-point haul since January 22 with a 4-2 defeat of strugglers Wigan Athletic. Wigan went ahead through Mohamed Diame at the beginning of the second half, but Steve Bruce's team came roaring back through goals from Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan and young England midfielder Jordan Henderson. A Stephane Sessegnon penalty made it 3-1 before Henderson doubled his personally tally after 76 minutes.

"(CNN) -- At least 10 people died Saturday after Syrian security forces opened fire on protesters who turned out across the country to mourn dozens of demonstrators slain the day before, eyewitnesses told CNN. The violence erupted in the Damascus suburb of Douma and the southern town of Izraa, where people attended funerals and buried people shot dead during the ""Great Friday"" protests. The brazen Friday killings rippled through the Syrian political establishment Saturday when Syrian parliament member, Khalil Al Rifai,  announced his resignation in a television interview over the deaths. He said security forces opened fire even though President Bashar al-Assad promised not to use force against protesters. The developments occurred amid growing discontent in Syria with the al-Assad regime, whose tough response to peaceful protests has emboldened the citizenry to take to the streets. Douma is one of the towns where Syrians have staged anti-government demonstrations for weeks. On Saturday, as thousands of people marched from the burial grounds towards the main hospital, security forces on the rooftops of government buildings fired shots, a witness said. ""We were chanting 'with our bloods with our souls we will sacrifice for you martyrs.' And all of sudden and without warning, they fired indiscriminately into the crowd,"" the witness said. The witness said five were killed and others were injured. People fled the violence, but several hundred demonstrators remain in smaller alleyways and side streets awaiting the opportunity to come out and demonstrate again. Activist Wissam Tarif, who is not in Syria but remains in contact with activists across the country, said he was told the forces were firing in the air and at random targets.  His contacts told him more than 10,000 protesters took to the streets. Witnesses in Izraa said tens of thousands of people gathered for a funeral procession, when, one  witness said, ""suddenly they opened fire on us and it was raining bullets. We were chanting 'peacefully, peacefully' and they fired at us."" Two people were critically wounded in the assault and medical personnel transported them to a hospital in nearby Daraa, a doctor said. There was a confrontation between security forces and families of the victims. Shots were fired in the air but the security forces left the scene and there were no casualties. Tarif said there were reports of shootings in the city of Homs, but an eyewitness said the city is eerily quiet and many people are too scared to leave their homes. There were burials of slain protesters but the funeral ceremonies were performed quickly and they were sparsely attended as if to not attract attention, the witness said. As for Friday's killings, they occurred in several flashpoint regions as thousands of Syrian protesters defiantly marched after Muslims' weekly prayers in a display of mass discontent toward the government. Violence ripped through the Damascus suburbs of Douma, Moademy and Zamalka, and other cities -- Homs, Harasta and Izraa. Firm casualty figures were difficult to come by. The Syrian government does not permit CNN to report from inside the country and CNN bases its figures on reports from witnesses. Tarif said activists have confirmed at least 84 deaths from Friday's confrontations between protesters and security forces. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said a ""group of people, some of them armed"" assaulted guards in Izraa on Friday, leading to the deaths of eight and the wounding of 28, both from the group and the military. Ted Kattouf, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, expressed admiration for the demonstrators' courage, but made no predictions about where it might lead. ""Unfortunately, repression, if used repeatedly, ruthlessly, brutally, can work. We saw that in Iran and, I'm afraid, we could see it in Syria,"" he told CNN's ""AC 360."" The demonstrators do not have the critical mass needed to effect regime change, Kattouf said. He noted that massive demonstrations have yet to appear in Damascus or Aleppo, where millions of people reside, most of them Sunni. Al-Assad is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The Alawite sect is a minority in Syria but it has maintained control of the regime for decades. ""There's a coalition of interests here, and the demonstrations would have to get much, much larger and stretch the capacity of the regime's security services to the point where some people thought about maybe making their own ways and abandoning Assad."" Amnesty International, which reported at least 75 deaths on Friday, said two boys aged 7 and 10 and a 70-year-old man were killed and urged the regime to stop its attacks on ""peaceful protesters."" ""The Syrian authorities have again responded to peaceful calls for change with bullets and batons,"" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director. The protests began last month in the southern city of Daraa after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti. The tough crackdown in Daraa spurred more protest. As peaceful demonstrations spread to other regions, such as Latakia, Banias, and the Damascus suburbs, the protests were met with force that emboldened the protesters' resolve. The government made some efforts at reform, include the lifting of the country's emergency law, the abolition of a special court that tried regime opponents, the establishment of a new cabinet, and the granting of citizenship to stateless people in the country's northeastern Kurdish region. The emergency law permitted the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. The security court was a special body that prosecuted people regarded as challenging the government. But activists think the violent crackdown Friday undermines the lifting of the emergency law. They also have other complaints with the government, such as immunity for its security officers and the incarceration of political prisoners and those arrested for participating in peaceful protests. They want the easing of the ruling Baath Party's power and a law that would permit the establishment of independent political parties.

"(CNN) -- The list of people missing in tornado-ravaged Joplin, Missouri, shrunk to eight on Wednesday, as officials told CNN that the bodies of two people previously on the list had been identified. Stanley Kirk and Maria Alvares Torres died in the storm, and their next-of-kin were notified, said Seth Bundy with the Department of Public Safety. News reports suggested that two other people listed as ""unaccounted for"" may have been declared dead as well.  Bundy said declarations are not made official until family members are informed. Authorities also announced that a woman who was not listed as missing has died as a result of the severe weather that struck May 22, Bundy said. Over the weekend, Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr told CNN the death toll stood at 142.  Not all the names had been released.  It was not immediately clear whether the deaths announced Wednesday were included in the toll. The May 22 tornado flattened buildings, destroyed neighborhoods and killed more people than any other U.S. tornado since modern record-keeping began in 1950. ""It's indescribable ... just devastating to see all the destruction of my school, my home,"" said Joplin High School sophomore Chanci McGowen, CNN affiliate KODE reported. ""My whole neighborhood is gone, but everyone's OK."" The station broadcast images of a memorial service at the school, where a sign out front just had the letters ""op"" from ""Joplin.""

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova remains on track for a first French Open title after reaching the last 16 with a comprehensive win over Taiwanese qualifier Chan Yung-Jan on Saturday. The former world No. 1, who has won the other three grand slam titles, is among the favorites following the earlier exits of top seeds Caroline Wozniacki and Kim Clijsters. The Russian, seeded seventh, won 6-2 6-3 against her 129th-ranked opponent. She set up a fourth-round clash with Agnieszka Radwanska as she seeks her best showing at Roland Garros since reaching the semifinals in 2007. Polish 12th seed Radwanska, who has beaten Sharapova only once in seven meetings, also won in straight sets as she defeated Belgium's No. 21 Yanina Wickmayer 6-4 6-4. Wozniacki dumped out of French Open . ""It'll be a really tough match because I think this is one of her best surfaces,"" Sharapova, who counts clay as her least favorite, told reporters. ""She's a really good mover and gets a lot of balls back."" The winner of their match will face either Russian 25th seed Maria Kirilenko, who had no problems in ending the run of Clijsters' young Dutch conqueror Arantxa Crus, or Germany's Andrea Petkovic. Petkovic, seeded 15th, overcame Australian No. 24 Jarmila Gajdosova 6-2 4-6 6-3 to reach the fourth round for a third successive grand slam event, having lost in the quarterfinals of this year's Australian Open. Fourth seed Victoria Azarenka is one of Sharapova's main threats to the title, and the Belarusian moved into the last 16 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 win over Italy's Roberta Vinci. Azarenka reached the quarterfinals in 2009, and will seek to emulate that effort by beating Russia's world No. 33 Ekaterina Makarova -- who eliminated Estonian 16th seed Kaia Kanepi 6-4 7-5. The winner of that match will face either Chinese sixth seed Li Na or Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic. Australian Open runner-up Li equaled her best performance in Paris, in 2009, by beating Romania's Sorana Cirstea 6-2 6-2, while ninth seed Kvitova defeated American Vania King 6-4 6-2. Meanwhile, Swiss player Patty Schnyder has announced her retirement from tennis at the age of 32 following her first-round exit in Paris. The former world No. 7 has won 11 titles in a 17-year career, reaching 27 finals. Her best performance at a grand slam was reaching the semifinals of the 2004 Australian Open, while she helped Switzerland reach the Fed Cup final for the only time in 1998.","Former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova cruises into fourth round at Roland Garros .

"(CNNGo) -- After months of anticipation and cast speculation, ""The Hangover Part II"" finally hit screens in Bangkok this week. For anyone unfamiliar with the film, starring Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis, it is much the same as the previous one: a wedding, a bunch of blokes, alcohol, memory loss and a missing person. Though instead of Las Vegas, this time it's set in Thailand. According to the film's producer, Dan Goldberg, Bangkok is ""the last place in the world that these guys should be, which, of course, makes it the perfect place to send them."" Sure, red light districts may be a cliché here in the City of Angels, so they were bound to have a role in the film. But there are plenty more surprises as you follow the wolf pack on their sick night out. ""The different locations provide an interesting cross-section of the city,"" says ""The Hangover Part II"" line producer Chris Lowenstein, of Thailand-based Living Films. ""Bangkok is essentially one of the characters in the movie, and we're trying to show how rich of a tapestry it is."" Review: ""The Hangover Part II"" If you are looking to create your own ""Hangover"" night to forget, here's the insider's guide to the film's Thailand locations and characters. Don't worry, we left out the spoilers. The Location: Phulay Bay Resort, Krabi Ritz Carlton . The Scene: Wedding for Stu (played by Helms) and fiancée Lauren (Jamie Chung). The Action: The world's first Ritz-Carlton Reserve, Phulay Bay Krabi has 54 one-bedroom villas with private plunge pools, outdoor baths, 24-hour butler service and the limestone-studded splendor of the Krabi coastal landscape just a Champagne flute's throw away. Amnesia has never been so pricey nor contracted at such a stunning venue -- online rates starts at 19,550 baht (nearly $650) during low season for a night at this more-than-five-star resort. 111 Moo 3 Nongthalay, Krabi. +66 (0)7 562 8111 . More on CNNGo: 5 'super luxury' Thailand resorts . The Location: Soi Plaeng Nam, Chinatown . The Scene: Phil (Cooper), Stu and Alan (Galifianakis) wake up the next morning in a dirty hotel in Bangkok sans Teddy (Lauren's brother, played by Mason Lee). The Action: Down this alley, best reached by taxi, you can still find bird's nest soup or buy some Chinese red lanterns to deck out your home. Don't try to find the room they woke up in -- those ""The Hangover Part II"" scenes were filmed on Los Angeles sets. Instead, enjoy an icy drink in a plastic bag while you wait for your rubber stamps to be engraved. Or, the lone wolf can take a prowl through vibrant Chinatown by following this mapped outwalking tour. Bangkok Food Tours also organizes a nighttime ""Chinatown Foodie Walk & Culture Tour"" daily, from 6 p.m. - 11 p.m. Standard tickets start at 1,550 baht (about $50) per person, inclusive of savories at seven tasting locations and four historical stops. More on CNNGo: Places to avoid when hungover in Bangkok . The Location: Song Wad Road Roundabout, Chinatown . The Scene: The monkey's drug dealing intersection. The Action: Last time we checked there weren't any Capuchin monkeys nickel-and-dimeing in this 'hood near the river. But it's a good place to sit and have a bowl of roadside guay tiow -- noodles -- as you imagine how location manager Somchai Sanitharangkun managed to close off all seven streets leading out from the one-tree roundabout for the filming. To get there, take the Chao Phraya Express boat to the Ratchawong Pier and hang a right at Song Wad Road. The Location: Ancient City (Muang Boran), Samut Prakan Ancient City . The Scene: In an attempt to recall the missing night, the boys are led to the Chinese temple of Ching Mei to meditate, and Alan has a juvenile vision. The Action: Self-proclaimed as the ""world's largest outdoor museum,"" Muang Boran offers a Cliffsnotes-esque what's what of Thailand's architectural monuments. A sala was added to create the temple atmosphere for the film near the existing Phra Kaew Pavilion, which, as an Ayuttayan representation for Buddhism, is a fitting place to calm the mind. And don't worry, stick-wielding Chinese monks -- as depicted in ""The Hangover Part II"" -- don't really live here. Entrance fees for foreigners are 400 baht (about $13) for adults and 200 baht ($6.50) for children, exclusive of optional golf carts, bicycles and guides. 296/1 Sukhumvit Road, Bangpoo, Samut Prakan. +66 (0)2 709 1644 . More on CNNGo: Why Thailand can enjoy ""The Hangover Part II"" without shame . The Location: Soi Cowboy . The Scene: At Siam Sam's Bar, things get a little crazy. The Action: The colorful stretch of dubious nightlife that runs parallel to Sukhumvit Road, linking Asoke to Soi 23, needs little introduction. ""Siam Sam's"" entrance is actually Cactus Bar, with the interior scenes filmed at Tilac Bar. We can't provide links to any of the sites that review these places for obvious reasons, but a Google search will easily lead the way. Don't bother looking for the back room in search of extracurricular activities or try to escape through the back alley when you're chased by ""ladies"" of the night. All that was filmed in Los Angeles and Chinatown respectively. If you are under 20 years of age or don't like the color red, loud music, or skimpy clothing, this place is not for you.

The Scene: A clue leads the wolf pack to a party street and barber shop, where the boys find themselves strangely unpopular. The Action: This was the set of ""The Hangover Part II"" that Bill Clinton visited, but the bars and tattoo parlor purpose-built for the film are not there anymore. (Contrary to rumors, the ex-president does not have a cameo role in this movie). Small restaurants and bars line this pseudo-red light district, so you can have a drink and reflect on how ""dead-end"" applies to more than just the soi. To get there, take the BTS to Nana station.

The hotel's Tower Club was also turned into a film set during the shoot, with the landmark ""golden dome"" on top of the building making a few appearances as well. To commemorate the film, the al fresco Sirocco restaurant and adjacent bar (sticklers for dress code) are offering Hangovertini cocktails for 490 baht to kickstart your night in style.

"(CNN) -- Louisiana's swollen Atchafalaya River was slowly receding along its entire length Tuesday after federal authorities flooded it to save the Mississippi River cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the National Weather Service reported. The Atchafalaya crested at more than six feet above flood stage at Morgan City, about 80 miles west of New Orleans, and forecasters are projecting a long, steady decline, said Shawn O'Neil, a meteorologist at the Weather Service office in Slidell. The river's peak at Morgan City was 10.35 feet -- barely two inches below its historic high-water mark in 1973 -- ""and now it's slowly, slowly falling,"" O'Neil said. Leroy Breaux, a resident of nearby Amelia, said the water rose about halfway up Morgan City's sea wall, where the name of the town is etched into the concrete. ""The water is up over the wall, and it's like the word Morgan City is sitting in the water,"" he said. Some businesses along the waterfront outside the sea wall flooded, but the sea wall -- and a massive barge sunk into nearby Bayou Chene -- prevented high water from reaching neighborhoods in and around the area, Breaux said. ""The blessing is there's no rain. If you had the amount of rain you had in 1973, you would have a much worse problem,"" said Breaux, who lived in Amelia during that year's flood and now serves as chairman of a local flood-control district. The Army Corps of Engineers began diverting water from the Mississippi into the Atchafalaya basin on May 14 by opening the Morganza Spillway above Baton Rouge. The agency began closing the spillway last Wednesday, shutting seven of the 17 bays opened during the operation by Tuesday evening, Corps spokeswoman Rachel Rodi said. At the peak of the diversion, as much as 1.2 million gallons of water per second were pouring into the Atchafalaya basin from the Mississippi, the Corps reported. The Atchafalaya may not reach its normal levels until ""well into June,"" O'Neil said. Officials said last week that flooding in the basin was not as severe as expected after the spillway's opening. But at least 1,230 structures in 13 parishes were affected by rising water, according to the state Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness office.","NEW: ""The blessing is there's no rain,"" one area resident says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A CIA team of forensics specialists has been granted permission by the Pakistani government to visit the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed, to search for possibly hidden or buried documents, a U.S. official confirms to CNN. The team will ""gather up any additional information that can be found,"" the official said. During the raid earlier this month, the Navy SEAL team was able to gather a substantial amount of intelligence documents and computer media during its 40-minute assault on the compound in Abbottabad. But the CIA has wanted to return to see if other material could be found. Former Pakistan leader: U.S. showed ""arrogance"" The team of agents also wants to have a close look at the compound to see what else it can learn about Bin Laden's stay there, the official said. The agreement was reached several days ago by CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell and the Pakistani government. The official declined to say when the visit will happen and if more than one trip is planned.","An official declined to say when the visit will happen .

"(CNN) -- World number one Caroline Wozniacki suffered another morale-sapping defeat at the French Open as she was dumped out by 28th seed Daniela Hantuchova. The Dane, who is yet to win a Grand Slam tournament, was beaten 6-1 6-3 in just 73 minutes to extend her miserable run at Roland Garros. Her best performance in Paris was reaching the quarterfinals in 2009 and she struggled against Hantuchova, from Slovakia, who was competing in her 41st major. Hantuchova reeled off nine straight games to seal the opening set and take a commanding lead in the second but Woznaicki offered herself hope when she secured her first break to reduce the deficit to 4-2. But Hantuchova held serve twice to seal one of the biggest victories of her career and set up a meeting with 2009 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the last 16, after she beat Canadian Rebecca Marino 6-0 6-4. ""She played very well today, better than me for sure,"" Wozniacki told a press conference. ""She knew what she wanted to do and I need to get back on the court and practice and come back stronger. ""Kim had a tough loss yesterday and I had a tough loss today and that's what can happen. Since we are number one and two we must be doing something right. ""I am young and I get experience every time and you learn more from your losses than from your wins."" After Wozniacki's exit, and Kim Clijsters defeat on Thursday, the trend for upsets continued as Australian 8th seed Samantha Stosur was beaten by unseeded Gisela Dulko. The Argentine set the tone by taking the first four games of the match, and though she dropped the second set, Stosur's 35 unforced errors counted as Dulko wrapped up the match. Afterwards, she told a press conference she was dedicating her victory to her brother's twins, Myla and Teo, who were born overnight. ""Yesterday night I was awake really late,"" she said. ""You know, it was very emotional, because I would have loved to be there, but I'm here. The key to the match was to start well, to be aggressive from the start,"" Stosur added: ""She seemed to be out ahead a little bit better and really kind of be the one dictating the points, which, for me, I'm usually the one able to do that."" Elsewhere, defending champion and fifth seed, Francesca Schiavone, from Italy, had no such trouble making the fourth round after her Chinese opponent Shuai Peng retired hurt with the score at 6-3 1-2. Russian third seed Vera Zvonareva beat Anastasia Rodionova, from Austria, 6-2 6-3 and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the 14th seed, triumphed over Nuria Llagostera Vives, from Spain, 3-6 6-3 6-3. Serb Jelena Jankovic, the 10th seed, beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands, from the United States, 6-2 6-2, while 11th seed Marion Bartoli, from France, beat Julia Goerges, from Germany, 3-6 6-2 6-4.","Caroline Wozniacki beaten at the French Open by Daniela Hantuchova .
