"Thirty-five years after the genocidal rule of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge ended, a UN-backed tribunal on Thursday sentenced two top leaders of the former regime to life in prison for 'extermination, inhumane acts and attacks against human dignity'. The regime's 1970s terror period left close to two million people dead. The historic verdicts were announced against Khieu Samphan, the regime's 83-year-old former head of state, and Nuon Chea, its 88-year-old chief ideologue - the only two surviving leaders of the regime left to stand trial.

The tribunal's chief judge Nil Nonn asked both men to rise for the verdicts but the frail Nuon Chea, wearing dark sunglasses, said he was too weak to stand from his wheelchair and was allowed to remain seated. Nil Nonn said both men were guilty of 'extermination encompassing murder, political persecution, and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer, enforced disappearances and attacks against human dignity.' There was no visible reaction from either of the accused, both of whom have denied wrongdoing. The rulings can be appealed, but Nil Nonn told the court that 'given the gravity of the crimes' both would remain in detention. The case, covering the forced exodus of millions of people from Cambodia's towns and cities and a mass killing, is just part of the Cambodian story. Nearly a quarter of the population — about 1.7 million people — died under rule of the Khmer Rouge through a combination of starvation, medical neglect, overwork and execution when the group held power in 1975-79. Tribunal spokesman Lars Olsen called it 'a historic day for both the Cambodian people and the court. A young Cambodian woman looks at the main stupa in Choeung Ek Killing Fields, which is filled with thousands of skulls of those killed during the Pol Pot regime . A tourist looks at human skulls of genocide victims at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, formerly the most notorious Khmer Rouge prison, in Phnom Penh . Former Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot talks to a journalist in a hide-out in Northern Cambodia - he died in 1998 . The Khmer Rouge, the communist ruling party in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, was responsible for the deaths of almost two million people, through executions, torture and starvation. Its leader, Pol Pot, was determined for society to be transformed into classless agricultural communism – at any cost. City dwellers were marched into the countryside to become farmers in labour camps, with those refusing to move shot dead and their homes burned to the ground. Factories, schools, banks and even hospitals were shut down and the population denied medicine. Many died through starvation – after all, most people from cities had no idea how to fend for themselves in the countryside and farmers were often too terrified to help them adapt. Some died through exhaustion, because the regime severely overworked those tending the land. Many were tortured and executed for being ‘enemies of the regime’. Anyone with links to the former Cambodian government, filmmakers, writers and indeed anyone deemed to be intellectual deserved to be put to death in the eyes of Pot. Even simply owning a pair of glasses could prove fatal, because as far as the regime was concerned, it meant that books were being read instead of hard labour being carried out. Religion was outlawed, so Christians, Muslims and Buddhists were also executed in huge numbers. The victims have waited 35 years for legal accountability, and now that the tribunal has rendered a judgment, it is a clear milestone.' Many have criticized the slow justice, however, and its cost. The tribunal, formally known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and comprising of Cambodian and international jurists, began operations in 2006. It has since spent more than $200million, yet it had convicted only one defendant — prison director Kaing Guek Eav, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2011. The current trial began in 2011 with four senior Khmer Rouge leaders; only two remain. Former Foreign Minister Ieng Sary died in 2013, while his wife, Social Affairs Minister Ieng Thirith, was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia in 2012. The group's top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998. Khieu Samphan has acknowledged that mass killings took place. But testifying before the court in 2011, he claimed he was just a figurehead who had no real authority. He denied ordering any executions himself, calling the allegations a 'fairy tale.' Instead, he blamed Pol Pot for its extreme policies. Nuon Chea, who is known as Brother No. 2 for being Pol Pot's trusted deputy, had also denied responsibility, testifying in 2011 that Vietnamese forces — not the Khmer Rouge — had killed Cambodians en masse. 'I don't want them to believe the Khmer Rouge are bad people, are criminals,' he said of those observing to the trial. 'Nothing is true about that.' Because of the advanced age and poor health of the defendants, the case against them was divided into separate smaller trials in an effort to render justice before they die. Both men now face a second trial that is due to start in September or October, this time on charges of genocide, Olsen said. That trial is expected to take years to complete. Survivors of the regime traveled from across the country to witness the historic day, filling several hundred seats available to the public at the tribunal. After the verdict was read, many said they felt mixed reactions and questioned if any punishment could fit the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge. 'The crimes are huge, and just sentencing them to life in jail is not fair,' said 54-year-old Chea Sophon, who spent years in hard labor camps building dams and working in rice fields. His brother was killed during the Khmer Rouge era . 'But what can I do? I just accept the verdict,' he said, but then added: 'Even if they die many times over, it would not be enough.' A female survivor, 58-year-old Khuth Vouern, said she felt a sense of relief that justice was finally served, even if it was generations late. 'I have been waiting for this day for many years,' said the woman, whose husband and several other family members were killed during the Khmer rouge reign. 'Now, for the first time, my mind feels at least some degree of peace.' Khmer Rouge survivor Bou Meng, left, collects the court documents after the verdicts were announced .

"The New York Stock Exchange will reopen for regular trading Wednesday after being shut down for two days because of Hurricane Sandy. The exchange said in a statement Tuesday that its building and trading floor are fully operational and that normal trading will resume at the usual starting time of 9:30 a.m. There had been erroneous reports Monday that the exchange floor had flooded. Exchange spokesman Ray Pellecchia said the exchange's building did not have any flooding or damage. Back for business: The . New York Stock Exchange will re-open on Wednesday . Deluge: Officials decided late Sunday that it was too risky to ask any personnel to staff the exchanges . Tuesday marks the first time since . 1888 that the NYSE remained closed for two consecutive days because of . weather. The earlier shutdown was caused by a massive snow storm. Sections of Manhattan were inundated . with water on Tuesday and power was shut off to millions of people and . businesses up and down the East Coast. Manhattan's financial district was . one of the hardest hit when Hurricane Sandy slammed New York Monday . afternoon and through the night. Initial reports that the exchange was three feet underwater were denied by a press spokesman. Deserted: The floor of the iconic building stands eerily quiet . Silent: It is the only time the Stock Exchange has closed for two days for more than a century . 'There has been no damage to our . building or systems, and we will conduct tests with the industry today . with the aim of reopening U.S. markets on Wednesday,' NYSE spokesman Ray . Pellecchia said in a statement. Though they would not go into . specifics, a number of generators must be located onsite in order for . the prospect of a Wednesday reopening to be considered, since lower . Manhattan remains without power and will likely continue as such for as . long as week, according to city power executives. The closure has made several records . in the history of the exchange, as Monday's closing was the first time . that the markets were formally shut since the days following the . September 11 attacks in 2001. Beyond that, it was the first time that it closed since Hurricane Gloria 27 years ago. CNN earned itself another black eye after wrongly reporting that the New York Stock Exchange was flooded with three feet of water following the worst of Hurricane Sandy. ‘There has been no damage to our building or systems, and we will conduct tests with the industry today with the aim of reopening U.S. markets on Wednesday,’ NYSE spokesman Ray Pellecchia said in a statement. During a live segment on Piers Morgan’s show Monday night, the anchor spoke with the network’s meteorologist who based the sensational claim solely on a comment left in a chat room. ‘You have an update on the stock exchange situation. Do we still think that three feet of water got into the exchange? There seem to be conflicting reports now,’ Morgan asked meteorologist Chad Myers. ‘Oh, is that right? You know, I got that from the National Weather Service chat bulletin board. It was right on there; it said three feet of water on the floor. I don’t know if there’s conflicting reports or not,’ Myers said. The claim instantly went viral, spreading quickly on social networks and circulating as fact. An NYSE official quickly tried to thwart the rumor, saying that the infrastructure of the landmark Wall Street building was ‘fine’. A spokesman for the network issued a vague apology, purposefully avoiding the point of the fact that their sources were as murky as the alleged sea water that covered much of lower Manhattan. ‘Chad referenced a National Weather Service report that turned out to be incorrect. We quickly made an on air correction. We regret the error,’ CNN spokesman Bridget Leininger said. When today's closure was announced it . was became first time that the NYSE was closed for two consecutive days . due to weather since 1888. Like much of the city, the Exchange . braced for the impact of Hurricane Sandy on Sunday, lining up a sandbag . barrier outside the building on iconic Wall Street. Nasdaq officials began employing . their contingency plans as soon as they came to the decision to close on . Sunday around 10.30pm. Traders were able to continue to . complete a drastically-reduced level of orders electronically, as many . banks have remote systems set up so that employees can work from home in . crisis situations. The New York Stock Exchange, which is . a privately-held company in itself, keeps a secondary location up and . running in case of emergency where all data is stored. The problem there, however, is that . the data centre is in Mahwah, New Jersey, which is dealing with . potentially more structural damage than New York. According to Wall Street and Tech, . the centre boasts a supply of 28 megawatts of power, which equates to . the amount used to power 4,500 residential homes. Additionally NYSE spokesman Robert . Rendine told The New York Times that they have a number of generators . and sufficient fuel to power the site for at least one week if . electricity does not return. 'I'm a little surprised that the . exchanges couldn't secure the technology needed to keep the market . operating,' said Dominic Salvino, a trader from the Chicago Board . Options Exchange told Bloomberg Businessweek. 'It seems unreasonable that the . nation's financial markets have to shut down just because everyone has . located themselves within five miles of each other in New Jersey. A snow . storm in Chicago wouldn't shut down trading on the East Coast.' The ripple effects are already being . seen, as companies are postponing their quarterly earnings, which were . scheduled to be released earlier this week. According to CBS News, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and media conglomerate Thomson Reuters are two of the tardy reportees. Dozens of companies have postponed . earnings reports this week because of the storm, but Ford Motor Co. did . release results for the third quarter that topped Wall Street . expectations. Ford's revenue fell 3 percent to . $32.1 billion because of the economic crisis in Europe and falling sales . in South America. The company exceeded Wall Street's revenue forecast . of $31.5 billion largely because of North America, where revenue jumped 8 . percent. European stock markets rose broadly . Tuesday after falling the day before. Trading was subdued in the wake of . the storm. Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.9 percent, Germany's DAX . rose 1.1 percent and the CAC-40 in France was 1.5 percent higher. Crude oil rose 14 cents to settle at $85.68 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. U.S. bond trading was closed Tuesday. Electronic trading for U.S. stock index futures was open, but trading volume was very light and the price moves were minuscule. As of the regular close of trading at . 9:15 a.m., Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 8 points to . 13,062. S&P 500 futures added 3.50 points to 1,411.10.

"A Somali rapist who cannot be deported because of human rights laws has spent nearly a decade in prison since completing his sentence – at a cost to taxpayers of £400,000. The man, who has not been named, was jailed for eight years for a serious sexual assault but completed his jail term in September 2002. Since then he has been held almost constantly in Lincoln Prison because ministers are powerless to kick him out. Blocked: A European Court of Human Rights ruling last year blocked the return of dozens of Somali criminals who the judges said could be harmed if returned to their homeland . Judges have refused to deport Somali nationals because they could face ‘inhumane or degrading treatment’ – a breach of Article 3 of of the Human Rights Act. A single year in prison is estimated to cost around £45,000. That means the extra time he has remained in prison at the end of his jail term has cost taxpayers a small fortune. The man was released in 2007 following an order by an immigration judge. But he was returned to prison the following year having failed to comply with the conditions of his bail. Whitehall sources said that while it was unacceptable for the man to remain in prison, it was better than him being out on the streets and a threat to the public. The new case was revealed in a report by the Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick . A European Court of Human Rights ruling last year blocked the return of dozens of Somali criminals who the judges said could be harmed if returned to their homeland. Article 3, which protects against torture and inhuman treatment, is an ‘absolute’ right, meaning it applies regardless of the offences committed. The new case was revealed in a report by the Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick, who was examining conditions in the Category B jail in Lincolnshire. The report said: ‘We found two foreign national prisoners who had been held for lengthy periods beyond the end of their sentence, one for a shocking nine years beyond the end of his sentence. ‘It cannot be right that they continue to be detained for so long without the authority of  a court.’","Unnamed man completed his jail term in September 2002 .

"A leather jacket which has been tagged by iconic artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and other legendary art figures from his era is expected to fetch up to $10,000 when it hits the auction block later today. The size 42 coat, which is being sold by the former stage manager of New York nightclub Danceteria, will go under the hammer at Swann Auction Galleries, where it is hoped a number of Basquiat’s most devoted fans will place bids in the hopes of taking the one-of-a-kind piece home. The auction house confirmed that the supple white leather jacket is being sold by the original owner, Rico Espinet, who managed Danceteria from 1981 to 1986 and now owns an art and design store in Brooklyn, and added that its pre-sale estimate for the coat is between $7,000 and $10,000. Personal effects: A leather jacket tagged by Jean-Michel Basquiat and other personalities of New York City's 1980s underground art scene is hitting the auction block . During his time working at the club, Mr Espinet asked one of the elevator operators, a woman called Joy, to use the jacket as a blank canvas for celebrity guests to sign. Her part in helping to create the artistic outerwear has been commemorated in its own tag, which reads 'Joystick' and can be seen scribbled in large black letters highlighted in blue on the jacket's verso. Its author is not known. Mr Basquiat's contribution includes schematic drawings and the words 'breast' and 'corset'. Sketchy behavior: Rico Espinet, the former stage manager and lighting director of the legendary 1980s nightclub Danceteria, asked one of the elevator operators to use the jacket as a blank canvas for celebrity guests to sign .

One of his paintings sold at auction last year for $23.7 million. Portrait of the artist: Mr Basquiat, pictured in the 1980s at a Soho gallery, contributed schematic drawings and the words 'breast' and 'corset' to the jacket . He died in 1988 of a drug overdose at age 27. But while Mr Basquiat is gone, his art lives on. Prints of 35 of his most famous works went on sale at Selfridges for the first time in October. And the Brooklyn Museum is currently planning an exhibition on the artist that includes eight rarely seen notebooks filled with his handwritten texts and sketches, which will open in April.","The unique coat hits the auction block at Swann Galleries, New York, today .

"Students from a ladies university rowing club who posed nude for a risque calendar last year have ignored criticism once again in bid to raise money for charity - by posing completely naked again this year. The students from Warwick University Rowing Society caused controversy in 2012 after their naked photographs were branded ‘tacky’ and ‘sexist’. Undeterred the girls have ditched their life jackets to this time completely strip off for a raunchy new 2014 version. Scroll down for video . Nude for charity: The female students of Warwick University Rowing . Society have decided to make another nude calendar to raise money for a . cancer charity despite causing a feminism row over a similar calendar . last year . The calendar features 17 members of the university’s rowing club - aged between 18 and 21 - who can be seen frolicking by the River Avon and in their boat house in Barford, Warwickshire. Second year History and Politics student Hettie Reed, 21, came up with the idea with friends Frankie Salzano, 21, and Sophie Bell, 19, who all feature in the calendar. Miss Reed, from Poole, Dorset was forced to leap to the defence of their 2013 calendar after facing a torrent of abuse on the internet from feminist bloggers. Bearing all: The students were undeterred by comments that their photographs last year were 'tacky' and 'sexist,' deciding to go ahead with their 2014 calendar (October pictured) Just a bit of fun: Student Hettie Reed, one of the original creators of the calendar, said the women had fun making the calendar and that the criticism just spurred them on to make the 2014 calendar . Yesterday she revealed the girls had just as much fun stripping this year, much to the delight of passing fishermen. She said: ‘The criticism we received last year just spurred us on to do it again as we were given so much positive feedback all in all. ‘It is just a harmless bit of fun for a fabulous cause and our fan base has only really grown as a result of last year’s furore. ‘So many people got in touch whose lives had been affected by cancer to say thanks and who can criticise us for that? ‘This year we shot the calendar over two days in June. The weather was a bit windy which played havoc with the girl’s hair. Good PR: The furore helped the students' fan base grow and Ms Reed said many people affected by cancer had got in touch to say thank you rather than to criticis . Calendar girls: The photo shoot involving 17 students was done in June and windy weather caused some hair issues . ‘We had to hold towels around the girls too because we kept giving the passing fishermen an eyeful. I think they loved it. ‘We also travelled to Spain to do a bonus shoot and those can be purchased as well as the calendar. ‘It was a bit easier stripping naked out there as the weather was much nicer.’ Layla Haidrani, a University of Kent student who describes herself as a commentator on feminist issues, described the concept as ‘tacky’ and an ‘attempt to gain notoriety’ on a blog written for the Huffington Post UK in December 2012. Layla Haidrani, who describes herself as a commentator on feminist issues, wrote: 'Groups of women posing semi-naked on a field with sticks doesn't sound a fundraising initiative for charity, it just sounds tacky,' Naked ambition: Sophie Bell, 19, Frankie Salzano, 21, and Hettie Reed, 21 (left to right) came up with the idea and all feature in the calendar . Beginning of the year: This photo, featured for January 2014, is one of 12 in the latest calendar on sale for £7.99 to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support . Aiming high: The rowing students hope they can triple the £600 they made for the charity last year and has 300 pre-orders already . 'Although many argue that it is purely for fundraising purposes, in my own university sports team, the majority of women who participated were not made aware and did not even seek to find out which charities were being helped. 'Rather, they just view it as an opportunity to strip and attempt to gain notoriety with friends and family both back home and on campus.' In response to the criticism Ms Reed said at the time: 'I do believe that women deserve equality and in my eyes, if the men of our rowing club are able to make a naked calendar we should have the right to do the same thing without [receiving] derogatory and slanderous comments - that is what equality is about.' The male students in the rowing society have created nude calendars for charity for the last four years. The 2014 calendar, which raised £600 for Macmillan Cancer Support last year, already has 300 pre-orders. The girls hope they can triple last year’s amount with their latest calendar, which is priced at £7.99.

"At first glance, it looks uncannily like the flying golden snitch that Harry Potter chased while playing quidditch - but in fact these amazing images show a unique colour-changing beetle. The incredibly rare golden beetle was captured by photographer Chime Tsetan. The Golden Tortoise Beetle, as it's formally known, can change colour and can even alter its reflectivity. The tiny beetle looks uncannily like the Golden Snitch chased by Harry potter and other quidditch players in the Harry Potter films . The beetle is strikingly similar to the golden snitch seen here in the hand of Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter. In the film series, the flying ball was used in the game of quidditch . The tiny insects are able to change colour, from golden to a red with black spots rather like a ladybug. They can alter the reflectivity of the cuticle so the outer layers become clear, revealing a ladybug type of red coloring with black spots. This colour change is accomplished by microscopic valves controlling the moisture levels under the shell. Chime, who is based in Tibet, captured the stunning insect while visiting an irrigation channel in Mundgod, India. He said: 'As kids back in the school days, we used to call it 'Ser Bu' which means golden insect. 'We used to catch the insects and put them in our geometry boxes with the leaves on. 'These beetles come in various colours, golden like this one and also in silver, yellow and spotted. 'A big golden beetle like this used to fetch us two to three pencils or a pen in exchange with other kids who used to be amused with this shiny creature. 'So when I found this beetle last year, it brought me all my childhood memories. The Golden Tortoise Beetle, as its formerly known, can change colour and can even alter its reflectivity . The rare golden beetle captured by photographer Chime Tsetan in Mundgod, India . The thumbnail-sized beetle was once common, but photographer Chime Tsetan said they are now rare in India . Chime took up photography as a hobby while he studied at university after his family moved to India in 1960 when Tibet was invaded by China. Golden tortoise beetles are common beetles that can be found on morning glory leaves, which are their preferred food. They can change colour, looking initially like tiny jewels, or golden ladybugs, by altering the level of reflectivity so the outer layers become clear. Tsetan said: 'It doesn't sting or bite. It just tries to get to an elevated place to fly, in this case, my finger tip. 'But it did poo on my finger just before it flew away. 'Nowadays we don't find much of them around any more.' The tiny beetles uses a system of valves on their body to alter their appearance, making them appear golden .","Golden tortoise beetle can change colour and even its reflectivity .

"This Utah father accused of chaining his son to a bed while the man was at work would not serve any jail time under a plea deal . A Utah father accused of chaining his seven-year-old son to a bed while the man was at work would not serve any jail time under a plea deal awaiting final approval by a judge. The 29-year-old father from Logan pleaded guilty Monday to one misdemeanor count of child abuse. Defense attorney David Perry said the father could not afford day care for the boy. Prosecutors did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the deal. Court records indicate they have agreed to seek a sentence requiring the father to wear an ankle monitor for about four months and complete 80 hours of community service. The Associated Press is withholding the name of the father to avoid identifying the child. The father was charged in June with four misdemeanor counts of child abuse after police following an anonymous tip discovered the boy in a basement bedroom in a middle-class neighborhood of Logan, north of Salt Lake City. Three of the charges were later dropped as part of the plea agreement. The man acknowledged chaining the boy, then aged six, during the day on other occasions, police said. Perry disputed whether the allegations constituted child abuse under Utah law. He said the boy wasn't injured by the heavy chain attached to his ankle, and he had access to snacks, water and a bathroom. 'He wasn't chaining him up for punishment or anything,' the lawyer said. 'He couldn't afford day care. He didn't understand there were other services.' The child was taken into foster care during the investigation. The father, who makes $13 an hour doing general labor, has taken parenting classes and cooperated with state child welfare authorities in an effort to regain custody, Perry said. Scene of the incident: The Utah home where the boy was found is located on a picturesque street 80 miles north of Salt Lake City . The boy's mother isn't currently involved in his upbringing. A judge has tentatively accepted the plea but won't officially sign off on the sentencing until a December 15 hearing. The father remains on probation after a separate conviction for felony forgery and theft in 2009. He was arrested again in 2011 when he broke the terms of his probation, online court records show.","A 29-year-old father from Logan, Utah, was arrested in June after police found his son, then aged six, padlocked to bed frame .

The advice, published by the Medical Schools Council which represents medical schools all over the country, comes amid concerns that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely to study the subject. Only two fifths of doctors attended non-selective state schools, while a third were privately educated. Medicine is a very popular career choice, the guidance says, with fierce competition. 'Medical schools have worked hard so that they can attract the right candidates and to establish admissions processes which are fair to all,' it says. 'Yet it remains that more needs to be done to ensure that the medical profession is representative of the society it serves, and that medical students are able to learn in a diverse environment.' This is the first time that the council has published advice on how to widen access to medical courses. It suggests that the 'journey to medicine' should start in primary schools, an area which is sometimes overlooked by medical schools. Pupils should be told about the qualifications and routes to becoming a doctor, the guidance says, and take part in 'lively and fun' activities linked to the profession. This could include roadshows, campus visits, demonstrations and workshops. 'Medical students acting as ambassadors are often the best people to lead activity, which can include demonstrations, campus tours and mentoring,' it says. 'Some medical schools formally recognise this work by medical students as part of their educational development.' In secondary schools, students should be taught about studying medicine at university and what a career in the profession involves. This includes helping pupils make the right subject choices for their GCSEs, Scottish Nationals, A-levels and other qualifications. The guidance goes on to suggest that when pupils are in the sixth-form, medical schools could offer would-be students help in making applications, including support in writing personal statements and preparing for interviews and admissions tests. Experts said primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops to help encourage them to train up . They could also run master classes and summer schools for secondary school pupils of all ages. Professor Tony Weetman, chair of the Selecting for Excellence Executive Group, said: 'A candidate's journey to a medical degree starts long before the Ucas application is made. 'The commitment in terms of hard work and academic achievement is of course essential, but before that must come the awareness that studying medicine is an option. 'That realisation does not come readily to all potential candidates, be they school students or mature learners, and we know that one's background will play a central part here. 'Medical schools cannot leave potentially excellent candidates to learn this message on their own; they have a responsibility, where possible, to reach out to these people and show them first-hand that a career in medicine is for anyone with the ability and commitment.' Professor Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: 'This guidance represents a major development in helping to improve access to the elite medical profession. 'Going to medical school opens the door to a career in a rewarding, high-status profession and that door should be open to everyone who has what it takes to be an excellent doctor, regardless of their background.'","Primary school pupils should have chance to meet medics, experts claim .

"A former woodwork teacher repeatedly molested children aged between three and 16 while reading passages from the bible and posing as a churchgoer. 79-year-old Stephen Gough admitted to nine acts of child sex abuse charges on Wednesday at Waitakere District Court in New Zealand. He received three-and-a-half years behind bars for his disturbing crimes. The judge said that Mr Gough carefully orchestrated his acts and used the children as 'sexual toys'. A former woodwork teacher repeatedly molested children aged between three and 16 while reading passages from the bible and posing as a churchgoer . The court heard that Gough, who needed the help of a walking stick to get up on the dock, repeatedly committed the heinous crimes against three girls and one boy over an 11-year period. Gough gained the trust of community members by being heavily involved in his local community and in the church. It was revealed that Gough would read passages from the bible to the innocent children while sexually abusing them, between 1976 and 1987. The court also heard that Gough watched children showering by carving out a peep hole under a house. His crimes only came to light after his victims came forward last year. 79-year-old Stephen Gough admitted to nine acts of child sex abuse charges on Wednesday at Waitakere District Court in New Zealand . Police believe more victims may come to light after Gough has been sentenced and are encouraging people to come forward. Police say new charges against Gough will be considered if further victims identify themselves. Speaking at the sentencing, Judge Glubb said Mr Gough's actions were 'a total disgrace'. 'This is a very sad day. It represents an appalling track record of invasive offending against very vulnerable young children,' he said. As Gough was led away from the dock, one of his victims screamed out in disgust. 'Burn in hell you piece of s***,' the victim said. According to reports,  Mr Gough believed he had been cured of his sexual addiction, having completed three rehabilitation programs for his urges. The court took this into consideration when sentencing Mr Gough. The court heard that Gough, who needed the help of a walking stick to get up on the dock, repeatedly committed the heinous crimes against three girls and one boy over an 11-year period . Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, one of Gough's victims described how the vile man had ruined her life. She told the newspaper that her mother knew exactly what was happening to her and never did anything about it. She also revealed that she has tried to end her own life on numerous occasions since she was abused as a young girl and has developed an alcohol addiction and eating disorder from her trauma. 'Two months ago I tried to take my life... it was pretty bad,' she said. They thought I was going to die this time. It's pretty hard. 'He has totally and completely ruined my life, I'm a complete mess. I drink to forget... I've been to rehab four times, I got sectioned last year because of my drinking. I'm so f***ing angry.' the victim said. She encouraged any other victims to come forward now that Mr Gough's name has been made public. She also thanked the police for helping bring Mr Gough to justice.","A former teacher molested children while reading the bible .

"When, just a few weeks ago, the impossibly glamorous Kate O’Mara succumbed to ovarian cancer,  the showbusiness world united to lavish praise not just on her striking looks, but a screen presence who lit up some of the most popular television dramas ever broadcast. She had travelled a long way from a childhood in wartime Leicester to the Hollywood glamour of Dynasty. But for all the acclaim, it was also a journey that left an indelible mark of sadness on the actress, a grief she tried to keep secret not just from her fans, but her closest family. Strained relationship: Kate O'Mara, pictured left at the height of her 1970s fame, only met her estranged son Christopher Linde (right) a handful of times . Notably after her death, there was no moving tribute from the 74-year-old’s sole surviving son, Christopher Linde – nor was he invited to the family funeral. In fact, the child O’Mara bore as a struggling young actress was  a stranger to her and - as The Mail on Sunday has established – she nursed a bitter grievance towards him until her dying day. An impassioned letter written by the actress, and never seen before now, accuses Linde of  terrorising her, and claims that the revelation of his existence pushed her into severe depression and drove her father, a former RAF flight instructor, to an early grave. Linde, in turn, blames his mother for abandoning him twice – at birth and as a young man. Today, the 48-year-old leads a squalid existence in a rundown housing association flat in Redhill, Surrey. Uninterested: Kate O'Mara said she had been 'blackmailed' by her secret son - while he has called her the 'worst mother ever' Plagued by ill-health and agoraphobia, he exists on benefits – and is likely to do so for some time. The actress’s will, published last week, leaves him not a penny from her £350,000 estate. It is a decisive confirmation of  their estrangement. Instead, O’Mara left a £10,000 legacy to the Actors’ Benevolent Fund and, after the funeral and legal fees, the remainder to her younger sister Belinda Cochrane, a former actress. Mrs Cochrane’s husband Michael plays retired farmer Oliver Sterling on Radio 4’s The Archers. The very private drama of mother and son began on May 12, 1965, when O’Mara gave birth to an illegitimate child, the product of a brief liaison with actor David Orchard. The two had met on the set of television series No Hiding Place. Times were hard. O’Mara was living in shared rented rooms and was already a single mother when she gave birth to Christopher. Bringing up two children on her own would, she felt, be impossible. Career: O'Mara is pictured here in The Saint, which broadcast in 1968, when Linde was three. He has said she treated him like a member of her fan club . So with her own parents still unaware that he existed, the baby boy was adopted by a married couple called Derek and Joy Linde. There the story might have ended. But at 18, Linde discovered the identity of his birth mother, and, after his then-girlfriend wrote to the actress in 1985, he and O’Mara were briefly - and tragically - reunited. They met on a handful of occasions, but when the news of her illegitimate son broke, O’Mara blamed Linde for speaking to the media. The pair fell out and never spoke again. Now a shambling figure with long, unkempt grey hair, Linde rarely leaves his flat, where he is surrounded by prescription drugs for depression and his neurological disorder. He feels little sympathy for the plight of his mother and expresses no shock that he was left out of her will. ‘I’m not shocked, I’m not surprised at all,’ he says. ‘I hadn’t expected her to leave me anything. ‘She didn’t know what sort of person I was – she never even attempted to get to know me. It’s crazy because I’m a perfectly civilised human being. The money might have helped with treatment. ‘But it doesn’t really make any difference to me now. What would have made a difference is if she hadn’t given me up when I was a day old. ‘If she had just been a normal person, that would have helped. She even got the date of my birth wrong in her autobiography. She said I was born in 1966 and I wasn’t. I was born in May 1965.’ He and Kate met shortly before she joined the cast of Dynasty as Caress Morell, the sister of Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins, in the hit saga about the wealthy Carrington family. Linde recalls his first encounter with his mother: ‘I was nervous. She didn’t say a lot. She didn’t seem to understand why I wanted to know who my dad was, or why I wanted to know where I came from. ‘I remember her not being particularly interested in me or what I was doing. I do remember her crying a bit but I was never made to feel at ease. There was no warmth, no empathy. ‘It was really awkward. I’m a working-class kid and I’m down-to-earth. But she wasn’t down-to-earth at  all. She was very “One does this, one does that, blah, blah, blah”. It was all very affected. ‘But I was polite. She didn’t seem interested in anything such as who I was and where I was from.’ The second time Linde met his mother briefly in a cafe, and the next day she came to his council flat then and brought him to her home in Farnham, Surrey. He says: ‘She didn’t seem to want to tell me who my dad was until the last time I met her and she told me his name. That time she came to my flat and drove me down to her cottage. ‘But she treated me like I was a member of her fan club. I can remember coming home with glossy pictures of her. I thought, “What do I want these for?” I met her sister briefly and she was all right. Other son: Kate O'Mara is pictured here with her son Dickon, who killed himself in 2012 . When I found out Kate had died I felt nothing. I couldn’t cry. How can you cry for someone who gave you away, who never thought anything about you and left you to a horrible life? Where is the maternal instinct in that? ‘I don’t feel like her child. It is ironic that she died on Mother’s Day. She was the worst mother ever.’ Linde did not realise the extent of his mother’s rejection until The Mail on Sunday showed him the letter, which made it clear she wanted nothing more to do with him. The letter, which has never been published, denounced  him as a ‘criminal’ following his arrest for attempting to steal a duvet from M&S. It also bemoaned that the revelation about her giving away an illegitimate son could scupper her career in the United States. O’Mara wrote: ‘I was menaced, emotionally blackmailed, threatened and terrorised by Christopher Linde, who as everyone now knows, has a criminal record. ‘Understandably, I now have no contact with him. ‘The disclosure of such an intensely private matter, my own personal grief, a grief I share with no one (not even my family) was, to say  the least, traumatic. ‘My father suffered a minor stroke, followed by several more. He died 18 months later, never having recovered from the shock. My mother suffered a fibrillation of the heart, resulting in a blood clot forming in her left eye. ‘When this healed, scar tissue was left, causing her to go blind in that eye. ‘My entire family were subjected to extreme distress.  As was I. I must reiterate the distress I suffered as a result of the disclosure. I became severely depressed.’ Linde chain-smokes nervously as he denies harassing his mother, saying: ‘I did not blackmail her. ‘And if I menaced her, why did she meet me again? Yes I called her up but that is what any child would do. My life is horrible. I have no family or support. I am all alone. I was abandoned by my mother not once, but twice.’ Linde says that he had got on well with his half-brother Dickon, who had worked as a stage manager and a theatre set designer. He says: ‘He was dating Jenny Agutter and I remember we all played Trivial Pursuit and drank port in her South Kensington flat.’ The reason for the relatively modest size of Kate’s estate, which was just above the inheritance tax threshold, is not known. However, in an interview before falling ill, the actress said that her TV work had dried up in recent years. In her younger days she had appeared in shows including Howards’ Way, Doctor Who and Triangle, a North Sea ferry soap opera. Mother and son were never reconciled, even after Christopher’s half-brother was found hanged in December 2012 in the garage at their mother’s home in Long Marston near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. Dickon killed himself after fighting depression and addiction problems for year. He had suffered brain damage when he was hit by a car in 2010 while walking his dog in fog. Mrs Cochrane, 68, refused  to comment about the will when contacted by The Mail on Sunday, saying only: ‘I don’t want to talk about it at all thank you very much. I’m sorry, but it is all a bit raw.’ But for Linde there is no forgetting: ‘What kind of woman hands over her newborn child to a foster mother and then agrees to have him adopted when she knows nothing about the adoptive parents? ‘I feel nothing for her.’","Kate O'Mara, who spent decades as Hollywood star, died this March at 74 .

'You blew it again, Barack Obama,' the former Republican vice presidential candidate said in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon, 'by negotiating away any leverage against the bad guys as these bad guys . – Osama Bin Laden's partners in evil crime – joyfully celebrate their . ""win"" in the deal you sealed.' Scroll down for video . Fresh off of claims that Barack Obama a 'weak' president who doesn't understand 'the mission of the military,' former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin criticized Obama for trading terrorists for American solider Bowe Bergdahl, who may have deserted the military just before he was captured by Taliban forces five years ago . Palin is among those who believe that Bergdahl was trying to desert the Army when he was captured by Taliban forces five years ago. It's unknown whether Bergdahl actually abandoned the military but its clear he voluntarily left his post in Afghanistan on the day in question. On Saturday the Taliban released Bergdahl, the last known U.S. solider in captivity, to U.S. Special Forces in exchange for five enemy combatants being held at Guantanamo Bay. At least one of the detainees the U.S. agreed to swap for Bergdahl was tied to bin Laden. President Obama formally announced Bergdahl's release at a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House on Saturday evening. He was accompanied on stage by Bergdahl's mother Jani and his father Bob. The U.S. 'made an ironclad commitment to bring our prisoners of war home,' Obama said. 'It’s . who we are as Americans. 'Today, at least in this instance, . it’s a promise we’ve been able to keep.' An undated image of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the remaining known U.S. solider being held in captivity, provided by the U.S. Army . U.S. Army Private Bowe Bergdahl watches as one of his captors displays his identity tag to the camera at an unknown location in Afghanistan, July 19, 2009 . President Barack Obama formally announced the release of Bowe Bergdahl on Saturday in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by Bergdahl's mother Jani Bergdahl, left, and father Bob Bergdahl, right. Obama said Saturday that making sure no man is left behind is 'who we are as Americans.' Responding to National Security Adviser Susan Rice's claim on ABC yesterday that Bergdahl 'served the United States with honor and distinction,' Palin shared on her Facebook today a link to an article in the New York Post that included details of an email Bergdahl sent his parents days before he was captured. 'I am ashamed to be an American. And the title of US soldier is just . the lie of fools,' he said in the email. 'I am sorry for everything. The horror . that is America is disgusting.' Palin latched onto the email as proof that Obama shouldn't have handed over suspected terrorists to the Taliban to get Bergdahl released. 'No, Mr. President, a soldier expressing horrid anti-American beliefs – . even boldly putting them in writing and unabashedly firing off his . messages while in uniform, just three days before he left his unit on . foot – is not ""honorable service."" ' Palin wrote. 'Unless that is your . standard.' Instead of praising Bergdahl, Palin said, Obama should be praising the soldiers who died looking for him. 'Praise . the soldiers who fought with everything they had to defeat Islamic . terrorists, those whom you just freed from prison,' Palin said. 'Our men gave all. Our . surviving combat vets will forever live with the effects of the . missions they willingly engaged in to protect you, our country, and . certainly their brothers and sisters who are proud to wear the uniform.' Palin's scathing Facebook post comes on the heels of comments she made last week on Fox News about the president's handling of the Veterans Affairs scandal. During an interview with Sean Hannity, Palin called Obama 'weak' and accused him of undervaluing the service of the nation's men and women in uniform. 'I think there's a lack of understanding on our . Commander in Chief's part on what the mission of the military is and why we owe . a debt of gratitude that's manifested in benefits paid to those who have . already earned them,' she said.","Sarah Palin lashed out at President Barack Obama on Facebook today for swapping suspected terrorists for the release of Sgt.

"Adam Johnson is sat on the Sunderland team bus as it rolls victorious beneath Newcastle’s famous Milburn Stand and past the black and white faces burning red with fury. With celebratory music dialled to the max, Johnson and his comrades are not exposed to the venom being hissed in their direction. For those on the inside, there is relief, for those on the outside, rage. Adam Johnson finds the net during Sunderland's 3-0 win against Newcastle at St James' Park in February . The winger also scored in the 3-0 win at St James' Park in April 2013 . ‘It’s better when you win away,’ says the player who has scored in both of Sunderland’s back-to-back 3-0 victories at St James’ Park and is bidding for an unprecedented fourth straight win over their rivals on Sunday. ‘Afterwards, you realise you’ve done it, the music is turned up and you’ve won the game. You get on the bus and you can see everybody there is fuming. That’s the best part. It just makes it a better feeling winning in front of their fans.’ For Johnson, the satisfaction of recent derby victories has been amplified by his team’s perilous position near the bottom of the Premier League. This time, their situation is not so dire. There is, however, always the fear of defeat. ‘It is an intensity,’ says the Easington-raised Sunderland fan as he describes what it is like to have played in four Tyne-Wear clashes. Johnson admits the best thing about beating Newcastle away is seeing the Geordie supporters fume . It was Johnson's striker that caused then manager Paolo Di Canio to slide on his knees in clebration . ‘You can feel that little bit more expectancy. There’s a pressure going into the game. When you get onto the pitch, if you didn’t know it was a derby, you can tell straight away. ‘There is a completely different feeling. There is a tension. It is like a cup final. Everything is just that little bit extra and you get that from the fans. They make it that way. ‘They are nervous, they want to do well, but there’s almost a fear attached to it as well. That’s exactly what it is, fear; everyone wants to win it that badly. That is how I would probably describe it.’ Johnson’s record in the fixture reads won three, drawn one. It was he who provoked Paolo Di Canio’s touchline slide and fist pump in front of the Newcastle fans when he curled home a delightful second in the 3-0 triumph of April, 2013. Ten months on and he was again doubling his side’s advantage, this time with a close-range poke at the Leazes End as Gus Poyet became the first manager in 46 years to record a double over the Magpies. Johnson falls under the challenge of James Tomkins to earn a penalty against West Ham last weekend . Johnson (left) celebrates with Jordi Gomez after the Spaniard scores from the spot against West Ham . ‘Those goals are up there with the best in my career,’ says the 27-year-old former England winger. ‘But I think what made it more special over the last couple of seasons is that we really needed the points. We needed the wins regardless of whether it was the derby. ‘We can maybe go into it a bit more relaxed this time. I don’t think there’s so much pressure on us. The onus is all on them.’ Johnson watched on Wednesday night as Newcastle were soundly beaten 4-0 at Spurs in the League Cup semi-final. That result – coupled with their 4-1 defeat at Arsenal four days earlier – has raised the stakes for United boss Alan Pardew heading in to the derby. Winger Johnson (centre) tries to find a way past the West Ham defence during Saturday's 1-1 draw . It was only two months ago that he was fighting to save his job, a fact not lost on Johnson. ‘There is pressure on them and there has been pressure on the manager before their recent run,’ he says, referencing the six wins in nine which have lifted Newcastle from bottom up to eighth. ‘We want to make sure the pressure is on them. We’re aware they’ve had a bad result but they are still a lot more points better off than us in the league. ‘Having said that, we’ll take anything we can that makes them tense and use it to our advantage.’ Some of Johnson's team-mates, however, are thought to be a little miffed at the latest comments of head coach Poyet. Johnson is hoping to pile the pressure back on to Newcastle boss Alan Pardew with a win on Sunday . The Uruguayan has bemoaned a lack of quality in his side and made a deliberate point of highlighting the shortcomings of his widemen. Sunderland have drawn 10 times this season – five of them goalless stalemates – and Poyet says he is bored of watching his team play. Johnson is too cute to be drawn on such issues, but does say: ‘Maybe we can create some better chances and then our finishing will be a bit better, but overall we haven’t been that bad. ‘The hardest part of football is scoring goals and winning games. Sometimes you need to score two or three to win in the Premier League.’ Score three is exactly what they’ve done on their last two trips to Tyneside. Repeat the feat on Sunday and even Poyet might me smiling.","Sunderland travel to St James' Park to play Newcastle on Sunday .

"Two frightening incidents of vandalism in El Paso near the Mexican border in Texas have been interpreted as warnings from drug cartels. In both instances, a mannequin wearing a suit and tie was tied to a billboard with a noose and messages were scrawled over the placards. Local station KHOU reports that one of the signs reads 'Plata o Plombo' which translates to 'silver or lead', a threat used commonly against police officers effectively warning that if they do not accept the cartel's bribes then they will be shot. Threat: The translation of the painted vandalism means 'silver or lead' which is meant to mean that police officers and business owners should either accept bribes or expect gunshots . Scary: A mannequin wearing a suit and tie was seen hanging from a noose from the El Paso billboard . 'This symbol has historically been used by Mexican drug cartels to threaten or intimidate Mexican citizens, business owners and government officials; however, we have never experienced this in El Paso,' local police said in a press release about the vandalism. The fear now for many is that the 'warnings' shows that the drug cartels- which have not been identified by name- are willing to bring the violence from Mexican border towns into Texas. 'Maybe the problems in Juarez are coming over here,' El Paso resident Javier Padilla told KHOU. Mr Padilla and his wife Maria Ramos know the terror of drug cartels on a personal level after two relatives were murdered in the area of Juarez in 2009. Second incident: The second message was written over an existing Drug Enforcement Agency billboard calling for the capture of drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero . The second instance of vandalism had a more obtuse warning, but the theme ran through since the message was written on an existing Drug Enforcement Agency billboard. The message was different this time, as the paint read: 'Dying for drugs' was written over a wanted poster calling for the capture of drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero. This second mannequin was dressed in jeans rather than the suit and tie from the other instance. The mannequins were a particularly jarring image for many familiar with the drug war, as some of the most violent drug lords south of the border regularly hang offenders off highway overpasses. While a warning from drug lords seems like one of the most likely prospects, KHOU reports that prosecutors have another theory that the vandalism also could have been caused by activist groups working against the war on drugs.","Two billboards along highways in El Paso, Texas were vandalized and had mannequins hanging off of them .

"He's the walking talking encyclopaedia of chocolate, well REAL chocolate that is, dubbed the real life 'Willy Wonka' who has claimed to revoluntionise the way we think about, experience and indulge in chocolate. Quirky UK artisan chocolatier, Willie Harcourt Cooze has devoted much of his life, to crafting the world's most perfect blend and says what we now know as the delicious treat is in fact, not real chocolate. 'What's happened at the turn of the century, big companies have gobbled up producing chocolate and adding cheap ingredients like processed sugar, which is highly addictive, to put in the flavour what we think chocolate is about,' he said. Scroll down for video . Quirky UK artisan chocolatier, Willie Harcourt Cooze, started his chocolate journey after buying a cacao farm in Venezuela . Willie, dubbed UK's 'Willy Wonka' and a cross between Bear Grylls and chef Heston Bumenthal, still uses antique machines in making his chocolate because they capture subtle notes and unique flavours . 'A good cacao with properly fermented beans will open people's eyes when they eat it.' 'People are surprised (at the difference) you see the awakening in their face, like it was for me.' Willie, who has been dubbed a mix between adventurer Bear Grylls and famous chef Heston Blumenthal, started his chocolate quest nearly two decades. He bought a 1,000 acre cacao farm in the rainforests of Venezuela, then created a custom-built factory to make chocolate in his own way with antique machines which are smaller and slower than their modern counterparts, but capture subtle notes and unique flavours. 'Chocolate was a fruit of the gods, it was used and drunk in many ceremonial occasions in South America, it was special back then.' 'Forgotten is the goodness of chocolate.' To bring that back, the chocolate enthusiast says he goes to extreme lengths to get his beans which are the most important in making the best quality. 'I've just recently been to Columbia and Peru to extend my search for new people,' he said excitedly. 'In eight days I met hundreds of farmers and I came back with a suitcase full of beans, that's what you need to do to get the best of the best to make chocolate.' Willie, the chocolate enthusiast has been referred to as the UK's 'Willy Wonka' Willie (pictured left and right) prides himself on buying and producing all his chocolate, or 'bean to bar' as he calls it, buying direct trade and at higher prices to local farmers to ensure quality is better . Willie prides himself on buying and producing all his chocolate, or 'bean to bar' as he calls it, buying direct trade and at higher prices to local farmers to ensure quality is better. 'I tweek the fermentation if I need to, it allows me to manufacture the chocolate myself and develop the flavours.' Willie (pictured) loves to experiment with his chocolate and cacao in cooking including making bread with cacao and adding it to mashed potato or on top of Tuna . 'I make in small batches, around seven to 11 days it takes and that enables me to deliver the end product to the consumer at a reasonable price.' 'Simple chocolate to bring out the flavour of the beans. If you don't have good quality you need to add all these things, like sugar and additives.' One myth he seemed to have debunked is about dark chocolate. He says while most of us associate the dark variety with being bitter, he says that's not the case. 'Dark chocolate isn't bitter, the reason is because the manufacturers are not using good quality beans and it's been heavily roasted.' The chocolate nut likens real chocolate to a fine wine because each bean has a very different profile and tastes differently. 'For example in Madagascar, they have got a very well know fruity profile which is quite unique and in the last century has developed into it's own flavour through the soil and the climate,' he said. In Venezuela where he first started his chocolate obsession, he describes the flavours as very interesting while in Rio he says the taste is predominantly coffee and has nutty notes. With most of Willie's chocolate range has only three ingredients - cacao, natural cacao butter and raw cane sugar, there's no doubt his brown gold will delight fussy foodies and the health conscious. He believes the health benefits are backed up by research that real chocolate is good for you, full of essential vitamins and minerals for the body. 'There's a really interesting study in the UK that chose my chocolate and found it was high in antioxidants which is good for cardiovascular,' he said. 'It supports my argument over processing that if you over process it, you kill it.' 'I think I tick a lot of the boxes, I like to keep things simple so you get instant gratification when you put it in your mouth.' Admitting to a hot chocolate, or Cacao every day, he says there's many different ways you can use cacao in cooking. His 'Willie's Cacao's' range that has come to Australia and is available on our shelves at Coles . Likened to 'Willy Wonka' (pictured) Willie is in Australia to launch his luxurious chocolates here . 'It is an interesting condiment, in cooking its remarkable in savoury or sweet,' he said. The chocolate phenomenon is now in Australia to launch his 'Willie's Cacao' range . Willie has tried a variety of different dishes including cacao in bread which he dissolves into the dough. 'It comes out a rick dark colour and when toasted brings out a nutty flavour. I add avocado and duck eggs on my toast as well as a mix of cacao and chilli.' 'You can also make gravy and it compliments the flavour or throw in when you are cooking rice, it's a  very soft flavour,' he said. He's also tried it in mashed potato, grated it on Tuna and made a vegetarian Porcini mushroom risotto. 'It can lift something with a depth of flavour.' The UK chocolate phenomenon is now in Australia for two weeks to officially launch his luxurious chocolate. 'Willie's Cacao' which is stocked in the UK and shipped to chocolate lovers all over the world, is now available on shelves here, with supermarket giant Coles stocking his products. 'It's a hugely great opportunity for me, it's all about making chocolate and tasting it, I'm on a mission and the mission is so big there's never a point you reach it.' A small bar of the Peruvian flavoured delight will set you back about $4 for 50 grams while if you want indulgence, you could try the lime and chilli for around $13. 'No chocolate like this in supermarkets, and once you've tasted it the others will be spoilt because you're eating something so good,' he said. And when asked which flavour was his favourite he was tasked with a big decision, but said it was hard to choose referring to all his creations as his children.

"An Egyptian court has sentenced nine people to five years in prison for stealing an ancient scroll and rock samples from the world famous Great Pyramid. Three Germans claimed to be researchers to steal rock samples and fragments of a scroll bearing the name Pharaoh Khufu, according to sources at a court in Giza, south of the capital Cairo. Six Egyptians, including three employees of the antiquities ministry, two pyramid guards and the director of a travel agency, were also jailed for five years for aiding the robbery. Protection from graverobbers: Security guards ride camels next to the Great Pyramid of Giza earlier this week . The three Germans were sentenced in absentia, having left Egypt after the events at the centre of the case. Germany has no extradition treaty with Egypt and it is unclear whether the three men will ever serve their sentence. The crime was discovered at the end of 2013 by Egyptian authorities, who announced in August that the missing fragments had been recovered. The judicial source said that the German 'researchers' had taken the scroll fragments in order to determine their age and bolster an unorthodox theory that the pyramids may be several millenia older than the construction period accepted by most Egyptologists. The source said the court also ordered and enquiry to determine the role in the theft of Egypt's former head of antiquities, Zawi Hawass. 'These remarks are totally unfounded,' Hawass told AFP. World famous: The Great Pyramid (centre) - also known as the Pyramid of Cheops - is the largest and most famous of the three Giza pyramids. It was built as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu . The Great Pyramid of Giza was the largest pyramid ever built. It is made of over 2.5 million stone blocks weighing around 2.5 tons each. The pyramid was constructed over a 14 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Originally standing 480.6 ft tall, the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. Built for the Pharaoh Khufu as a tomb, inside would have been necessities needed for the afterlife, including his sarcophagus. Originally, the entire casing was finished in a polished limestone The burial chamber is located in the center of the pyramid. It can be reached by a series of passages including a 30ft high gallery. Many passages were filled with traps to stop graverobbers. Khufu left behind three wives, who were interred in three smaller pyramids, and fathered fifteen daughters and nine sons. One of the convicted Germans, 47-year-old Dominique Goerlitz who describes himself as an independent 'experimental archaeologist,' has not denied taking the samples. He previously said that 'it has never been logically clarified how Bronze Age people 4,600 years ago' could have built the pyramid. A schoolteacher by trade, eight years ago Goerlitz tried to prove that a type of reed boat used 6,000 years ago could cross the Atlantic. His vessel, the Abora III, sank after 2,400 miles and 56 days at sea. It is expected that the six Egyptian men convicted in the case will launch an appeal against their sentences. As the three German men were convicted in absentia, they are entitled to a complete retrial if they are ever taken into Egyptian custody. The Great Pyramid - also known as the Pyramid of Cheops - is the largest and most famous of the three Giza pyramids. It houses the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu, and is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still survives.","Three German men and six Egyptians convicted of smuggling antiquities .

"David Davis last night established himself at the head of a growing Tory rebellion over Syria. The former shadow home secretary, who stood against David Cameron for the Tory leadership, said there were ‘huge risks’ in bombing Syria. He added: ‘This will be interpreted around the Middle East in ways we can’t predict. I’m also not at all sure that it will improve the safety of British citizens.’ Testing: U.N. chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks carry samples collected from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in  Damascus yesterday . Mr Davis also warned he had yet to be convinced the lethal chemical attack was a ‘deliberate act of the Assad government’. Fellow Tory Crispin Blunt, a former minister and soldier, said he would vote against the Syrian intervention tonight and in any potential second vote. He said: ‘I haven’t seen any evidence that suggests whether or not the regime was responsible for this and identifying who in the regime (gave the order). ‘The UN weapons inspectors will establish that there was a chemical attack, they’re not going to be able to establish who carried it out.’ John Baron, who has helped organise a Tory rebellion that now numbers dozens, said: ‘I am starting from a position of voting against but let’s see what Cameron comes up.’ Rebels: Former shadow home secretary David Davis says bombing in Syria carries 'huge risks' and leadership aspirant Adam Afriyie is wary of the British people's reaction . Live tweeting: Number 10 tweeted a picture showing Prime Minister David Cameron chairing a National Security Council . Former defence minister Gerald Howarth warned of the risk that the UK and allies ‘get our hand caught in the mangle’ by intervening in the civil war. ‘Where will this military intervention lead on?’ he said. ‘Will that be the end of the story or will there be calls for further action and are we then at risk of having our hand caught in the mangle? ‘I hope that when the Government says no decision has been made, that that is genuinely the case.’ Fellow Tory Sir Roger Gale said he remained to be convinced that ‘any intervention now will be other than too little, too late and ineffective’. He said he was ‘gravely concerned’ about the implications of punitive action against the regime. ‘Any such response must be based first upon legality, must be proportionate and must be effective,’ he added. Across the road: As Government discussed actions, a protest calling for no military attack took place on the other side of the road . Possible attack: A victim is rushed to hospital for suspected napalm or white phosphorous burns after a suspected attack which the opposition claimed Assad's regime was responsible for . Sir Roger said the experience of being persuaded to vote in favour of the Iraq war on false information ‘has left with me deep cynicism about the veracity of “military intelligence” that may or may not have been adjusted to suit a particular political purpose’. Self-styled Tory leadership hopeful Adam Afriyie also came out against a military strike. He said: ‘The British public have absolutely no appetite for being unnecessarily dragged into yet another Middle Eastern conflict. ‘They just don’t want us to get involved. I am with them.’ Former security minister Baroness Neville-Jones said the Government needed to be ‘cautious’ about the evidence it was considering, and publish legal advice on military intervention. She said: ‘The public should be informed of the legal basis on which the Government is acting. Having a good evidence trail is going to be extremely important.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage last night slammed the ‘rush for military action’. He said: ‘Sending cruise missiles into Syria as a punishment for possibly using chemical weapons – how does that make anything better?’ Would bombing Syria be lawful? Britain . and the US insist it would be, but the truth is far from clear. It’s . hard to see how Syria’s reported chemical attacks against its own . citizens present a direct threat to either country. What specific laws or UN conventions might be used as justification? The . UN Charter allows for military action on only two grounds – in . self-defence, or if action is approved by the UN Security Council. Neither applies here. Russia has made clear its intention to veto any . proposed Security Council resolution authorising action – as has China. Can a military strike  be legal without a  UN resolution? Unclear. In 1999, the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia was launched without . one, with Tony Blair and President Clinton seeking to justify it on . humanitarian grounds to protect Kosovan civilians. The intervention was . widely welcomed, but its legality was questionable. A similar . humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in Syria. If . President Assad is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own . people, he will be in breach of the Geneva Gas Protocol, an . international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which Syria is a . signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons. But breaching the . protocol doesn’t provide a clear justification for military action and . it normally applies to international conflicts, rather than civil wars. Does the UN have a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ the Syrians? In . 2005, following the hideous atrocities committed in Rwanda and Bosnia . in the 1990s, the UN brought forward an initiative called the . ‘Responsibility to Protect’. It was designed to protect the innocent . from genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on . individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders, and an . obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere. But former UN . assistant Secretary-General, Francesc Vendrell, says the doctrine does . not necessarily justify the use of force. All diplomatic efforts must . have been tried first, and even then military intervention requires the . backing of the Security Council – taking David Cameron and President . Obama back to square one. Does the PM need Parliamentary backing  for a bombing campaign? Technically, . no. He retains the power, under Royal Prerogative, to use military . force without Parliamentary approval. However, all recent major military . interventions – including the wars in Iraq and Libya  – have been . preceded by a Commons vote. The Government has made clear it will . ‘respect the outcome’ of tonight’s.","Several Tory MPs hesitant over military action against Assad .

"It's a well-worn tale. After too many scary stories about things that go bump in the night, imaginative children pester their parents about the monster under their bed and spiders in the basement. Classic childhood fears are the subject for American photographer Joshua Hoffine, 40, who has created a collection exploring the nature of a scary story. From the silhouette of a girl in pigtails being watched by a creature hiding underneath the stairs to a terrified child clutching a teddy as giant hands emerge from under her bed, the vivid images give cliched scenes an eerie feeling. Watch out: A creature lurking under the staircase for the innocent child is a classic representation of the kind of cliched horror Hoffine is interested in . Controversial: Hoffine says this picture 'crosses the line for so many people. The wolf is universally read as a sexual predator' Bedtime terrors: The figure of the devil emerging from the bedroom floor blurs the boundary between fairy tale stories and horror . Mr Hoffine was inspired by reading bedtime stories to his four daughters, two of whom appear in the collection. He told the Observer that he featured his daughter is featured in the haunted bed picture, but he ensured she was not scared by the scene. Mr Hoffine said: 'She could only really perform for about a minute. I'd have cookies baking in the background'. He said the most controversial of the pictures is the image of a screaming child in a nappy being cornered by a wolf. Close to home: The 40-year-old photographer's daughter is pictured here. He said she could only perform in the scene for short periods of time . Unusual fear: Hoffine told the Observer that the clown was played by his mother-in-law, but the fact that you can't see her face creates tension in the image . Haunting: Hoffine has received complaints about the sinister nature of some of his photographs . 'This one I get hate mail for- it crosses the line for so many people. The wolf is universally read as a sexual predator,' he told an Observer reporter. He is an avid fan of horror but believes it is much more than mere entertainment. The freelance photographer, who has been published in art magazines, says his love for horror goes beyond the thrill of a scary story: 'I believe that the horror story is ultimately concerned with the imminence and randomness of death, and the implication that there is no certainty to existence. 'Horror tells us that our belief in security is delusional, and that the monsters are all around us,' the 40-year-old says on his website. Stuff of nightmares: A skeleton holding an umbrella on a tightrope? This bizarre scene is enough to give anyone the creeps .

"Neighbors claim the policeman accused of shooting dead an unarmed teenager in St Louis had a serial con woman for a mother, MailOnline can reveal. Darren Wilson’s mother Tonya Durso won the trust of her neighbors then cheated them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by stealing their identities and taking out vast loans and credit card debt. At the time she committed the offenses she was on parole for similar crimes elsewhere the state and afterwards died at the age of 35 under mysterious circumstances. Neighbors today revealed how they were stunned that Wilson became a police officer after his mother behaved so deviously towards them. Scroll down for video . Sandy Finney (L) and Mickelle Gordon (R) - two of Darren Wilson's childhood neighbors in Ferguson, Missouri - were both affected the fraudulent ways of Wilson's mother . Victim: Michael Brown's Aug 9 death has been followed by protests criticizing the Ferguson police department . Wilson was finally named on Friday by police in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, in Missouri that has been torn apart by five nights of protests and rioting over the death of Michael Brown, 18. Wilson accused by witnesses of shooting him even though he had his hands up. Ferguson police only disclosed his name after coming under intense pressure and facing lawsuits by civil liberties groups. Wilson is 28 and currently lives in Crestwood, a suburb of St Louis which is 94 per cent white and 1.6 per cent black. His house is a $180,000 bungalow with a pool and a basketball hoop in the drive on a sleepy street in a neighborhood that one resident described as 'solidly middle class'. But Wilson’s life has not always been so idyllic. He grew up in St Peters, another majority white suburb of St Louis, where his family were popular and well thought of - until his mother’s deception was exposed. She had three children by at least two different men and lived with her husband at the time in a large detached bungalow on the leafy street. Mickelle Gordon, 39, a dental assistant, lived over the road from the family and said that Wilson's mother was ‘charismatic’ and ‘charming’ and first targeted her brother Jason, who lost tens of thousands including some of his pension. Gordon said: ‘He used to work lots and saved all his money. She said that she was an investor and that she could help him. ‘She got his social security number and stole his identity. She used it to take out loans, credit cards and went through his savings. He never got it back’. Ongoing: Protestors continue to take to the streets of Ferguson in a united front against police over the death of Michael Brown . Protesters take to the steets during the Michael Brown demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, this week . All board: Children join their parents in protesting the death of Michael Brown . After that she fooled Gordon’s mother Sandy Finney, 67, an office manager, and stole her ID too. Finney said: ‘My husband and I were naive. She cleaned us out for at least $100,000 and $30,000 in cash which we didn’t get back.’ She explained that his mother used to intercept her mail and sent of for pre-approved credit cards that she would use herself. She got into do much debt that she had to take out one loan after another just to keep the scam afloat. Finney claimed that Wilson's mother made a copy of the key they had left by the front door to let herself in when she wanted, using the cover story that she was letting the cat back in the house. But really she was forwarding her calls from creditors to her own number so Finney had no idea how much debt she was in. The charade came tumbling down in February 2001 when Finney was told by her own bank that she could not deposit any money and the authorities were alerted. According to public records Wilson's mother pleaded guilty to six counts of forgery and one count of stealing at the 11th Judicial Court in St Louis. In 1998 she had already admitted another six counts of stealing in an unrelated matter. His mother's victims say however that she did not serve any time in jail and went into bankruptcy in October 2002 . The following month she died. Finney said: ‘They were not able to tell us if it was a suicide. As a victim you are not told anything’. Only afterwards did she discover that his mother was on probation in Washington, Missouri, for doing something similar to somebody else. Finney added: ‘I’m surprised Wilson passed the background checks to become a policeman. People can change but that was a bad home. His mother was a serial conwoman’. Wilson's mother died when he would have been 16. Killed: Police say the officer that shot Brown did not know he was a robbery suspect, but stopped Brown and a companion 'because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic' What effect that had on him at that age is unclear, but it appears that he bounced around the St Louis area at a number of addresses. At the age of 22 for reasons only Wilson knows, he signed up to join the police and live a life on the other side of the law from that which his mother chose. At Wilson’s current home, neighbors knew nothing of his dark family past and their biggest concern was that rioters would come and wreck the street if they found out where he lived. A female school teacher told MailOnline: ‘Our neighborhood didn't do anything wrong. I'm worried people are going to come up here and start looting. 'They just moved in and seemed like nice people. 'Things are pretty quiet round here'. Nobody answered at the door when MailOnline visited. A husband and wife in their 60s who had lived in the neighborhood for many years said that it was full of respectable people. The man said: 'Crime is not really an issue around here. The biggest thing we have to worry about is the occasional party from teenagers but we don't have any at the moment’ In a surprising twist, it can also be revealed that Wilson won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, according to NBC's Tom Winter. He spent four years with the Ferguson police department and two previous years in the Jennings district, Winter said. Neighbors told USA Today that Wilson was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog. Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, told USA Today: 'He's a young guy. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.' Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, absolutely devastating' to Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an effective officer.'","Police named Darren Wilson as the officer that shot dead Michael Brown, 18, on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri .

"It is a rare glimpse into the childhood of Nazi Germany's second most powerful man. Heinrich Himmler was one of Hitler's closest confidantes and also the architect of the Holocaust, in which he co-ordinated the killing of six million Jews. Yet this extraordinary image reveals a bit of the monster's life as an 11-year-old boy before he went on to commit atrocious war crimes. Historical: Heinrich Himmler's communion certificate which was taken from the Nazi's holiday home and is now for sale . With his mother a devoted Catholic, she not doubt wanted her young son to follow in her footsteps. And this rare printed communion certificate shows that Himmler was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1911. The certificate, which features a reproduction of an old master painting showing Christ at the Last Supper, is due to go to auction on Thursday. It will be sold alongside a number of other fascinating items which belonged to an American woman whose father, Lieutenant Richard J Wills, was tasked with remodelling Himmler's home in the Alps into a senior officers' club after the Second World War. One of the rarest items which will be sold at Mullock's auction house in Shropshire is a postcard from Hitler wishing Himmler's mother a happy 75th birthday. Dated 25.IV.27, the letter is regarded as being 'excessively rare'. Glimpse into the past: These photographic portraits of Himmler in his SS uniform are being sold on Thursday . Other lots in the auction show photographic and oil portraits of Himmler in his SS uniform. Himmler was born in 1900 in Munich to a middle-class family. He began training as an officer during the First World War but the conflict had ended before he could be sent to the front. He went on to study agriculture and for a short while was a chicken farmer. Extremely rare: A postcard from Hitler wishing Himmler's mother a happy 75th birthday . He joined Hitler's fledgling Nazi party and soon became a trusted aide and even towards the end of the war the German leader referred to him as 'der treue Heinrich' (the loyal Heinrich). However, In 1945 a disillusioned Himmler believed victory had slipped from Germany's grasp. He secretly attempted to start peace negotiations with Eisenhower, who was then Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, in a bid to escape a war crimes trial. But Eisenhower refused to have anything to do with Himmler. A furious Hitler declared Himmler a traitor, stripped him of his powers and the SS chief went on the run. Life-like: Oil portraits of former SS chief Himmler which belonged to Lieutenant Richard J Wills . When Himmler was arrested by the British at Bremervoerde on May 22, 1945, he had disguised himself by shaving off his moustache, wearing an eye patch over his left eye and he was carrying false identity papers. However before he could be interrogated, he committed suicide the following day by swallowing a cyanide capsule. The auction will take place at Mullock's Specialist Auctioneers & Valuers in Church Stretton, Shropshire, on Thursday.

"Sainsbury's today dumped plans for dozens of new superstores after it announced pre-tax losses of £290million in the last six months and warned they may be squeezed for years. Britain's third biggest chain, behind Asda and Tesco, said today it needs to respond to changing shopping habits. Customers have been flocking to discounters like Lidl and Aldi, smaller convenience stores or shopping online. In the face of its worst results for a decade the supermarket giant admitted it needs to improve the quality of 3,000 own-brand products and would invest £150million in cutting its prices. Struggling: Sainsbury's reported pre-tax losses of £290m for the past six months as it said it would launch a price war to win back customers . The cost of writing down the value of existing stores and those sites which will no longer be developed meant the supermarket giant plunged to a loss of £290million in the six months to September 27. New chief executive Mike Coupe, who replaced Justin King over the summer, said Britain's grocery market is going through a 'once-in-a-generation' transformation - and Sainbury's needs to cut prices to compete. He told Sky News: 'We've had one of the most challenging market conditions I've seen in my 30-year career; a culmination of structural change in our industry, customers shopping more frequently. 'A period of deflation, which happens once every 10 years but actually fantastic for customers, so customers are seeing prices coming down'. But despite the change in habits he does not believe it is the end for superstores. The retailer said its underlying profits for the six months to September 27 were 6.3 per cent lower at £375 million in the 28 weeks to September 27 - compared to £433million in the same period last year. But it had to write-off £628million from the value of its existing supermarkets and because of its mothballed developments. The ultra-competitive market means it expects its like-for-like sales to fall over 'the next few years' after reporting a 2.1 per cent drop in the period. And it warned its second half profits were likely to be worse. The company said: 'The grocery sector is undergoing structural change as customers shop more frequently, using online, convenience and discount channels more. 'We expect supermarket like-for-like sales in the sector to be negative for the next few years, but we have robust plans to address this challenge.' A new price comparison survey by the Grocer magazine has found the cheapest basket of food is available at Aldi. The budget chain is significantly cheaper than more established rivals, the publication said. A basket of 33 commonly bought items was £38.19 at Aldi. Asda was the next best at £45.26, which is some £7.07 or 18.5per cent more expensive. The equivalent basket was £49.87 at Tesco, £50.08 at Morrisons, and £52.41 at Sainsbury’s. Morrisons has tried to counter the threat posed by Aldi by being the first supermarket to launch a loyalty card scheme that promises to refund the price difference in the form vouchers. Tesco and Sainsbury’s also offer vouchers where one of their mainstream rivals – other than Aldi and Lidl – are cheaper. Waitrose is one of the few mainstream food companies, along with Marks & Spencer, to be putting on sales. Its basket of 33 items came in at £56.19, which is £18 or 47per cent more expensive than Aldi. The prices for Lidl were not included in the study however, it tries to match the figures charged by Aldi. The Grocer magazine was not able to make an exact like for like comparison, however the products were as close as it could find. It said: ‘Asda is working hard to close the gap. Morrisons has promised to refund the difference via vouchers. But on the evidence of Aldi’s first guest appearance in The Grocer 33, the big four are still trailing in its wake. ‘Virtually all products this week - 30 out of 33 - were cheapest at Aldi - 25 exclusively so. The biggest savings were on meat products, with £1.99 gammon steaks and £1.07 sausage rolls, respectively 81p and 53p cheaper than elsewhere.’ The Grocer added: ‘It is the margin of difference to Aldi that is furrowing brows … When it comes to basics, it’s elementary: Aldi is way cheaper.’","Britain's third biggest supermarket made pre-tax losses of £290million .

"Britain risks sleep-walking into a full-scale war by launching missile strikes against Syria, former top brass warned last night. Retired commanders cautioned that an ill-thought-out attack against President Assad’s brutal regime could provoke revenge attacks at home and abroad. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, General Lord Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, and Major General , a commander during the first Gulf War, all warned of the ‘unintended consequences’ of a military campaign. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, General Lord Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, were among those warning of the unintended consequences of a military campaign . It also emerged that Israel was taking precautions against a possible Syrian attack, including bolstering missile defences and handing out gas masks to civilians. A coalition spearheaded by the US, Britain and France is preparing to punish Assad for allegedly gassing to death hundreds of innocent people last week. Defence chiefs favour a strike against important military installations, including airbases, arms dumps and communications hubs, using long-range cruise missiles fired from warships or submarines amassing in the Mediterranean. The hope is that the attacks will deter Assad from using chemical weapons and make it more difficult for him to launch them in future. But military grandees fear David Cameron and his allies might unwittingly escalate Syria’s civil war into a regional conflict in the Middle East, or even a proxy Cold War with Damascus’s key ally, Russia. Assad might also be goaded into retaliating against UK bases in Cyprus. And a missile strike might encourage extremists to bring bloodshed to the streets of Britain. Lord West, a former head of the Navy, said ministers should try to get Russia and China to agree to condemn Assad’s chemical attacks in a UN Security Council Resolution. A coalition spearheaded by the US, Britain and France is preparing to punish Assad for allegedly gassing to death hundreds of innocent people last week . The hope is that the attacks will deter Assad from using chemical weapons and make it more difficult for him to launch them in future . He said: ‘We are moving inextricably towards military action. A strike might be a rap across the knuckles for Assad but will that be enough to make him stop? I have have very severe doubts. ‘If he is deranged enough to have used chemical weapons on his own people, which is a loathsome thing, what is he likely to do if we strike against key targets in Syria? ‘He might do something as mad as fire ballistic missiles against the air base in Cyprus. That then becomes an attack on a Nato ally, an attack on British sovereign territory, and that means war, doesn’t it?’ He added: ‘Politicians think they can control these things, but once you embark on military operations you cannot predict what will happen. 'We need to be very clear on our game plan – what, at the end, is going to make our nation and the globe more secure, and ideally help the Syrian people.’ Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.' 'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria . Of any military strike’s consequences, Lord West said: ‘Iran has said if anything happened it would unleash terrorist attacks, so you might have some reprisals here.’ Lord Dannatt questioned the legality and purpose of the proposed military strike, describing the plans as inappropriate. He said Assad’s probable use of chemical weapons, however wrong, did ‘not constitute an open invitation for the international community to impose themselves on the internal affairs of another country.’ The general, who headed the British intervention in Kosovo in 1999, said an intervention could result in ‘fuelling the conflict and making it worse’. Would bombing Syria be lawful? Britain . and the US insist it would be, but the truth is far from clear. It’s . hard to see how Syria’s reported chemical attacks against its own . citizens present a direct threat to either country. What specific laws or UN conventions might be used as justification? The . UN Charter allows for military action on only two grounds – in . self-defence, or if action is approved by the UN Security Council. Neither applies here. Russia has made clear its intention to veto any proposed Security Council resolution authorising action – as has China. Can a military strike be legal without a UN resolution? Unclear. In 1999, the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia was launched without . one, with Tony Blair and President Clinton seeking to justify it on . humanitarian grounds to protect Kosovan civilians. The . intervention was widely welcomed, but its legality was questionable. A . similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in . Syria. If President . Assad is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people, . he will be in breach of the Geneva Gas Protocol, an international . agreement dating back to 1925 – to which Syria is a signatory – banning . the use of chemical weapons. But . breaching the protocol doesn’t provide a clear justification for . military action and it normally applies to international conflicts, . rather than civil wars. Does the UN have a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ the Syrians? In . 2005, following the hideous atrocities committed in Rwanda and Bosnia . in the 1990s, the UN brought forward an initiative called the . ‘Responsibility to Protect’. It . was designed to protect the innocent from genocide, war crimes and . ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such . horrors within their borders, and an obligation to intervene if they see . it elsewhere. But former UN assistant Secretary-General, Francesc Vendrell, says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force. All . diplomatic efforts must have been tried first, and even then military . intervention requires the backing of the Security Council – taking David . Cameron and President Obama back to square one. Does the PM need Parliamentary backing for a bombing campaign? Technically, no. He retains the power, under Royal Prerogative, to use military force without Parliamentary approval. However, . all recent major military interventions – including the wars in Iraq . and Libya  – have been preceded by a Commons vote. The Government has . made clear it will ‘respect the outcome’ of tonight’s. General Cordingley, who led the Desert Rats during the liberation of Kuwait, said: ‘There is a danger Assad will retaliate against us. More widely, yet again people in the Arab world will say the West is dropping more bombs on the Middle East. 'It might not heighten the threat of terrorism at home, but it certainly will do nothing to reduce it.’ Syrian prime minister Wael al-Halqi responded to the threat of military intervention by warning his war-torn country would become a ‘graveyard of the invaders’. And a Syrian army officer has claimed Assad could use kamikaze pilots to combat Western forces. The unnamed officer told the Guardian that, in the event of an attack by the US and Britain, the Syrian army had 8,000 ‘suicide martyrs’ who would give their lives to bring down warplanes. ‘I myself am ready to blow myself up against US aircraft carriers to stop them attacking Syria and its people,’ he said.","They cautioned could provoke revenge attacks home and abroad .

"A huge chunk of the largest holiday camp ever constructed by the Nazis has been sold for £2.2million. Block One of the Colossus of Prora - built by Hitler in the 1930s along the lines of Butlins in the UK - will be converted into a 400-bed luxury hotel and 400 apartments. The building, the single-biggest sold in post-war Germany, had a reserve price of £700,000, but telephone bidding at a Berlin auction on Saturday sent the price soaring. Vast: A section of the Colossus of Prora, which spans nearly three miles along the coast of the Baltic island of Ruegen, has sold for £2.2million at an auction in Berlin . Derelict: The camp was intended to provide entertainment for 20,000 Nazi holidaymakers at any one time, but no-one ever stayed there and it fell into serious disrepair . Prora was constructed on the Baltic island of Ruegen by the stormtroopers of the Nazi 'Strength Through Joy' leisure organisation over a six-year period and occupies nearly three miles of beachfront. It was meant to provide holiday entertainment for 20,000 of Hitler's hordes at any one time. But not a single Nazi ever got to stay there. The last rooms of the 'Butlins-of-the-dark-side' were finished just as World War Two began in 1939 and Prora was left empty, the greatest white elephant of all time. It was occupied after 1945 by the Red Army and became a top-secret Soviet base. White elephant: The Colossus of Prora was built in the same vein as Butlins (above) in the UK, but it didn't even get off the ground as the outbreak of World War Two and subsequent defeat of Hitler left it empty . After German reunification, all the buildings were given listed status and a very few have been transformed into holiday flats. Monitored enjoyment: Hitler viewed leisure as yet another aspect of human activity to be governed by the Nazis . After the auction on Saturday, it is . hoped that investment in the remaining miles of accommodation will rise . until all are given a makeover. Initial fears that neo-Nazis would buy into the blocks have proved unfounded. So far, there are a few luxury flats and a youth hostel in the buildings at the site 120 miles from Berlin. Block One is nearly 1,200ft long and auctioneer Mark Karhausen juggled bids from least ten developers. Nearly £5million has to date been raised for the government in sales of parts of the Prora complex. After the war, the Soviets considered blowing it up, but discovered they didn't have enough dynamite for the job. Instead they turned it into a massive tank-and-artillery base for the Peoples' Army of East Germany and it vanished from all maps. A museum at the site chronicles the history of Prora which, aside from the building of the Atlantic Wall of coastal fortifications stretching from Norway to the border of Spain - intended to thwart any Allied landings in occupied Europe - was Hitler's biggest building project. The Nazis viewed leisure as just one more aspect of human activity to be governed by the party. Prora was destined to be the forerunner of a string of such giant camps whose plans were mothballed due to the war he unleashed on the world.","Huge section of Colossus of Prora sells for £2.2million at Berlin auction .

"A father is suing his son's high school track coach because the teenager didn't make the team. Ervin Mears Jr. filed a lawsuit asking for $40million on behalf of his 16-year-old son Mawusimensah, as well as the varsity letters and championship jackets for the past two seasons. 'Children have rights, just like any adult,' Mr Mears told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Standing their ground: Ervin Mears Jr. (left) filed a $40million lawsuit because his son Mawusimensah was kicked off of his high school's track team even though he was one of the quickest runners . Mawusimensah was kicked off the Sterling Regional High School team in Somerdale, New Jersey, and the school says it was because of unexcused absences. Mr Mears contradicts that, saying that his son had a leg injury and a death in the family that caused him to miss certain practices. Instead, he said that the falling out with the coach after he would not put him in the events he was best suited for. The school did not comment on the matter because of the ongoing legal action. Mr Mears did not name the coach as the only plaintiff in the lawsuit, as he also included the school athletic director, the principal, as well as the school superintendent and the members of the school board. He would not specify how exactly the came to the asking amount of $40million for the lawsuit, though it is clear that they are concerned with Mawusimensah's career. Mr Mears said that his son was the 'undefeated champ' in the middle school 200-, 400-, and 800- runs at his Catholic school in eighth grade. Then when he went on to Sterling Regional High School, the coach reportedly did not allow him to run those races, but not because he was slow, rather showing partiality towards older students. No comment: The coach and all employees of the school would not release a statement because of the ongoing legal drama . Defense: The school says that the son had unexcused absences from practice, but his father said it was because of an injury and a death in the family . 'If he doesn't qualify, then the clock will say he's not fast enough,' Mr Mears told The Inquirer. Mr Mears, who is a disabled veteran who was also a runner in his youth, believes that his son's lack of exposure will hurt him when it comes time to seeking a college athletic scholarship. Aside from that, the suit is based around the charge that Mawusimensah was bullied and harassed as a result of his failure to make the team. 'I felt in a way, disrespected,' Mawusimensah told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 'At practice, I work hard and I try to be the best athlete I can be, but at meet time, I didn't get the respect that I thought I deserved.' Even without Mawusimensah, the team did fine on their own having won the track Sectionals this season with the help of some athletes still on the team.","Son, 16, was kicked off the high school track team and his father says that his coach was 'bullying' him by keeping him out of his best events .

"Jane Austen is quoted 1,640 times in the most recent edition of the Oxford English Dictionary . Shut up, dirt cheap and dog-tired would roll off the tongue of any Tom, Dick or Harry today. But you wouldn’t have expected them to flow from the pen of genteel Jane Austen. Now the increasing influence of Austen on contemporary English has been highlighted. Oxford professor Charlotte Brewer told the Hay Festival in Hay-on-Wye that while Austen had a great influence on the first Oxford English Dictionary published in 1928, she is quoted 1,640 times in the most recent edition. Entries include 321 phrases from her 1815 novel Emma, which includes ‘dinner-party’ and  ‘brace yourself’. She also came up with ‘if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you 100 times’. This comes as it is revealed that a new TV version of her famous novel Pride and Prejudice is set to be aired next Christmas. Welsh actor Matthew Rhys will take on the role of Mr Darcy in new BBC adaptation Death Comes to Pemberley, a novel by crime writer PD James, which tells the story of Jane Austen’s Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett six years after they married. Rhys, who has previously starred in Brothers and Sisters and The Mystery of Edwin Drood, has already admitted he faces a huge challenge to follow Firth’s 1995 portrayal of Mr Darcy. Mr Darcy: Matthew Rhys, left, will be taking the role of Jane Austen's heartthrob memorably played by Colin Firth n 1995, right . The 38-year-old said: ‘Exciting as it is, one of the challenges of a part such as Darcy are the comparisons that will be drawn to those who have institutionalised him in the past. ‘The beauty of Pemberley is that it is an entirely new and different Darcy six years on. 'And also, I don’t have to appear from a lake in a white shirt and breeches.’ Anna Maxwell Martin, who starred in The Bletchley Circle, will play Lizzie. Smouldering: Colin Firth in the famous wet shirt scene from the 1995 version . Popular role: Matthew MacFadyen also played Mr Darcy opposite Keira Knightley in the film from 2005 . The novel has been adapted into three one-hour programmes. Rhys will also follow in the footsteps of Spooks actor Matthew Macfadyen, who played Mr Darcy to Keira Knightley’s Lizzie in the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice. Filming for Death Comes to Pemberley will begin in Yorkshire in June.","Oxford professor revealed how much Austen has influenced our language .

"Photography enthusiast Matt Ames was pleased to find some rolls of old film among the usual collection of discarded bric-a-brac lining the shelves of a backstreet thrift shore in Virginia. But what Mr Ames didn't realise was that he'd accidentally stumbled upon a piece of Europe's wartime history - as captured by a young American couple who appeared to be on their honeymoon in Italy. For among the 400 or so negatives on the 35mm nitrate films, he was shocked to uncover previously unseen photos of Adolf Hitler touring Italy at the height of his powers. The pictures were taken by a mystery photographer, who Mr Ames believes may either have ended up living in the city of Roanoke, where the films were purchased, or New York, which is featured in many of the photos. Among the scores of holiday snaps and family photos, the pictures - taken in the years before the Second World War - reveal the unknown photographer's brush with the 20th century's most infamous leaders. In one of the forgotten photos, Hitler is pictured sitting next to King Emmanuel III of Italy during a parade in Naples in 1938 after the Fuhrer had viewed fellow fascist leader Benito Mussolini's naval fleet in the Mediterranean. Mr Ames, who has held an exhibition of the photos in Martinsville, Virginia, said: 'In 2013 I found several rolls of negatives in a thrift store in Roanoke, Virginia. They were standard 35mm, black and white and some of the rolls were clearly nitrate film. 'Much to my surprise the film included photographs of Hitler and King Emmanuel on parade, other Nazi images from Naples, Italy in the Spring of 1938, numerous photos of Naples city life, Pompeii and photos of Manhattan.' Pictures of Adolf Hitler - sitting on the left beside King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy - were uncovered on films found in a thrift store in Roanoke, Virginia by photography enthusiast Matt Ames . Mystery couple: The roll of vacatation snaps also includes a picture of the photographer and a woman thought to be his wife. The man is thought to have worked for Mobil Oil . Hitler visited Italy in 1938 to meet with fellow Axis leader Benito Mussolini. The photos uncovered in Virginia are believed to show him after he viewed Italy's naval fleet . Hitler (circled) is pictured receiving fascist salutes from Italian troops, who lined the seafront road in Naples for his visit . The images show Hitler's cavalcade surrounded by motorcycle outriders as he is paraded along the streets of the southern Italian city . The pictures also appear to show young members of Mussolini's Gioventu Italiana del Littorio or GIL youth movement, which was similar to the Hitler Youth in Germany . Hitler took a tour of Italy in 1938, and joined Mussolini and the king on board the battleship Conte di Cavour in Naples to watch military exercises . The photographer managed to capture a picture of the Italian fleet, which was amassed of the coast for the Fuhrer's visit . The pictures also offer an insight into the fascist architecture being built in Italy at the time, with swastikas adorning a number of public monuments (above and below) Hitler's visit to Naples was one of many meetings between the two leaders, pictured here ahead of the 1938 Munich conference. File Photo . The rolls of film were later bought by Matt Ames (pictured left with the films), who used newspaper cuttings to work out when they were taken . Mussolini's fascist regime, which took control of Italy in 1925, was in many ways seen as a forerunner to Hitler's own Nazi party. Hitler is known to have admired the way Mussolini swept to power and wrote to him in 1923, the year after the Italian's famous 'March on Rome' protests. After Mussolini took control of Italy, he provided financial assistance to Hitler's National Socialist movement and allowed the SS to train with his 'Blackshirts' brigades. After taking power in Germany, Hitler backed Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) in 1935 and the two countries' forces lined up together with the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. But despite the diplomatic consensus, the pair's first meeting in 1934 (pictured right) went badly, with Mussolini struggling to understand Hitler's Austrian accent. Hitler is believed to have felt upstaged by Mussolini's elaborate uniform and the Italian is said to have found Hitler boring and described him as 'a mad little clown'. Despite the personal differences, the two leaders signed the so-called 'Pact of Steel' in 1939, agreeing military and economic cooperation. Italy didn't officially enter the Second World War until 1940 and after a disasterous campaign in North Africa, the Allies invaded Sicily in 1943, with Mussolini later expelled from power and executed. Berlin fell in 1945, with Hitler committing suicide in his military bunker. The pictures also include some street scenes of 1930s Naples, including this one, showing a children's goat-drawn cart in a city square . The snaps show the photographers' interest in Italy's famous sportcars, including a photo of this vehicle, pictured on a seaside promenade . The rolls of film also contain more usual holiday snaps from the photographer's visit, including shots of the Naples skyline at the time . Mr Ames also found a series a photos of New York on the films, apparently taken from a boat rolling into the city's famous harbour . The pictures, which show a crowded boat about the dock in the US, suggest the man either visited Italy on a trip or moved to America from Europe ahead of the Second World War . The photos, along with tales from Mr Ames' attempts to work out their origins, were made the subject of a recent exhibition at Patrick Henry Community College in Martinsville, Virginia . Mr Ames traced the location of the pictures by comparing this shot of Naples waterfront with modern-day pictures of the same location . The photographer, seemingly a car enthusiast, also took photos of this Fiat garage and motorists filling their vehicles outside .","Pictures of the infamous leader were found in rolls of an unidentified family's holiday snaps from the 1930s .

"Heavy metal fans have been warned that headbanging can be bad for you after a Motorhead fan suffered a blood clot on his brain after performing the 'violent and rhythmic' movement at a concert. The 50-year-old German fan developed the potentially fatal condition after getting carried away at one of the hardcore British rock band's concerts. It is the fourth documented case of subdural haematoma linked to headbanging - one of which proved fatal. Headbanger: A 50-year-old German fan suffered a blood clot on his brain after headbanging while watching Motorhead, fronted by Lemmy, play . Specialists treated the fan at the Hannover Medical School two weeks after he started suffering a constant, worsening headache that affected his entire head. A CT scan confirmed that the man had a suffered a subdural haematoma, a clot caused by blood leaking into the space between the skull and the brain, on his right side. Surgeons successfully removed the clot via a hole drilled into the skull, and fortunately he was able to make a full recovery. Subdural haematomas are most often caused by blows to the head, but the patient could not recall suffering such an injury. However, a month before attending hospital he had been to a Motorhead concert where he joined other fans headbanging to the fast and furious music performed by frontman Ian Fraser Kilmister, aka Lemmy, and his bandmates. Medical attention: Specialists treated the fan at the Hannover Medical School two weeks after he started suffering a constant, worsening headache that affected his entire head . 'Our patient had no history of head trauma so we assume that headbanging, with its brisk forward and backward acceleration and deceleration forces, led to rupturing of bridging veins causing haemorrhage into the subdural space,' said doctors writing in The Lancet medical journal. A review of the medical literature revealed three previous cases where headbanging led to blood clots. One, an acute haematoma, resulted in sudden death. Other conditions attributed to headbanging have included a torn carotid artery, whiplash injury, fractured neck, and air in the chest cavity. The doctors defined headbanging as 'a contemporary dance form consisting of abrupt flexion-extension movements of the head to the rhythm of rock music, most commonly seen in the heavy metal genre'. Motorhead were one of the pioneers of 'speed metal', marked by fast tempos of more than 200 beats per minute. The surgeons, led by Dr Ariyan Pirayesh Islamian, ended their report by paying the band a veiled compliment. 'This case serves as evidence in support of Motorhead's reputation as one of the most hardcore rock'n'roll acts on earth, if nothing else because of their contagious speed drive and the hazardous potential for headbanging fans to suffer brain injury,' they wrote.","German fan, 50, developed condition after one of the band's concerts .

"Not Doctor Woo: Capaldi, 56, insisted his Time Lord would not be following in predecessor Matt Smith's footsteps by getting intimate with sidekick Clara, portrayed by 28-year-old Jenna Coleman . Incoming Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi has revealed there will be no flirting with co-star Jenna Coleman in the new series. The previous Doctor was engaged in a close relationship with his sidekick Clara that even led to a passionate kiss. But Capaldi, 56, insisted his Time Lord would not be following in predecessor Matt Smith's footsteps by getting intimate with 28-year-old Coleman's character. 'There'll be no flirting, that's for sure,' he told The Sunday Times Magazine. 'It's not what this Doctor's concerned with. 'It's quite a fun relationship, but no, I did call and say, ""I want no Papa-Nicole moments"". I think there was a bit of tension with that at first, but I was absolutely adamant.' The Papa-Nicole comment relates to a series of 1990s Renault Clio car adverts which hinted at a romance between an older man and a younger woman, before they were revealed to be father and daughter. Capaldi also had good news for those Doctor Who purists who believe the show's storylines have become over the top in the past few series. 'It's going to be a bit different from what we've seen over recent years. A bit more gravity,' he said. 'Some situations are more sombre and I think there are more rooted dramatic scenes. Over the past two or three years, which I've loved, there has often been a breathless vigour; we still have that attack, but we have another level of drama, another tone. And the scenes are longer.' Capaldi recalled how his agent called him to tell him he had got the part when he was filming in Prague, and he spent the afternoon wandering around the city humming the Doctor Who theme tune. 'I just didn't think it was something that would happen to me,' he admitted. Strictly platonic: Peter Capaldi as The Doctor and Jenna Coleman as Clara . But the Glaswegian actor did not say yes to the part immediately. 'I didn't want to be Doctor Who in a Doctor Who I didn't like,' he said. 'I had to be convinced the show was going in a direction I was interested in. 'I had to think carefully about the level of visibility. My life was blessed, but as soon as this happened I had paparazzi outside my house. People spoke to me before and recognised me, but nothing like this. 'I had to decide if I was ready to live with that, because once that genie is out of the bottle, it doesn't go back in.'

"A Sydney grandmother missing for two months in southern India has been found dead, with three men facing murder charges. Indian police say her body has been exhumed and a guard at the apartment building where she was living has been arrested over her murder along with two of his friends. Inspector B. Venugopal said the men robbed Ms Ludgate of her money and jewellery, killed her and buried her body in a remote place about 15 kilometres from Puttaparti. Scroll down for video . Toni Ludgate (pictured right) with daughter Traci Harding (pictured left) has been found dead in India . Ms Ludgate was on a regular trip to India doing charity work. She is said to have experienced a deep connection with ashram and spiritual master Sai Baba, who died in April 2011 . She was reportedly last seen getting into a taxi with another woman on September 23 in the village of Puttaparthi, 125km north of Bangalore. The 75-year-old Pyrmont local went missing in August after arriving in India in July. She was on a regular trip to India doing charity work in an ashram when her family became concerned after they had lost all communications with her. Ms Ludgate had been working serving breakfast and dinner at the Western Cantina in the Prasanthi Nilayam ashram. Hindu holy man Sai Baba was undergoing treatment at  the Institute of Higher Medical Sciences at Puttaparti before he died . She is said to have experienced a deep connection with ashram and spiritual master Sai Baba, who died in April 2011. Followers flock to visit his ashram. Australian officials said on Saturday evening they were providing consular assistance to the family of Mrs Ludgate. Toni Ludgate (pictured) with two of her grandchildren was robbed of her jewellery and money and killed . Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was assisting Ms Ludgate's family, and is understood to be liaising with Puttaparthi police in charge of the investigation as well as the commissioner of police in Bangalore. DFAT told News Corp Australia earlier this week it was sending consular officials to Bangalore on the basis this was where Ms Ludgate was believed to have been headed. Her daughter, author Traci Harding, told Sydney's Daily Telegraph Indian police had been unable to find the cab driver and one of her mother's two mobile phones had received a couple of short calls, about one second each, since then. The Sai Baba search team (pictured) had been on the ground, following leads to source as much information about Toni Ludgate's disappearance as possible . Her daughter, best selling author Traci Harding, who last spoke to her mother on her birthday on August 28, said she was reportedly last seen getting out of a cab with an older lady on September 23. 'The landlord of the lodge she was staying at, had reported she paid an extra five days rent before leaving in a cab with an older lady in Bangalore. After that we never heard from her,' she said. Ms Ludgate's bank account had also not been touched and her ticket home to Sydney  was found in the apartment. Toni Harding's (pictured centre) family had been looking for her since September 23 when she was last seen . 'I think when she didn’t get back to unit there were alarm bells.' 'That part of India has recently been hit by a tornado, communications have been down, so there's a lot going on.' Friends of Ms Ludgate at the Prasanthi Nilayam (Abode of Supreme Peace) ashram, where she regularly did volunteer work, have been on the case to find her since concerns were raised. Ms Harding says they took up the case, followed up on leads and even got their legal team involved. 'They really have been fantastic,' she said. She said they felt the crime scene, where her mother was last seen, had not been handled properly as the local authorities didn't have the capabilities to do an extensive search. Toni Ludgate (pictured right) with her daughter Traci Harding (pictured left) arrived in India in July and had not been heard from since September . That's when the call for help came out, for higher authorities to get involved. 'DFAT Canberra have come to the party,' said Ms Harding.

"A burglar suffocated when his neck became trapped under a wooden fence panel as he attempted to flee from a house, an inquest has heard. Stephen Pope, 35, died from asphyxiation after he became trapped between the panel and a concrete gravel board at a property in Waltham Abbey in Essex, in March this year. Today, an inquest at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court, ruled that Mr Pope had died accidentally while trying to escape from the garden of the house with stolen items. Stephen Pope, 35, who suffocated when his neck became trapped under a wooden fence panel as he tried to escape from a house . Accomplice Albert Brinkley, 27, of no fixed address, was jailed for 12 months earlier this year after admitting the burglary. Coroner Eleanor McGann told the hearing: 'It did become obvious early on that this death was part of a burglary. 'We know that somebody has confessed to the burglary, has been convicted and has done his time and come out. 'There is evidence Mr Pope was also part of that burglary.' The inquest heard how Mr Pope, also from Waltham Abbey, was found holding a pillow case containing stolen items from the nearby property. A post-mortem revealed that he had been on a cocktail of drugs including cocaine, cannabis and methadone during the break-in. It went onto state Mr Pope had been ‘pinned in a face down and awkward position that could have caused asphyxiation’. An inquest heard that Mr Pope died from asphyxiation after he became trapped between the panel and a concrete gravel board at the property in Waltham Abbey, Essex . Floral tributes were also left at the scene with his family saying at the time that he suffered from 'inner demons' The inquest heard how Mr Pope had told one elderly passer-by, who believed he was a workman, that he was 'okay' when asked if he needed help whilst trapped under the fence panel. He was later discovered unresponsive by another lady who called 999. Two female nurses from a nearby nursing home helped lift the fence panel off Mr Pope before paramedics arrived. But attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and he was declared dead. Mrs McGann added: 'It is perfectly plausible Mr Pope said he was okay as he did not want to be caught with a pillowcase of stolen items.' The coroner ruled the cause of death was compression of the neck in association with postural asphyxia. A secondary factor in the death was noted as mixed drug intoxication. The coroner ruled Mr Pope's death an accident saying the cause of death was compression of the neck . Investigating officer, DS Darren Ward, told the court the death was treated as ‘not suspicious’ following a full investigation. He added: 'The investigation did not reveal a third party was involved in Mr Pope’s death. 'No criminal charges were brought in respect of the death.' Mr Pope had been on bail for theft of fuel when he was found dead outside the property. His parents Barry Pope, 67, a retired bus driver, and Jean Pope, 70, a retired packer, described their son as ‘a lovable rogue’ outside of the inquest whilst slamming the ‘accidental death’ verdict. Mother-of-five, Jean, said: 'We strongly believe that this wasn't an accident. 'Stephen had fractured his back in a car accident the year before. 'How would he be able to lift a fence panel with his injuries? 'We’re not excusing what he did but we just want some closure. 'My son was a lovable rogue who wouldn't hurt a soul. 'I knew he had previous for a bit of shoplifting but I’d never known him to break into a house.' At the time of his death, Mr Pope’s family released a tribute describing him as a ‘troubled and tormented soul’ who was ‘fighting many inner demons’. The statement said: 'He had the ability to make you laugh and lift your heart, but unfortunately also the ability to break it into a thousand pieces. 'He was a troubled and tormented soul, with some mental health issues and was fighting many inner demons for most of his life. 'This is a devastating tragedy for our family, one from which we will never recover. 'A hole has been ripped in our hearts and that void will never be filled.” A 51-year-old who also arrested in connection with the incident was released from bail with no further action.","Stephen Pope became trapped under the fence as he tried to flee a house .

"The club made famous by The Beatles has filed a lawsuit against the multi-million dollar Hard Rock Café over the use of its name. The Cavern Club in Mathew Street, Liverpool is where the Fab Four played 292 gigs in the early Sixties before Beatlemania swept the globe. The American music-themed restaurant secured the rights to the name 20 years ago in the US and Mexico and there is a Hard Rock Cavern Club in Boston and Mexico. George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon on stage at the original Cavern Club . But the owners of the English club - which include John Lennon's sister Julia Baird – are taking the Florida-based Hard Rock Café to court in Orlando over the US rights. The US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board gave Hard Rock Café International rights to the name Cavern Club in the United States in 1994. Hard Rock Café Inc has registered the US rights to use the Cavern Club name for any room at its outlets in United States and Mexico. Memorabilia from rock icons Aerosmith, Nirvana, Bon Jovi, Van Halen and The Grateful Dead adorns the walls of the Boston venue although none of them ever played the Liverpool club. The original Cavern Club in Mathew Street, Liverpool, and a tribute to The Beatles, opposite the site of the Cavern Club. The Beatles played the venue 292 times before they became world famous . Stars like The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks, all played at The Cavern in its heyday and more recently Adele launched her second album there. On December 14, 1999, Sir Paul McCartney marked the end of the millennium and the release of his new LP with a gig at club in Liverpool. More than 75,000 Beatles fans make a pilgrimage annually to Mathew Street to see where the Mop Tops honed their sound and were signed by Brian Epstein in 1961. On December 14, 1999, Sir Paul McCartney marked the end of the millennium with a gig at the Cavern Club . The fifth Beatle: Brian Epstein became the Fab Four's manager, legend has it, after a boy called Raymond Jones came into his Nems music store and asked for The Beatles record My Bonnie (recorded with Tony Sheridan) Members of the Seminole tribe atop the marquee at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, New York (left) and the logo for the Cavern Club at the Hard Rock Cafe in Boston, Massachusetts (right) Cavern Club director Dave Jones said: ‘It's an outrageous, insinuated claim to an association with fame that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Hard Rock Café. ‘We are very much the David in this battle against Goliath. ‘The Cavern doesn't look for a fight, it's not in our nature, but we owe it to every music lover on the planet to get this put right. ‘If this dispute is not put right perhaps in some decades time kids might be confused into believing that the four lads who actually changed the world from a cellar bar in Liverpool instead started out at a Hard Rock. ‘That would be a travesty of history and a tragedy for music heritage.’ The Cavern Club owns the trademark for the name in Britain, all of Europe, Australia and China. The Hard Rock Café is owned by the Orlando-based Seminole tribe who bought the chain, which began in London in 1971, in 2007 for $965million. The chairman of the Seminole Tribal Council James E. Billie is a Grammy-nominated musician for a song on his 1999 album Alligator Tales. The Cavern have pleaded for him to personally intervene and quipped that he and his band can perform a gig at the legendary night spot. Cavern Club director Bill Heckle said: ‘We are sure that as a musician Chief Jim Billie will see the history and the right to our claim. ‘This trademark row began long before the Seminole tribe took ownership of the Hard Rock, so we don't consider it's of their making. ‘If Chief Jim Billie instructs the Hard Rock to try to see it our way not only will right be done but we'll put him and his band on at The Cavern Club as part of the deal.’ Hard Rock Café did not respond to requests for comment. The Cavern Club closed in 1973 and reopened in 1984 on the same site . The Hard Rock Cavern Club in Boston features memorabilia from rock legends none of whom played at the original Liverpool venue . Some likely lads take it outside the Cavern Club in the Sixties . Jazz was the genre of music originally performed at the Cavern Club on Liverpool’s Mathew Street when it opened on a cold January Wednesday in 1957. It was opened by Alan Sytner who wanted to emulate the Parisian jazz clubs that he had enjoyed visiting. The first act to play at the club was the Merseysippi Jazz Band. After a flirtation with skiffle and blues, it became the centre of Liverpool’s rock scene in the Sixties and The Quarrymen (later The Beatles) were one of many groups who played there. The Beatles first played the Cavern on 9 February 1961 (the first time George Harrison appeared with them) after returning from Hamburg and exactly nine months later Brian Epstein saw them there. The Fab Four played there a little under 300 times, the last occurring on August 3, 1963. Epstein promised the club owners that the group would return, a promise that was never kept. The Cavern Club closed in March 1973 and was filled in during building work on the Merseyrail underground rail loop. The venue reopened on April 26, 1984 having been rebuilt using many of the old bricks and on the same site – 10 Mathew Street.","Beatles played 292 gigs at the Cavern Club beginning on February 9, 1961 .

"The policeman who shot dead a black teenager in St Louis decided to stay with the Ferguson police department because he liked the people in the neighbourhood, a friend who has known him for 12 years has claimed. Jay, who declined to give his surname, said that Darren Wilson preferred to patrol the African American neighbourhood of St Louis, Missouri rather than work a whiter area with lower crime. He claimed the 28-year-old officer was not a racist and was a level-headed person who ‘always made the right decisions’. Jay spoke out as MailOnline obtained a picture of Wilson when he was just 16 - two years younger than Michael Brown, who he is accused of shooting dead last Saturday. Yearbook: This image shows Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson at age 16 - two years younger than the age of his alleged teen victim, Michael Brown . Wilson was earlier identified in a photo shared on Yahoo!, that was originally uploaded to Facebook by his father . Outrage: An image of Michael Brown in his graduation cap and gown is held by a protester in Ferguson on Saturday . The photo shows Wilson as a sophomore at St Charles West High School in St Charles, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, where he grew up. Wilson is now at the centre of a story which has torn apart St Louis and sparked six nights of unrest and rioting. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has now imposed a curfew and declared a state of emergency as tensions remain high. MailOnline spoke to Jay, 28, who checks for underground utility lines for a living, after tracking him down through a friend who also knew Wilson. In the longest conversation so far with somebody who is close to the officer, Jay said that he met his friend playing hockey on the street in St Charles. They became close and used to ‘do typical guy stuff’ together like sit around and watch football. They two friends also joined a bowling league team together. Jay said: ‘He’s a really classy guy. He’s the last person you would expect to do something like this. ‘We met 12 years ago and we’ve become really good friends since then. ‘He’s got a lot of friends round here. He’s a quiet guy. ‘I know that if he was in danger he is not the type of guy to do something stupid. ‘I just can’t see it happening. I can’t see him doing it.’ Jay said that Wilson signed up to join the police when he thought about it and then backed out, but Wilson was interested and took his place. Jay said: ‘He loved the job. He loved being a cop. He liked to help people so I think that’s why he signed up’. Jay said that Wilson would ‘do anything for anybody’ and once co-signed for a car with him because he had bad credit. Victim: Michael Brown's Aug 9 death has been followed by protests criticizing the Ferguson police department . Scene: Authorities are seen standing over Michael Brown's body last week . Ready: Officers were seen on the streets of Ferguson Saturday as protests continued . A man holds his hands up in front of officers in Ferguson . A protester carried a sign reading 'Cops Kill Kids' on Saturday . He said: ‘I have never seen him in a bad situation. At all times he keeps himself out of bad situations. He always makes the right decisions.’ At the age of 22 Wilson signed up with the police in Jennings, a neighbourhood close to Ferguson. He appears to have transferred to Ferguson two years later. In February he received a commendation for ‘extraordinary effort in the line of duty’. His father John posted a picture on Facebook and wrote next to it: ‘Very proud of my son’. Asked if Wilson had ever appeared racist, Jay said: ‘Not at all. I know he told me many times that he liked working out in Ferguson and Jennings. ‘People used to ask him why don’t you move to a safer area but he liked it out there. He didn’t mind being on the (housing) estate… . ‘...he liked the people out there. He liked the people he worked with. As far as I know he never had any trouble’. MailOnline has already established that Wilson came from a troubled home and neighbours claimed his mother Tonya Durso cheated them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by stealing their identities.

According to public records he got divorced last year and moved into his current home with his new girlfriend. Others coming to Wilson’s defence in recent days have been Jake Shepard, who went to school with him. He wrote on Facebook: ‘He is the nicest guy in the world! He Has the biggest heart. He really does.

"The World Health Organization says the number of Ebola deaths has passed 5,000. The U.N. health agency said Wednesday that overall 14,098 people are believed to have been infected with Ebola, the vast majority of those in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Of those, 5,160 have died. There are some signs that the rate of new infections may be slowing in Guinea and Liberia, but they are surging in Sierra Leone, it said. In addition, the agency said that there are still areas of Liberia and Guinea where transmission remains high. The agency has said even these unprecedented tolls are likely an underestimate because many sick people have been too afraid or unable to seek care. Ebola fear: A dozen people have been quarantined in Mali's capital after the death of 25-year-old nurse Saliou Diarra was confirmed to have been caused by Ebola . The news comes as a dozen people were quarantined by authorities in Mali after a 25-year-old nurse died from Ebola on Tuesday. Family and colleagues who had been in contact with the nurse, identified by family as Saliou Diarra, have been quarantined in order to prevent Ebola from returning to Mali. Mr Diarra died yesterday after he treated an imam from Guinea who died with Ebola-like . symptoms in the capital Bamako. The imam from the border town of Kouremale was never tested . for the disease and his body was washed in Mali and returned to . Guinea for burial without precautions against the virus. Two aid workers said that another person who lived in the . house where the imam stayed in Bamako had died this week and was . buried without being tested. A doctor at the Pasteur Clinic where the nurse worked - one . of Bamako's top medical centres - is also suspected to have . contracted Ebola. Mali, the sixth West African nation to record Ebola, must . now trace a new batch of contacts just as people linked to its . first and only other case - a two-year-old girl who died last . month - completed their 21-day quarantine on Tuesday.

Emergency programs coordinator at Mali's Health Ministry Samba Sow, second from right, speaks to journalists at a news conference in Bamako . Concern is growing at the time it took between the imam . dying and the steps needed to contain the deadly disease being . put in place. Dr. Samba Sow, head of Mali's Ebola response, said . the imam died on Oct. 27, two days after going to the clinic. 'This case shows the lack of training of doctors in Bamako. This training should have been done six months ago,' one aid . worker told Reuters, asking not to be named. The government said in a statement on Wednesday that Mr Diarra was confirmed to have Ebola on Tuesday and died later that . evening. All necessary steps to identify people who had come . into contact with the nurse had been taken, it said. Ousmane Doumbia, secretary general of the health ministry, . said 70 people had been quarantined. The Pasteur Clinic was . locked down by police on Tuesday night. Mali shares an 800 km (500 mile) border with Guinea, which . alongside Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been worst affected by . an outbreak that has killed nearly 5,000 people this year. The . two-year-old girl had also brought Ebola to Mali from Guinea. Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond visited several Ebola treatment centres in Sierra Leone to see the challenges of the epidemic first hand. Commenting ahead of the visit, Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, said: 'The UK is leading the international effort to defeat Ebola in Sierra Leone. 'I shall be getting an update on our intervention and seeing how our support is making a difference when I meet members of our Armed Forces and health workers who have joined the fight to end Ebola.

"This photo shows Peter Mandelson's 'suburban Stalin' grandfather living among a commune of 'beardy weirdy' conscientious objectors during the First World War. Socialist Herbert Morrison, the grandfather of Labour grandee Lord Mandelson, became one of the most famous examples of the 16,000 men who refused to fight during the First World War as a matter or principle. The young activist - who went on to become a prominent figure in the Labour party- rallied against what he believed was a conflict between two capitalist nations, waged to protect the empire. This photo shows Peter Mandleson's grandfather Herbet Morrison, (middle row, far left) among a commune of conscientious objectors who worked the land in Letchworth Garden City, Herts, during the First World War . Morrison, then 28 (left), who believed the war was a capitalist fight, was seen as a radical activist and went on to inspire his grandson Lord Mandleson (right) to pursue a career in politics . So, despite being exempt from service because he was blind in one eye, Morrison registered as a conscientious objector, amid conscription laws which enlisted two-and-a-half million British troops from 1916. In return for his exemption, following a 'tribunal' in Wandsworth, Morrison joined a group of fellow objectors who worked the land in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire. While there, he met his wife Margaret, a handweaver and embroider. According to one historian, the commune became infamous in satirical magazines which portrayed the men as being 'a group of vegetarian, beardy weirdies in home-spun tweed'. While at the garden, Morrison - pictured aged 28 - apparently tried to sabotage the war effort in his own way by pulling up fledgling cabbages and cauliflowers and leaving the weeds in the ground. Years later, Labour politician Michael Foot described Morrison as a 'suburban Stalin'. 'Conchies', as they were known, attracted considerable stigma among their peers. Those who objected to the war had to appeal in public before they were put through a 'tribunal'. Many were granted a 'conditional exemption'. This meant they were exempt from conscription, but had to take on medical roles and other 'work of national importance', usually on the roads and land. Some objectors carried out dangerous and vital work, such as stretcher-bearing. But many others refused to be involved in any part of the war machine. They then faced imprisonment if they refused to join up. During the war, Morrison continued working with the Labour party and later became a significant figure in Government . Morrison himself experienced backlash for his radical views. He once revealed how he was dragged by an irate group towards a duck pond, as he pontificated about his views on the war. Speaking about the incident, he said: 'I remember an open air meeting on Hampstead Heath one Sunday morning. I had given the audience my views as to the cause of the war, and expressed my conviction that the involvement of Britain in it had been wrong. 'My audience was very hostile. I spoke amid a great deal of violent and angry heckling. 'Ultimately I was dragged off the platform and dragged by force to a nearby pond. There was some dispute at the edge of the pond, however, when the police intervened, and although my prince-nez glasses were flung into the water, I was not. 'This was a common experience among the anti-war speakers, although some of them did get a ducking.' Morrison went on to become a prominent figure in the Labour Party and served in Ramsey MacDonald's government in the late 1920s. Ironically, he was appointed by Winston Churchill as Home Secretary during the coalition government of the Second World War - a conflict he supported because he said it was against a fascist regime. There were 16,000 conscientious objectors during the First World War, who refused to fight, usually on moral or religious grounds. 'Conchies', as they became known, attracted considerable stigma among peers. Those who objected to joining up had to appeal in public before they were put through a 'tribunal'. Many were granted a 'conditional exemption', allowing them to be exempt from conscription, as long as they agreed to take on other work. This usually included dangerous non-combat medical roles such as working as a stretcher-bearer or driving an ambulance. Others were sent to carry out 'work of national importance', such as working on the roads or farming. But some still refused to be involved in any part of the war machine. If their arguments were rejected by the tribunals, then they had to decide whether to wait to be arrested, or go against their beliefs. Once drafted into the Army, men disobeying orders faced a court martial which could lead to imprisonment. Out of the 16,000, 4,500 objectors were sent to do work of national importance such as farming, 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties, while 6000 were forced into the army - many of whom were sent to prison. Thirty-five objectors were taken to France and formally sentenced to death but immediately reprieved to ten years in prison. Conditions were made hard for conscientious objector prisoners — ten died in prison, and around seventy died elsewhere as a result of their treatment. In the Second World War, there were nearly 60,000 registered Conscientious Objectors. Years later, Morrison inspired his daughter's son, Lord Mandelson, to join the Labour Party and break into politics. Now the photo - which has been digitally-colourised - is being featured in the Herts at War project,a  community-led project to commemorate the First World War. Dan Hill, of Herts at War, said: 'Herbert Morrison was perhaps the most well known of all conscientious objectors in The Great War. 'His lot was certainly not an easy one. Conchies were scorned in the street, disowned by family, friends and neighbours and generally regarded as cowards by the general population. 'Letchworth Garden City, a free-thinking town, attracted huge numbers of like-minded people during the Great War, including Herbert, who was employed in a market garden just outside the town. 'He regularly made the commute to London to continue his work as Labour Party Secretary. 'Today his objections to global conflict seem reasonable, although it is important to note that his opposition to the war was very radical. 'We are pleased to acknowledge his contribution during the Great War, albeit far from the fighting front.' Terry Charman, a historian and author of the book 'First World War on the Home Front,  which covers conscientious objectors, said: 'Many people in society gave conscientious objectors a hard time. 'Shopkeepers refused to serve them while others generally treated them with scorn and hostility.' He continued said: 'Herbert Morrison became a leading light in the Labour Party. He wanted to be the leader but was stopped in his tracks by Clement Attlee. 'In World War One he was a conscientious objector although he was blind in one eye and wouldn't have been called up anyway. 'But he wanted to take a stand and make a point and denounced the war in a series of articles in newspapers. 'A lot of left wing people in World War One were opposed to the war as it was two capitalist empires. 'There were 16,000 conscientious objectors compared to six million men who served in the armed forces.' He added: 'Morrison went before a tribunal at Wandsworth where he agreed to undertake alternative service of working on the land in Letchworth Garden City. 'Theirs was a rather famous commune of conscientious objectors and they were satirised by magazines like Punch as being a group of vegetarian, beardy weirdies in home-spun tweed. Years later Michael Foot described Herbert Morrison as a suburban Stalin. 'He was attacked by both sides for it, his fellow conscientious objectors thought that by agreeing to the land service he had sold out and he should have gone to prison for his principles while he was viewed as a coward by the other side.' Herbert Morrison was born in Stockwell, south London, the son of a police officer. As a baby, he became blind in his right eye due to an infection. That infection would later lead to him being exempt from being called up to fight in the First World War - though he also registered as a conscientious objector. Morrison went to Stockwell Road Primary School, before leaving at age 14 to become an errand boy. He became interested in politics as a teenager, briefly becoming involved with the Social Democratic Federation over the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Later, during the war, he worked in a market garden in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, after registering as a conscientious objector. There, he met his wife Margaret, a handweaver and embroiderer. During the war, Morrison continued his day trips to London to work for the Labour party. He went on to become a prominent figure in the party and served in Ramsey MacDonald's government in the late 1920s. Morrison held a variety of senior positions in the Cabinet, including Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister. He was appointed by Winston Churchill as Home Secretary during the coalition government of the Second World War - a conflict he supported because he said it was against a fascist regime. Morrison, alongside Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin, formed the triumvirate that dominated the Labour governments of 1945-51. He was Attlee’s deputy and was a shoe-in to become Attlee’s successor. But Attlee disliked him and postponed stepping down until 1955, when Morrison was too old. Morrison organised the victorious 1945 election campaign, and the critical nationalisation programme that followed. He was, however, a staunch opponent to Aneurin Bevan's proposals for the British National Health Service. He developed his social views from his work in local politics, and always emphasised the importance of public works to deal with unemployment. He died in 1965.","Herbert Morrison was one of 16,000 men who refused to fight in Great War .

"A mother attending her first festival hanged herself in a public toilet cubicle after taking illegal drugs which 'affected her state of mind', an inquest heard today. Beauty therapist Lisa Williamson, 31, was found slumped in a toilet at BoomTown Fair on the third day of the festival in Alresford, Hampshire. Her back was to the door when a festival-goer discovered her. He alerted security, who then broke in and began CPR, the hearing was told. Lisa Williamson (pictured with her husband Darren), was found slumped in a toilet at BoomTown Fair on the third night of the festival in Alresford, Hampshire, an inquest heard . She died later that day on August 9 this year at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester after paramedics also failed to revive her. The mother-of-two had bought amphetamine - including ground-up ecstasy - with husband Darren Williamson when they arrived at the festival, the inquest was told. She took around a small amount the night before she died - on August 8, the inquest heard. Mrs Williamson - who did not make it to bed until 6am on the day of her death - woke up in a 'grouchy' mood, the inquest heard, and the tent was particularly hot when she was awoken at 11.30am. After becoming agitated, Mrs Williamson, from Bromyard, Herefordshire, stormed off through a field of festival-goers' tents, the coroner was told. Her husband became concerned when she did not return later and after 20 minutes went off in search of his partner of eight years. A little over two hours later he discovered an ambulance crew attending a stricken festival-goer. Mr Williamson said: 'I rushed across the fields but a security guard said ""you're not allowed through"". 'I told him I'm looking for my wife but he said ""don't worry, it's a man"". 'We carried on walking past the block of toilets when I looked back - and then I saw her pyjamas.' Weeping, he added: 'That's when I realised it was her. 'We didn't know what had happened but she was on the floor and paramedics were surrounding her. The mother-of-two had bought amphetamine - including ground-up ecstasy - with husband Darren Williamson when they arrived at the festival, the inquest was told (file image of BoomTown Fair) 'They seemed to be trying for a long time to bring her around - watching it all I felt so helpless.' A letter from her GP Dr Louise Mottram at the Nunwell Surgery in her hometown said Mrs Williamson had no significant history of depression or mental health problems. However, she had an episode of 'lower mood' in 2010 shortly after the birth of her two children, which Mr Williamson said was a mild form of post-natal depression. She had left her children with relatives to attend the festival, which is held on the Matterley Estate. Toxicology tests revealed Mrs Williamson had high levels of amphetamine and MDMA in her blood. There were also traces of cocaine, which could have been taken in the weeks leading up to her death. Consultant Pathologist Hayley Burnley today said she 'ultimately died from hanging', but added: 'But the use of drugs previously would have no doubt affected her state of mind at the time.' Grahame Short, Central Hampshire Senior Coroner, recorded an open verdict because he could not be sure she intended to kill herself. He said: 'I am satisfied she took ecstasy and amphetamine and I believe she was under the influence of those drugs at the time of her death. 'She was found hanging in a locked toilet and having heard the evidence, I'm satisfied this was self-inflicted. 'She had been behaving strangely in those last few hours of her life. 'I think the drugs had affected her as well as the lack of sleep and the temperature of the tent would have affected her state of mind.' The inquest heard how Mrs Williamson had been 'behaving strangely' in the last few hours of her life (file picture of BoomTown Fair) Mrs Williamson's death, in the TrenchTown area of the site, was the third in four years at the BoomTown Fair. Last year public schoolgirl Ellie Rowe died after taking the horse tranquilliser ketamine at the festival. The 18-year-old, from Glastonbury, Somerset, was working as a volunteer steward at the festival when she was found collapsed in her tent by a friend. In 2011, mother-of-two Deborah Jeffery, 45, died from a heart attack at the festival after taking ecstasy. At the time of Mrs Williamson's death, a BoomTown spokesperson said: 'BoomTown Fair would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family of the young woman who was found unconscious on site. 'Despite the efforts of all our staff involved she was later pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Winchester Hospital. 'Our thoughts are with all her loved ones at this tragic time, and the festival is doing all it can to assist those involved.' BoomTown Fair is a music festival where acts and music are divided between nine different districts - each with their own theme or style. It has been running for six years and features four days of live music and art events. Acts who played the festival include The Wailers, The Skatalites, Jimmy Cliff, Shaggy and Chas n Dave. This year, Hampshire Constabulary seized around £70,000 of drugs and £15,000 in cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act.","Lisa Williamson found slumped in a public toilet cubicle at Boomtown Fair .

"Important discussions: Prime Minister David Cameron has recalled Parliament for today . David Cameron was forced to delay plans for immediate military strikes on Syria last night after being warned he faced losing a Commons vote. The Prime Minister battled desperately to get a consensus for a missile attack, but was forced by Ed Miliband and Tory rebels to allow UN inspectors time to report on last week’s chemical weapons atrocity. MPs will vote tonight on a hastily prepared motion which still supports the principle of military action. However, it will not now be carried out until ‘every effort’ has been made to secure a UN agreement, and even then, direct British involvement would require a second Commons vote. The decision to wait for a second vote is a humiliating setback for Mr Cameron who had privately promised Barack Obama that Britain would stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States. British officials had to phone their counterparts in the US last night to explain that President Obama would have to go it alone or wait to see if Mr Cameron can persuade MPs to back him in the coming days. Mr Cameron had little choice, because losing a Commons vote could have triggered his own downfall. On another day of dramatic developments: . Scroll down for video . Talks: Mr Cameron chaired a meeting of the National Security Council at Downing Street before the recall . Demonstration: Activists block Whitehall near the junction with Downing Street during an event organised by Stop the War Coalition to protest against potential UK involvement in the Syrian conflict . Listening: Protesters hear from Diane Abbot MP at a Stop the War Coalition demonstration at Downing Street . Downing Street reacted angrily to the dramatic U-turn by Mr Miliband, who had initially indicated support for intervention. A . senior source said: ‘Labour has been playing politics when they should . have been thinking about the national interest. 'Their position has . changed consistently over the last 24 hours, finally ending in demands . they had not even hinted at before.’ Lending her support: Diane Abbott MP (left) attends an event organised by Stop the War Coalition to protest against potential UK involvement in the Syrian conflict in Whitehall, London. Another protester is seen (right) 'Hands off': People take part in a protest organised by the Stop the War coalition calling for no military attack . Government . sources last night said Mr Cameron was still determined to get approval . for a retaliatory strike on Syria within days. 'Labour has been playing politics when they should have been thinking about the national interest' Downing Street source . A second Commons vote is likely to be held early next week, and could even come as soon as tomorrow or Saturday. Mr . Cameron will now rush out an Iraq-style intelligence dossier on Syria . this morning in a desperate bid to persuade his own MPs – and Labour – . that Assad’s use of chemical weapons must be met with a show of force . from the West. Last night it . was unclear whether the United States will press ahead with plans for a . missile bombardment this weekend – or pause its assault to see if Mr . Cameron can deliver British support. Watching on: Police stand guard outside Downing Street during an event organised by Stop the War Coalition to protest against potential UK involvement in the Syrian conflict in London .

Taking a shot: An opposition fighter fires an rocket propelled grenade during clashes with regime forces over the strategic area of Khanasser, situated on the only road linking Aleppo to central Syria . Mr . Miliband’s decision to withdraw support for immediate attacks on Syria . dealt a major blow to the Prime Minister as he prepared to deliver the . speech of his life. If MPs have the slightest suspicion that attacking Syria will cause more suffering than it can possibly prevent they have a fundamental moral duty to vote No. Read more . Just . before 6pm the Labour leader, who has dithered for days over the issue, . said he would order his divided party to vote against immediate action, . to allow the United Nations more time to consider evidence about the . atrocity. Within an hour the . Government had issued its own Parliamentary motion saying it would not . act until the UN Security Council had had time to consider the report of . the weapons inspectors. A Government source said Mr Miliband had . ‘barely mentioned the UN’ when he held talks with Mr Cameron and Nick . Clegg in Downing Street on Tuesday. Would bombing Syria be lawful? Britain and the US insist it would be, but the truth is far from clear. It’s hard to see how Syria’s reported chemical attacks against its own citizens present a direct threat to either country. What specific laws or UN conventions might be used as justification? The UN Charter allows for military action on only two grounds – in self-defence, or if action is approved by the UN Security Council. Neither applies here. Russia has made clear its intention to veto any proposed Security Council resolution authorising action – as has China. Can a military strike be legal without a UN resolution? Unclear. In 1999, the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia was launched without one, with Tony Blair and President Clinton seeking to justify it on humanitarian grounds to protect Kosovan civilians. The intervention was widely welcomed, but its legality was questionable. A similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in Syria. If President Assad is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people, he will be in breach of the Geneva Gas Protocol, an international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which Syria is a signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons. But breaching the protocol doesn’t provide a clear justification for military action and it normally applies to international conflicts, rather than civil wars. Does the UN have a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ the Syrians? In 2005, following the hideous atrocities committed in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s, the UN brought forward an initiative called the ‘Responsibility to Protect’. It was designed to protect the innocent from genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders, and an obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere. But former UN assistant Secretary-General, Francesc Vendrell, says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force. All diplomatic efforts must have been tried first, and even then military intervention requires the backing of the Security Council – taking David Cameron and President Obama back to square one. Does the PM need Parliamentary backing for a bombing campaign? Technically, no. He retains the power, under Royal Prerogative, to use military force without Parliamentary approval. However, all recent major military interventions – including the wars in Iraq and Libya  – have been preceded by a Commons vote. The Government has made clear it will ‘respect the outcome’ of tonight’s. Warzone: Free Syrian Army fighters run to take cover from snipers loyal to President Assad near Aleppo airport . Wreckage: Syrians walk in a heavily damaged street in the country's eastern town of Deir Ezzor . Response: United Nations chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks carry samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus . Rallying: The local Syrian community protests against US involvement in Syria, in Allentown, Pennsylvania . He . then phoned the Prime Minister on Tuesday night to say he needed a ‘UN . moment’ before he could act – prompting Britain to table a UN Security . Council resolution yesterday despite the certain knowledge it would be . blocked by Russia. He then . visited Downing Street again yesterday to demand that the inspectors be . allowed to report, even though they have not been asked to rule on . whether Assad was responsible for last week’s atrocity. With . dozens of Tories also warning they were yet to be convinced by the case . for an attack, Mr Cameron was facing the prospect of a potential . Commons defeat and had no choice but to give way. A . Downing Street spokesman said the new Commons motion ‘reflects the . Prime Minister’s respect for the UN process – something he made clear to . President Obama several days ago’. The 370-word motion agrees that military action may be necessary and would be legally sound. But it’s awash with conditions, caveats and turgid language. IT SAYS: . ‘This House: . 'Deplores the use of chemical weapons in Syria on 21 August 2013 by the Assad regime, which caused hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries of Syrian civilians; . 'Recalls the importance of upholding the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons under international law; . 'Agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action that is legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria’s chemical weapons; . 'Notes the failure of the United Nations Security Council over the last two years to take united action in response to the Syrian crisis; . 'Notes that the use of chemical weapons is a war crime under customary law and a crime against humanity – and that the principle of humanitarian intervention provides a sound legal basis for taking action; . 'Notes the wide international support for such a response, including the statement from the Arab League on 27 August which calls on the international community, represented in the United Nations Security Council, to ""overcome internal disagreements and take action against those who committed this crime, for which the Syrian regime is responsible""; .

"One Direction star Zayn Malik has been bombarded with death threats by outraged Israelis after posting a #FreePalestine message on Twitter. The 21-year-old, who was brought up a Muslim in Bradford, Yorkshire, shared the #FreePalestine hashtag earlier today to his 13million followers, who retweeted it 140,000 times. However, moments after the post appeared, Zayn began receiving messages telling him to 'kill himself' and one even read: 'Let me kill you'. Scroll down for video .

Zayn's mother Trisha Malik was born in Bradford to a white British working class family. Her parents ran a pub in the city, but her life changed when she met and married a British Pakistani, Yasser, and converted to Islam. She told the BBC in December last year: 'I've always tried to learn as much as I can about my husband's religion and culture. 'I made sure the children went to the mosque. Zayn has read the Koran three times.' Opinion: Zayn Malik is not the first celebrity to wade into the conflict in Gaza . Trisha also worked as a halal chef in the kitchen of a local primary school, making meals for Muslim children. Zayn, who is engaged to Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards, is not the first celebrity to wade into the conflict in Gaza. Pop singer Rihanna posted a message only a few weeks ago to her 36.4million followers in support of Palestine. The message was removed within eight minutes but it had already been retweeted thousands of times. Shortly after she then tweeted: 'Let's pray for peace and a swift end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict! Is there any hope?...'

Ms Villatoro first met Josie and her father when she photographed them, along with Josie’s mother, Grace, for one of their final family portraits together. Mrs Zetz mentioned that Josie was upset about the fact her father would not be there for 'memories down the line' so Ms Villatoro decided to try and help out. She suggested holding a 'mini-wedding' for Josie to coincide with her 11th birthday and got the go-head. Friends and family rallied around in support, as did complete strangers. For her 'wedding' Josie wore an elegant long, lacy white dress and carried a pink-and-white bouquet. Soft waves were put in her long brown hair and beauticians applied natural make-up. Her father meanwhile opted for a smart camel-colored three-piece suit, topped with a flat cap.

"This towering castle is fit for a tiny king or queen. With a height of 39ft, the sandcastle designed by American artist Rusty Croft is vying for the world record for the tallest one ever built. It took nearly a week to construct the castle – using 20 truckloads of sand – in the Brazilian city of Niteroi, across the Guanabara Bay from Rio de Janeiro. With a height of 39ft, the sandcastle designed by American artist Rusty Croft is vying for a world record . It took nearly a week and 20 truckloads of sand to construct the castle, which has incredible detail . With elaborate detail the massive beach sculpture puts  the tiny sandcastles that most holidaymakers build when they’re sunning on a beach to shame. A team from Guinness World Records is visiting the statue to measure it and confirm whether it is a record breaker. After it is measured, the sandcastle, built from special material that can withstand winds and rain, will be destroyed. After it is measured the sandcastle will be destroyed on a beach in the Brazilian city of Niteroi . Impressive scenery: Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer is visible in the background . Mr Croft, who builds sandcastles around the world, constructed this palace with the support of two American companies looking to promote their brands in Brazil. His professional career began in 1997 when he was part of a team that created the record-setting Lost City of Atlantis sand sculpture. He is now a co-owner of California-based Sand Guys, which is hired to create sand sculptures for the likes of Yahoo!, Google, Facebook and other companies.","Towering palace is 39ft tall and took nearly a week to construct .

"One Florida waiter had a very memorable night at work on Tuesday thanks to a generous couple. Carlos Perez of Naples, Florida, was having a particularly busy night at Pazzo! restaurant, and one of his tables told him to take his time bringing them a very expensive bottle of Tuscan wine.

The chef obliged, and did not take the money, so the man told Perez to put two cases of beer on his bill for the entire staff to enjoy after work. 'We’re talking about 48 beers. That’s $240 in beers just for the staff,' Perez told Naples Daily News. Then, the gentleman, whose identity the restaurant will not reveal, asked Perez, ‘What would you do if you had some money?’ Perez said he would fix his car, and with that the man said, 'Don’t worry about it, Carlos. You’re going to fix your car tomorrow. I’m going to get you a $1,500 tip.' He was good to his word too, and though Perez tried to refuse him, he handed over $1,500 at the end of the meal.

"Heartbroken: Becky Tait, 20, had died on a railway line where a close friend was fatally hit by a train . A heartbroken girlfriend killed herself by copying her boyfriend’s suicide just weeks after he threw himself in front of a train. Care worker Becky Tait, 20, stepped in front of a speeding locomotive on Sunday evening after struggling to come to terms with the death of Phil James. The 19-year-old had died two days after being hit by a train along the same stretch of tracks, near Stone station in Staffordshire, on September 7. Shortly after his death, Miss Tait posted photographs on a Facebook tribute page of the couple on holiday in Portugal. She wrote: ‘The best memories with the best person I’ve ever met. I love you so much.’ Yesterday friends told how Miss Tait had been left inconsolable following the death of her ‘soul mate’. On a Facebook page in her memory, they wrote that the pair had ‘found true love’. One friend, who would give his name only as Adam, said: ‘They had known each other for a while but had only been going out for a couple of months. ‘She was inconsolable and I don’t think she coped well with the death at all. ‘Despite people trying to show their support she just shied away and went into her own little bubble. 'She didn’t talk about it, which I don’t think helped. It’s a tragic loss of two good people. ‘It is so sad they both thought this was the only option out.’ More than 370 of Miss Tait’s friends have joined the Facebook page set up in her memory. Tom Arnold, who created the tribute, wrote: ‘You were the single most incredible, lovable, funny, compassionate, brilliant, entertaining person … The reality of it set in today and I honestly don’t know what I’ll do without you.’ Holiday: Miss Tait had been on holiday with Phil James (right) to Portugal. Mr James, a popular rugby player and Robbie Williams fan, died two months ago after being hit by a train on the same stretch of track . Respectful: Hundreds of people have joined Facebook tribute groups and left flowers at the scene . Close: Miss Tait (left) attended a match at Stone Rugby Club last month to raise money for a memorial bench for her friend Mr James (right). Robbie Williams was among those who paid tribute to the rugby player . He added: ‘I know you’ve struggled for a long time now and I truly hope you’ve found peace.’ Miss Tait was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene at around 6.15pm, just yards from where Mr James had been found fatally injured. Stone's mayor said of the pair (pictured): 'The feelings of the community are very strong' Police say they are not treating her death as suspicious. In a statement, her family said: ‘Becky will be sadly missed by many people. Sadly Becky took her own life. ‘We would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes, support and floral tributes.’ A spokesman for New Park House care home, where Miss Tait had worked for the past three years, said: ‘Becky was a highly valued member of the team. She was bubbly, caring and would do anything for anyone.’ Mr James, also from Stone, was described as one of Robbie Williams’ biggest fans and had a tattoo of the pop star’s name across his chest. Following the teenager’s death, the singer left a tribute on Twitter, asking him to ‘save me a pint in heaven’. Since the two deaths, cards and flowers have been left across the town in tribute. Cathy Collier, mayor of Stone, said: ‘To take your own life is a terrible thing. No one knows what goes through someone’s mind when they do it. ‘The family must be going through heartbreak. ‘The feelings of the community are very strong, as they were with the previous death. It’s bad enough when someone older passes away but for someone so young it’s such a waste of a life.’ Miss Tait last month attended a rugby match held at Stone Rugby Club to raise money for a memorial bench for her boyfriend at Stone Cemetery.","Friends paid tribute to Becky Tait, 20, whose body was found on Sunday .

"Airline food as a whole does not have the best reputation as the most exciting nor delicious meal one eats while travelling. However that may be about to change thanks to a brand new menu being unveiled by Qantas which features larger serving sizes and a wider range of options than ever. The best part is the exciting new meals are served in economy and come at no extra cost to passengers. With a 50 per cent increase in the size of main meals and a pick of three different choices - four if you log on to the Q-Eat service to pre-order - the airline has completely overhauled its on board meals. Scroll down for video . Qantas Airways have overhauled their in-flight menu for economy travellers . The Q-Eat system wasn't previously available to economy travellers. Passengers will soon be able to choose from the likes of smokey barbecue beef with roasted sweet potato, broccoli and corn or honey roasted chicken farro salad and seasonal vegetables with pumpkin and sesame seeds. Scrambled eggs with chicken sausage, tomato, hash brown and baked beans and Ruby and Roy's traditional Greek yoghurt with granola will also feature on the new menus set to take-off from November 25th. Qantas Group Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said he hopes the dining experience will raise the bar for the five million Economy customers travelling across the airline's international network each year. The meals are now double the size they used to be and passengers can choose from four options instead of two . People are encouraged to choose their meal online before they fly so they receive their first preference . 'We have worked closely with Australia's leading producers and suppliers to deliver what we believe to be the best inflight economy dining experience offered by any international carrier,' said Mr Joyce. 'The new menu offers more generous meals and an increase from two to four meal options. We also have new meal categories, including a healthy option, comfort food, and a meal inspired by the route itself, like Smoky Barbeque Beef on our US flights,' said Mr Joyce. 'Together with new serving plates, which remove the need for trays, our crew will be able to serve and clear meals up to 30 minutes faster giving them more time to interact and assist passengers,' he added. The new serving plates remove the need for the large food trays and reduce unnecessary plastic waste . Meals are now much larger but also 40 per cent more expensive to produce than previous economy options . Passengers in economy also get the choice of a new range of snacks on board including pulled beef sliders with capsicum and tomato relish, Weis ice-cream bars, Maltesers and fresh fruit. The new experience has been introduced in a bid to improve customer satisfaction and while it wont be quite the standard of premium economy, the gap between that and economy will close slightly. And despite the larger meals now costing 40 percent more to produce - according to Traveller - the airline is certain it has cut back costs on packaging - doing away with trays and unnecessary plastic wrappings. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said he hopes the dining experience will raise the bar for the five million Economy customers travelling with the airline each year .","The new menu will feature four meal options instead of the previous two .
Wagyu beef and a chicken salad will be among the first meals offered .

"Laddish comic Dapper Laughs has retired the 'persona' which prompted outrage in an ITV2 show - and claims the complaints against him have 'wrecked his life'. Daniel O'Reilly was grilled on the BBC's Newsnight after 68,000 people and 44 comedians called for his show On The Pull to be axed for giving a platform to 'everyday sexism'. He found internet fame on Vine and Twitter - leading to his TV show - as south London 'lad' Dapper Laughs, who engaged women in 'banter' in the name of comedy. But his UK tour and possible second series were cancelled after he told a stand-up audience member she was 'gagging for a rape'. Scroll down for video . Laddish: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled on the BBC's Newsnight after 68,000 people and 44 comedians called for his ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull to be axed for giving a platform to 'everyday sexism' The comedian said: 'Obviously I don't think that, but I'm taking the mick out of what I thought men think' Dressed all in black with a turtle-neck jumper, he told Newsnight anchor Emily Maitlis last night: 'It's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian. 'The bad press and everything that's happened - it's wrecked my life to a certain extent.' Mr O'Reilly, from Clapham, south London, insisted repeatedly that Dapper Laughs was a 'character' and didn't reflect his real personality. On his show inciting rape . If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go ""Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b****, well done, see you later"" On homeless people . A tramp just asked me what I was looking at,""Your tooth"" I said,he laughed, which revealed two more random teeth, which ruined the joke . On his own demise . Breaking news, Dapper Laughs dies of a viagra overdose. Apparently his girlfriend took it very hard . On women's tastes . Girls love brains almost as much as they love b*******. There's loads of them in bookstores. Girls, try this [book], it's a bit long, it's about my **** . On how to market himself . Watch my TV show on ITV2 and I'll shag ya. Yeah that works. That's work, c'mon! He said: 'At the time I didn't think that so many people would end up seeing it. In the end it became very popular and I kind of got a bit carried away with it, to be honest with you. 'It's wrong but, to me, I didn't see it as me who was saying it, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular. 'I thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.' The ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull - which claimed to teach awkward men how to talk to women - finished its first series on November 3. It was widely criticised after the comedian bellowed his catchphrases 'she knows' and 'proper moist' at women in the street. He said he took the decision to cancel the tour after deciding he did not want to perform as the character any more. 'I am not going to allow Dapper Laughs to represent me,' he said. 'I want the people out there to know that not only am I going to stop it, I am going to help it not being promoted.' His bids to defend himself previously led to even more anger. Defending claims the show encouraged rape, he told a live audience: 'If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go ""Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b****, well done, see you later"".' He was later heard telling a female audience member she was 'gagging for a rape'. Offensive: Newsnight host Emily Maitlis told the comedian his act 'incites harassment and violence' Provocative: The south London 'lad' rose to internet infamy with his six-second Vines about pulling women . The comedian produced a charity Christmas album to raise money for Shelter - but the homelessness charity rejected the offer because of his offensive jokes about homeless people. In one tweet in October last year he said: 'Just gave my number to a homeless woman (cracking boobs tho, not sure if her top was low cut or just ripped) closed with: your place or mine'. In another in June he said: 'A tramp just asked me what I was looking at,""Your tooth"" I said,he laughed, which revealed two more random teeth, which ruined the joke.' Face-off: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled by the BBC's Emily Maitlis as he revealed he is retiring his 'character' EMILY MAITLIS: Dan O'Reilly, at best what you do is offensive, at worst it incites harassment and violence. DANIEL O'REILLY: Mm. No, d'you know what, from the beginning when I started the character Dapper Laughs it caught on really quick that that type of humour was really popular for a certain demographic of people... In the end it became really popular and I kind of got a little bit carried away with it to be honest with you. EM: When you see that now, what do you think? DOR: If that was the first time I'd seen that kind of comedy I'd think the character is not setting a good example, but at the time when we were doing it, it was getting so much praise from the audience it was being received by and growing and growing and growing... I thought maybe y'know these people could see that I'm, cos, saying that, obviously to me, it's like c'mon, that's not, that's not real, obviously I don't think that, but I, I'm taking the mick out of what I thought men think, d'you what I mean? EM: Right. So when you say you're giving advice to men on the pull and for example you say 'get your g*** out' to women, can you deny that would encourage men to do that on the street? DOR: Yeah potentially of course, you're right, it's, it's, y'know, it's wrong, but, to, well I'm not going to say but, but to me, I didn't see it as me that was saying that, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was quite popular. EM: So you agree that when you create this character and it incites sexual violence... DOR: I didn't think it did at the time, I thought the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it. EM: You've said Dapper Laughs is an extension of yourself. He allows you to do things you wouldn't normally do and you blame it on him. Doesn't sound like satire at all, it sounds like an excuse. DOR: Well that's not the attitude that I did have with it. D'you know what, to be completely honest with you, it was great at the beginning for me, it's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian. EM: Just another line that came up, 'Just show her your penis, if she cries she's playing hard to get'. There's a bit in the film we saw where you're holding up a knife and you say 'Lift up your f****** shirt. Was that all just done in jest? DOR: No disrespect to you, looking at me now, do you think I'd go out and do that? I was creating, I was pushing the boundaries of that character. EM: But what you're saying is that women who say no don't mean no, and if people watching that think it's funny and they go and enact that, then that's the consequence... DOR: That makes me sad to think if someone had done that and I was responsible for that it's terrible. That's why this week with the bad press and everything that's happened, I've stopped and said, y'know, it's wrecked my life to a certain extent. EM: So you're feeling like a bit of a victim now, are you? DOR: I wouldn't say that, maybe a victim of my own mistakes.","Daniel O'Reilly claimed outrage over his jokes had 'wrecked his life'

"One of Britain's most picturesque railway lines, which cost £35 million to repair when it was nearly destroyed by winter storms in February, is in peril again after 'huge' cracks appeared in it. Gaping holes appeared in the sea wall which protects the main railway line through Dawlish, Devon after it was battered by storms on Tuesday. In early February the track was swept away with part of the sea wall cutting off the service linking Cornwall and much of Devon with the rest of the UK. Scroll down for video . Dawlish's railway line (pictured) cost £35 million to repair when it was nearly destroyed by storms in February - and now new cracks have appeared in it after a storm battered it yesterday . Gaping holes (pictured) appeared in the sea wall which protects the main railway line through Dawlish, Devon after it was battered by storms yesterday . A 300-strong Network Rail team rebuilt the track at a cost of £35 million. In total, £15 million was spent repairing the area outside Dawlish station where track had been left dangling. It cost an additional £20 million to repair tracks either side of the town. Now a 20-foot long stretch of the sea wall has been damaged again leaving gaping holes and precariously exposed coping stones. The sea wall at Dawlish regularly suffers minor damage after a storm due to its close proximity to the sea . In early February the track was swept away with part of the sea wall - cutting off the service linking Cornwall and much of Devon with the rest of the UK . Dawlish residents took to social media to express their concerns over yesterday's damage. Rob Coleman said: 'I fear for the future of the route. I have said all along that there is an agenda out there to get it changed - things like today, although exaggerated, does not help the town one bit. 'The business fraternity west of us will not want a train line down again for any length of time.' Elliot Watson said: 'The sea will always win...simple.' Rebecca Marett added: 'Ultimately the same destructive thing will happen at some point in the future, it's the sea.' And Tony Russell said: 'Much bigger storms to come yet.' A Network Rail spokesman said: 'The sea wall at Dawlish regularly suffers minor damage after a storm due to its close proximity to the sea. 'This is why a team is permanently tasked with checking the wall daily and carrying out minor repairs. 'The minor damage that occurred during last night's storm was not to the new section of the wall and will be repaired shortly.' In total, £15 million was spent repairing the area outside Dawlish station where track had been left dangling . Julian Burnell from Network Rail added: 'I'm not too worried about this. It is pretty much business as usual at Dawlish. 'We had a thumping storm and that is why we have a team of men that have for many years gone up and down that wall all the time checking for damage and fixing it. 'In this case the coping stones at the top of the wall have been hit enough to loosen them so we closed the walkway to assess the damage. 'But we will fix the stones back in position - this is the kind of thing we deal with at Dawlish every day. 'Everybody is very sensitive after the catastrophe in February - this is nothing to worry about on that scale.' Oliver Colvile MP said the disruption demonstrated that the South West needs a more resilient railway line. He said: 'The idea that we are going to have this railway line that is going to break on a regular basis just isn't good enough. 'I want to make sure that we have a railway line that is a resilient one and also an alternative in case anything happens like last February and today.' Dawlish boasts one of Britain's most picturesque railway lines - but it is constantly being battered by the sea .","Gaping holes appeared in the sea wall which protects track following storm .

"A man who had been reported missing turned up at a Burger King drive-through on Friday and shot himself in the head. Samuel Teran, of Las Vegas, Nevada, who had been reported missing since Wednesday, shot himself after employees at the Burger King called authorities to report they had seen the car that Teran and his stepdaughter, Susana Villalvalzo, had last been seen in when they went missing. Teran died when his family took him off life support, and at the same time became a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter. Scroll down for video .

"Astronomers have captured storms raging on the normally bland face of Uranus - although the origin of the storms remains a mystery. The storms were first spotted back in August but more recent images have revealed they are still occurring. And the cloud activity is so bright that even amateur astronomers have seen signs of it in the blue-green atmosphere of the planet, which is 30 times further away from the Sun than the Earth. These are infrared images of Uranus obtained on 6 August 2014 with the Keck telescope in Hawaii. The white spot is an extremely large storm that was brighter than any feature ever recorded on the planet . Astronomers observing Uranus with the Keck Telescope in Hawaii detected eight large storms in the planet's northern hemisphere on August 5 and 6. One was the brightest ever measured on Uranus, accounting for 30 per cent of all light reflected by the rest of the planet at a wavelength of 2.2 microns. This is the 'colour' of light that senses clouds just below the tropopause, where the atmospheric pressure is half what it is at the Earth's surface. Later observations by amateur astronomers revealed a bright spot, which scientists believe is evidence of storm activity much deeper in the atmosphere. Uranus boasts a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph (900 km/h). It has massive storms that could engulf continents on Earth, and temperatures in the -220°C (-360°F) range. The planet's strange tilt is the cause behind this bizarre weather system. The Earth has seasons because the axis tilts, and the hemisphere tilted towards the sun gets more light than that the region tilted away. But Uranus has an axis that runs almost parallel to the plane. It also spins backwards, compared to the other planets, making its tilt 98 degrees. This causes 21-year-long seasons and unusual cold weather. For nearly a quarter of the Uranian year - equal to 84 Earth years - the sun shines directly over each pole. But interestingly, the extremely bright storm seen by Keck in the near infrared is not the one seen by the amateurs, which is much deeper in the atmosphere than the one that initially caused all the excitement. Is is thought this feature is below the uppermost cloud layer of methane-ice in Uranus's atmosphere. French amateur astronomer Marc Delcroix processed the amateur images and confirmed the discovery of a bright spot on an image by French amateur Régis De-Bénedictis, then in others taken by fellow amateurs in September and October. He had his own chance on 3 and 4 October to photograph it with the Pic du Midi one-meter telescope, where on the second night, 'I caught the feature when it was transiting, and I thought, ""Yes, I got it!""' said Delcroix. 'I was thrilled to see such activity on Uranus. Getting details on Mars, Jupiter or Saturn is now routine, but seeing details on Uranus and Neptune are the new frontiers for us amateurs and I did not want to miss that. 'I was so happy to confirm myself these first amateur images on this bright storm on Uranus, feeling I was living a very special moment for planetary amateur astronomy.' These optical images of Uranus were taken on 19 September and 2 October, showing the dramatic appearance of a bright storm on a planet that normally displays only a diffuse bright polar region . A total solar eclipse hangs in the sky over the W. M. Keck Observatory on 11 July 1991, and the Nasa Infrared Telescope Facility is seen in the background. The edge of the Moon's shadow can be seen near the horizon . The findings were first presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division of Planetary Sciences in Tucson, Arizona. Co-investigator Dr Heidi Hammel, from the US Space Science Institute, who was part of the initial observation in August said: 'This type of activity would have been expected in 2007, when Uranus's once every 42-year equinox occurred and the sun shined directly on the equator. 'But we predicted that such activity would have died down by now. Why we see these incredible storms now is beyond anybody's guess.' Uranus has a diameter four times that of Earth and is wrapped in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, plus a dash of methane that gives it a blue tint. Because it is so distant - 30 times farther from the sun than Earth - astronomers were able to see little detail on its surface until adaptive optics on the Keck telescopes revealed features much like those on Jupiter. Bright clouds are probably caused by gases such as methane rising in the atmosphere and condensing into highly reflective clouds of methane ice. Because Uranus has no internal source of heat, its atmospheric activity was thought to be driven solely by sunlight, which is now weak in the northern hemisphere. Hence astronomers were surprised when these observations showed such intense activity.","Astronomers have spotted storms raging on the planet Uranus .

"A quarter of British households throw away food amounting to £437 a year just because it ends up at the back of the fridge and they forget that it's there. The Scots are the worst offenders, with more than one in ten (13 per cent) finding produce that has gone past its sell-by date. Those in East Anglia (12 per cent), the North East (11 per cent) and Wales (10 per cent) were equally as bad when it came to wasting food. A quarter of Brits throw away food amounting to £437 a year because it ends up at the back of their fridges . Almost 10 per cent of the weekly shop ends up getting thrown away - be it leftovers, half eaten lunch packs or food that has gone past its expiration date. The  study by Samsung UK also highlighted that over a quarter (26 per cent) of Brits confess to 'top-up shopping' (buying food every other day), with more than one in five (23 per cent) only deciding what they're going to eat for dinner on the day. More than one in five (22 per cent) think that a better food organisation system would help to reduce their food wastage. And nearly a quarter (23 per cent) say that being able to more easily see what they buy once in their fridge freezer would help. De-cluttered: Introducing more organisation into fridge-freezers may be the answer to reducing food waster . More than one fifth (22 per cent) confess to throwing away food that is more than a week past its sell by date, whilst four per cent have found an item in their fridge that was a year past its expiration date. People are even more in the dark about the food left in their freezers, with 12 per cent confessing to throwing away an item that was a year past its perishable date. Professional organiser and de-clutter Vicky Silverthorn, who counts Lily Allen, La Roux and Ed Sheeran among her clients, said that introducing more organisation into fridge-freezers may be the answer to reducing food wastage. Ms Silverthorn said: 'Whether you're throwing away lunch leftovers or a bottle of milk that has gone out of date, no one likes to waste food. 'A well-designed fridge can instantly help you to stay organised and keep on top of your weekly shop.' Professional organiser  Vicky Silverthorn . The more visible the food, the more likely you are to use it up: If you can't see it you don't use it.  The easier the contents of your fridge are to see, the less likely you are to throw away out-of-date products. Make notes: Take a mental note of what you end up throwing out each week and make sure you have these products in a more visible place so you don't make the same mistake twice. Keep the items you use most at the front of the fridge: Having the items you use most to hand as soon as you open the fridge door can make a world of difference. Store at eye level the food you want to eat most of: If you're trying to eat more healthily, then make sure your fresh fruit and vegetables are the first thing you see when you open the fridge.. Make the most of flexible storage: Remember you can often move your refrigerator shelves up and down. So adjust to suit what you are storing to ensure you don't have any dead space. More than a third (34 per cent) of Brits have a partial storage system in their fridge freezer, storing bulk items like milk and eggs separately but 16 per cent confess to having no system at all, storing food wherever they find space. Lana Sanleandro, Head of Marketing, Home Appliances, Samsung UK said; 'Every household in the UK will remember a time when they have found something in the back of their fridge that has gone past its sell-by date.

"Google, pictured street-mapping in Bristol, has always claimed that it didn't know its software would collect the private information . Google is facing an inquiry into claims that it deliberately harvested information from millions of UK home computers. The Information Commissioner data protection watchdog is expected to examine the work of the internet giant’s Street View cars. They downloaded emails, text messages, photographs and documents from wi-fi networks as they photographed virtually every British road. It is two years since Google first admitted stealing fragments of personal data, but claimed it was a ‘mistake’. Now the full scale of its activities has emerged amid accusations of a cover-up after US regulators found a senior manager was warned as early as 2007 that the information was being captured as its cars trawled the country but did nothing. Around one in four home networks in the UK is thought to be unsecured – lacking password protection – allowing personal data to be collected. Technology websites and bloggers have suggested that Google harvested the information simply because it was able to do so and would later work out a way to use it to make money. The slow reaction of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) to deal with the data theft is in direct contrast to the vigorous efforts of watchdogs in Germany, France and even the Czech Republic. The fact that the Government was at the same time courting executives at Google opens up uncomfortable questions about its relationship with the company. Last month a report by the US media regulator the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revealed that the Google programmer who wrote the Street View software repeatedly warned that it collected personal data, and called for a legal and privacy review. Yesterday he was named as Marius Milner, 41, a British software engineer from Hove, East Sussex, who now lives in California. He has pleaded the fifth amendment against self-incrimination and refused to answer investigators’ questions. OCTOBER 2006: Computer engineer Marius Milner devises software for Google Street View vans which captures private information from personal computers. He warns there are privacy implications and the company should consult lawyers. MAY 2007: Google Street View launched in the US. 2008: Milner again warns two colleagues – including a senior manager – that personal data is being collected. MARCH 2009: Street View launches in the UK. EARLY 2010: UK data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner (ICO) launches inquiry into Street View. APRIL 27 2010: Google denies collecting information, only to admit a few days later: ‘We have been mistakenly collecting samples of data from open Wi-Fi networks ... Quite simply, it was a mistake’. OCTOBER 22 2010: Google admits: ‘In some instances entire emails were captured ... as well as passwords.’ NOVEMBER 2010: ICO secures formal undertaking that Google will improve data protection compliance but concludes any collection of personal data was ‘inadvertent’. JANUARY to SEPT 2011: Google refuses four times to co-operate with US Federal Communications Commission, before finally giving some key information such as names of employees who created Street View software. APRIL 16 2012: Google fined £15,000 by FCC after it found the company ‘wilfully and repeatedly’ failed to help with its investigation. APRIL 30 2012: FCC report finds that rather than being ‘a mistake’ Google’s software was ‘intended’ to harvest information from networks. MAY 27 2012: ICO indicates inquiry into Street View’s harvested data. Yesterday at the family home, his stepmother said: ‘He has always had a love of computers, even from an early age I think. He is a brilliant mind. 'He got a degree from Trinity College, Cambridge. My husband is an elderly man. He is nearly 90 and he is rather distressed by this. We really don’t want to say any more.’ The report by the FCC attacked Google for inadequate oversight of Street View, and claimed it was planning to use the data collected for other internal projects. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said it would examine what Google knew at the time and whether it breached the Data Protection Act. But critics said the ICO was doing ‘too little, too late’, and pointed to its earlier report into Street View which concluded that any collection of personal data was ‘inadvertent’. As Britain’s privacy watchdog was accused of being lily-livered in its handling of Google, regulators in the US and continental Europe confronted it head on. In Germany Google was forced to stop filming for Street View owing to privacy concerns by Hamburg prosecutors, who opened a criminal investigation. In France Google was fined £87,000 by the privacy regulator CNIL, the largest it had ever handed out. In the Czech Republic Street View was banned in September 2010 after negotiations between Google and the authorities over privacy concerns failed. A Tory MP said he would raise the issue of Google’s information gathering when Parliament reconvenes. Robert Halfon said: ‘The FCC report seems to indicate that there is far more to it than an innocent mistake. Clearly what happened is unacceptable. 'Google created the privatised surveillance society by hoovering up our emails and wifi data. Google has some serious questions to answer.’ Concern about links between the internet giant and the Government have emerged in recent weeks, with the Daily Mail revealing that Tory ministers have met Google executives an average of once every month since the General Election. Google Street View swivels around Parliament Square looking towards Big Ben. The bank of personal data collected could have been used by Google to develop new products . Earlier this month Google was fined £15,000 by the FCC after it found the company 'wilfully and repeatedly' violated orders to hand over information it requested while investigating Street View . This week Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt will face the Leveson Inquiry to face questions about his links to another multi-national company, News International. His special adviser Adam Smith was forced to quit after text messages were published by the inquiry showing his closeness to a News International lobbyist. Mr Hunt has also faced repeated calls to quit. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch said: ‘It appears Google deliberately and without remorse spied on people’s wi-fi networks and has now been caught trying to cover it up. 'The continued thirst of big-data companies for personal information is a serious threat to privacy and all too often consumers find themselves without redress when their rights are compromised.’ Guests of the Google bride: Close links between Google and the Conservative Party were on display this weekend at the society wedding of senior Google executive Naomi Gummer. Miss Gummer, a former political secretary to Jeremy Hunt, married Henry Allsopp, 38, in an Oxfordshire ceremony attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, as well as the embattled Culture Secretary, who came with his wife and their two young children . Big day: Bride Naomi Gummer, 27, with her husband Henry Allsopp, who married in Chadlington, Oxfordshire this weekend . A spokesman for the Information Commissioner said: ‘We are currently studying the FCC report to consider what further action, if any, needs to be taken. Google provided our office with a formal undertaking in November 2010 about their future conduct, following their failure in relation to the collection of wi-fi data by their Street View cars. ‘This included a provision for the ICO to audit Google’s privacy practices. The audit was published in August 2011 and we will be following up on it later this year, to ensure our recommendations have been put in place.’ Google spokesman Anthony House said: ‘We have always been clear that the leaders of this project did not want or intend to use this payload data. Indeed Google never used it in any of our products or services. ‘Both the Department of Justice and the FCC have looked into this closely – including reviewing the internal correspondence – and both found no violation of law.’","Work of Street View cars to be examined over allegations Google used them to download personal details .

"Corvettes that were once part of an artist's storied collection, but became dusty and fell into disrepair are being restored. The collection includes thirty-six sports vehicles that were released consecutively from 1953 to 1989 and once belonged to artist Peter Max, The New York Times reported. Max sold the cars to members of the Heller family this summer, who will eventually sell the vehicles in an auction, according to the newspaper. New start: Thirty-six corvettes, known collectively as the Peter Max Corvettes, have been sold to new owners . Historic: Pop Art figure Peter Max owned 36 Corvette models, released consecutively from 1953 to 1989 . Original owner: Dennis Amodeo originally won the Corvettes through a 1989 VH1 call-in contest - and was contacted by Max about potentially incorporating the cars into his artwork . Dennis Amodeo originally won the Corvettes through a 1989 VH1 call-in contest - and was contacted by Max about potentially incorporating the cars into his artwork, The Times reported. Hemmings Daily reported on Max's purchase from Amodeo, stating 'Amodeo received $250,000 in cash, $250,000 in Peter Max artwork and an agreement that if Max sold the collection at a future date, Amodeo would get a portion of the proceeds, up to an agreed upon cap of $1 million.' Though Max began his plans with the cars, they were placed on the backburner following various issues, including a tax fraud case, according to the The Times. Scott Heller, one of the Corvette collection's buyers, assisted in transporting the Corvettes to the Flatiron district parking after their original West 40th Street garage went on the market thirteen years ago, The Times reported. Up for grabs: Members of the Heller family, which purchased the Corvettes from Max, hope they are all auctioned off together . Secret treasure: The cars have been in Upper Manhattan since 2010, after being kept in both the Flatiron district then Prospect Heights . Soot: Many of the cars are dusty and have fallen into disrepair . The cars have been in Upper Manhattan since 2010, following a stay in a Prospect Heights garage, according to the news outlet. The Times reported that 'Scott Heller said that earlier this year he had offered to work with Mr. Max, restoring the cars for sale and splitting the proceeds. Mr. Max rejected the offer, he said. But Mr. Heller said that not long after, he was asked whether he wanted to buy the cars outright.' He reportedly bought the cars with his two sons and his cousin Peter Heller, according to the media outlet. Time travel: The Corvettes span a thirty-six year period of automobile design . Sporty: Artist Peter Max used to own all of the dusty Corvettes . The cars, many of which are damaged, include a 1953 vehicle that was only one of 300 produced, as well as vehicle from 1955 in which only 700 were produced, The Times reported. Chris Mazilli, who is working with the new Corvette owners, told the newspaper they are looking for all the cars to be purchased together. 'The biggest thing for use was rescuing the cars,' he told The Times. 'It was a good thing [the Heller family] came along. And they’re going to do the right thing.' Amodeo also told the newspaper 'I would like to see them out there when they’re done. That would be nice.'","Corvettes that were once part of an artist's storied collection, but became dusty and fell into disrepair are being restored .

"In light of the brutal rape and murder of two British students holidaying in Thailand, an Australian woman claims that she nearly met the same fate. Rather than staying on Koh Tao, the Melbourne woman was celebrating in Phuket after the wedding of a family member, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. She told local media a hotel security guard attempted to rape her on an isolated rocky beach near a five-star resort in the early hours of the morning. The woman also revealed she suspected her drink had been spiked after she started to feel disoriented and unwell after a late-night swim. An Australian woman claimed she was almost raped on a beach in Phuket, Thailand (not pictured) The security guard allegedly tried to lead the woman down a path towards a dark beach and away from her hotel, insisting that he was taking her in the right direction. 'I was still insisting I want to go this way and before I knew what was happening he put his arm around me and directed me towards the beach, so quickly I didn't have a chance to react ... all of a sudden I was on the beach and he kept pulling me towards the dark coconut palms,' the woman  revealed to Phuket-based news organisation Phuketwan. 'Before I knew it, he was on me, he was holding me, pushing and pushing. His face was on me, he was kissing me and touching me. ' The woman fought back, and luckily managed to escape back to her room, with some injuries. The Melbourne woman was celebrating at a five-star resort after a family member's wedding, when she was dragged away by a security guard . 'I was trying to kick him. I knew that I had to get out of there or I was going to get seriously raped. I screamed ""No! Get away from me! I go home now!"" I pushed him out of the way and ran back towards the party.' But she stayed on the island for a short period after in order to try and bring her alleged attacker to justice. The woman said she wanted to share her story to prevent other people meeting the same fate, from someone she presumed she could trust like a security guard. This comes soon after the brutal rape and murder of British backpacker Hannah Witherage, and the killing of David Miller on the resort island of Koh Tao. Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, were arrested in October for murders of British tourists Witheridge and Miller, but have since retracted their confessions, amid claims of torture.","Melbourne woman reveals terrifying moment 'she was almost raped'

"A Brooklyn woman is distraught after a cold-hearted thief drove off with her Audi with her  tiny Chihuahua puppy  still inside. Elani Pappas, 23, from Mill Basin said she feels sick that her little dog, Leo, has gone missing and is  desperate to get him back. ‘We just hope that the man didn’t harm him,’ she said. ‘We don’t want the car — we just want Leo.’ Best friends: Elani Pappas, 23, said she feels sick at the thought of her little dog Leo being taken by the thief . Missing: Leo the Chihuahua was inside the car when the vehicle was stolen at a gas station in Mill Basin . Pappas pulled into a gas station on Avenue U in Mill Basin for a minute before the car was swiped from right in front of her. ‘My puppy was in the car and I didn’t want him to get cold,’ she said. She left the car running and went inside the gas station to pay for her gas. ‘It was literally not even a minute,’ Pappas told The New York Post explaining how long she left her  puppy alone. The 23-year-old legal assistant said: ‘I threw 20 dollars on the attendant’s desk, and I said ‘20 dollars on pump six,’ and as soon as I was walking out I saw the man sitting in my car and he just took off!’ She said:‘I tried to run after him, but he started going like 60 miles an hour.’ Reward: Dozens of family members and friends have helped Pappas to hang up missing posters for the dog . Devastated: Pappas said she wouldn’t care if she did not ever find the car but just wants the dog back .

"Joanne Berry, 30, posed on websites such as Cougar Shag declaring she liked role play . A woman who used sex chatrooms to arrange a ‘stranger rape’ of a former work colleague has been convicted and ordered to undergo psychiatric tests. Office admin worker Joanne Berry, 30, posed on websites such as Cougar Shag declaring she liked role play and wanted to create ‘some sort of rape scenario’. But having told one man to knock at her door and ‘burst in’ she gave him the home address of another woman. Her innocent victim only discovered what was happening when the man arrived on her doorstep. Fortunately, he became suspicious and did not go through with the planned attack and apologised to the woman, saying he had been set up by ‘a very deranged person’. When Berry was arrested her computer was found to contain conversations with several men describing violent rape fantasies. One conversation, which included the victim’s address, said: 'Grab me by the neck and really scare and intimidate me. Interested? Then you basically have free rein.' University-educated Berry, of Grove Park, South London, denied putting a person in fear of violence between April and June 2012. She also denied assault with intent to commit a sexual offence, common assault and attempting to cause a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. She was convicted of all charges and will be sentenced on August 8. Judge David Griffith-Jones QC released her on bail from Maidstone Crown Court and said he wanted a psychiatric report before deciding her fate. Prosecutor Andrew Espley said Berry had become ‘slightly obsessed’ with her innocent victim and had sent her numerous texts daily. When Berry was arrested her computer was found to contain conversations with several men describing violent rape fantasies . Cougar: Berry used websites such as Cougar Shag (pictured) to set up the 'rape' Mr Espley said: 'Joanne Berry arranged for men to go around to the woman’s house and rape her. Luckily that did not happen. 'She . went on various sex chat websites, pretending to be the victim, gave . her address, used her name, gave the registration of her car which was . going to be parked outside and told men to come around to engage in a . fantasy rape game with her - basically to rape her.' Maidstone Crown Court in Kent (pictured) heard that she arranged for men to go round to (the victim's) house and rape her . He . said the woman also started getting text messages from strange men . asking: 'What’s going on?, Why aren’t you in? Why can’t I have a fantasy . rape with you?' One man called at her home and claimed to have been talking to her all day online.

"A New Jersey native and track star at an Ivy League University has been missing since Christmas and his family has blamed it on his deteriorating emotional state caused by the male enhancement supplements he was taking. Timothy Hamlett, a track star at the University of Pennsylvania, has been missing since December 26, and his mother Katherine Hamlett has no idea is he is alive or dead. Hamlett was last seen the day after Christmas wearing an Adidas track jacket, true religion jeans, and sneakers at around 6:30 p.m. Missing: Timothy Hamlett (pictured) , a track star at the University of Pennsylvania, has been missing since December 26, and his mother Katherine Hamlett has no idea is he is alive or dead . He allegedly lied to his parents and told them he was going to visit his friend nearby but then instead planned on visiting a friend in Manhattan. He took a Jitney but hasn't been seen since entering Manhattan. Hamlett’s mother and a neurologist confirmed in December that Timothy Hamlett's behavior had changed recently as a result of overuse of athletic supplements, reported CBS. 'Our son did not experience any issues until he started taking these supplements,' Katherine Hamlett told The Daily Beast. 'And people look at us cross-eyed and I know there’s a lot of skepticism. But if you look at the history he goes all the way through school—no issues whatsoever and then he starts taking these supplements and everything in his life, literally everything in his life changes.' Teaneck New Jersey Police said that Hamlett probably entered a park near West 174th street after getting off the jitney because both his iPhone and wallet turned up in the hands of local kids playing there. Changing behavior: 'After taking the cordyceps my son starting believing in these supplements and what he was doing,' said dad Archibald Hamlett who later said his son's behavior became 'schizophrenic' At 2:24 a.m. on December 31, both of Hamlett’s parents received phone calls from a blocked number. His mother said the phone calls were silent and that the police are currently trying to track the location of the blocked caller’s phone. A subway booth clerk at a subway station on 157th Street told the Hamlett family that she sold Hamlett a subway card around 8:00 a.m. on Saturday morning. She said she was confident it was him because he was not one of the regulars and she did not usually see young people at that hour of the morning. Parents Archibald and Katherine Hamlett believe that they would know where their son was had he not taken the supplements he began purchasing in 2013 following a sports injury. Pygeum, Cordyceps, and Ginseng Panax were among some of the herbal supplements Hamlett was taking, said his mother. Hamlett was also taking Vitalikor Male Enhancement, Big Jim, and Twins Male Enhancement Huge Penis Enlargement. 'What you’re taking is anybody’s guess,' Paul Offit, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told The Daily Beast. Mystery dissapearance: Timothy Hamlett, pictured with his mother Katherine and his father Acrhibald, is missing and his parents believe herbal supplements are to blame for his erratic behavior . 'You’re assuming what’s on the labels is in the bottles.' Edgar Miller, deputy director of Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, told The Daily Beast that herbal supplements can possibly make a person crazy and cause kidney and liver failure. 'Do a fistful of herbs and spices and supplements cause a psychosis? I don’t know these particular supplements,' he said. 'It sounded like some of them might be hormonally active and then the question is can hormones cause problems like that? Possibly,' he said. Hamlett's mother said that up until taking supplements that her son had a likable and warm personality and was known to make jokes. 'Something wasn’t right' his mother said. 'Now we’re looking at a person who is isolated. This was a supplement-induced psychosis.' Hamlett began taking supplements after being injured in a race against Harvard in 2013. 'Someone from Harvard spiked him,' his mother added. 'I can remember him distinctly calling me saying ‘I got injured. They’re taking care of me. But I got spiked.' Shortly after Hamlett was injured he began taking supplements like cordyceps, a fungus extracted from caterpillars in China. When Hamlett's father asked his son why he was taking it he replied, 'It’s not banned.' 'After taking the cordyceps my son starting believing in these supplements and what he was doing,' said dad Archibald Hamlett. Supplements: Shortly after Hamlett was injured he began taking supplements like cordyceps, a fungus extracted from caterpillars in China . 'He had gone from high school running a two-minute 800-meter to almost three years of training in less than a year,' Hamlett's dad continued. 'Some of the ones where it’s dietary or male enhancement—someone of his age wouldn’t need that,' the father said. 'But if you look at the situation where you need stamina and strength for long distances—these things give you some get-up-and-go or more fight and determination,' he added. Hamlett's dad said that his coach began adding pressure on him to perform which pushed him even further into his supplement addiction. 'He looked at Timothy as a prodigy and was expecting a lot out of him. And he was expecting a lot out of himself. That’s why he changed from the 400 to the 800. That’s a lot of pressure,' said his dad of the coach’s expectations. Soon after taking supplements Hamlett's grades declined and the family said they ordered an MRI of his brain to determine if there were any cysts. Hamlett's parents described his state as schizophrenic at times. 'He’s not engaging with his roommates. And he’s staying in the bathroom for long amounts of time. And talking to himself,' said his mother. Hamlett's mother said her son's memory also began slipping. 'What’s your name? What’s your major?' his mother recalled her son asking a friend. 'Then later in the conversation he asks again, what’s your major?’' Finally Hamlett's parents pulled him from the University of Pennsylvania and tried to get him help. In May of 2014 Hamlett was charged in a 'vandalism binge' that included shattering windows in nine homes and three parked cars in Teaneck Township in May, according to NorthJersey.com. In one vandalism case, an 18-year-old woman needed to get stitches after she was cut on the head by shattered glass when a brick was thrown through a window in her home. Hamlett's backpack came back positive for 'brick residue.' When asked if pending charges might cause Hamlett to run away, his lawyer Jason Foy said, 'this is not the case your run from.' Hamlett's parents hope that someday their son will return safely so they can get him the help he needs.","Timothy Hamlett, a track star at the University of Pennsylvania, has been missing since December 26 .

"Scientists claim they have found a ‘sixth sense’ which can detect light without the use of sight – and could even be a form of telepathy. They implanted detectors for invisible infrared light into the part of rats’ brains that control  tactile feeling. When the light was shone, the animals responded by preening their whiskers, indicating that they thought they were being touched. They soon began to detect the source of the ‘contact’ and move towards the signal. Trialling telepathy: Neurobiologist Miguel Nicolelis who has given rats a 'sixth sense' that enables them to detect invisible infrared light may have succeeded in getting animals to communicate with each other using only their minds . The team at Duke University, North Carolina, said that – for the first time in adult animals – their other senses were not affected but simply augmented. Neurobiologist Miguel Nicolelis said: ‘We didn’t use the skin to deliver this signal ... the animal is feeling light, not seeing light. It’s very interesting.’ He added the technology could one day be used to help the blind or to allow paralysed individuals to feel objects. Dr Nicolelis also claimed the  concept had been extended to ‘brain-to-brain interface’ meaning the rats could carry out a form of telepathy. Quizzed as to the exact nature of the research he declared: ‘It is an interface that no one has dreamed could be done.’ He added: ‘I’m not a Catholic, but I give you my word it is much better than the [announcement of a new] Pope’. Speaking about creating the ability in adult rats to touch infrared light, Dr Nicolelis said he hoped that one day the technology could be used to allow paralysed individuals who have been fitted with prosthetics to feel objects once again. ‘What we did here was to demonstrate that we could create a new sense in rats by allowing them to “touch” infrared light that mammals cannot detect,’ he said. 'No one dreamed it could be done': Neurobiologist Miguel Nicolelis said he hoped that one day the technology could be used to allow paralysed individuals who have been fitted with prosthetics to feel objects once again . In the experiment, published in the journal Nature Communications and announced at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual conference in Boston, six rats were fitted with the infrared detectors. When the lights were turned on, the rodents began preening their whiskers, indicating they thought they were being touched. But they soon began to interpret where the source of the ‘touch’ came from and moved towards the signal. ‘They are learning. At the start they are rubbing their whiskers with their forepaws,’ said Dr Nicolelis. ‘After a few weeks they develop the scanning behaviour, scanning the head in search for the light, but now it’s not something that bothers them in terms of their whiskers. ‘It’s like driving a car or riding a bike. My suspicion is that these animals are feeling touch, it's different from regular touch in that he is projecting the feeling of touch, not from his body, but to the external world.’ In future, the technique indicated humans who cannot see because the part of their brain responsible for sight is damaged could be helped through a device implanted in another part. Co-author Eric Thomson said: ‘The philosophy of the field of brain-machine interfaces has until now been to attempt to restore a motor function lost to lesion or damage of the central nervous system. ‘This is the first paper in which a neuroprosthetic device was used to augment function, literally enabling a normal animal to acquire a sixth sense.’","Scientist Miguel Nicolelis implanted infrared detectors into rodents' brains .

"A week-long heatwave along the Northeast Corridor is set to push the mercury far into the 90s from Monday, giving no respite from the weekend's stifling heat. Heat index values - temperatures mixed with humidity - are expected to pass 100 degrees in cities including Philadelphia on Monday, with temperatures staying around 90 degrees even throughout the night. As the East Coast braces for a scorching week, the National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for the tri-state area, including New York City, most of Connecticut, Rhode Island, western parts of Boston and up into New Hampshire. Chilling out: Skye Stabley Numidia, Pennsylvania does what she can to cool off as highs exceeded 90 Monday across the Mid-Atlantic . Middle ground: Chad Ohman takes advantage of the warm day to fish from a kayak on the Mississippi River Monday. A heat wave rages to the East and storms brew to the south while Mississippi Valley temperatures hover in the 80s . Providence, New York City, . Philadelphia and Washington will see temperatures averaging in the . mid-90s and could see the heat index values in the low 100s - the . hottest week of the year so far. The . searing heat will be accompanied by largely stagnant, windless . conditions, leaving Northeasterners without so much as an occasional . cool breeze to take their minds off the heat. For New York City and southern . New England, this qualifies as a heat wave, which is three . or more days with highs in the 90s. A trend expected to stretch into seven days. A . heat advisory is also in effect for northern and central New Jersey and . parts of southeastern Pennsylvania, and an excessive heat warning is in . effect for Philadelphia and Trenton. Making a splash: Joey Pavelack of Enfield Connecticut pops up before being totally immersed in the cooling rapids of the Scantic River . Searing: Lifeguard Lena Alessi watches as young swimmers beat the heat at Knickerbocker Lake on Monday in Kinderhook, New York. A searing heat wave will grip the Northeast through Sunday . Plunge: As temperatures rose into the 90s, Jacob Marinock of Drums, Pennsylvania cooled off with a dip . According to CBS News, a . heat advisory is announced when the heat and humidity combine to make . it feel like at least 95 degrees out for two days on end or, . alternatively, if the heat index reaches 100 to 104. Be advised, this week’s heat wave will offer both. ‘It's . going to be very hot and humid this week,’ said New York Mayor Michael . Bloomberg. ‘The weather can be dangerous, especially for those without . air conditioning, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. There are about 425 cooling centers that we have open around the city . for those needing relief from the heat.' This overwhelming heat wave is expected to last until Sunday, when temperatures will drop to an average of the mid-80s. Respite: A firefighter in Scranton, Pennsylvania takes a break to cool off with a wet towel. On Monday, temperatures in the area and across much of the East Coast easily surpassed 90 degrees . Fire with fire: As they battled a house fire Monday, Scranton, Pennsylvania firefighters fought the blazing heat, too. Conditions aren't expected to improve for a full week . A cold front will . gradually shove the hot, humid air to the south later this week, first nudging it from . the southern Great Lakes on Friday and then the Ohio Valley and Northeast . this weekend. It is caused by a large dome . of high pressure in the upper atmosphere, the Weather Channel said. It . means that temperatures are 10 degrees above average. People . living in the affected areas should be careful to drink enough water . and should avoid strenuous activity in the middle of the day. They . should also wear hats and sunscreen lotion. Lasting: This week is expected to bring more of the devastating temperatures seen Monday in a heat wave that's expected to pummel the East Coast with the summer's hottest days yet . Dangerous: Heat advisories were issued across the East Coast Monday during what is only the start of a dangerous heat wave expected to hold much of the country hostage for a week .

"A fifth of workers believe they will never have enough money to retire, a report warns today. The study by HSBC found a third of people were ‘not preparing adequately’ for their retirement, with another third saving nothing at all. It warns that Britain must prepare for the ‘Age of the Unretired’. Money worries: An HSBC study has found a fifth of workers believe they will never have enough money to retire . Pensions minister Steve Webb last night insisted Government reforms of the pension system would help people to save more, particularly those on low incomes. But he added: ‘It is certainly true that this generation will have to work longer than their parents … We need to get people starting to think about their retirement much sooner, instead of the culture of “panic at 50” which we’ve had until now. ‘Under-saving is a chronic problem in this country and has been for decades – it cannot be turned around overnight. People need to start saving earlier, save more and, yes, work for longer – there are not many other options.’ HSBC research shows the UK fares badly when it comes to saving for retirement. On average British workers think their savings will run out barely a third of the way through their retirement. Workers in the United States think their savings will fund two thirds of their retirement, while those in Australia, Mexico and China think they have saved enough to pay for at least half. Today's study found only two per cent of people plan to get a job to boost an inadequate income during retirement . Former government pensions adviser Ros Altmann said: ‘People are going to have to save more but they are also going to have to work a bit longer too.’ But today’s study found only 2 per cent of people plan to get a job to boost an inadequate income during retirement. Meanwhile, 44 per cent said they were ‘resigned to the idea they will just never be able to make up the shortfall’. In Britain, just seven per cent of people said they hoped to set up a new business in retirement, compared to a global average of 27 per cent. Christine Foyster, head of wealth management at HSBC, said: 'People want to slow down in later life and while some may welcome the chance to remain economically active, many may not. 'Whereas some people regard a comfortable retirement as a natural entitlement, for a growing number it is not.’","HSBC study finds a third were 'not preparing adequately' for retirement .

"Jean-Claude Juncker launched a bizarre defence of the Luxembourg tax-dodging scandal yesterday, insisting he was not to blame despite having been its prime minister for 18 years. The scandal engulfing the new European Commission President and arch-federalist deepened after a disastrous press conference in which he attempted to claim it was not his fault. Mr Juncker told journalists that he was ‘not the architect of what you could call the Luxembourgish problem’. ‘There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe,’ he added. Can't hear your over all my avoidance: Jean-Claude Juncker claims there is no conflict of interest as the European Commission begins to investigate tax deals between international corporations and Luxembourg, deals which were made while he was prime minister . But Mr Juncker was either prime minister or finance minister of the country for more than two decades from the mid-90s. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘I would be surprised if he was in charge of the country and didn’t know what was going on. I don’t know what’s worse – being in charge and turning a blind eye to aggressive tax avoidance or being in charge and not knowing what’s going on. You wouldn’t want to have someone in charge of the EU who didn’t know what’s going on. He has got some very serious questions to answer.’ It was reported last week that Luxembourg had granted secret deals to 340 companies allowing them to avoid tax. It helped them avoid paying billions in tax elsewhere and was agreed at the time when Mr Juncker was in charge of the country. He said yesterday it was up to the Luxembourg government to explain its behaviour. Bizarrely, he also appeared to blame the problems in Luxembourg on Britain and other countries in Europe blocking tax harmonisation across the continent. King of the 'magical fairyland': Other EU countries may have missed out on billions of euros in tax revenues while Luxembourg became one of the world’s richest because of the sweetheart deals . He suggested that tax rates that ‘can sometimes lack fairness’, a problem caused by countries such as the UK not wanting to give up sovereignty over taxation. ‘If there is insufficient tax harmonisation in Europe then this can be the result,’ he said. Mr Juncker admitted that as prime minister he was ‘politically responsible’ for what happened in each and every corner of the country’, but indicated he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated. Companies such as Burberry and Dyson had their divisions in Luxembourg lend money to their operations in other countries. The interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries. In some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the Grand Duchy. Reports about the tax breaks surfaced last week, putting Juncker, who only took office on November 1, immediately in the firing line given the European Union's headline commitment to fighting tax fraud. Tory MP Stewart Jackson called for Mr Juncker to resign. He said: ‘His position is untenable. The issue of corporate tax avoidance has been high on the UK agenda because of Amazon, Google and Starbucks. The sweet heart deals of countries such as Luxembourg sit at odds with a Commission President who says that he supports widespread economic and financial reform.’ Spilling the beans: Companies such as Heinz had their divisions in Luxembourg lend money to their operations in other countries, leak says . Patrick O’Flynn, Ukip’s economics spokesman, said: ‘The EU actually facilitates tax avoidance by enabling multinational corporations to channel earnings through whichever member state they want. ‘Luxembourg was happy to do dirty dealings with the big corporations to maximise its revenues at the cost of tens of billions of pounds that should have ended up in the UK public realm. ‘Juncker has lots of questions to answer. It’s why multinationals are so keen on EU membership but why it is not in the UK’s interest.’ Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said Mr Juncker had ‘presided over the biggest exploitation of European nations in his own little country for decades’. The Labour MP, who has been one of the fiercest critics of tax avoidance by companies such as Starbucks, Google and Amazon, said: ‘I think he should come clean and talk about it, certainly try to explain it. How can we know he’s working in the interest of Europe when as prime minister in Luxembourg he has exploited populations in every European country and elsewhere for decades?’ The Commission has launched a series of investigations into tax arrangements in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg on the grounds they might infringe state aid rules by unfairly favouring some companies over others. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has promised to press on with the probes and Juncker earlier said he would let the process take its course, as it should. However, questions about his role in deals which are technically legal but go against the grain at a time of austerity, refuse to go away. On Wednesday, Juncker turned up at the Commission's midday press conference unannounced, only for journalists to question his credibility and suitability as head of the EU's key executive arm. 'I'm as suitable as you are,' Juncker replied to one journalist. Juncker said that as head of the Commission he could no longer comment on Luxembourg's affairs. Some 22 of the 28 EU states had similar tax arrangements, he said, and the issue was to ensure that they did not violate state aid rules.","Luxembourg did tax break deals with more than 300 global firms .

"A 30-mile car chase ended with a 16-year-old joyrider smashing into another car - a few inches from two top newsreaders. The bizarre coincidence happened yesterday in the west London district of Hammersmith, home to BBC veteran Kate Silverton and her Sky News rival Isabel Webster. Ms Webster, 32, said it was a miracle no one was killed in the drama, which ended in the 16-year-old being arrested and another driver being taken to hospital. Scroll down for video . Debris: Two rival newsreaders, the BBC's Kate Silverton and Sky's Isabel Webster, were inches from a horror crash by London's Hammersmith Bridge (above) which left one driver needing hospital treatment . Damage: A 16-year-old boy was arrested after the crash (pictured) and remained in police custody . Coincidence: Rival newsreaders Kate Silverton (left) and Isabel Webster of Sky News' breakfast show both witnessed the crash. Ms Webster, who presents alongside Eamonn Holmes, said it was a miracle no one died . Police began a chase in Salfords, Surrey - near Gatwick Airport - and scrambled several cars and a helicopter before it ended beside west London's Hammersmith Bridge at 1pm yesterday. The VW Passat, which had been chased by a convoy of officers along the A3 into London, smashed into a Vauxhall Astra behind Sunrise presenter Ms Webster's car. The Passat spun five times across the road, passing within inches of Ms Webster's car, while the driver of the Astra had to be taken to hospital with neck injuries. By chance the crash was also witnessed by BBC veteran Ms Silverton, 44, as she walked with her three-year-old daughter and pushed her four-month-old baby in a pram. The 'dazed' driver of the Passat - which Ms Webster said had been travelling at up to 70mph - remained shocked in his car before escaping on foot. He was later arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and is still being questioned by police. Under arrest: Police escort a young driver from the scene after a car chase which had lasted for 30 miles . Investigation: Police declared the area a crime scene as they examined the Passat and the Astra yesterday . Horror: Ms Webster said the crash left the driver of the car which was hit covered in blood. He was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, with neck injuries which were not thought to be life-threatening . Ms Webster, who presents the breakfast show alongside Eamonn Holmes, told MailOnline she was being dropped off at Hammersmith station by her husband Liam Pearce when the incident happened. 'It was one of those moments when you think ""one of my nine lives has been used up"",' she said. 'I think it's a miracle no one was killed. The guy was completely crazy, all over the place. 'We were pulling out of the road when the crash happened and the car the got hit was behind us. The Passat spun round about five times and ended up face to face with us. 'There was debris everywhere and we were right in the middle of it all. 'We went to help the guy in the car before realised he was being chased by police. He was in the car with the airbag up, his head back and his eyes were rolling back. He then got out the car and ran. 'We then turned our attention to this other guy, the driver of the car that got hit, who got dragged out of his car. 'He was on his knees and covered in blood. It's a miracle he didn't get killed. 'It happened so fast - a huge noise and impact and you kind of process it what's happened afterwards and realise it could have been a lot worse. My thoughts are with him and his family.' The driver of the Astra was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, with neck injuries which were not thought to be life-threatening. Hammersmith Bridge was also closed  as the debris was cleared up. Ms Webster said the incident had made her look at news reporting differently. She said: 'I reported the worst ever motorway crash, on the M5 in Bristol on Bonfire Night, and I was on the side of the road for several days but I guess this is the first time I've been a bit too close for comfort. Damage: The front of the Astra was left wrecked in the crash, and the driver had to be taken to hospital . Cleanup: The road was closed as dozens of witnesses gathered at the scene to help those affected . 'As a journalist you report on the most horrendous things and it's just part of the job. But when it's ""real life"" it's totally different and makes you think about how you report these things.' She and Ms Silverton live in the same area of west London, but have never met socially. 'We messaged on Twitter and we will probably be quite pally through this,' she said. 'I saw that she tweeted about it so I sent her a message saying ""glad you're okay"". We were both a bit shaken up.' A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'At around 12.20pm yesterday, a VW Passat failed to stop for a marked police car in the Salfords area of Surrey. 'A pursuit followed which involved a number of Surrey Police vehicles and a police helicopter. 'The VW Passat travelled onto the A3 and into the London area where the Metropolitan Police joined and led the pursuit. 'A collision subsequently occurred in the Richmond area and a 16-year-old youth was arrested nearby on suspicion of dangerous driving. He was later transferred into custody in Surrey and enquiries are currently ongoing.' A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 1.05pm to reports of a collision between two cars. We sent an ambulance crew to the scene and treated a man for a neck injury. He was taken as a priority to St George's Hospital in Tooting.'","BBC's Kate Silverton and Sky's Isabel Webster witnessed horror crash .

"A woman and a girl died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning yesterday after being found on a boat with ‘serious breathing difficulties’. A male family member who was with them remains seriously ill in hospital. The emergency services, including two air ambulances, were called to the private boat on Windermere in the Lake District, where the three were treated by paramedics. Injuries: The boat where all three victims were found, a 36-year-old and her 10-year-old daughter, who both died Monday afternoon, and one man, who remains in hospital, was moored by the middle jetty by Lake Windemere . Vessel: The boat where the victims were found is believed to be a Bayliner, a luxury boat with a diesel engine (pictured is a boat of the same model on Lake Windemere) It is believed the three family members raised the alarm themselves after experiencing breathing difficulties.

"'I betrayed my country': Christine Keeler, pictured last year . The woman at the centre of one of Britain's most notorious Cold War spy scandals has admitted for the first time that she betrayed her country. Fifty years after the Profumo affair erupted, Christine Keeler, now 71, has confessed she played a role in a high-placed spy ring. Keeler claims she helped her friend, osteopath Stephen Ward - whose clients included Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor - ­uncover secrets about missile ­movements in the West that were later passed to the Soviets. In a new book, she says: 'However I dress it up, I was a spy and I am not proud of it. The truth is that I betrayed my country. 'I tried to block it out – I was too . scared. Just by admitting that for the first time I have freed myself of . an ­enormously heavy emotional ­burden.' The scandal hit the headlines after seven shots were fired at a house in a quiet Marylebone mews by a jilted boyfriend of Keeler in December 1962. It then emerged the then 19-year-old Keeler had been sleeping with former Secretary of State for War John Profumo, then 48, and a handsome Russian spy Yevgeny Ivanov. The orgy-loving playboy Ward, it seemed, was the ringmaster who introduced everyone. But when . news of the Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov love triangle broke 18 months later, . Profumo lied to the House of Commons about his affair. He was soon . found out and Keeler sold her story to the News of The World for £23,000. In June . 1963, he quit in disgrace, amid allegations Keeler had been asked by . Ivanov to discover from the War Minister when the West Germans might . receive U.S. nuclear missiles to be stationed on their soil. Profumo had been a rising star of the Tory Party, close to Prime Minister Harold . Macmillan, a favoured visitor at Buckingham Palace, a war hero and the . dashing husband of actress Valerie . Hobson, one of the great beauties of her day. But Keeler, whose other lovers have included A-Team . actor George Peppard, legendary womaniser Warren Beatty and Prisoner of . Zenda star Douglas Fairbanks Jr, says the Establishment was far more interested in painting it as a sex scandal and chose to ignore claims of a widespread spying network. Quoted in the Sunday Mirror, Keeler says: 'I know the truth and it is far more shocking than what the public has been fed by the British Establishment. Sex was a game - spying was a serious business. 'Far better that the Establishment be caught with its pants down than involved in stealing secrets. That was the thinking.' Dr Stephen Ward and Christine Keeler (bottom left) with friends Grundie Heiber and Sally Norrie (right) Heart of the scandal: John Profumo (left), the War Minister who resigned after his affair with Keeler (right) wrecked his career and marriage . Christine Keeler (right) and Mandy Rice Davies leave the Old Bailey after the first day of the Ward trial concerning the Profumo scandal . The consequences for the Tory party were catastrophic and Macmillan's Cabinet was shaken by the revelations. Tales of organised orgies followed, including whipping parties at a house in Mayfair where, it was said, one of the guests became over-excited and died of a heart attack. Lord Denning released the government's official report on September 25, 1963, and the Prime Minister stepped down due to ill-health not long after. The Tories were then voted out the following year. The Profumo affair was considered emblematic of the early 1960s, a time when the traditional British way of life was rapidly being replaced by modern customs. John Profumo was forced to resign as Secretary of State for War in 1963 after it emerged that he had lied to Parliament about his relationship with model and showgirl Christine Keeler. The Conservative minister was 27 years older than his lover, and was married to actress Valerie Hobson. The scandal was even believed to endanger national security when it was revealed that Ms Keeler was also having an affair with Soviet spy Yevgeny Ivanov, as well as notorious drug dealer Johnny Edgecombe. When Harold Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister later that year, his decision was widely thought to be linked to the fall-out from the affair. Profumo, who died in 2006, devoted the rest of his life to rehabilitating his reputation through charity work. Keeler said her spying had begun in . 1961, before she even met ­Profumo. She says Ward asked her to deliver . an envelope to the Russian Embassy in London. He told her Yevgeny Ivanov . was expecting it for their bridge game. But Keeler is now convinced she unwittingly helped pass on ­secrets that could have ultimately harmed the country. On July 8, 1961, Ward took her to . Cliveden House, Buckinghamshire – the ancestral pile owned by Lord Astor . – where Profumo first showed his ­interest in her after seeing her . ­swim naked. According to her book, Keeler claims . Ward used that first ­meeting to steal secret letters from Profumo's . briefcase, detailing the delivery of nuclear ­weapons to ­Germany. Her affair with Profumo began days . later and she claims Ward immediately asked her to find out through . pillow talk when the nuclear warheads were ­being moved to Germany. In December 1962, the . police were called to Ward's home when another of Christine's ex-lovers, . ­Johnny Edgecombe, fired shots at the lock while she and showgirl . pal Mandy Rice-Davies cowered inside. The . police investigation led to Ward's arrest and charges for living off . immoral earnings and the revelation of Christine's affair with . Profumo. Ward committed suicide before a verdict in the case was reached. She was sentenced to six months in jail for perjury. She said she was a 'stupid young girl' and did not fully understand she was doing anything to harm her country. Speaking . of Ward, Keeler said she was recruited by 'a clever, ­charismatic but . dangerous man' and admitted she was flattered by the attention she got . from Profumo, who had a 'natural style' about him. * Secrets and Lies, by Christine Keeler and Douglas Thompson, is published by John Blake and is out now.","Keeler, now 71, claims she helped friend Stephen Ward uncover secrets .

"An American man who served in Iraq but later deserted because he believed the conflict breached international law, could win the right to claim asylum in the European Union, according to the bloc's top court.

Shepherd was deployed to Iraq in 2004 to maintain Apache helicopters, as seen above; he re-enlisted in 2005 but later decided the war was illegal and deserted rather than following an order to return there in 2007 . He re-enlisted in 2005, but later decided the war was illegal and failed to go to Iraq when ordered to do so in 2007. Mr Shepherd, who was based in Germany, unsuccessfully sought asylum there, then later appealed the decision. Before reaching a decision, a German court sought clarifications on several points of EU asylum law from the European Court of Justice. When they receive those opinions, the court will then decide on Mr Shepherd's case. An opinion on the case by Advocate General Eleanor V.E. Sharpston yesterday isn't binding on the European Court of Justice, but the court generally follows such recommendations, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, she said it was up to the German court to examine the case and decide whether the punishment Mr Shepherd would face if convicted, would act as an act or persecution. The European court didn't have enough evidence to rule on that, the advocate general said. Another central question in EU asylum law was whether there was a reasonable likelihood the person deployed to a war zone would be involved in war crimes, her opinion said. The German court would also need to answer that. Sherpherd's lawyer said his client only agreed to re-enlist after being told he wouldn't be sent back to Iraq . Mrs Sharpston said: 'What matters is the likelihood that the applicant risks committing war crimes. It is not necessary to establish beyond reasonable doubt that violations of international criminal law can be expected to occur,' she said. Even though Mr Shepherd was in a noncombat role, she said the right to claim asylum because of war crimes should apply to him. She said it wasn't relevant in this case that Mr. Shepherd didn't apply for conscientious objection to U.S. authorities because that wouldn't have stopped his redeployment. The European Court of Justice usually takes three to six months to make a final ruling. Mr Shepherd's lawyer, Reinhard Marx, said the opinion backed the arguments he was already making. He said client, currently living in Davaria, could face up to 18 months jail in the U.S for desertion and had only agreed to re-enlist after being told his unit wouldn't be sent back to Iraq. The case is the first dealing with an asylum request for a U.S military employee in the EU, Mr Marx said. Rates of desertion in the U.S.increased significantly during the Iraq war. In 2007 nine in every 1,000 soldiers deserted during that financial year. The rates, however, were significantly higher during the Vietnam War.","André Lawrence Shepherd served in Iraq in 2004 in a noncombat role .

"A tearful woman bids farewell to her loved one at Paddington Station in 1942; elsewhere, young boys leap over gravestones as they use a Glasgow cemetery as a post-war playground. These striking images form part of a retrospective celebrating the work of renowned photographer Bert Hardy, who would have been 100 this year. Hardy, who died in 1995, is best known for his assignments at Picture Post magazine between 1941 and 1957. A woman bids farewell at Paddington Station in 1942 as a train pulls away. This is one of the haunting images taken by Bert Hardy, who is the subject of a retrospective at the Photographers' Gallery in Soho . A group of boys from the deprived Gorbals district of Glagow play among the gravestones of the Corporation Burial Ground in 1948 . A young boy blowing up a balloon in Gorbals in 1948. Hardy, who died in 1995, is best known for his assignments at Picture Post magazine between 1941 and 1957 . The Gorbals tenements were built quickly and cheaply in the 1840s, providing housing for Glasgow's burgeoning population of industrial workers. Conditions were appalling; overcrowding was standard and sewage and water facilities inadequate. The tenements housed about 40,000 people with up to eight family members sharing a single room, 30 residents sharing a toilet and 40 sharing a tap. Redevelopment of the area began in the late 1950s and the tenements were replaced with a modern tower block complex in the sixties. He covered the London Blitz, D-Day landings and the liberation of both Paris and the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Now, an exhibition of his work will be shown at The Photographers' Gallery in Soho, from next Thursday, to coincide with his centenary. The pictures on display will focus on ordinary people going about their daily lives during and after the Second World War - including the poor district of Gorbals in Glasgow. Often referred to as Europe's worst slum, Gorbals was filled with low-quality housing and street gangs were rife. Despite this, Hardy managed to capture the cheeky playfulness of urchins as they made the best of the hand fate had dealt them. Men at a social club in Gorbals in 1948.

Born in London to a working-class family in May 1913, Hardy was the eldest of seven children. After leaving school at the age of 14, he got a job as a messenger, which saw him collecting and delivering film and prints for West End chemists. Bitten by the photography bug, he bought his first camera for 50p from a pawn shop and had his first big break when he snapped King George V and Queen Mary passing by in a carriage down Blackfriars Road. The enterprising youngster printed off 200 postcards and sold them to friends and neighbours.

"When Ivan Waterson was walking his dog on the beach, the last thing he expected was a three metre crocodile charging at them. The 56-year-old, from Wulagi, north of Darwin in the Northern Territory, took his border collie named 'Friday' on their regular walks along Rapid Creek beach about 7pm on Sunday. But after letting Friday go for a swim in the water to wash off the sand, Mr Waterson noticed just the eyes of a submerged saltwater crocodile about 30 metres from his dog and moving quickly toward him. Ivan Waterson was walking his dog, named Friday on a beach when he noticed the crocodile coming at them . ‘I couldn’t see what it was so I thought I’d check it out because it looked like a fish on the surface,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘They are very smart creatures and it had its whole body submerged the whole time and all you could see were those little eyes coming at you. ‘It was coming straight at us really fast and we had to run right off the sand before it spun around and went straight back into the water.' Mr Waterson was walking back towards the bridge when he happened to turn around and notice the reptile before other beach goers alerted what they had saw. ‘People on the other side of the creek were screaming out: “Watch your dog!”,' he said. ‘It happened to stalk us at the time and it would have come from behind us and got the dog. If I hadn’t seen it, it would’ve been a whole different story. ‘I also warned the fishermen to get off the bank at the time because he was right on the edge of the water.' The quick-thinking man noticed the submerged three-metre crocodile moving really quickly towards them from 30 metres away . But Mr Waterson said this wasn’t the first time the crocodile had 'targeted' the pair. Two months ago, he was walking with his wife, daughter and Friday, when they had a similar encounter. ‘Friday was chasing rocks under the water and we made sure he played in the shallow end. 'Just as we started walking back, my daughter said something in the water looked like a croc. 'We kept an eye on it and it didn't worry us too much but it started following us for a good 200 metres before it stopped and sort of sat there. ‘I did go back there after to take the dog for a run and as soon as it saw Friday, it made a beeline for him because it obviously wanted the dog - a dog is a bit of a delicacy for the crocs.' A three-metre saltwater crocodile was spotted along Rapid Creek beach in Darwin on Sunday evening . Mr Waterson has been a regular Rapid Creek visitor for 15 years and said the incidents haven’t changed his mind about going back there. ‘It doesn’t stop me from going back there but I am always alert and aware,' he said. Mr Waterson added: ‘What worries me are the kids who are playing near the water or new people who don’t have an understanding of swimming at the beach. ‘You need to be aware because they’re very fast creatures but the odds of taking someone is slim. ‘There have been two reports of crocs in the Rapid Creek area around this time of year but no one has been taken by one – they’d take a dog before taking anyone else.'","Ivan Waterson was walking his dog on a beach when he noticed the croc .

"The Indian doctor responsible for the mass-sterilisation which left 13 women dead and dozens hospitalised, used rusty instruments to perform the operations. R.K. Gupta, is accused of having carried out  83 tubectomies in just three hours at a state-run 'family planning camp' in the Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh state on Saturday. A majority of the women fell ill shortly afterwards, and local government officials admit the equipment used was rusty and medicines provided to the women were contaminated. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: 13 women have died and dozens remain in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in India, which was carried out with rusty instruments and contaminated medicines . 'Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery,' said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district where the camp was held. The death toll has now reached 13, dozens  remain in hospital and 20 are critically ill. The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines. Dr Gupta's mass sterilisation took less than three hours with the help of two assistants working in a dirty, abandoned private hospital, officials said, and contravened government guidelines to limit such operations to 30 a day. 'Preliminary reports show that the medicines administered were spurious and also the equipment used was rusted,' senior local government official Siddharth Komal Singh Pardeshi said. Recovery: Victims of surgeries lie on hospital beds after 13 women lost their lives in sterilization operations in Bilaspur, Chattisgarh, India . Government mass sterilization camps are held regularly in Chhattisgarh and other states as part of a long-running effort to control India's booming population . An Indian woman who underwent sterilisation surgery is carried on a stretcher for treatment at the CIMS hospital in Bilaspur, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh . Tubectomies were carried out on 83 women by a single doctor in a government-run 'family planning camp' A seven-member team of doctors from New Delhi arrived in the district of Bilaspur on Wednesday to investigate what went wrong, and the local government registered with the police a case of causing death by negligence against Gupta. Local media said Gupta blamed medicine the women had been later given and denied making any mistakes. The 83 women who underwent tubectomies at the camp received . incentive payments of 1,400 rupees ($23) to have the surgery, . according to R.K. Bhange, Bilaspur's chief medical officer. Health workers also got 200 ($3.25) rupees for bringing a woman . to the camp. The cause of the deaths of the eight women had not been . determined, according to Bhange, but he said they had been . vomiting before they died. Senior state health officials have been sent to investigate. 'As of now, the government has not found any evidence of . negligence,' said Bhange. He said the government doctors who had . performed the surgeries were experienced in the procedure. Deaths due to sterilization are not a new problem in India, . where more than four million sterilizations were performed in . 2013-14, according to the government. Between 2009 and 2012, the government paid compensation for . 568 deaths resulting from sterilization, the health ministry . said in an answer to a question in parliament two years ago.

Local media reports that all the women involved had been operated on within a five hour window . Authorities in eastern India came under fire last year after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation. The women had all undergone surgical procedures at a hospital that local officials said was not equipped to accommodate such a large number of patients. Health advocates worry that paying women to undergo . sterilization at family planning camps is both dangerous and, by . default, limits their contraceptive choices. 'The payment is a form of coercion, especially when you are . dealing with marginalized communities,' said Kerry McBroom, . director of the Reproductive Rights Initiative at the Human . Rights Law Network in New Delhi. She said basic care at the camps is often inadequate, with . surgeries rushed through in unhygienic conditions. Pratap Singh, commissioner of Chhattisgarh's Department of . Health and Family Welfare, said  the state's . sterilization program was entirely voluntary. The United Nations expressed concern. 'If the facts are confirmed, then a grave human tragedy has . occurred,' said Kate Gilmore, deputy executive director of the . U.N. Population Fund.

"A pair 17,000-year-old skeletons have been brought to life by a sculptor who has spent seven years creating silicone models of them by studying their pre-historic bones. Elisabeth Daynes has created 'Chancelade Man' and the 'Woman of the Pataud Shelter' based on remains found in France's Dordogne region in the 18th millennium BC. Ms Daynes became an expert in palaeontology after starting out as a make-up artist and creator of masks at the Theatre North in Lille. The silicone reconstruction of the 'Chancelade Man' created by artist Elisabeth Daynes, which is a reconstruction of a pre-historic human . The creation by Ms Daynes, right, which was based on studying his bones, shows a grey and balding man with blue eyes and wrinkled skin . Now she says she gives flesh to the faces and bodies of fossils from all ages of evolution, some from millions of years ago through a collaboration of forensic science, anthropology and art. The skeleton of the 'Chancelade Man', measuring 188cm tall, was discovered in 1888 in the south-west of the country with a curved posture, below the floor of a rock shelter. After years of studying casts of the skeleton's skull as well as carrying out detailed anthropometric surveys, Ms Daynes has created a silicone reconstruction of what the man would have looked like. The silicone reconstruction of a pre-historic female showing her with brown eyes and a rounded face and wearing an animal skin stole . The bones of the woman were discovered in France's Dordogne region and date back more than 17,000 years . And the result is a grey and balding looking man with blue eyes and wrinkled skin, who has been created in a pose similar to that of Rodin's 'The Thinker'. Ms Daynes, who creates he models in her Paris apartment, said: 'My work is done just like a forensic investigation from casts of skulls, which are reconstituted exactly as composite sketches by police. 'These anthropometric surveys deliver a wealth of information such as age and sex.' As well as the 'Chancelade Man', Ms Daynes has also created a female version of a pre-historic human based on the skeleton of a woman also found in the Dordogne region. The silicone model shows a woman, who is thought to have died aged 20 with brown eyes and a rounded face. An exhibition entitled 'Chairs de Orgines' in Bordeaux is where the two silicone models will be on show . The skin coyote stole worn by the female model is also a close representation of what a pre-historic woman would have worn, although she admits the dreadlocks and skin markings are her artistic impressions. She explained: 'My art is a synthesis between scientific observation and imagination.' The models are set to go on show in a exhibition entitled 'Chairs des Origins - our ancestors as you've never seen'. The exhibition will be displayed at a gallery in Bordeaux until December 5.","Elisabeth Daynes has created two life-size models of pre-historic humans .

"The NHS will today be warned it must save up to £10billion a year by cutting down on expensive agency staff and selling off land. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will tell NHS managers they need to spend money more efficiently to ensure the service is sustainable and improve frontline care.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will tell NHS managers they need to spend money more efficiently to ensure the service is sustainable and improve frontline care . ‘If we are to be truly financially sustainable we need to rethink how we spend money in a much more fundamental way,’ he will say. Mr Hunt will say reducing ‘avoidable harm’ to patients will save £2.5billion a year from the cost of further treatment and negligence claims, while minimising prescription errors could save £551million. Better acquisition of services and goods could also deliver £1.5billion of savings on the £15billion annual NHS procurement budget by next year. Mr Hunt will say reducing ‘avoidable harm’ to patients will save £2.5billion a year from the cost of further treatment and negligence claims, while minimising prescription errors could save £551million . He will insist that private agency staff bills – which have increased by £1billion to almost £2.5billion – must come down, while NHS trusts will also be challenged to sell off surplus land and estates. The total value of surplus NHS estate is estimated to be worth £1.5billion in London alone. The Health Secretary will also restate his determination to claw back money from ‘health tourists’ – visitors and migrants who access non-emergency care. A list of 25 drugs – which includes six breast cancer drugs and Jevtana used in prostate cancer – has been posted for ‘re-evaluation’ next month by the Cancer Drugs Fund, with a decision due in the New Year.

"A popular student who was found dead at her university halls after a night out died from a rare form of meningitis. Alisha Bartolini, 18, from Wigan, was found dead at Hope Place campus, Liverpool, at around 5.30pm on November 1 after attending a Halloween party in the city centre. A post-mortem examination confirmed she died as a result of meningococcal meningitis, which affects around 2,000 people each year in the UK. Alisha Bartolini, 18, was found dead at her halls of residence in Liverpool just weeks after starting university . The rare and serious infection causes the membranes which cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. The popular teen, from Appley Bridge, Wigan, was in her first year of studying marketing, media and management at Liverpool Hope University. Miss Bartolini had been to a Halloween-themed student event at Nation nightclub in Liverpool city centre the night before she was found dead at her flat. After her death, her devastated parents, Michaela and Sean, said: 'We are struggling to come to terms with what has happened. And are absolutely devastated by the death of our daughter Alisha.

"The parents of a newborn baby found dead inside a carrier bag dumped on a country lane appealed for an Islamic funeral for the infant, an inquest heard. It was feared that the baby - named Alia by detectives - may have lain dead at the roadside for up to 11 days after passers-by mistakenly assumed that her tiny body was rubbish. A coroner today issued a final plea for the baby's mother and father to come forward, saying 'it was never too late.' Scroll down for video . A message scrawled on the carrier bag read 'please please bury him Islamic way please please' The grim discovery was only made when a couple walking their dog picked up the bundle to place it in their own bin. They discovered the infant wrapped in a white t-shirt and stuffed in the bag alongside a pair of jogging bottoms. The child's mother and father have never been traced, despite witnesses reporting seeing an Asian woman sobbing at the rural scene. DNA samples taken from the child failed to identify her parents and detectives later named the child, Alia, which means 'beautiful.' In a further bid to trace the newborn's parents Greater Manchester Police have reviewed 3,000 hours of CCTV, traced discarded bus receipts and even visited 53 people in a 15 mile radius who had bought the same Tesco white shirt found with Alia. NHS Direct, walk-in clinics, colleges and even schools were all asked for assistance as well as investigations into the circulation of shop carrier bags. An inquest was finally heard into Alia's death 20 months after she was discovered in Ox Hey Lane, Lostock, Bolton, Greater Manchester on 14th March 2013. The hearing heard that it was likely that she had only lived for a matter of hours and that she was found with the placenta and her umbilical cord still attached. Tests revealed she was a full term baby of 36 weeks old. Police searching Ox Hey Lane in Bolton where the body of the baby girl, named Alia by the police, was found wrapped in a white t-shirt within a Tesco carrier bag . A coroner urged the parents of the newborn baby girl found dead in Ox Hey Lane, Bolton, to come forward after concluding an inquest into her death . The shopping bag had been spotted by several people in the days before infant was found, yet people had believed it to have contained rubbish. Dog walker Colin Eccles who made the discovery whilst walking with his wife Marilyn around 5pm after his wife noticed there was 'a lot of rubbish in the bag' and said to 'pull it out and take it home and put in the bin'. 'As I pulled the bag out there was some material in the bag, as I pulled the bag the material fell to one side,' he said. 'I opened the material and then that was the time I saw the child.' Another witness told the inquest how days earlier he had been walking with his wife Jane on Mothering Sunday last year, when they initially spotted a black Sports Direct carrier bag on the left hand side of the lane underneath the hedgerow that had looked 'totally out of place'. Dean Crombie added that Mrs Crombie had complained of the rubbish and they were again both to see the bag two days later. It is believed that the Tesco bag had been within the Sports Direct bag which was never found. In a statement read to the court Mrs Crombie said that as she drove along the lane on the day of the discovery she saw the bag, and described what appeared to be 'clothing pouring out of the bag'. Student at nearby Bolton Wanderers Academy, Arron Goodison, said he had seen what he had believed to have been 'a doll' in the bag.'. 'There was this strange smell and we saw clothing or something like clothing,' he told the hearing. 'There was a weird smell every time we went past it. We didn't think anything of it at first. It was a black bag, I saw clothing, when I looked into it it looked like a doll.' He added that he had also seen an Asian woman 'acting strangely' in the vicinity. 'She was walking up and down and looked suspicious. She seemed like she was crying, she looked like she was really upset. She seemed like she was crying because her face was down.' This pair of stained three quarter length trousers (pictured right) were found in the carrier bag with baby Alia . Home Office pathologist Dr Philip Lumb said that he was unable to find a medical cause of death but  was able to conclude that Alia had lived for a number of hours. He  was unable to confirm if any trauma had occurred but could exclude major injuries. The inquest heard that the white Florence and Fred shirt with a 50' collar was investigated with 53 sold locally, and all owners were visited and spoken to. Detective Inspector Aaron Duggan  said: 'We completed best chance inquiries to find out what happened to Alia.' Bolton Coroner Alan Walsh recorded an open verdict into the death of little Alia. Hundreds of mourners attended a funeral service held for Alia at a mosque in Bolton . He said: ''It saddens me a great deal that baby Alia lived for a matter of hours, maybe only two hours. 'She had an extremely short life It's appropriate that the police called her Alia which means 'beautiful', sadly her beautiful short life came to a rapid end. 'I have to accept that very sadly the deceased could not be identified. It is likely that the bag had been put in its position sometime between the 3rd and 10th of March 2013. 'It saddens me she wasn't able to blossom into a beautiful young lady. 'It is extremely sad she should have died in these circumstances without any medical help or medical attention. 'I'm disappointed that the parents of the child did not come forward. 'It saddens me, she would not have had the benefits of parents to lay her to rest in the appropriate way. 'I accept the police inquiries have been exhausted but the file will remain open, if any information comes forward the police will investigate. 'I believe it is not too late for someone to come forward. I believe it is a matter that would be important to establish what happened to baby Alia.'","Couple walking their dog in Bolton made the grim discovery in March 2013 .

Completely cut off from conditions outside the temperature and humidity controlled isolation tank, lettuce inspectors wear full body suits while making notes on the quality and growth of the leaves on their tablet computers in order to prevent the air around the plants becoming contaminated. Each plant is blasted with artificial lighting to trick it into believing it is exposed to sunlight, while vitamins and nutrients are injected directly into its roots, meaning the lettuce does not need soil.

The sterile environment is to prevent the plants becoming contaminated . Inspection: Located in disused 21,000-square foot electronics factory in Yokosuka, Toshiba claims to have created a perfect 'germ free' environment where it will grow three million bags of lettuce a year . Sealed: The lettuces are grown in a huge temperature, light and humidity controlled isolation tank . The goal of Toshiba's new high-tech farm is to produce the world's highest quality lettuce. The final product will be free of any form of bacteria, fungi or insect life before being placed into sealed bags, which should ensure the product has a longer shelf life than other lettuces. The gardening technique aims to have a bacteria ration of no more than 1/1000th - considerably lower than that found in normal gardening soil. Toshiba aims to harvest three million bags of leaf lettuce, baby leaf greens, spinach, mizuna and herbs every year - with each bag likely to cost consumers £1. The ultimate in organic vegetables, the lettuces require no pesticides but are expected to have a similar shelf to plants that have been heavily treated with chemicals. Delicate: The lettuce factory is no marketing gimmick by Toshiba. Instead it represents the company's latest attempt to diversify its technology-led business.

There are already plans for the technology giant to build similar factories around the world over the coming years - and it will also be selling the high tech equipment that allows factories to produce similar products of exceptionally high quality. Toshiba was founded in 1938 as Tokyo Shibaura Electric through the merger of Shibaura Seisaku-sho, founded in 1875, and Tokyo Denki, founded in 1890. The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978.","Japanese technology giant growing organic lettuce in disused factory .

"As stylish couples go - no one has quite managed to live up to Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. The couple were the epitome of seventies chic and although their 13-year love affair ultimately ended in disaster, 30 years after it finished fans of the couple still regard it as one of the great romances of the 20th Century. Now a new exhibition is allowing the public to get up close and personal with the stars, with photographs taken from Jane's brother Andrew's personal archive going on show in London from this week. Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg were the epitome of seventies chic and a new exhibition featuring photographs from the personal archive of Jane's brother Andrew Birkin is going on show at London's Proud Gallery this month. Here Jane & Serge are pictured watching the sunset in Oxford, August 8, 1969 . Serge Gainsbourg with his daughter Charlotte in Normandy, July 1977 . The couple met as co-stars on the set of the film Slogan in 1968, where they also recorded the theme tune 'La chanson de slogan,' together. Their first date comprised of a crawl of the nightclubs in Paris, ending up in a transvestite bar. When Serge was no longer able to hold his booze, he took Jane back to the Hilton hotel and promptly passed out. The date was a resounding success though and they swiftly fell in love - Serge was 20 years her senior. The film Slogan was the first of a long line of collaborations during the relationship, which also included the infamous song 'Je t'aime... moi non plus,' a track so X-rated that it was denounced by the Vatican and banned from airplay in the UK. As well as their shared body of work, the relationship also produced a child, Charlotte Gainsbourg who is now 43. Jane & Serge in Cannes, on May 10, 1968, shortly after they met on the set of Slogan . Jane Birkin & Serge Gainsbourg with Jane's first daughter Kate from her marriage to composer John Barry, the trio were on holiday in Oxford, 1969 . Despite their long relationship, the couple never married. Jane said of the decision: 'When I gave birth to our daughter Charlotte in 1971, Serge said it was the happiest night of his life. 'He wanted us to marry, but I’d been married to John and that was enough. 'Now I regret turning Serge down.' Jane Birkin being photographed by her brother Andrew on April 12, 1964 . Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg in front of the Radcliffe Camera, Oxford on August 8, 1969 . Despite their intense love, the couple couldn't manage to make the relationship work long-term and Jane left Serge in 1980. She later said of the decision: 'I left him after 12 years, partly because of his drinking. 'I was starting to find others attractive too – that’s when our age gap made a difference.' Jane with  her daughter Kate and Vanessa Vadim - the daughter of actress Jane Fonda and French filmmaker Roger Vadim, in Paris on December 7, 1972 . But Serge never got over his love for Jane, right up until the day he died of a heart attack on March 2, 1991. Jane said: 'Serge went on being in love with me and writing songs for me, and bought me a diamond three days before he died in 1991. 'I couldn’t have had anyone who loved me more and I don’t think I’ll ever live in England again – I’m too spoilt in France.'

"A diet high in omega-3 fatty acids can help preserve memory and thinking abilities . A Mediterranean diet low in red meat and dairy food and high in omega-3 fatty acids can help preserve memory and thinking abilities, say researchers. Scientists in the U.S. studied the diets of 17,478 people with an average age of 64. Participants were given tests that measured mental ability over an average of four years. During the course of the study, seven per cent developed memory and thinking deficits. The study found people who more closely followed a Mediterranean diet had a 19 per cent reduced risk of mental impairment. A key element of the Mediterranean diet is omega-3 fatty acids, found in oily fish, flax seed, walnuts and pulses, which are known to benefit the brain and nervous system. The diet typically also contains high levels of fresh fruit and vegetables and low levels of saturated fat. The findings are published in the latest issue of the journal Neurology. Lead researcher Dr Georgios Tsivgoulis, from the universities of Alabama in the US and Athens in Greece, said: 'Since there are no definitive treatments for most dementing illnesses, modifiable activities, such as diet, that may delay the onset of symptoms of dementia are very important. 'Diet is an important modifiable activity that could help in preserving cognitive functioning in late life. However, it is only one of several important lifestyle activities that might play a role in late-life mental functioning. Exercise, avoiding obesity, not smoking cigarettes and taking medications for conditions like diabetes and hypertension are also important.' Other recent research found that eating a . Mediterranean-style diet can cut heart attacks, strokes and death rates . in people at high risk of heart disease by as much as a third. Other recent research found that a  Mediterranean diet could be as good as statins at cutting the risk of heart disease . Changing the balance of foods in a diet can lessen the risk even before heart-related illness strikes, according to a major clinical trial. Previous studies have compared the effects of the diet on people after they have suffered a heart attack or stroke – with many showing improved heart health. But this research, published online by the New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to rigorously test the effects on a high-risk group. In fact, the study of around 7,500 people was halted early, after almost five years, because the results were so clear it would have been unethical not to recommend the diet to all those taking part.","A Mediterranean diet high in omega-3 fatty acids can help preserve memory and .

"New Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew says that he has been promised transfer funds by chairman Steve Parish in a bid to stave off relegation from the Premier League. Palace, third from bottom, have an interest in taking Arsenal’s Yaya Sanogo on loan or perhaps signing Bafetimbi Gomis from Swansea and Pardew is clear the squad will need improvements this month if the club are to achieve their principal goal of staying up. Pardew was confirmed as Palace manager on Saturday and will take charge for their FA Cup third-round clash at non-League Dover on Sunday after watching the team draw 0-0 at Aston Villa on New Year’s Day. Alan Pardew has been unveiled as Crystal Palace's new manager after leaving Newcastle United . Newcastle United confirmed the departure of their former manager on Saturday morning . Speaking publicly for the first time since his shock departure from Newcastle last week, Pardew said: ‘Without putting pressure on the chairman — because I think it’s difficult for the manager to keep talking publicly about players and putting unnecessary pressure on the board — we have had discussions and we are going to need a player or two at least and that is what we’re going to try to do. ‘Maybe it just needs a little change of direction. The players have a great attitude here. I’ve been really, really impressed with them. ‘So can I help change that energy into more tangible results? That might take a transfer or a change of style a little bit and that’s really what a manager of my experience can hopefully do.’ Although former Palace manager Tony Pulis became frustrated with the club’s transfer strategy, Pardew is likely to enjoy a better relationship with Parish than he did with Mike Ashley at Newcastle, where he had little say over which players came and went. Pardew will manage Crystal Palace's FA Cup third round clash at Dover after leaving Newcastle . Pardew was at Palace's training ground on Friday for just under 12 hours as he started life at his new club . Pardew (centre) stands with Palace chairman Steve Parish in the stands during the Villa game . Pardew will email tactical mini-dossiers to Parish before each game to keep him informed of the reasons behind his team selections and decisions, and send analysis of each game afterwards. He wants his owner to feel part of the management process, believing it helps deal with poor results or other difficult situations at the club. Pardew did the same with Ashley at Newcastle but the frustration over transfer policy and the antipathy of Newcastle fans seems to have persuaded him to move back to the club he played for between 1987 and 1991. He became a fans’ favourite, scoring the winner in the dramatic 4-3 win over Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final. ‘It was difficult because I’m leaving a big club in Newcastle,’ he said. ‘It was a choice I decided to make which I felt was good for myself and for my family and my career. Caretaker boss Keith Millen took charge of Palace's 0-0 draw at Aston Villa on New Year's Day . Pardew will lead his first game with Palace after they agreed a £3.5million compensation deal with Newcastle . ‘Every time I’ve come back here it was always a lovely welcome and a nice feeling. I knew at some point I was sure I would have worked in this club. ‘Really and truly my home is in this area and for me it’s what you would class, as close as you can be as a manager, to my own club.’ ‘Fans love you when you do something good for the football club and I think they admired the spirit and the way we approached games in that era and would like to see a little bit more of that and I hope I can bring that back. The club has done incredibly well in the last couple of years. It’s a little bit sticky at the moment. And we need to find a route out of that.’","Crystal Palace announced Alan Pardew as their new manager on Saturday .

"Jane Andrews, a former aide of the Duchess of York who was jailed for murdering her wealthy lover. She is set to face a Parole Board hearing next month . The Duchess of York’s killer aide Jane Andrews could be free for Christmas after winning a new parole hearing. Andrews, who murdered her wealthy lover in a rage when he refused to marry her, will face a Parole Board hearing next month. The former royal dresser, was jailed for life for stabbing to death Thomas Cressman, 39, in 2000. Two years ago, she was denied parole after escaping from prison. Now 46, she works in the laundry at Send Prison in Surrey. Mr Cressman’s brother Rick 62, has vowed to fight her bid. ‘We believe Jane Andrews is a danger to the public,’ he said. ‘In 14 years, she has never shown any remorse. 'The day Tommy died was the start of a life sentence for us. We think about him every day. 'Traditionally, a life sentence was 25-years and I believe that Andrews should serve that.” Mr Cressman, who runs a successful hotel, said his mum Barbara, 86, is distraught. He added: 'She told me that she thinks of him every day and even speaks to him. 'There is a moment when she will tell Tommy her feelings in the hope he hears her.' Mr Cressman and sister Cathy, 60, will attend the hearing to give a statement. They will tell of the emotional toll and how they feel Andrews has shown no remorse. Mr Cressman added: 'All she does is to try and justify her actions.' Given Andrews’ history, the parole board is more likely to send her to an open jail. A source said: 'Jane believes she has done enough to be moved to an open jail. 'She knows this is the first step towards eventually being released and is quietly confident. In 2000, after Thomas Cressman (right) refused to get married, Jane Andrews (left) clubbed him unconscious with a cricket bat at their home in Fulham, west London. She then stabbed him to death . 'Jane has been a model prisoner for the last couple of years and has been sure to show remorse. 'She has been a keen member of therapy groups and has ticked all the boxes. 'However, many in the prison think she is manipulative and a threat to men.” Andrews was given a life term with a minimum of 12 years in 2001. The Parole Board will include a top psychologist, prison staff, probation workers and parole members. The clinical psychologist will assess Andrews’ mental state before the parole hearing. He will conclude whether she is a danger to the public. Andrews became friends with the Duchess of York, 54, during nine years working as her aide. Jane Andrews became a close friend and confidante of the Duchess of York during nine years as her employee - joining her on royal duties both in the UK and abroad . She joined her on royal duties both at home and abroad. She stabbed businessman Mr Cressman to death at the house they shared in Fulham, South West London, after clubbing him unconscious with a cricket bat. Her Old Bailey trial heard Andrews had a history of depression and severe mood swings. Andrews had been moved to open jail East Sutton Park in Kent, but she absconded in 2009. She was returned two days later. Mr Cressman said: 'I fear she will be downgraded to an open prison. Let’s hope she doesn’t walk out again. 'She is a manipulative individual and would do or say anything to win her freedom.' A spokeswoman for the Parole Board said: 'We do not comment on individuals.'","Jane Andrews could be freed after winning a Parole Board hearing .

"Wages will increase by more than three per cent next year, the Bank of England predicted yesterday as official figures revealed that Britain’s cost-of-living crisis could finally be coming to an end. The data shows that average pay – excluding bonuses – is 1.3 per cent higher than a year ago, above the 1.2 per cent rate of inflation. It means millions of workers are finally receiving ‘real’ wage increases, easing an unprecedented squeeze on family finances triggered by the economic crisis. Pay has risen faster than inflation for the first time in five years, meaning families could start to feel better off . Workers in the private sector, especially manufacturing, saw the biggest rises in pay, the ONS said . Bank Governor Mark Carney said it was ‘more likely than not’ that inflation will also dip below one per cent over the next six months as energy and food prices continue to fall. ‘We are seeing encouraging signs,’ Mr Carney said at the launch of the Bank’s quarterly inflation report. ‘We are seeing the start of real pay growth.’ He added: ‘We expect this pick-up to accelerate, with earnings growing a little above three per cent and inflation running around one per cent or 1.5 per cent. ‘It is a welcome development but one swallow doesn’t make a summer. This has to persist.’ The Government seized upon the figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, as ‘remarkable’ and said more generous pay rises would continue into the New Year. Meanwhile, new data showed employment was at another record high in the three months to September, with 30.8million UK adults now in work. It means three-quarters of people aged 16-64 are in employment. According to the ONS, 98 per cent of people who have found work in the past three months have gone into full-time jobs, debunking claims by unions and Labour that Britain is in the midst of a ‘part-time recovery’. The employment rate has hit 73 per cent, within touching distance of the record 73.2 per cent seen in 2005 . On average people in the UK worked a total of 987,854,908 each week in September, the data reveals . The total number of people in work has risen by 2.3 per cent in the last year. But the biggest rises were among workers from the European Union. The number of UK-born workers in a job rose by 1.6 per cent, but for people from the other 27 member states, the figure rose by 11.1 per cent. The biggest rise was among people from Romania and Bulgaira, up 34.9 per cent in a year. It follows the lifting of work restrictions for people from the two countries in January this year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘We constantly get this jibe that somehow this is not about full-time work – oh yes it is. ‘Full-time work is absolutely the key to this.’ He said full-time work was ‘important’ to people because it gave them ‘that sense of security’ and ‘that sense of self-worth’, adding that the latest figures were ‘somewhat better than encouraging – they are rather remarkable’. Unemployment has dropped by 115,000 to 1.96million, the lowest figure since the start of the year. Chancellor George Osborne said the figures showed the Government’s ‘long-term economic plan is working.’ The Government said a new person had entered the workforce every minute of every working day since the Coalition came to power in 2010. Economists expressed hope last night that wages would continue to rise during 2015, comfortably beating inflation. They said households would feel the benefit of even moderate pay rises at a time when shop prices were still falling. The total number of people in work rose by 2.3 per cent year-on-year, but surged by  34.9 per cent among people born in Romania and Bulgaria . The figures are a boost for Chancellor George Osborne who will hope to create a 'feel-good factor' in the run-up to the general election in May next year . The price of oil per barrel has plummeted by about a fifth in the past year. And Britain’s biggest supermarkets have slashed their prices to fend off stiff competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, easing the pressure on family finances. Richard Troue, of Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ‘Energy and food prices have been falling recently, so even modest wage growth could ease the pressure on consumers and households further, putting more pounds in their pocket in the run-up to Christmas.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said yesterday’s figures were ‘not yet much to celebrate’. He said: ‘I hope the Governor of the Bank of England is right when he says that he thinks that wages will start to grow more strongly than inflation next year, because of course that’s not happened so far.’","Average earnings up 1.3% in September, while CPI inflation is at 1.2% .

"Lurking off the coast of Chile and Peru lives a sea creature that blends in so naturally with the rocks on which it lives you'd be forgiven for missing it. However, if you were to accidentally stand on this living rock it will burst to expose a mass of blood-red hermaphrodite creatures considered a delicacy in the nearby Central American countries. The creature is called Pyura chilensis - also known as Piure in Spanish - and it belongs to a class of sac-like marine life known as sea squirts. Scroll down for video . This bizarre sea creature called the Pyura Chilensis lives off the coast of Chile and Peru is often called a living rock or sea squirt. It is born a male before developing female organs which means it can breed with itself. The unusual mass of organs feeds on algae and microrganisms by inhaling them through seawater . The Pyura Chilensis, pictured, is fished commercially from the Pacific Ocean. Fisherman have to cut into the camouflaged living rock in which the creatures hide using a sharp knife or even a handsaw . The Piure is known as a tunicate, so-called because it is covered in a layer - or 'tunic' - of animal cellulose called tunicin. Inside the living rock is a mass of organs surrounded by a layer of skin and muscle. It is called a filter feeder because it inhales seawater, removes and feeds on the algae and microoganisms in the water, before exhaling the filtered water back into the sea. The most interesting feature of this bizarre creature, however, is its reproductive skills. The Piure is born a male and when it reaches puberty it also grows female organs, making the sea squirt a hermaphrodite. When . it comes to breeding season, the Piure releases eggs from its female . organs at the same time it releases sperm from its male gonads into the . seawater. From the outside, the Pyura chilensis or Piure looks like a rock covered in molluscs, pictured left. Yet when the Piure is cut open the mass of blood-red organs, skin and muscles are exposed, pictured right . If the eggs and sperm collide they form a 'fertile cloud' that will produce tadpole-style children. These male tadpoles will then settle onto a nearby rock and grow into adults. Piure's only breed like this when they are alone; if there are other members of the species nearby, the creature will choose to cross-breed to increase the chances of success. Despite its red colour, the blood of the Piure is clear. It also contains a high level of vanadium - a hard, silvery grey metal that occurs naturally in more than 60 different minerals around the world. The flesh of the Piure, pictured, is canned or sold as strips and can be eaten raw, or cooked. It is also exported to Sweden and Japan. Its blood is clear and contains high levels of metallic element vanadium . The concentration of vanadium produced by the Piure is around 10 million times the amount found in surrounding seawater. Because of its high level of vanadium, and the element's toxicity, there are concerns about eating the creature . According to Scientific American magazine, the concentration of vanadium produced by the Piure is around ten million times the amount found in the surrounding seawater, and researchers are unsure what the function this element has in these creatures. On land, vanadium is used to make steel alloys. The animal is one of the main food sources for aquatic species such as the Chilean abalone but it also fished commercially and served in Chilean restaurants. The living rock has to be cut using a sharp knife or handsaw before the siphons are pulled from the tunic. This flesh is canned or sold as strips and can be eaten raw, or cooked. It is also exported to Sweden and Japan. Because of its high level of vanadium, and the element's toxicity, there are concerns about eating the creature.","Pyura Chilensis is a sea creature that lives off the coast of Chile and Peru .

"A Pennsylvania man who has the misfortune of bearing a strong resemblance to the suspect in the killing of a state trooper has been awarded for his troubles with a car. James Tully, 39, from Canadensis, was questioned by police more than 20 times during the intense manhunt for Eric Frein, who was captured October 30 after a 48-day manhunt. Because he did not own a car, Tully had been forced to walk to work two hours each way along rural roads at the heart of the search zone, bringing him into nearly daily contact with troopers looking for the suspect. Scroll down for video . He got a car! James Tully, 39, a man who had the misfortune of bearing a strong resemblance to suspected cop killer Eric Frein, was able to buy a car from donations collected on his behalf online . Lookalike: Tully, left, looks a lot like Frein, right, who had been hunted by state police for more than five weeks after allegedly shooting dead a trooper and wounding another . Tully used less than half of $24,000 donated via a GoFundMe account to buy this blue 2007 Subaru Outback . Thinking ahead: The man said that the rest of the raised funds will go towards gas, maintenance and insurance . Tully is pictured here shaking hands with Matt Raymond, a digital marketing manage at the Halterman's Toyota Scion & Mitsubishi dealership in East Stroudsburg . On one occasion, Tully said that armed officers tackled him to the ground at gunpoint, holding him face-down in the gravel, knee in his back, while shouting at him to identify himself. He has taken to carrying photo ID everywhere to prove he is not one of America's most wanted men. The unfortunate doppelganger's plight brought him wide sympathy and led to a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe.com to get him a car so he could safely travel to and from work. Just over $24,000 was raised, and on Wednesday Tully used less than half to buy a blue 2007 Subaru Outback. 'I'm truly overwhelmed by the community support and everything. I want to thank everyone for their support,' he told PA Homepage. Tully, a separated father of two children, ages 4 and 11, who works at an aerospace manufacturing firm, said that the rest of the raised funds will go towards gas, maintenance and insurance. Speaking to the Pocono Record last month, he described how he was walking home one night down Route 447 after finishing work at midnight. Violent encounter: Tully says that one officer who stopped him late at night pointed a rifle at him and pinned him to the floor with his knee . Necessary: Tully has started wearing visible photo ID to convince police he is not Eric Frein . He was stopped twice without incident - but the third officer to spot him leaped from his SUV 'screaming like a lunatic' and aiming his rifle straight at Tully, he said. He said: 'The only ID I saw was the barrel of the gun. He yelled at me to get down on the ground with my arms out wide and he demanded my name.' Despite tearing the ID badge out from under Tully, the officer, he said, continued to hound him. He allegedly said 'I will break you right here - what is your name?' while pressing down on his bad back with one knee. After a while a state trooper who had seen Tully before pulled up and calmed the situation - and promised to tell other searchers about him. He says he was stopped three times the next day. He later checked into hospital, where he was told his ribs were bruised in the encounter. Tully told the Record that due to budget constraints he didn't own a car - and said nobody was available to give him a lift home because of his late hours. Despite a bad knee and back, he had been walking to work every day - a five-mile trip which takes him two hours each way. In response to the article about Tully's plight in The Pocono Record, Dawn DiBiase, a friend of a friend of Tully's, set up the online fundraiser to help him buy a vehicle. 'Everybody wanted to help out and it was like a silver lining to the manhunt and everything,' the woman told PA Homepage. Tully, described as a humble, hardworking man, asked DiBiase to shut down the fundraiser once it's reached $24,200 . Survivalist: Frein, right, was  on the run from state police and the FBI for 48 days .

"Labour MPs cheered jokes about killing the Royal Family and lynching Tory Cabinet minister Esther McVey at a tasteless Remembrance Sunday event . The Labour party today tried to disown comments made by a senior backbencher about wanting to 'lynch' a Tory Cabinet minister. Left-winger John McDonnell made the offensive remarks about Employment Minister Esther McVey at a tasteless Remembrance Sunday event, the Daily Mail revealed today. He told the audience how a campaign had been launched to kick Ms McVey out of her seat, but activists were arguing 'Why we are sacking her? Why aren't we lynching the b******?'. The Tories condemned the public call for a 'violent attack' on a female MP. But the Labour party only tweeted a message in response, stating: 'John McDonnell's comments, if accurately reported, don't represent the views of the Labour Party. He speaks for himself.' Mr McDonnell said he regarded the 'Daily Mail having a go at me' as a 'badge of honour'. He added: 'All I'm saying is don't blame me for simply repeating what some of Esther McVey's constituents have said at a public meeting.' The 'anti-war comedy night' even featured remarks mocking the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London and killing the Royal Family. Among those attending the event at a club in Covent Garden were former shadow minister Diane Abbott and Left-wing MP Jeremy Corbyn. Last night, Ed Miliband faced calls to condemn the MPs for taking part in the 'sickening' event, held as the sacrifices made by our Armed Forces since the start of the First World War 100 years ago were honoured across the country. But Mr Corbyn risked causing further offence by insisting the comedy night – organised as a tribute to Labour firebrand and anti-war campaigner Tony Benn, who died in March aged 88 – was 'a great event' that he 'really enjoyed'. In his speech, Mr McDonnell, the MP for Hayes and Harlington, spoke about a visit to Miss McVey's Wirral West constituency, where the former TV presenter faces a major union-backed campaign to oust her from the marginal seat. To applause, he said: 'I was up in Liverpool a fortnight ago where Alec McFadden, one of our [union] organisers, launched the Sack Esther McVey Day on her birthday. 'I spoke at a packed public meeting... there was a whole group in the audience that completely kicked off quite critical of the whole concept, because they were arguing 'Why we are sacking her? 'Why aren't we lynching the b******?' Comedian Steve Gribbin was then loudly cheered and applauded when he said: 'I'm not a fan of the Royal Family, they are a bunch of parasites.' He added: 'There are royalists in [the audience], I can feel the anger. 'Leave them alone'. No, kill 'em.' Joke: John McDonnell gave a speech joking about Employment Minister Ms McVey being lynched while left-winger Jeremy Corbyn said it was 'a great event' that he 'really enjoyed' London Labour MP Diane Abbott was also at the event but has refused to comment on the story . Left-wing activist and blogger Mark McGowan, who uses the stage name The Artist Taxi Driver, mocked the Tower of London ceramic poppies as 'a river of blood'. Last night Tory MPs demanded that Mr McDonnell have the Labour whip withdrawn until he apologises and withdraws his comments about Miss McVey. Defence Minister Anna Soubry said: 'These comments, made on Remembrance Sunday of all days, are extremely serious. There can be no excuse for a Member of Parliament to fantasise about someone's death. 'Ed Miliband must remove the whip from John McDonnell. The Labour Party must not be a refuge to those who incite violence.' Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: 'It's sickening that Labour MPs chose to mark Remembrance Sunday, a hundred years since the outbreak of World War One, by making vile death threats against a female MP. Ed Miliband faces calls to condemn the MPs for taking part in the 'sickening' event, held on Remembrance Sunday as the rest of country paid tribute to the fallen . The 'anti-war comedy night' even featured remarks mocking the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London . 'Ed Miliband has totally lost control. His own frontbench MPs are inciting hatred and violence against women. John McDonnell should be forced to withdraw his disgusting comments, and apologise.' The Labour Party, Mr McDonnell and Miss Abbott did not respond to requests to comment last night. Mr Corbyn, MP for Islington North, said: 'It was a great event and I really enjoyed it. 'Tony Benn dedicated his whole life to ending, not glorifying, war.' MP John McDonnell . 'I was up in Liverpool a fortnight ago where Alec McFadden, one of our organisers, launched the Sack Esther McVey Day on her birthday. I spoke at a packed public meeting, it was absolutely packed but there was a whole group in the audience that completely kicked off quite critical of the whole concept because they were arguing, 'Why are sacking her, why aren't we lynching the bastard?' 'Tony [Benn] always said how you can use a ballot box to change the world. But there's [another] way too, which in the old days we called insurrection, now we call it direct action. It's when the Government don't do as you want, you get in the streets or you occupy and you take direct action against them.' 'Electorally, let's just learn the lessons from Tony Benn, electorally let's be absolutely clear, in this election in May coming up we've got to get these b******s out. We've got to destroy this Government. We cannot cope with the re-election of a Tory Government in whatever coalition form it is, because our society cannot cope with it. That's why for those people who are talking about not voting or not mobilising, to be frank that's a combination of dereliction of duty and cowardice.' Activist Mark McGowan . 'We need a new politics. We need radical change, we're moving towards a next general election where no one's got any ******* hope at all. Any decent person would want to vote Labour, any decent person would, but they're in ******* bits. Ed Miliband said they're going to [put] 25p on the minimum wage... we've got every single politician standing up and talking about affordable housing. It's the biggest bunch of s*** ever.' 'Today is 100 years [since the start of the First World War], this is what they're celebrating with a river of blood coming out of the Tower of London from the royals, from the monarch, and they're all there today. And Tony Blair's there today, Tony Blair, that's the Labour Party's gift to the world.' Comedian Steve Gribbin . 'I'm not a fan of the Royal Family, they are a bunch of parasites.

"Arjen Robben admitted trying to con the referee in Holland's 2-1 victory over Mexico, while Miguel Herrera branded the forward a cheat. The Dutchman revealed that he dived in an attempt to win a penalty - but not for the decisive 93rd minute spot-kick that secured Holland's progression to the quarter-finals. Robben had two penalty appeals turned down earlier in the match - before Klaas Jan Huntelaar converted in injury time - and later apologised for trying to fool Portuguese official Pedro Proenca.

Holland eventually drew level, with three minutes of regular time left to play, through a vicious strike from Wesley Sneijder. Robben's unsuccessful appeals fell either side of half time and, after finally convincing Proenca in the dying moments of the last 16 knock-out, he entrusted Huntelaar with the crucial kick. 'Usually I am comfortable with taking a penalty, but this time I was the one who was tackled,' said Robben. 'I felt comfortable that Huntelaar would capitalise. 'It was his moment, he deserved this.

"The tragic death of Jill Meagher stunned Australia, but the horrific crime has led to the creation of a phone app that could save others in danger. Gavin Lockwood from Canberra was as shocked as the rest of the country when the pretty Irish woman was violently raped and murdered while walking home from a pub in Brunswick, an inner suburb of Melbourne, in the early hours of September 22, 2012. But instead of forgetting about the terrible incident, Lockwood decided to try and develop a mobile phone app that would help others in trouble in the future. Jill Meagher was brutally raped and murdered two years ago in Melbourne . Mr Lockwood is a full-time sheet metal worker who works long hours. However, despite this he worked regularly in his spare time to make the free app that would allow users to request the help of other people nearby at the touch of a button. Later he teamed up with his friend Steve Thomas who helped develop the app further and he became his business partner on the project. The new mobile phone app was developed specifically to help others in trouble . After a year working on it all their hard work came to fruition when the Hawk Help app was finally finished. It is now available on iTunes and Google Play. Tom and Jill Meagher on their wedding day: Jill's murder shocked Australians across the country . 'What happened to Jill Meaher was shocking and it got my mind racing. I just thought there has to be something that can be developed that can help. That was where the idea originated from,""  Mr Lockwood said. 'We spent the first six months developing the app and the next six months testing it and making sure it worked properly. I worked on the app in the evenings after I'd finished my job and on the weekends.' A memorial site for murdered Irish woman Jill Meagher on the steps of the Brunswick Baptist Church in Melbourne. It's hoped the Hawk Help app will help prevent a tragedy like this happening again . The app works very simply. If someone feels threatened they just open the app and hit the help request button. This searches for a a range of up to 25 kilometres in the area. The app shows people how many other users are located within this radius, but this can be refined as more people download it. 'It'll send out a help request and if the person who receives it accepts the request they'll be given a map showing where the person is who has requested the help,' Mr Lockwood said.                                                                                                                                                       When activated Hawk Help can contact more that one person in the vicinity and is traceable. As well as Australia it is also available in New Zealand, China, India, Brazil, Italy and Qatar. Tom and Jill Meagher in happier times: Jill's death inspired Gavin Lockwood to develop the Hawk Help app . 'The whole idea with the app is to create a community. Initially give it to someone you trust or are familiar with. Obviously the more people there are on board, the more people there'll be to assist in a time of need. It's about making your community safer,"" Mr Lockwood said. Hawk Help is user intuitive and uses the latest messaging technology for faster contact. It is suitable for women, men, children, the elderly and anyone whose work involves them being unaccompanied with others, people dating new people or anyone at risk in general. A picture of Jill Meagher during her memorial service at St Peter's Church in Drogheda, Ireland. The thinking behind Hawk Help is to have an phone app that can help protect the whole community . 'We're not trying to make heroes out of people or put them in any danger, it's more about having a presence and working together as a community,' Mr Lockwood explained. 'We don't want anyone to put themselves in danger, but rather to create a support network.'","Irish woman was brutally raped and murdered two years ago in Melbourne .

"Jose Mourinho takes on Zlatan Ibrahimovic in Tuesday night’s Champions League clash between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in the battle of the biggest egos in football — but the man who knows them both, David Luiz, claims their images are far removed from how they portray themselves in public. Luiz, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012 but left in the summer for Paris Saint-Germain for £50million, says he joined because Ibrahimovic was there and that the Swedish striker could be unstoppable against Chelsea at the Parc des Princes this week. Chelsea knocked PSG out in the Champions League quarter-finals last year, despite PSG winning the first leg 3-1. PSG went down 2-0 at Stamford Bridge with Ibrahimovic out injured.

The French club’s preparations have been far from ideal — they surrendered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Caen, finishing with nine men due to injury, and have doubts over Yohan Cabaye, Marquinhos, Serge Aurier and Lucas Moura — but Luiz is backing Ibrahimovic to make the difference. ‘There are two Zlatans: one the media portray and then the real one,’ said Luiz. ‘He was one of the big reasons that I chose to join Paris. When Chelsea played Paris he said to me during the game, you need to come and play with us next season. The Swedish striker strips off to celebrate scoring against Caen in Ligue 1 on Saturday .

Mourinho worked with Ibrahimovic for a season at Inter Milan before the Swede joined Barcelona in £57m move in 2009 —and he famously told Ibra that if he left, he would miss out on winning the Champions League with the Italian club.

He lives and breathes football 24/7. 'I’ve never know a manager with the kind of knowledge he has about the opposition side. I felt increasingly that this guy gives everything for the team so I want to give everything for him.’ Chelsea will be hoping defender Kurt Zouma can contain Ibrahimovic. The 20-year-old helped secure his move to London with a superb display for St Etienne in October 2013, when he marked Ibrahimovic out of the match.","Chelsea meet PSG in last 16 of Champions League on Tuesday .

"The billions of pounds spent trying to stop opium production in Afghanistan has achieved nothing, the UN has revealed, adding that poppy cultivation in the country hit an all time high this year. Cultivation of opium poppies rose by seven per cent in 2014, with those grown largely in the south of the country now accounting for 90 per cent of the world's heroin supply. The UN's Office on Drugs and Crime report explained that the increased poppy cultivation could produce an additional 6,400 tons of opium - a rise of 17 per cent on 2013 figures. Hit: Afghan heroin addicts smoke the drug in the town of Kunduz this morning. Poppy cultivation in the country reached an all time high this year, rising by seven per cent since 2013 . Production: A farmer is pictured collecting raw opium in a poppy field in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province . Flames: Huge piles of confiscated opium and alcohol are pictured burning in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan . Poppy production in Afghanistan is now at an all time high, with cultivation rising by seven per cent in 2014. Opium production has now risen four years in a row, having tailed off slightly in 2008, 2009 and 2010 . Afghanistan's Minister for Counter-Narcotics Din Mohammad Mubariz Rashidi urged countries around the world to give fresh impetus to controlling the drug's production and trade. 'The international community must fight opium drugs and poppy cultivation in Afghanistan as seriously as they fight terrorism,' he said. The area used for poppy cultivation grew to 553,500 acres - 89 per cent of it in the nine provinces with a significant Taliban presence, the U.N. report said. The Taliban, which has been waging war against the Afghan government since 2001, are heavily involved in poppy cultivation and opium distribution. Poppy farm: The support Afghans receive from the Taliban, like fertilizer and cash advances, are strong incentives for poor farmers not to switch over to other cash crops like wheat, fruit and saffron . Harvest: Poppy seed heads stand amid the blooming flowers in a field on the outskirts of Kandahar . Consequence: A group of Afghan heroin addicts smoke the drug in the town of Kunduz this morning . The report said that the wholesale price of opium was falling because of increased supply, but the value of the crop was equivalent to four per cent of the country's £14 billion GDP. Billions of pounds have been spent on counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan in the past decade, including programs encouraging farmers to switch to other cash crops like wheat, fruit and saffron. The support farmers receive from the Taliban, like fertilizer and cash advances, are strong incentives for poor farmers to stick with poppy. The alternative would be to wait years for a return on lower-yield produce with uncertain markets and inadequate means of storage and transport. Plea: Afghanistan's Minister for Counter-Narcotics Din Mohammad Mubariz Rashidi (left) today urged the West to help control the country's drug trade. Andrey Avetisyan (right), the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's regional representative, added that opium had to be tackled for Afghanistan to develop its post-war economy . Profit: Cultivation of opium poppies rose by seven per cent in 2014, with those grown largely in the south of the country now accounting for 90 per cent of the world's heroin supply . Up in smoke: Alcohol and opium is burned near Kabul following a seizure by Afghan government officials . Andrey Avetisyan, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's regional representative, said that with the end of the U.S. and NATO combat mission in December, the production of opium had to be tackled if Afghanistan was to develop its post-war economy. 'Without tackling the problem of drugs seriously, no serious economic achievement is possible to develop Afghanistan,' he told reporters. 'To help Afghanistan with economic development, we all together have to finally seriously do something with the threat of narcotics.' The majority of Afghan poppies are grown in the southern Helmand province, where British troops were stationed until October.

"Archaeologists have unearthed the remarkably well-preserved ruins of an ancient shopping centre in northern Greece. The 2,700-year-old portico was discovered in June on the site of the ancient city of Argilos following an archaeological excavation. An expert told MailOnline that they had even managed to identify individual shops - with one having been confirmed as a bakery, another an olive oil shop and one is thought, but not yet confirmed, to be a chemist that once sold make-up and medicine. The remains of the 2,700-year-old portico was discovered this summer on the site of the ancient city of Argilos, following an archaeological excavation in northern Greece . In ancient Greece, the portico - or 'stoa' in Greek - was a long, open structure that often housed shops and . delineated public squares from the city. Porticos were common during the Hellenistic period, from the 3rd to 1st century BC, but earlier examples are extremely rare. This latest finding from Argilosis the oldest example to date from northern Greece and is totally unique. 'We had no idea something so . historically important would be lying here,' Jacques Perreault, . Professor at the University of Montreal's Centre of Classical Studies, . who led the dig told MailOnline. Jacques Perreault, Professor at the University of Montreal's Centre of Classical Studies, who led the dig, told MailOnline that this room was a shop that pressed and sold its own olive oil . 'It is incredibly exciting and we believe there still so much more to find.' Located on the edge of the Aegean Sea, the ancient city of Argilos was the first Greek colony established in this area around the Strymon River. At its peak, in the 5th century BC, Argilos was one of the richest cities in the region. Since 1992, Professor Perreault and Dr Zisis Bonias, an archaeologist with the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports, have excavated the hill covering Argilos. It is thought that this room was a bakery because archaeologists found a grinding stone to produce flour (top right of room) as well as a small kiln to bake bread . The portico could have resembled the Stoa of Attalos in Athens (reconstruction that stands in Greek capital, pictured). It was built between 159 BC and 138 BC and became the major commercial building or shopping centre in the Agora and was used for centuries . Acquisitions of land were made on behalf of the Greek government, but the excavators retain the rights over scientific research. The remains of the Argilos portico are located on one of these sites, at the northern end of what was the city's commercial district, 50 metres from the port area at the time. The Stoa of Attalos was built by King Attalos II of Pergamon who reigned between 159 and138 B.C. He built it as a gift to the Athenians in appreciation of the time he spent in Athens studying under the philosopher Karneades. The building was an elaborate 'stoa' or 'portico' - a large two-storeyed double colonnade with rows of shops behind the colonnades. The building was made of local materials, marble for the facade and columns, and limestone for the walls. It is 116 metres-long and originally housed 42 shop. The Stoa became the major commercial building or shopping centre in the Agora and was used for centuries, from its construction in around 150 B.C. until its destruction at the hands of the Herulians in A.D. 267. Archaelogical digs in June unearthed a roughly 40 metre-long portico. The open area once contained seven rooms, five of which have been excavated, each measuring 5 metres wide and 7.5 metres deep, with a 2.5-metre high back wall. 'Each room was a shop and they sat side by side - much like how shops are arranged in modern malls,' explained Professor Perreault. The rooms exposed by the dig are only the west side of the portico, leaving archaeologists with another 'wing' to explore once they have finished their current dig. The portico is unusual in that it was not architecturally uniform. Since Argilos was very prosperous, experts have long believed that the portico was commissioned and built by the city. If this were the case, an architect would have overseen the construction and there would be an architectural uniformity to the structure. There would have been no differences in the size of the stones used, and all the rooms would have been identical. However, the architectural remains indicate the exact opposite. The construction techniques and the stones used are different from one room to another, hinting that several masons were used for each room. 'This indicates that the shop owners themselves were probably responsible for building the rooms, that ""private enterprise"" and not the city was the source of this stoa,' Professor Perreault, who specialises of the Greek Archaic period, between the 7th and 6th centuries BC, told MailOnline. 'We have confirmed one of the shops as a bakery - we found a flour grinding stone as well as a kiln inside to bake. Another was an olive oil shop as it still had the olive press required to produce the product.' Archaeologists also unearthed this vessel called a 'krater' which was often used to mix water and wine . Archaeologists found a 'very, very small' stone in another shop that may have been used as a pestle and mortar. This, they believe, could indicate that the shop was a chemist that pulverised its own ingredients to made medicine and make-up for visiting customers. In the Iron Age, northern Greece was very prosperous. The valley of the Strymon River, whose mouth is located less than three km from Argilos, was rich in gold and silver mines. With its ports and nearby mines, Argilos was a strategic location for trade in precious metals. Experts remain baffled by this finding however - they had no idea what it may have been used for, although the small holes indicate it once hung up on a wall . But its prosperity declined rapidly from the mid-5th century BC, when the Athenians founded the nearby city of Amphipolis. In 357 BC, Philip II conquered the whole region and deported the inhabitants from Argilos to Amphipolis, the new seat of the king of Macedonia. Deserted and untouched by further urban development, Argilos has remained frozen in time, which is why its buildings are in such relatively pristeen condition. The portico itself has not yet been fully excavated, and according to the results of a three-metre deep geophysical survey, the structure appears to continue, and more discoveries thus await the archaeologists. 'We hope to excavate what we hope is the east side of the portico next year and it could unearth many more shops and insights into daily life in the once prosperous city. I'm very excited,' Professor Perreault told MailOnline.","The ruins were discovered on the site of the ancient city of Argilos .
Expert told MailOnline that units are so well-preserved that individual shops can be identified - including outlet that made and sold own olive oil .
Non-uniform design indicates that each owner designed and built his shop .

A stone boundary wall inset with plaques separates the pet cemetery from the rest of the estate. One commemorates the life of Candy, a yellow Labrador who died in 1958 after having belonged to Prince Philip for six years. Another is engraved with the name Sandringham Slipper - a black Labrador who died in 1980 after eight years as part of the royal family. Sandringham Brae, another black Lab, is described as 'a gentleman amongst dogs' on his grave, while roan Cocker Spaniel Sandringham Fern is remembered for being a 'tireless worker and mischievous character'.

However, he was laid to rest at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where he died. The Queen was left with just two Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Willow and Holly, and two Dorgis, Candy and Vulcan. The Dorgis are a cross-breed resulting from an unplanned liaison between a Corgi and Princess Margaret's Dachshund Pipkin. When at Buckingham Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a special boot room near the royal apartments, where they wander freely.

When the Queen is being fitted for a dress, Country Life reports, she carries a special magnet to pick up pins and save her precious Corgis from pricking their paws. At Balmoral, the young Elizabeth would take the Corgis out onto the moor to help find grouse. However, although the corgis were expert at locating the shot birds in the heather, they had difficulty retrieving them. So she would watch them wind the game and then rush over to retrieve the grouse herself. The Queen thinks of the names for all the puppies at the kennels.

"A North Carolina mother has been arrested and charged with sickening child abuse after allegedly locking her four children away in a room and intentionally starving them to the brink of death. Charlotte-Mecklenburg police arrested Ronika Bell, 28, and her partner, Deron Cuthbertson after she dumped her children aged 10 to six with her estranged husband and their biological father in Florida. Appalled at their gaunt and skeletal features, Joshua Bell tried to feed his kids, only to find they were too starved to swallow having been locked away for six months, so he rushed them to the ER for treatment. Scroll Down for Video . Arrested: Ronika Bell and her partner Deron Cuthbertson have been charged with felony counts relating to the alleged abuse of Bell's four children aged between 10-years-old and six . Bell abandoned her children to their father in September, having kept them from him for more than two years. It took a cross-state investigation till the weekend to take Bell and Cuthbertson into custody to be charged with the torture of Aniya, Zymir, Tasean and Dontre. Captain Jacquelyn Hulsey, of the Special Victims Division in Charlotte-Mecklenburg said they believe Bell and her 31-year-old partner, intentionally cooked food so that the children could smell it from their locked prison. 'The doorknobs had been manipulated so that the children could not get out,' said CMPD Capt. Jackie Hulsey in a news conference Tuesday morning. Amazed: Neighbors of Ronika Bell said they couldn't believe her arrest for child abuse - because they didn't know she had children . 'They were withheld food, they were withheld attention, and they were also occasionally physically beaten. The children, the information obtained from the children, is that there was plenty of food in the home, they were just now allowed access to it. They were not fed.; . Neighbors at Bell's home in Charlotte said they were stunned by the arrest because they never knew that she had a child, let alone four. 'I walk down to that corner all the time I never see anybody there,' said Beverly King a neighbor to WCNC. According to police, Bell dumped her children with Joshua Bell at his home in Pensacola, Florida. After he had rushed them to hospital he contacted the Escambia County Sheriff's Office in Florida who in turn contacted their counterparts in North Carolina. 'The children were ill and extremely thin the father tried to feed the children they became ill they could not hold down food. He took them to the hospital,' said Hulsey to WCNC. Shocking: (from left) Zymir, Aniya, Tasean and Dontré (front) were allegedly abused by their mother inside the home she shared with her partner Deron Cuthbertson . Two of the children required a lenghty stay in hospital - although all four are now with their father at home, healthy and at school. Joshua Bell spoke to WSCOTV about the harrowing moment he realized what his estranged wife had done to his children. 'It took everything in my power not to snap,' said Joshua Bell. 'I just cried. I cried myself to sleep.' Joshua Bell said when he first set eyes on his children he knew there was something wrong. 'Kids were skin and bones,' said the angry father to WSOCTV. 'You could see all their clothes hanging off of them, faces sunk in. My youngest, he had no comlexion at all. He was gray.' Home safe: The children are now safe and sound with their father Joshua Bell (pictured) at his home in Florida . He then described the moment he tried to feed them: 'They tried to eat like every couple of bites. They just started throwing up. Their body just wasn't used to food anymore.' Seven-year-old Dantre spent a week in intensive care and had two blood transfusions - but has now recovered. Captain Hulsey said: ""I can tell you medically speaking that this is not something they are going to recover from overnight, psychologically or physically."" “Why would a mother do this? I can’t answer that,” Hulsey said. “I don’t know what her intentions were.” Bell and Cutherbertson are charged with four counts of felony child abuse for prolonged abuse and starvation, police said. Bell and Cuthbertson are currently in jail being held under $75,000 bond for each of the four child abuse counts.","Ronika Bell, 28, charged along with her partner, Deron Cuthbertson, 31 .

"A  mother who suffered 13 miscarriages has put her wedding ring on sale so she can afford to adopt a little girl. Since giving birth to her son Elias 11 years ago, Zaundia Klingbeil, 33, and her husband Enoch have suffered devastating heartache, including losing their twin sons Ezekial and Lucas at 18 weeks. 'To hold your baby on your babies in your arms, and realize you will never know what they would have looked like on their graduation,' she told Valley News Live through tears. 'You will never experience what their favorite birthday cake is.' Scroll down for video .

They are now hoping to welcome the little girl soon . She added: 'If I had another baby that I loved half as much as I love our son, all the pain would be worth it, all of it.' The couple, from Fargo, North Dakota, might finally be getting their wish after they received a call from a couple expecting a baby girl, whom they want the Klingbeils to adopt. But there's a cost. The little girl, Elise, is expected to have expensive medical issues and the couple also needs to raise enough for adoption fees and travel, which they estimate will total around $8,000. To raise enough funds, Mrs Klingbeil decided to part with her beloved wedding ring. 'We just felt like it was something God really put in our laps, and really how can you say no?' she said. Loved: Klingbeil, pictured right with her son, put her wedding ring, pictured top left above her husband's wedding band, up for sale but donations from the community and local businesses have been rolling in .

Friends and strangers managed to raise more than $4,000 in donations on a gofundme page. A local business, with whom her husband has previously worked, has matched those funds, leaving her with $8,000. 'We have raised so much, which gives us the comfort of knowing our babies immediate needs are taken care of!' Klingbeil wrote on the gofundme page. She added that they will still be accepting donations up until Christmas because they are not yet sure how costly Elise's medical issues will be. The little girl is expected any day now, she said.

"David Beckham is being called out of retirement by the Government to mark the centenary of the Christmas Day football match between British and German troops . David Beckham could captain his country one more time against Germany to commemorate the centenary of the 1914 Christmas Day truce. The retired footballer is to be approached by the Government to mark the day British and Germans troops laid down their weapons and played football on No Man's Land. The Government wants Beckham, who acted as an ambassador for the 2012 Olympics and 2018 World Cup bids, to lead a team of British players and serving soldiers in a football match against the Germans on Boxing Day 2014. The game would be shown live on television as a way to capture the interest of the public in the centenary of the start of the First World War. Sir Bobby Charlton and Franz Beckenbauer, who faced each other in the 1966 World Cup Final, may also be among the football legends invited to join the event, reports the Sunday Times. A Department of Culture spokesman told the newspaper: 'The unofficial Christmas truce on the Western Front in 1914 was a poignant moment during the Great War. 'We are keen to see it marked in some way as part of the centenary project and staging a football match feels like the right way to do it.' The Christmas Day truce saw more . than 100,000 British and German soldiers lower their guns and leave the . trenches in the mud of No Man's Land. In some areas, soldiers on both sides merely held their fire throughout the day. But elsewhere, troops climbed out of their trenches and exchanging gifts and handshakes and . playing football. The match finished 3-2 to the Germans, according to the diaries of Kurt Zehmisch, a soldier in the 134th Saxons. More practically, soldiers used the time to reclaim their dead from no man's land and bury them behind the lines. In . the evening, soldiers of both sides sang carols and fighting . only resumed when fresh battalions were moved into the line. The impromptu battlefield football matches were recreated in this picture at Dale Barracks between German soldiers and Royal Welsh Fusiliers . The Christmas Day truce of 1914, showing German and British soldiers socialising . The football match, to be held at Messines, near Ypres in Belgium, is among ideas to be considered by the First World War advisory group, chaired by Culture Secretary Maria Miller. Members of the panel include authors Sebastian Faulks, author of Birdsong, and Pat Barker, who wrote the Regeneration Trilogy. Their First World War novels have become a staple of school teaching on the books and poetry inspired by the war. There will be six state occasions, school trips to battlefields and exhibitions backed by historians and the Government, which has set aside £50million for the commemorations.

"As a pulsating and compelling north London derby reached its final few minutes, one man rose to take centre stage. There were 85 minutes on the clock when Nabil Bentaleb swung in a hopeful cross which, in reality, should have been dealt with better. Neither Laurent Koscielny nor Per Mertesacker claimed it for their own. One man did, however. He is, of course, the man of the moment. He had dominated the pre-match talk, no one now able to avoid his obvious qualities. There is no keeping down Harry Kane at present. Certainly not when that Bentaleb cross arched its way through the air and met the head of Kane.

To beat the team from down the Seven Sisters Road and to go above them in the race for fourth place is one thing; to do so, as those Tottenham fans sing, with ‘one of their own’ made this a famous derby victory. Kane scored both goals and now has 22 for the season. We keep waiting for his rise to reach a plateau but he seems blissfully unaware of the fact. He simply keeps scoring: poachers’ goals, headed goals, penalty goals and long-range goals. The sheer range of finishing ability is testament to the work he has done on his game. Tim Sherwood deserves credit for blooding him but manager Mauricio Pochettino is quickly becoming English football’s greatest asset. He sees young English players and is perplexed by the reluctance by some in the game to try them. ‘For me, you watch the training session and afterwards you decide if the player deserves to play. I don’t look at the names or their years. When you work with a player, you can see the quality but you still have to give them the possibility to play. You have to take a decision as a manager. You need to take a risk.’ That risk has been rewarded and as Kane left the pitch, the ground serenaded him with that song: ‘He’s one of our own.’ The nation might soon claim the same. Even Arsene Wenger, amid his disappointment, could smile as the Arsenal manager said: ‘When you have scored the number of goals he has scored, if England don’t put him in there, someone will give him a passport from another country.’ Two-goal hero Kane shouts into the camera as he walks off the pitch at the end of a pulsating derby . Kane sends the home supporters into rapture as he wheels away in celebration after netting his 21st goal of the season . Tottenham academy graduate Kane roars in celebration after scoring his first north London derby goal on Saturday . Kane fires the ball past David Ospina  and the Arsenal defence to draw Tottenham level at White Hart Lane . Wenger was generous in praise but could not help reprimanding his own players. ‘Cheap goals,’ he almost spat out when analysing his defence. ‘He (Kane) was good, as always. He grows and he has good determination and doesn’t stop. He keeps going. The regret I have is that we gave him a cheap goal. It’s worrying that at the back with five minutes to go we are always making the same mistakes. Overall we defended with solidarity. But the biggest regret is that we didn’t have a big day and we can do much better.’ He was right, but nevertheless the movement and anticipation of Kane contributed to the embarrassment of Arsenal’s defence. And the visitors were curiously devoid of creativity for long periods. ‘Going forward we didn’t produce enough,’ added Wenger. ‘Were we too focused to defend? I think so.’ The fairy-tale script was some time in coming. Kane was quiet initially when it appeared as though a doggedly defensive Arsenal team might prevail. They scored on 11 minutes when Danny Welbeck tore past Danny Rose, finding Olivier Giroud, who opened his body up to shoot but skewed his strike to Mesut Ozil. The German did, in fact, have a big toe offside but with the officials oblivious, he simply executed the kind of deft volley which to him is second nature. However, Arsenal did little else after the goal as Tottenham poured forward. Rose went close twice, Bentaleb shot just wide and Ryan Mason brought a diving save from David Ospina on the half-hour. Mesut Ozil wheels away in celebration after opening the scoring for Arsenal at White Hart Lane in the north London derby . Arsenal were on the defensive, but curiously, they weren’t creaking. They looked at this stage an altogether more solid and better side than their previous incarnations. That said, there is always an obvious risk in inviting teams on to you and Arsenal are not yet masters of the art. Their solidity was already beginning to wane somewhat when they defended a 56th-minute corner. Mousa Dembele flicked it on and Ospina punched it away but only to the feet of Kane, who was lurking at the far post. Kane had made little impact until then but he was not to be denied his moment. Having eluded his marker, he struck decisively from close range and White Hart Lane roared once more. The stadium was as vociferous as it can be and Arsenal suddenly looked beleaguered. They responded with a lovely curling Welbeck strike which Hugo Lloris did well to tip away. Koscielny might then have scored from the resulting corner, given that he was granted a free header. Ospina was called back into action to make a fine save from Bentaleb on 64 minutes but it seemed as if honours would be shared. We had reckoned without the intervention of that man Kane. His plot lines grow increasingly implausible. Sooner or later, we will have to start believing in him.

"Former Virginia governor candidate Creigh Deeds is fighting for his life after he was brutally stabbed by his own 24-year-old son, who then killed himself - just one day after the younger man was committed to a psychiatric ward but released because there were no beds available. Deeds, a state senator, has been upgraded to fair condition at University of Virginia hospital after he was found stumbling away from his home in rural Bath County, Virginia, by a cousin who happened to be driving by. Deeds was stabbed multiple times in the head and torso and lost large amounts of blood. He was initially flown to the hospital in critical condition. The veteran Democratic state legislator's son Gus was found shot dead inside the family home. Gus had been evaluated by psychiatrists at a mental hospital on Monday, but could not be committed because there was no room at any mental health wards in all of western Virginia, according to reports. Scroll down for video . Creigh Deeds is in critical condition and is fighting for his life after he was stabbed at his home in rural Bath County, Virginia . Tension: Austin 'Gus' Deeds took a semester off school in 2009 to help his father Creigh on the campaign trail. They are seen here together traveling between campaign stops .

The Highland County Recorder reports that Austin 'Gus' Deeds attacked his father before shooting himself in the head at the politician's home in Millboro Springs. Police have not commented on a motive. Gus had been a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, which he attended off-and-on since 2007. He took a semester off school in 2009 to help his father with his losing campaign for governor. He was enrolled this year, but withdrew from the university last month. Administrators said he was a music major with a 'strong academic record.' On Monday, he was evaluated by psychiatrists in Williamsburg after an emergency commitment order was filed against him, a source told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Virginia State police surround the home of Senator Creigh Deeds in Millboro today to investigate the fatal incident . He was only released because there was no room for him at any psychiatric wards in western Virginia. On his Facebook page, Gus listed his political views as: 'Too busy with love to care.' He was one of four children of 55-year-old Deeds. Gus was arrested for alcohol possession in May 2009 when hew was 20 after police caught him at a house party near his home. Deeds is being treated at the University of Virginia Medical Center and is listed in critical condition.

Deeds rose to national fame during the . 2009 Virginia governor's race in which he lost by a landslide of nearly . 18 percentage points to Bob McDonnell. He and his wife of two decades, Pam, . divorced in February 2010 after the embarrassing loss turned him into a . punchline in some political circles. Deeds said his marriage to Pam, right, fell apart because of the rigors of his political career. The two divorced in February 2010 . In 2010 he told the Washington Post that the divorce was 'a casualty of a nearly 20-year pursuit of a lifelong ambition that kept him away from home.' He married Siobhan Lomax in a quiet ceremony in June 2012. Lomax, . 44, owns a boutique near the campus of Washington and Lee University in . Lexington, Virginia, where Deeds has been a visiting law professor . since 2010. Condolences immediately began to pour for Deeds and his family.

"In the village of Ricaurte, in northern Ecuador, close to the Colombian border, the Valencia family will this morning be crowding into the family farmhouse. Parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews and grandparents will all be there and all eyes will be fixed on the Boleyn Ground in east London. 'There's loads of them,' says Enner Valencia, now of West Ham but once of that parish. 'Loads! They all gather there to watch my games and they always call me afterwards. I think they transmit all their happiness to me.' The man dubbed Superman in his home country is not the first Ecuadorian to succeed in the Premier League — indeed, he could be facing his compatriot and namesake Antonio in West Ham's meeting with Manchester United. Enner arrived at the same time as Swansea's Jefferson Montero and he follows in the footsteps of Agustin Delgado and Ulises de la Cruz. West Ham striker Enner Valencia opens up about his family, hometown, the World Cup and life in London . Valencia joined West Ham last summer from Mexican side Pachuca for a reported £12 million fee . But he is the most celebrated. His rapid rise to global prominence has been extraordinary. Little more than a year ago he was still playing with Emelec in Ecuador before earning a move to CF Pachuca in Mexico in December 2013. He scored against England in an excellent display in a pre-World Cup friendly and added three more in the World Cup finals as Ecuador were narrowly eliminated in the first round. The 25-year-old moved to West Ham in the summer and last week was linked with a £15million move to Chelsea. Nowhere has this ascent been more positively received than in Ricaurte, though it was not always that way. He was the archetypal boy, chastised by his parents for the frequent occasions on which he would skip school to play football. 'I was always with a ball, or with a bottle, or with whatever we came across, always trying to get a game going,' he says. 'Loads of times I bunked off school to play. I told my parents I was going to school but I never got there. I went to play football. I've always been passionate about this game. My mum and dad were always telling me off about this. But my love for the game was stronger than that!' In other tasks, though, he was basically obedient. Coming from a rural family, he had farm chores to do, including milking the cows, and his father, Renberto, remembers he did his jobs dutifully. Enner Valencia poses with his large family in their home province of Esmeraldas . The Valencia family had a special TV feed to watch their golden boy score at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Football hotbeds do not come much hotter than Enner Valencia's home province of Esmeraldas. Esmeraldas is on the Colombian border which accounts for around three per cent of Ecuador's 15.2million population — yet this sweltering, poverty-stricken place boasted 10 members of the country's 23-man squad at last summer's World Cup. And that does not include team captain, Manchester United's Antonio Valencia, who was born in the Amazon but whose parents are from Esmeraldas. It is a remarkable production line which sees Esmeraldas stand apart. In a country where seven per cent of the population is of African descent, Ecuador's football team is almost 80 per cent black and Esmeraldas is the biggest Afro-Ecuadorian province. And until 2014 his had been a gentle rise. He left home to join Emelec, a team in the south of the country, at the age of 18 and rose through the ranks, winning the title in 2013 and being the top scorer in the Copa Sudamericana, the equivalent of the Champions League, a feat for which he earned his Superman sobriquet. Valencia was also the Mexican league's top scorer in his six months there. Suddenly he became the focus of a nation. During the World Cup, Ecuadorian TV was running live feeds from his family home to relay the atmosphere to the nation. His arrival at West Ham, along with Diafra Sakho, has propelled Sam Allardyce's team up the table, injecting frightening pace of which United will be wary this afternoon. It has also brought him to the attention of Champions League clubs. He almost missed his chance of the move to England after the World Cup, though. West Ham had contacted Pachucha in Mexico and fees were being agreed. The trouble was no one could track down Valencia, who was back in Ricaurte. 'I was with my family. I'd switched off the phone and wasn't taking any calls,' he says. 'In the end West Ham sent someone over because they had been calling over to Mexico to tell me to come and play in England.' London seems to suit him. He lives in Canary Wharf, in the same apartment block as goalkeeper Adrian. 'He has helped me a lot with the language, helped me at the club, helped me with getting used to being in England. He's always there to help with whatever I need.' However, Valencia is a keen learner. Unlike many foreign footballers new to England, he attends English classes every day. And what he likes most about London is the chance it gives him to assimilate. He can use the Tube or go out for a meal with his Ecuadorian wife, Sharon, without it being a major event. Valencia tussles with Liverpool midfielder Emre Can in the Premier League game at Anfield on January 31 . 'It's a lot easier over here compared to Mexico. If you go out in London, people know you and ask for a picture, but always politely. But in South America, in Mexico — no! They all crowd round and it's photo after photo. The culture is completely different.' Not that there is much time for socialising at present. Sharon gave birth to their daughter, Amelia, on Christmas Day, so nights are disrupted at present. He has a second daughter, Beira, who is three and lives in Ecuador. But fan culture is somewhat removed from his experiences in Latin America. He was well aware of the passionate reputation of West Ham fans — embarrassingly for the club he had seen the film Green Street, a fictionalised account of West Ham's hooligans. In real life the fans are somewhat more civil than their Latin American counterparts. 'It's completely different in Ecuador and Mexico. A lot tougher! You lose a game and you've got to be careful when you're leaving the stadium in case some nutter jumps out at you. Here, on the other hand, if you lose a game, the fans are still there asking if you'll sign a programme and that's something really nice about English football. They're a lot more friendly. The culture is completely different here.' Valencia scored three goals at the World Cup last year - two against Honduras and one against Switzerland . Having just settled into West Ham, he does not especially want to engage with the talk of Chelsea's interest. 'I found out about it from the social networks and from what my team-mates were saying,' he says. 'Nobody said anything definite to me. But if a team like Chelsea is interested in me, it's a big compliment. It makes me want to keep on getting better.' For now, though, there are more immediate challenges, such as the visit of Manchester United. His immersion into English culture has continued apace in recent days. 'I'm learning about the rivalries we've got here in West Ham,' he says. 'Some say the derby is against Tottenham, others say the matches against United are another kind of derby. So we've got to win it.' If they do, you can expect the celebrations at Upton Park to matched by the fiesta in Ricaurte. Valencia is ready and raring to go for West Ham ahead of the game with Manchester United on Sunday .

"Fight back: Dorothy Hendrix managed to shoot one of her suspected attackers before she was shot dead . A 76-year-old woman was killed in a shootout as a gang tried to rob her outside her South Carolina home in the early hours of Saturday. Dorothy Hendrix was shot twice by the gang of two men and a woman, but she managed to shoot one of her assailants in the stomach before dying of her wounds. Steven Hagood, Tereba Geer, and Bradacious Galloway have all been charged with murder. 'She fought. She was a fighter. She shot . him,' the victim’s brother, Ronnie Lollis, told WYFF News Channel 4. Ms Hendrix, who was known as Dot to her friends, had been returning to her Anderson County home at 1am when the gang allegedly tried to rob her. The 76-year-old fired at the group and one of them fired back, hitting Ms Hendrix in the abdomen and the arm. A neighbor called police after hearing the gunshots, but Ms Hendrix died outside her home while a relative held her hand. Hagood, who she shot in the stomach, was taken to hospital where he is under guard. As well as being charged with murder, the 33-year-old has been served with a family bench warrant for unpaid child support of $80,000. Attack: Police tape off the area around the home of Dorothy Hendrix who was killed in an attempted robbery . Shot: Steven Hagood was shot in the stomach during the alleged attack . The two other suspects, Geer, 26, and Galloway, 23, also face murder charges. Ms Hendrix, who volunteered at a bingo club, had applied for a carry and conceal weapon and learned to shoot after being robbed outside the same home in 2011. The robbers behind the earlier attack were never caught, and police have not said whether they believe the two incidents are connected. Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said: 'This was not a random act. The robbery was planned, and she was specifically targeted.' 'The trio had knowledge that Hendrix carried large sums of money home with her at night,' he added. Mr Lollis said his sister had learned to fire a gun after the earlier attack, and had a carry and conceal permit, according to News 13. 'She had been robbed right here at her . house, coming out of her house. That's what made her get her gun. I . don't understand why she wanted to keep coming back,' he said.

"A jewellery brand has unveiled their latest limited edition iPhone collection, decorated with the face of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Caviar phones, a Russian-Italian company specializing in bespoke iPhones, have designed a gold iPhone 6 called Supremo Putin II, which will set Putin-fans back £2,300. If you are a bit strapped for cash, no need to worry, there is a titanium version called Ti Supremo Putin ('Putin, you are supreme') for just £1,850. Scroll down for video . For his biggest fans: The limited edition Supremo Putin II iPhone 6 is available in Russia at a cost of £2,300 . Despite the unusual choice of decoration - and the jaw-dropping price tag - previous models from the Putinphone collections have sold out in record time. The iPhone 5 Supremo Putin, a limited edition design of which only 144 were made,  retailed at £2,730 and was gone within days of its release in June this year. The phones are designed by jewellery film Perla Penna for Caviar phones, and are only available in Russia. The Putinphones come in gold and titanium, the latter because 'it is he hardest, most pure metal in the world [reflecting the] indomitable force, unyielding will and steadfastness of Russia's leader'. Originally set out to produce a limited collection of 299 Supremo Putin II, Perla Penna and Caviar suspended production of the iPhone 6 design after protests from Putin's camp. Golden boy: The phone has been decorated with Putin's face, Russian Federation's crest and the first two lines of the national anthem, and also comes in titanium, called Ti Supremo Putin - 'Putin, you are supreme' That Crimea feeling: Caviar Phones tell prospective buyers of the Putinphone that they can expect 'priority service' when flashing the gadget in a bar as 'the worried international community sees the Russian president as an aggressive figure ready to take drastic steps' Super limited edition: Originally set out to produce a limited collection of 299 Supremo Putin II, production of the iPhone 6 design was suspended after protests from Putin's camp, and only just over 100 were made . Nyet: The President himself  does not approve of the Putinphones but will not do anything about it . The Russian president's press secretary Dmitry Peskov announced on Monday that Putin is 'negative' to the use of his image for commercial use, and despite adding that the President will not do anything to stop the Putinphones, Perla Penna and Caviar were quick to suspend production. 'After learning about the president’s discontent with the use of his portrait, we immediately ceased the production of the Caviar Supremo Putin II [Putinphone],' Caviar’s press secretary, Anna Lobova, told Russian newspaper Izvestia. 'Though we planned to manufacture 299 items, there will be no more phones made and those already produced will be the only ones.' However, as now only just over 100 Supremo Putin II iPhone 6 have been made, the item is expected to gain even more popularity among the richest of Putin's fans. The company has even used Russia's recent actions in Ukraine to promote the Putinphones, claiming that the world's fear of Putin will be transferred to the owner of the device. 'Place a phone with a picture of Putin on it on a bar counter somewhere in Nice or Monte Carlo, and you can expect to get priority service,' a Perla Penna press release on the iPhone 5 collection claims. 'The worried international community sees the Russian president as an embodiment of power, robustness and strength, an uncompromising and aggressive figure ready to take drastic steps'.","Russian-owned Italian jewellers have designed a Putin phone .

"Roy Hodgson says he will listen to Brendan Rodgers’ concerns when he picks Daniel Sturridge for England next month and take into account his recovery programme. But the England manager conceded that the international schedule means he can’t always look after players in the same way the clubs do. Sturridge will be back in the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and the friendly against Italy, the first time he has trained under Hodgson since suffering a thigh injury in September while on England duty. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge will return to international duty next month for the first time after injury . Sturridge celebrating with team-mate Alberto Moreno (right) after scoring during their win over Crystal Palace . Liverpool manager Rodgers subsequently said he was ‘disappointed’ that Sturridge trained when he needed an extra recovery day and said the England manager had assumed that ‘one recovery fits everyone.’ Hodgson claimed England could not be blamed for Sturridge’s injury problem and denied that they work any differently from Liverpool. ‘No we don’t. That’s another myth,’ he said. ‘We also like to give players a second-day recovery when we can. But it’s much less obvious that we can do that because of the shortage of time we get between games. ‘Of course if you have a week between games you can give two days off, you can give three days off if you want. We can’t. But that’s not a particular thing. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is concerned after Sturridge got injured with England last year . England boss Roy Hodgson has insisted he will listen to Rodgers and Liverpool about Sturridge . 'It was unfortunate that Daniel got injured as he did and we were sad about that but he’s had a few injuries since then and I haven’t seen too many people writing about that. ‘The other three muscles injuries he’s picked up? Are they due to England and the way we work? I don’t think so. It’s just one of those things. ‘If I hear he’s having a special programme and needs to do certain things, we’ll take it into consideration. Of course we will. ‘If he’s got a special programme our medical people will know that because they’re in contact with the Liverpool medical people.’","Roy Hodgson is set to pick Daniel Sturridge for England duty next month .

"Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark is up against the winner of the Man Booker Prize for a dubious honour in the literary world – the Bad Sex In Fiction award. The shortlist for the prize, created by Literary Review, features ten works, including Wark’s novel The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle and the Booker-winning The Narrow Road to the Deep North by Australian Richard Flanagan. Organisers say the idea is to draw attention to ‘poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them’. Kirsty Wark, pictured, has been nominated for the Literary Review's Bad Sex Award for 2014 . Wark’s novel includes the passage: ‘I had never imagined that I was capable of wanton behaviour, but it was as if a dam within me had burst and we made love that day and night like two people starved, slowly suffused with more and more pleasure, exploring and devouring every inch of each other, so as not to miss one single possibility of passion.’ Announcing the shortlist, the magazine said: ‘The judges also considered Andrew Marr’s Head of State, which started arrestingly – “they bucked like deer and squirmed like eels. And after that, vice-versa” – but failed to sustain its early promise.’ The prize will be awarded on December 3.","Newsnight presenter in the running for the  'bad sex in fiction' prize .

"A carer who secretly buried a dead man in a rockery so she and his wife could continue to claim his benefits could be sent back to jail because falling gold prices mean she can’t repay the money. Boqer-Ore Adie, 44, and Rebekah Sturdey, 57, were jailed earlier this year after they claimed £77,318 in benefits in Geoffrey Sturdey's name for nearly four years after he died. They had buried him in the garden of the Sturdeys' isolated farm near Tregaron, West Wales, after he died suddenly of natural causes. The last confirmed sighting of him was in October 2008, when he was 60. Buried: Boger-Ore Adie who  buried Geoffrey Sturdey (pictured) in a rockery so she and his wife could claim his benefits could be sent back to jail because falling gold prices mean she can’t repay the money . Family: Wife Rebekah (left), 56, claimed he'd gone travelling around Europe to explain his absence. Boqer-Ore Adie’s daughter Hazel, 21, (right) pleaded not guilty which was accepted by the prosecution. Her stepsister Karmel admitted preventing the burial and was given a suspended sentence . Both women have since been released, but now Adie faces being returned to prison unless she repays  £46,116 - which she used to buy gold bullion only for it to fall in value, Swansea Crown Court heard. A proceeds of crime hearing was told that Adie, who was a registered carer for Mr Sturdey before his death, had assets worth £70,00 in gold coins and cash. However, the court heard Adie said she had sold the gold and had only made £37,545 due to a fall in prices. She said she couldn’t get hold of the remaining £8,571 in time for this week's deadline. Judge Paul Thomas said he would give her a further three months to come up with the money, or face a 12 month prison sentence. Grave: Adie and Rebekah Sturdey had buried Mr Sturdeyin the garden of the couple's isolated farm near Tregaron, West Wales, after he died suddenly of natural causes . Adie was jailed for 20 months in February alongside Mrs Sturdey for wrongly claiming benefits after hiding Mr Sturdey's body in a makeshift garden grave at the farm where the couple ran a religious sect. The Sturdeys set up the community at their 20-acre farm called Beth Berithnear, and Adie lived there with her daughter Hazel and her stepdaughter Karmel. The group studied the Old Testament and believed Jesus would soon return to the earth. Mr Sturdey said that when he died he wanted to be buried in the rockery so he would be able to rise from the dead. After he passed away Mrs Sturdey, Adie and Karmel dug a grave and buried him in his chosen spot - but failed to notify the authorities of his death. Officials became suspicious after thousands of pounds of disability allowance and pension credits continued to be paid in Mr Sturdey's name. Mrs Sturdey lied to benefits investigators, telling them that her husband had gone on a touring holiday around Europe. However, Mr Sturdey did not have a valid passport and a specialist police search was launched at the cost of £20,000. Investigation: Mr Sturdey was dug up and examined so police could rule out foul play before being returned to his grave in the rockery, in accordance with his wishes . Falling value: The court heard Adie had sold the gold and had only made £37,545 back due to a fall in prices . A court was told his 'remarkably well-preserved body' was found buried under the rockery. He was dug up and examined so police could rule out foul play before being returned to his grave in the rockery, in accordance with his wishes. Sturdey and Adie admitted fraud and conspiracy to prevent his lawful and decent burial. Karmel Adie, 26, also admitted preventing the burial. The pair were jailed for 20 months earlier this year and have since been released from prison. Mrs Sturdey has repaid her share of the money. Karmel Adie was given nine-month suspended sentence. Hazel Adie, 21, pleaded not guilty which was accepted by the prosecution. Swansea Crown Court heard Hazel was only 15 at the time and was 'under the influence' of the older women. Prosecutor Huw Rees explained the group's unusual domestic set-up. He said: 'Their home contained a large number of religious books. 'They were not part of any organised group but they studied the Bible particularly the Old Testament and Adie had taught herself Hebrew. 'Mr Sturdey had chosen his own burial plot where he expected to be raised from the dead. 'The group expected Jesus's return to earth after his death.'","Boger-Ore Adie, 44, and Rebekah Sturdey, 57, buried Geoffrey Sturdey, 60 .

"A surge in testosterone in newborn boys just hours after birth could be the solution to the age-old mystery that is the difference between the male and female brains. Called the Hershey Kiss protein by researchers, the surge only affects the male brain, a new study by the University of Otago has found. The study published in the Journal of Neuroscience observed a small group of neurons linked to fertility are only active in male newborn mice, and not females. Kisspeptin - where the 'Kiss' in the name originated - is a small protein which stimulates a certain type of neurons, a process that researchers found only occurred in males. New research suggests a release of testosterone shortly after baby boys are born could account for the differences between the male and female brains . These neurons are Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and are cells that control the release of reproductive hormones from the brain's pituitary gland. The molecule was originally named after the Hershey Kiss chocolate by US cancer researchers based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, who at the time were unaware of its role in fertility. The Otago study also found that when kisspeptin binds to specific nerves it kick-starts a brief but powerful testosterone surge in male babies within five hours of birth, causing their brains to develop differently from females right form the get-go. This could have implications on the neurological disorders from which men and women suffer. Called Hershey Kisses, the protein could also shed light on the neurological disorders from which men and women suffer . The study's leader Allan Herbison said the findings highlight the role kisspeptin can play in controlling fertility. 'Not only does kisspeptin signalling act as a master switch for puberty and ovulation, we now show how in the first hours of drawing breath it also triggers our brains to develop differently according to our sex,' he said. The study was carried out by Professor Herbison with Jenny Clarkson from the Centre for Neuroendocrinology in collaboration with researchers in Canada and Germany.","A new study has found a surge of testosterone released into newborn baby boys' brains .

That's 2,000 pounds of the product grown by farmer Randy Williams of Fireweed Farm in Prosser, Wash . Williams has been cultivating the crop all summer. USA Today reports that at retail prices, Williams' crop could be valued as high as $6 million. 'It's just like regular farming - you grow in the spring and summer, harvest in the fall and then you go to Cabo for the winter,' cracked Greg James, who publishes Marijuana Venture, an industry magazine. James has helped to advertise the sale. Only state-certified processors will legally be allowed to buy the crop. It can not be sold directly to consumers. The plants reach a dozen feet in height. They were grown in south-central Washington in the area's wine region. Washington only began allowing recreational sale of marijuana this summer and consumer demand has kept store shelves bare. At retail prices, Williams' crop could be valued as high as $6 million . This year's outdoor harvest could flood the market and drive down prices. Because there is no need to pay for sunlight as indoor pot farmers must do, outdoor harvests can be bigger and cost less to grow.

"Undercover journalist Mazher Mahmood has tonight been unmasked in a BBC documentary, despite an 11th hour attempt by him to block the broadcaster from showing his image. The Panorama programme, featuring up-to-date pictures of the 'Fake Sheikh', heard from former celebrity stings and associates of Mr Mahmood, who claimed that he set them up and targeted them unfairly. Among them was former London's Burning actor and child star John Alford, who spent nine months in prison after he claims Mr Mahmood entrapped him into supplying cocaine. Scroll down for video . Undercover journalist Mazher Mahmood (seen in recent footage) has tonight been unmasked in a BBC documentary, despite an 11th hour attempt by him to block the broadcaster from showing his image. The Panorama programme, featuring up-to-date pictures of the 'Fake Sheikh', heard from former celebrity stings and associates of Mr Mahmood, who claimed that he set them up and targeted them unfairly . The reporter's elaborate set-ups led to the exposure of dozens of people, from hapless royals to hardened criminals while he worked for the now defunct News of the World.. He is pictured while posing as a Sheikh in the 1990s . While working for the News of The World, the investigative journalist fooled Mr Alford into thinking he was a movie producer who could make him £1million working alongside his idols Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone. But the sting resulted in him being sent to jail, leaving his life in tatters and Mr Alford on the brink of suicide. The reporter's elaborate set-ups led to the exposure of dozens of people, from hapless royals to hardened criminals while he worked for the now defunct News of the World. The Crown Prosecution Service has now confirmed that although no-one is currently in prison as a result of Mr Mahmood's investigations, it will be looking back at operations carried out by the reporter which resulted in prosecutions. Mr Mahmood told the BBC that he had used legitimate investigatory methods and had brought many individuals to justice as a result. On Friday, the reporter launched a High Court challenge to prevent his image from being broadcast. Mr Mahmood had argued in court that revealing his current appearance would breach his human rights by exacerbating the existing risk to his safety caused by his investigative work. Although the High Court did not grant Mr Mahmood an injunction to stop the screening on Monday - a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal - the broadcaster pulled the programme until new information put forward by Mr Mahmood's lawyers could be evaluated. The Panorama programme instead went ahead tonight. It heard from Steve Grayson, a former associate of Mr Mahmood, who claimed that they created newspaper stories to target celebrities unfairly, including  Page Three glamour model Emma Morgan. In the 1990s the pair worked together to convince the model she was being offered a lucrative contract for a Middle East bikini calendar. Among them was former London's Burning actor and child star John Alford, who spent nine months in prison after he claims Mr Mahmood entrapped him into supplying cocaine . Former Page Three glamour model Emma Morgan was also caught out by the Fake Sheikh, and says her career suffered as a result . Mr Mahmood was the key prosecution witness against former N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos, but the case collapsed in July when judge Alistair McCreath told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that there were 'strong grounds' to believe that Mr Mahmood had lied . Instead, Mr Grayson said, they were trying to expose her as a 'drug pusher'. He described how they had hired a man called Billy to act as her bodyguard and assist them in the deal. Ms Morgan, who was 24 at the time she was covertly filmed taking cannabis and cocaine, claims she was pressured for several hours to later supply the pair with the class A drug which she obtained from 'Billy'. But Mr Grayson said: 'He is a drug dealer, we're drug dealers, we have paid this guy to supply the drugs to give to her.' Billy told Panorama: 'The only real criminal was Mazher Mahmood, he gave me the money to buy the cocaine. Ms Morgan added: 'I was a fool, I was naive. To be foolish isn't a crime, to be naive isn't a crime, to do what he did is criminal. 'I haven't had the career I should have had. I haven't had the life I should have had. He's a horrible, horrible man.' Solicitor Mark Lewis helped uncover the phone hacking at the News of the World and is representing some of Mr Mahmood's targets . Former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has also called for the reporter's record to be re-examined . Mr Grayson was eventually fired from the News of the World for faking images of the Beast of Bodmin Moor. Mr Mahmood has denied acting improperly, and accused the Panorama account of events of being wrong and misleading. Mr Mahmood was the key prosecution witness against former N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos, but the case collapsed in July when judge Alistair McCreath told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that there were 'strong grounds' to believe that Mr Mahmood had lied on the witness stand and 'had been manipulating the evidence'. Mr Mahmood, who denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged, is currently suspended by The Sun and a number of cases in which he was set to be a witness have been dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service while investigations continue. Solicitor Mark Lewis helped uncover the phone hacking at the News of the World and is representing some of Mr Mahmood's targets. He told Panorama: 'The damage that's caused, the damage for people's livelihoods, the amount of people sent to prison, it's a far more serious thing than phone hacking ever was.' And former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith called for the reporter's record  to be re-examined. 'The fact that somebody who has been accused by a judge of apparently of not telling the truth may be instrumental in those convictions would certainly be a reason to look at those convictions again and to examine them to see whether they are safe.' The CPS has since said it had identified three cases involving evidence from Mr Mahmood where there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. It told Panorama that no-one was currently in prison as a result of Mr Mahmood's evidence, but it was also looking at past cases. Mr Mahmood said he had spent his career investigating crime and wrongdoing, and had conducted his investigations legitimately, bringing many to justice. He added that the criticism levelled at him usually came from the people he had exposed or those he had worked with and who had 'an axe to grind'. Panoram also heard from Steve Grayson, a former associate of Mr Mahmood, who claimed that they created newspaper stories to target celebrities unfairly . John Bryan, an American financial manager who was pictured kissing Sarah Ferguson's feet in the 'toegate scandal' also appeared on the programme, claiming Mr Mahmood had set him up . MailOnline has contacted Mr Mahmood's representatives for comment. Last week, Mr Mahmood's counsel Adam Speker told the High Court judge that showing his current appearance in a broadcast which was likely to be watched by millions was intrusive and not in the public interest. Because of his work, threats had been made to Mr Mahmood, who lived a reclusive life in secure accommodation with 24-hour surveillance and where his neighbours did not know his real identity, he said. The programme, was described by Mr Mahmood's counsel, Justin Rushbrooke QC as a 'hatchet job', . Ahead of the broadcast a  BBC spokesperson said: 'The BBC had intended to broadcast Panorama, Fake Sheikh: Exposed tonight following the Court of Appeal's decision earlier today to allow the BBC to broadcast images of Mazher Mahmood. 'Shortly before transmission Mr Mahmood's lawyers submitted new information relating to one of the cases in the programme which, as a responsible broadcaster, the BBC needs to evaluate. Once this has been done we will broadcast Fake Sheikh: Exposed, including recent footage of Mr Mahmood, as planned.' Mr Mahmood later said: 'I hope the BBC will see sense and postpone any broadcast until the conclusion of any proceedings. 'I hope then that they will review and consider the evidence properly (and not threaten broadcast without the full facts) and stop the broadcast. This may be a vain hope. They are determined to condemn me whatever the truth. 'In the meantime, if they do go ahead, I would ask anyone interested to keep an open mind on any allegations they do indeed make.' In 2011, Mahmood exposed the Pakistan cricket . cheats whose fixing scandal rocked the sport. His . trademark disguise was born in 1984 when he was sent to expose a vice . ring operating out of a hotel near the Birmingham National Exhibition . Centre. He decided to pose as a wealthy young Arab looking to buy a Ferrari. With . a huge gold Rolex on his wrist and a deferential entourage of hired . hands surrounding him, the 'King of the Stings' found he could get . access to pretty much any well-known individual. In . 2005, Princess Michael of Kent was exposed by the Fake Sheikh making . some startling comments about fellow royals. She described the late . Princess Diana as a 'nasty'  woman and said Prince Charles had merely . married a 'womb'. But his career has featured some high-profile failures. In 2002, he claimed to have uncovered a plot to kidnap . Victoria Beckham and her sons and ransom them for £5million. Five men . were arrested. But the case collapsed as the main witness, a Kosovan . asylum seeker, was deemed unreliable and had been paid £10,000 for the . story. In 2006, he clashed with George Galloway, who claimed the reporter attempted to trap him by posing as an Islamic businessman. The Respect MP responded by circulating photos on the internet Mahmood - threatening his anonymity - after the journalist failed in his bid to ban their . publication.","Panorama programme featured up-to-date pictures of the reporter .

"Real Madrid are considering whether to bid for Radamel Falcao at the end of the season with the Colombian striker unlikely to stay at Manchester United after his disappointing loan spell at the club. But Monaco, Falcao's owners, say that they have no concerns regarding Falcao’s future as there are plenty of major teams who have contacted them to take the 29-year-old striker. Falcao has scored just four goals and had just 14 starts for United since joining in loan on transfer deadline day – and United are not expected to take up their £43m option.

But Monaco vice president Vadim Vasilyev said: ‘It’s up to Manchester United to take a decision but I’m not worried for him because we have interest from other big clubs. 'Sometimes it’s just little thing that matter in football. When the technical quality is there, the mentality is there, sometimes it’s just the confidence of the coach or just little details. We tend to overreact if somebody doesn’t do well for a few years. ‘Had he stayed here – I know he wanted a bigger challenger and Man United is a great club – one of our problems is efficiency in front of goal. If he was here we would not be fourth, we would be first or second.’ Louis van Gaal is unlikely to make the forward's deal permanent and Real Madrid are potentially interested .

"A woman who sliced the genitals of an 18-year-old-boy with a box cutter while under the influence of marijuana made a deal with prosecutors and will avoid jail time. Bonita Lynn Vela, 35, Franklin, Indianapolis pleaded guilty to battery and criminal confinement after she attacked her daughter's teenage boyfriend with a box cutter after believing he molested her 2-year-old son on December 28. She held the teen for three hours at a neighbors mobile home. Indy Star reports that on Thursday a Johnson County judge gave Vela a 16 month sentence. Sliced penis: Bonita Lynn Vela was sentenced to 10 months GPS monitoring,  6 months probabtion, and anger management after she sliced an 18-year-old man's genitals, accusing him of molesting her toddler son . She must spend 10 months on home detention with a GPS monitoring and six months on probation. Vela will also need to undergo anger management counselling. Vela was arrested in December after holding the 18-year-old man, he daughter's boyfriend, captive for three-and-a-half hours with the help of two others at a trailer park in Franklin, Indiana. The victim told police that the woman was ‘out of control’ and ‘extremely mad’. He adamantly denied her accusations of molestation. Vela admitted that she had smoked marijuana and was unsure whether she had taken any other drugs according to a Johnson County Sheriff report. She told police that she had been at a friend’s house when she took the drugs and by 3 a.m. she became angry and demanded that one of her friends retrieve the 18-year-old to confront him. Two people held the young man down as Vela threatened him, saying she would ask friends to ‘take him out’ with guns by tying him to a tree, shooting him in the head and leaving his body to be eaten by animals, the victim told police. Vela then allegedly gave him an ultimatum – allow her to cut his penis or be killed or have his penis cut completely off. Held captive: The man was held down by two people as Vela allegedly threatened and cut him at a trailer park on this street in Franklin, Indiana . According to the police report she said she ‘wanted to scar him so that he would have to look at it every time that he had sex in the future’. As the confrontation went on, Vela got increasingly angry, shouting at him to admit to the abuse of her son. He begged them not to call the police, denying her angry accusations. She said that if ‘didn’t have anything to hide then he should let her “cut him”,’ and that whatever happened he was never come back. Out of control': The victim told police that Vela gave him an ultimatum: allow her to cut his penis with a box cutter or be killed (file photo) The 18-year-old said he thought the trio would ‘go to great lengths to hurt or kill him’ and that one of them had filmed the incident which left him with a deep cut to the penis. Vela told investigators that she only meant to scare the young man and never intended to hurt him. He was taken to Johnson Memorial Hospital for his injuries caused by the weapon, which is usually used to cut tape that holds boxes together.

"Hero: Wing Commander Forest 'Tommy' Yeo-Thomas, has been identified as the inspiration behind Ian Fleming's character James Bond . His identity has remained a secret for decades, as one would expect of an international man of mystery. But after years of speculation, the debate over who it was that Ian Fleming based his character James Bond upon may finally have been resolved. One of Britain's greatest spies of the Second World War, Wing Commander Forest 'Tommy' Yeo-Thomas, has been identified as the inspiration behind 007. A new biography of Yeo-Thomas claims that, like Bond, he surrounded himself with women and ruthlessly saw off his enemies. And it suggests that many of his real-life adventures are recreated in Fleming's novels. Yeo-Thomas, who was known by the code name White Rabbit, was parachuted into occupied France three times before being captured and tortured by the Gestapo. He was taken to Buchenwald concentration camp but managed to escape and reach the Allied lines. Historian Sophie Jackson discovered Yeo-Thomas's link to Bond in recently declassified documents at the National Archives, in West London. The dossier includes a memo from May 1945 in which Fleming, who also worked in intelligence during the war, informs colleagues of Yeo-Thomas's escape from the Gestapo. Yeo-Thomas and Fleming worked in different units and this is the first time a connection has been established between the two men. Miss Jackson, a former editor of History magazine, explores the link in her book, Churchill's White Rabbit: The True Story Of A Real-Life James Bond. 'It shows that Fleming was interested in the case of Yeo-Thomas and had been following it,” she told the Sunday Telegraph. 'Fleming picked up the story and was interested in it. Ladies man: Daniel Craig's James Bond frolics in the water with Eva Green. A biography of wartime hero Wing Commander Forest 'Tommy' Yeo-Thomas reveals that he surrounded himself with women, just like Bond . Shooting star: Like James Bond, Yeo-Thomas always carried a weapon. In Paris, he once shot an enemy agent at close range and threw him into a river . 'On top of that, there are other significant parallels between Yeo-Thomas and Bond, in their personal life, their relationships with women and attitudes towards women and the way Yeo-Thomas acted as a secret agent. He acts in a way we think of fictional spies acting. 'Some of the sequences that Yeo-Thomas went through are things which are then portrayed in James Bond. And these were experiences that Fleming knew about.' Miss Jackson points to several similarities between Yeo-Thomas's war record and sequences in Bond novels. In the first Bond novel Casino Royale and the recent movie of the same name, for example, 007 is tortured by his enemies in the same way that the Gestapo treated Yeo-Thomas. In From Russia With Love there is a scene where Bond is on the Orient Express, having dinner with an enemy agent, who is masquerading as an ally. This scene echoes Yeo-Thomas's own experience on a mission, when he was on a train in occupied France and engaged himself in conversation with Klaus Barbie, a notorious Nazi known as the 'Butcher of Lyon'. Memo: James Bond author Ian Fleming, who also worked in intelligence during the war, informed colleagues of Yeo-Thomas's escape from the Gestapo in this 1945 document . Man of mystery: Yeo-Thomas tries on a trilby hat in 1946. He regularly wore disguises, one of many techniques which echo tactics used by Bond in the Fleming novels . Yeo-Thomas used a range of techniques to escape or evade his enemies, including jumping from a train, strangling a guard, wearing disguises and riding in a hearse. These methods echo tactics later used by Bond. And, like Bond, Yeo-Thomas always carried a weapon. In Paris, he once shot an enemy agent at close range and threw him into a river. Yeo-Thomas is said to have been charming and attractive, like his fictional counterpart, and the main members of his personal cell were all women. He never officially married his partner, Barbara, who he met during the war – although she changed her name to his – because he was unable to obtain a divorce from his estranged wife, Lillian, who was living in occupied France. Yeo-Thomas's wartime exploits took their toll. He was affected by recurring nightmares and illness after the war and died in 1964, aged 62. Inspired: Author Ian Fleming at his desk in 1958. He informed intelligence colleagues of Yeo-Thomas's escape from the Gestapo in a memo in May 1945 .","Bond author Ian Fleming briefed intelligence colleagues on the exploits of Wing Commander Forest 'Tommy' Yeo-Thomas .

"Getting a parking fine is a bad experience at the best of times. But getting one you haven't earned - that's even worse. This was the reality for Brisbane woman Julie Small last week, when she paid a visit to her local shopping mall during her work lunch break. However, what she didn't realise at the time was that the dashboard camera (dashcam) installed in her car would help her case against the parking company that tried to rip her off. Scroll down for video . Julie Small received an $88 parking fine last week even though she had a valid ticket in her car . Speaking to A Current Affair Ms Small revealed her outrage when she returned to her car at Market Plaza Shopping Centre in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, to find a parking fine on her windscreen - despite being back before the two hour limit. 'To do this sort of thing to unwitting people, I just think it's criminal,' she told the program. Footage from Ms Small's dashcam shows her switching off the engine just before 12 o'clock last Friday, at which point she put the paid two hour ticket in her car and went about her business. The woman returned to an $88 fine (left) she wasn't entitled to, but luckily her dashcam (right) had recorded the time she left her car . But, the $88 fine she received was time-stamped at 12.39 - well before she was due to return around 2pm. When she brought this up with an employee at a nearby office, Ms Small didn't get the reaction she was hoping for. 'I went over to the employee who works for the company and I asked her could she explain why I got fined when I had an unexpired ticket. 'She told me that I had an expired ticket - she couldn't care less. She just stood there and blatantly lied to me,' Ms Small revealed. The ticket was issued just 40 minutes after she left her car, despite her having paid the full far for two hours . Luckily for her the parking company have since dropped the fine, but the savvy driver expressed her dismay over the fact that other motorists may have been caught out by the same tricks. 'I'm just glad that I have the evidence and I'm really sorry for the people who have been caught and had no evidence,' she said. '(It's) definitely revenue raising, I mean there's other ways that you could police a carpark,' Ms Small continued.","Julie Small got a parking ticket in a two hour zone after less than an hour .

"A married couple  were paid £120,000 for four months hospital work just weeks after receiving £1million in taxpayer-funded redundancy payouts from the NHS, it was revealed today. Chris Reed and Karen Straughair are at the centre of a national row over the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes  before walking straight into another role. The managers earned £120,000 between them while in temporary management posts at hospitals in Leeds, West Yorkshire. But it has emerged that just two months before starting in the city, they had received payments totalling £1million after their previous health service jobs in the North East were abolished. Critics today called the salaries an 'outrageous example of the 'revolving-door' culture in the NHS' while a Leeds MP said it was 'entirely wrong'. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust earning £120,000 - months after a combined £1m payoff . It came as MailOnline exclusively revealed today that the NHS is rehiring more than 50 staff a month who have been given redundancy pay-outs. New figures show that in just eight months the number of managers who have returned after being paid off leapt by 10 per cent to 4,300. This latest case involving married Mr Reed and Ms Straughair came to work at Leeds' hospital trusts in June last 2013 after their previous roles, as chief executives at primary care trusts, disappeared due to NHS reforms in April last year. Back in work: The married couple were taken on by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust after benefiting from a NHS reshuffle . Bosses had previously refused to say how much the couple had been paid while working for the trust as interim chief executive and recovery director. But, it had been revealed that Mr Reed received £70,000, including pension entitlements, and Ms Straughair £50,000. Both worked at Leeds hospitals between June and October last year. Previously it has been revealed that Ms Straughair was paid more than £605,000 in redundancy from her top job at NHS South of Tyne and Wear. Mr Reed received more than £345,000 when NHS North of Tyne was wound up. The pair came under criticism last years when news of their large redundancy packages came to light, critics said payouts should be capped and recouped when staff are reemployed soon after being let go. On an online forum for an NHS trade publication, one critic at the time posted: 'Surely a relevant question is how come two former Chief Executives, effectively Mr and Mrs NHS Tyne and Wear can pocket hundreds of thousands in redundancy payments and then get relatively swiftly re-employed by the NHS on mega high salaries.' There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing, but the case sparked national controversy when details first emerged last year - and the latest revelation has prompted further anger. Dia Chakravarty, political director at the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another outrageous example of the 'revolving door' culture in the NHS, which hits taxpayers twice - once in the form of pay-offs and then again in the form of new salaries. 'This is exactly the sort of bad management and lack of foresight we simply cannot afford in the public sector, particularly at a time when hard-pressed families are having to budget to make ends meet.' Last month the Government vowed to recoup similar 'golden goodbyes' paid to public sector workers earning more than £100,000 who return to the same part of the public sector within 12 nonths of taking redundancy. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt argues the NHS reforms have saved £1.5billion a year, despite thousands of people given payouts returning to work in the health service . Greg Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, said: 'We already know about the scandalous sum that this couple were paid from NHS budgets in redundancy, then came back into the NHS in similar positions, earning good salaries as well. 'That's entirely wrong and people will be rightly outraged at a time when the pressure on these budgets is huge.' He said the situation 'must never be allowed to happen again' and he was glad the Government was legislating to prevent it. A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said the couple were paid in line with the roles they were fulfilling.","Chris Reed and Karen Straughair given total of £1m in payoffs from NHS .

"A kangaroo with a love for pictures has surprised a trio of British tourists by demanding a selfie.

"When a businessman from Brisbane was offered the once in a lifetime opportunity to meet President Barack Obama he knocked it back for one sole reason – his wife wasn’t invited to come along too. Devoted husband Phil Hogan, who has been married to Michelle for almost 21 years, said he made a vow a long time ago that weekends were for family time and he wouldn't go anywhere without his beloved. ‘I’ve been in hospitality all my life and have been invited to a lot of things but the number one most important thing in my life is my family. ‘I worked out way back a rule that weekends are for family time, I don’t go to anything unless my wife is invited,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Devoted husband Phil Hogan has been married to Michelle for almost 21 years . Mr Hogan, seen here holding his former business partner Pat Rafter's favourite rum bottle before a game of Veterans Rugby, said he turned down meeting President Obama because he wants to see his wife . Mr Hogan received an invitation from the White House on Monday to attend a speech given by the US President on Saturday morning in Brisbane, as part of Obama's visit to Australia for the G20 summit, and he immediately emailed to ask if he could bring his wife along too. The bar owner, who runs Jade Buddha in Brisbane’s city centre, revealed his wife ‘was annoyed’ that he’d turned down the opportunity for her. ‘She’ll love me for it really though and it wasn’t up to her, it was up to me,’ he said. Mr Hogan received his invitation to listen to Obama talk at The University of Queensland on Saturday . Mr Hogan wrote a polite email response to the White House, in which he stated ‘I’m a big fan and everything’, explained his family policy and how his wife is a solicitor who once worked for the DPP for women and children. ‘My point being that she’s not a terrorist or anything. I asked politely if they could swing us an extra invite,’ he laughed. Mrs Hogan is now a stay-at-home mum who helps raise their four children - Chloe, Ella, Patrick and Abbey. ‘They said it was against security protocol as the guest list had already been closed off. I said “that’s fine, no worries”.’ Mr Hogan says his wife Michelle, seen here on holiday in Las Vegas, is the most beautiful woman in Brisbane . Phil and Michelle Hogan have been married for almost 21 years and have four children together called Chloe (centre back), Ella (back left), Patrick (back right) and Abbey (bottom left) US Predient Obama will be in Brisbane this weekend for the G20 summit . Incredibly, Mr Hogan then asked the White House to pass on a note to Obama that offered him an open invitation to come down to his bar. ‘I said “if you are out and about swing by Jade Buddha”,’ he joked as he revealed his bar is throwing a secret service themed party this Saturday in honour of the G20. ‘I’m hoping the real ones come along and that there’s not a shoot-out in the room. We’re hoping to get Abbott, Putin and Obama down on the decks and sort out all the world’s problems with me mediating, it will work,’ he laughed. Previous celebrity visitors to Mr Hogan's bar include Kim Kardashian and Justin Timberlake. The couple first met at a friend’s Christmas party when Mr Hogan was dressed in a rather unusual outfit . Mr Hogan said his wife is the most attractive woman in Brisbane, as proved by the fact that when he first opened Jade Buddha with tennis player Pat Rafter (who has now sold his stake in the business) his wife got all the compliments at the event. ‘I kid you not, there were a lot of people at the opening and I lost track of the amount of times people came up to me and said ""she is the most attractive woman in the room"" and there was some stiff competition with Lara Rafter there. I’m not silly … a happy wife equals a happy life,’ he said. The couple first met at a friend’s Christmas party when Mr Hogan was dressed in a rather unusual outfit. Tennis star Pat Rafter opened Phil Hogan's central Brisbane bar with him and once owned a stake in the business . The father of four, who is partially colour blind and used to shop with a female friend to avoid colour clashes, was forced to go shopping on his own to choose an outfit for the party and he came away with a sparkling silver suit. It may have been a fashion faux pas but it certainly got his future wife’s attention. ‘It was essentially a silver suit, it almost made Geoff Edelsten look good. I’ll never forget, I looked in the elevator mirror and I was really happy with it and thought “what a wicked suit” and then the doors opened to the party and everyone stared at me. ‘Ten years later when I married Michelle she told me she was going to burn it.’","Businessman Phil Hogan was invited to hear the US President speak .

"Arsene Wenger admits that the traditional, powerful English defender has become a dying breed – not just at Arsenal but throughout the Premier League. Better pitches and a more cultivated approach to training in youth academies might have killed off the old-fashioned English centre-half in the tradition of Tony Adams, Martin Keown and Wenger’s current assistant, Steve Bould. Indeed Wenger believes John Terry may be the last of a generation raised to defend aggressively – but he insists he still has hopes that his own troubled back four will eventually match the great Arsenal defensive teams of the past. John Terry is the last of the traditional English central defenders, according to Arsene Wenger . Terry rises above Moussa Sissoko to head during Chelsea's 2-0 win over Newcastle on Saturday . Wenger, whose team take on Stoke today, having lost 3-2 in a particularly calamitous defensive performance last month at the Britannia Stadium, said: ‘Young boys practice well on quality pitches, whereas before it was muddy and you could tackle and throw your body in - it created opportunities for defenders to work naturally on their defensive techniques. Today it's all more standing up there is less physical commitment because the quality of the pitches are much better. ‘The game has become more technical. You find more players who may have good technique. Maybe as well our societies are less aggressive. In the football education . System, you cultivate that intense desire less. It's more about the quality of the technique and maybe that creates fewer defenders.’ Asked whether the likes of Terry were the last of that kind of defender, Wenger said: ‘John Terry is a coach on the pitch. He's a Tony Adams, basically, (who) organises the team, because he has huge experience now and because he reads the game well. 'Maybe Gary Cahill in five, six, seven years will be like that as well. He is the right age, and you do not find many any more. You had more before than you do today.’ Arsenal boss Wenger with former captain Tony Adams lifting the Premiership trophy in 1998 . Wenger believes that Chelsea's Gary Cahill could also be on the same level as the likes of Terry and Adams . And Wenger concedes that developing communication between a multi-cultural back four has proved much more difficult than in the days when he had Englishmen Adams and Bould at centre half with Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon at full back. ‘Certainly, you had more (leaders) before,’ said Wenger. ‘If you look at the evolution of English football, when I arrived here, the back four all was English. They were not only English, they communicated because they had the same culture, the same way to see the game, they were educated together and communication is an important part. ‘With people coming in from different countries, communication has gone from the back four, much more than before, and you see less people who talk. It doesn’t mean there are no leaders but they do not speak always the same language, they are not the same way to respond to situations. That has a little bit gone in our game.’ Arsenal's legendary central defensive partnership of Steve Bould (left) and Adams . Wenger believes that current partnership Laurent Koscielny (left) and Per Mertesacker can reach their level . That said, Wenger’s greatest back four, in the 1998-99 season, which conceded just 17 goals, finished second to Manchester United in the Premier League. Wenger always remains peeved that no-one refers to his own creation, the Invincible back four of Lauren, Sol Campbell, Kolo Toure and Ashley Cole, which conceded 26 goals in their unbeaten season of 2003-04. ‘We had a great defence after that, nobody spoke about that: the Invincible team. They were physically fantastic. Lauren, Kolo, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole was a top back four.’ And Wenger remains convinced that the current back four of Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny, Per Mertesacker and Kieran Gibbs can still become a unit that could compare with those teams. ‘I think we are not far. We are getting there. It’s not only [that], I think we have more offensive players in midfield than we had at the time. It’s not only the back four, I think the whole defensive unit, we are more offensively oriented than we were at that time.’","Traditional powerful English defenders are dying out, says Arsene Wenger .

"If Calum Chambers was ever inclined to dwell on his rapid ascent in recent months and relax a little, there is a vivid memory which he retains to keep him grounded. Chamber, 20, was a raw Southampton right-back last season, battling with Nathaniel Clyne to stake his claim in the team. In the past six months, he has made his Arsenal debut at centre-half, won the Community Shield, made his England debut and played in the Champions League. It is little surprise he describes his season so far as a ‘whirlwind’ but he is unlikely to get carried away. Calum Chambers has won the Community Shield and played in the Champions League since joining Arsenal . Chambers trains with his team-mates ahead of their FA Cup fifth round clash with Middlesbrough . Chambers says he used to clean the boots of Rickie Lambert (centre) while they were at Southampton . On Sunday he is expected to return to the team to take on Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fifth round as Arsenal defend the trophy. Yet only a few years ago he would have been out in the cold cleaning boots as dusk fell at Southampton’s Marchwood training ground. In those days, Southampton were an aspiring Football League club rather than a much-admired Champions League-chasing outfit and Chambers was fully aware he was near the bottom of the pile. ‘For two years I had to clean Rickie Lambert’s boots,’ he said. ‘It was a good experience. I know some clubs don’t do it but it keeps everyone grounded and as an academy player you know your place. It makes you want to be the player who’s getting his boots cleaned.’ In Lambert, it turns out he had a mentor. ‘He was fantastic to me. He was polite and would speak to me. I wanted to be the person he was.’ Chambers’ loyalty to Lambert hasn’t dimmed. A light-hearted inquiry as to whether Lambert tipped well elicits a mock horrified response. ‘I can’t discuss that,’ says Chambers. ‘That’s confidential between boot boy and player!’ Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been impressed with Chambers since he signed him last summer . Chambers also made his senior debut for England last year after moving to Arsenal . Chambers also played in the Champions League, pictured here after their 3-3 draw with Anderlecht . Despite the menial labour, Chambers doesn’t have a hard-luck story to tell. Southampton are recognised as one of the leading producers of football talent in the world, with Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Adam Lallana the best-known graduates of their academy. And he went to Churcher’s College in Petersfield, Hampshire, an independent school, passing nine GCSEs, although the school’s strength in sport was initially something of a problem. ‘My school specialised in rugby and hockey,’ he said. ‘They didn’t do football, so I played rugby for a bit, hockey for a bit and I enjoyed them. I’d play football on a Saturday. It almost got to the point where the school wanted me to stop playing football on a Saturday to concentrate on school sports. We had to argue the case. We had to say that I had to concentrate on football. It was fine eventually.’ Given the evidence of the last six months, the right choice was made. Chambers is still absorbing his success. He will concede that he was ‘a bit nervous on the first day’ at Arsenal after his £12million move. He was thrust straight into the team in an unfamiliar position at centre-half and performed well in his first game — the 3-0 win over Manchester City in the Community Shield. Per Mertesacker’s need to recover from the World Cup and the injuries to Mathieu Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny mean he has made 32 appearances in a season in which he was anticipating having to wait for his chance. Four years ago Southampton fc introduced six Academy players to the home crowd before a fixture against Brighton. Chambers, Luke Shaw, Jordan Turnbull, James Ward-Prowse. Front; Omar Rowe, Harrison Reed. Chambers came through the academy at Southampton and played for their first team before joining Arsenal . Chambers' good form for Arsenal has earned him Champions League games and an England debut . Chambers trains with Arsenal alongside fellow England internationals Jack Wilshere (left) and Danny Welbeck . Calum Chambers graduated from the famed academy that is the life blood of Southampton, producing dozens of kids who have blossomed into top-class internationals — as well as netting the club millions of pounds. The only time they got their sums wrong was when, with the club in financial plight, they waived their 25 per cent sell-on fee when they sold Gareth Bale to Spurs in May 2007. It meant Saints missed out on an £21.5m windfall when Bale moved to Real Madrid for a world-record £86m in 2013. That was a rare oversight, however, as illustrated by this list of recent graduates whose transfer fees alone have earned Southampton more than £100m. Wayne Bridge to Chelsea for £7million - Jul, 2003 . Theo Walcott to Arsenal for £9.1million - Jan, 2006 . Gareth Bale to Tottenham for £7million - May, 2007 . Chris Baird to Fulham for £3million - Jul, 2007 . Nathan Dyer to Swansea for £400,000 - Jul, 2009 . Andrew Surman to Wolves for £1.2million - Jul, 2009 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Arsenal for £12million - Aug, 2011 . Luke Shaw to Manchester United for £27million - Jul, 2014 . Adam Lallana to Liverpool for £24million - Jul, 2014 . Calum Chambers to Arsenal for £12million - Jul, 2014 . TOTAL - 102.7m . ‘I set a few goals at the start of the season and I exceeded them massively so I’m really pleased,’ he said. ‘It was a whirlwind few months, it all happened so quickly I didn’t really have the time to sit back and think: “Wow, this is pretty good”. 'I just got on with it and tried to play as best I could in every game. It was an amazing few months getting my Arsenal debut, Champions League debut, England debut. ‘I knew coming to a club like Arsenal there would be competition for places. I knew that at training every day it was going to be tough and that’s what I wanted. You can’t turn down the opportunity to come to a club like Arsenal. I wanted to rise to that opportunity and prove to everyone what I can do and how good I can be.’ Arsene Wenger is clearly impressed. As well as a potential centre-half, he has him down as a possible holding midfielder. And Chambers is part of a new generation of players — including Luke Shaw, Nathaniel Clyne, John Stones, Ross Barkley, Jordon Ibe, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane — causing a stirring of optimism in England, especially with the Under 21s at Euro 2015 in the Czech Republic. ‘I would be happy to be there if I got called up,’ says Chambers, even though he has now made his senior team debut. ‘It would be amazing to go to that and to win it. I think there are a lot of good young English players coming through. There is good hope for the future. Of course, it would put down a big marker (to win it). But even if we didn’t, there’s still a lot of talent coming through.’ Chambers used to compete alongside Nathaniel Clyne for the right back spot at Southampton . Shaw is another former Southampton academy star who has moved on to Manchester United . His friendship with Clyne is intriguing. The pair were vying to be Southampton’s right-back last year; now it is the England post for which they contend. ‘He’s a really good guy and we have a really healthy relationship. 'We were always pushing each other in training and games. If I wasn’t playing, he’d be playing and he’d be at the top of his game, and vice versa. When it was your turn to play, you always felt like you had to grab every opportunity and play the best you could.’ For now, though, it is Middlesbrough in the fifth round and the defence of the FA Cup on which to focus which should, in itself, generate a degree of satisfaction. It certainly beats scrubbing boots on long winter evenings at Marchwood. Watch Arsenal take on Middlesborough in the FA Cup Fifth Round exclusively live from 3.30pm today on BT Sport 1.

"Police killer Harry Roberts was last night preparing for a new life in sheltered housing after being freed from prison. The 78-year-old, who was jailed for life for the shooting deaths of three unarmed officers in 1966, is set to live alongside unwitting elderly people following his controversial release on Monday night. Amid great secrecy, he was taken from Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire to a bail hostel in the south of England, where he will be assessed pending an expected move to warden-controlled accommodation – complete with panic alarm in case he feels threatened. Harry Roberts, pictured, is being given a new identity and a flat in an OAP home following his release from jail . Roberts as he was in 1966 when he was jailed for life, left, is believed to have changed his name by deed poll . Despite spending nearly half a century in prison, he will be entitled to draw the basic state pension – £113 per week – and could also be eligible for housing allowance. Last night there was mounting speculation that Roberts has changed his name, possibly by deed poll, to avoid being identified by fellow residents. A leading criminal justice expert said that although Roberts has not been given a new identity, which would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and cause an outcry, ‘it would make sense’ for him to have a new name to remain anonymous. Harry Fletcher, a former senior official in the probation officers’ union NAPO, said: ‘Every effort will be made to ensure his whereabouts remains a secret. I expect he will spend a relatively short period of time in a bail hostel, before being switched to sheltered accommodation where fellow residents won’t realise who he is.’ Roberts was jailed for life for the murders of Det Sgt Christopher Head, 30, Det Con David Wombwell, 25, and PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, in West London in 1966. A widow subjected to a vile hate campaign at the hands of Roberts said she was ‘living in fear’. Joan Cartwright, 71, said she felt ‘very vulnerable’ after it emerged the criminal – who has threatened to kill her and her husband – had been freed. She only learned about his release when she heard the news on the radio. Five years ago, Roberts’s bid to be released from jail was rejected after it emerged he had terrorised Mrs Cartwright and her family when she complained about his behaviour while working on day release in her animal sanctuary in the East Midlands. ‘I feel very frightened, it’s quite terrifying,’ she told the Mail last night. ‘On the one hand the police are telling me he’s a reformed man, who’s full of remorse and that nothing is going to happen. But at the same time they are giving me code words to quote should I need to call them if we have any upset or worry.’ PC Fox’s son said he was disgusted that he received no official notification that his father’s killer had been freed. Speaking at his home in Aylesbury, Paul Fox, 64, told the Mail: ‘No official has had the decency to tell me what is going on. I have learnt everything from the media. ‘Harry Roberts has been behind bars for more than 40 years and that is where he should have stayed. He has lived a life of luxury in prison. I feel very let down by the system.’ The Ministry of Justice said: ‘We do not comment on individuals.’","Harry Roberts was released from prison on Monday after 48 years inside .

"A British soldier awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross died in vain because of an order to prevent damage to Taliban mud huts, an inquest will be told this summer. Colleagues of Lance Corporal James Ashworth – who won the UK’s highest gallantry medal – are expected to tell a coroner they were denied powerful weapons to take on the Taliban due to fears mortars and rockets could damage buildings. Soldiers from the Grenadier Guards will claim James died because he was forced to crawl to within a few feet of an enemy sniper in a mud hut while clutching a grenade, rather than firing from a safer distance. Inquest: Lance Corporal Ashworth's (pictured) colleagues will claim the regulations to protect infrastructure in the Helmand Province led to his death . Last night his father Duane Ashworth accused top brass of sacrificing his son’s life to protect the building, saying his pride in his son’s VC was now coupled with anger over the way in which he had died. ‘We can build more mud huts but nobody can bring back my son. This is hard to stomach,’ he said. Just weeks before L/Cpl Ashworth died in June last year, new tactics were introduced by the multi-national forces in Afghanistan that prevented use of heavy weapons in all but the most exceptional  circumstances. The change – in response to a request from President Hamid Karzai to protect local infrastructure – meant British patrols no longer carried mortars and shoulder-held rocket launchers on routine operations, forcing them to engage any targets at close range. L/Cpl Ashworth would still be alive if they had been able to use the weapons that were restricted just a month earlier, his comrades will say. The revelation follows last week’s ruling by the Supreme Court that any decision to deny troops access to adequate weaponry could constitute a negligent decision and therefore a breach of their human rights – potentially opening the floodgates for hundreds of damages claims from bereaved families. Outrage: Lance Corporal Ashworth's family have said they are angry and accused top brass of sacrificing his life to protect the building. (L to R) father Duane, mother Kerry and brother Coran . Yesterday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned that the ruling could prevent British soldiers carrying out vital missions because their commanders will be frightened about being sued if their troops are badly wounded or killed. He said: ‘We can’t have commanders living in fear of how lawyers back in London might interpret their battlefield decisions that are vital to protecting our national security.’ L/Cpl Ashworth was awarded a VC after taking on a Taliban sniper team in Mohammed Zai, Helmand province, on June 13 last year. He was killed while getting into position to throw a grenade through the window of the mud hut occupied by a Taliban sniper. James’s father Duane, 45, from the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, added: ‘James was put in even graver danger by the lack of basic weapons. Award: Lance Corporal Ashworth was given a posthumous Victoria Cross. It is the UK's highest gallantry medal . James or one of his colleagues could have fired a mortar or a rocket-launcher from a longer range and in all likelihood he would be here today.’ Platoon commander Captain Michael Dobbin will be called to the inquest at Kettering magistrates’ court on August 1. Grenadiers who fought a close-range gun battle in the mud hut are also expected to give evidence. A Grenadiers source said: ‘While Captain Dobbin will support the Army’s version of events, the junior soldiers will express their frustration about having to fight the Taliban with effectively one arm tied behind their backs that summer. ‘James would still be alive if we’d used the same weaponry we used on the 09/10 tour.’ A legal expert told The Mail on Sunday that the failure to provide adequate weaponry could provide grounds for a future negligence claim by the Ashworth family against the MoD. Shubhaa Srinivasan of Leigh Day & Co said: ‘If weapons were denied to soldiers as a result of a decision taken sufficiently away from the battlefield... it may be possible to establish liability against the Ministry of Defence under negligence or the Human Rights Act. ‘The MoD does not have carte blanche to fail to equip troops.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts remain with the family of James Ashworth. UK forces continue to operate under established Rules of Engagement which give them the right to defend themselves and to call in the fire support they need in any situation.’","Lance Corporal James Ashworth, 23, is said to have crawled within a few feet of enemy sniper .

"Tony Fernandes is here at Loftus Road to talk football. QPR have a new manager in Chris Ramsey, they are in a battle against the drop and he is keen to impress how the club have changed and how they can withstand the shock of relegation should that day come. But it is hard to focus entirely on matters on the pitch. For Fernandes is also the face of AirAsia and describes the last seven weeks as the ‘worst 50 days of my life’. It was on December 28 that AirAsia flight QZ8501 with 162 people on board crashed into the sea between Surabaya and Singapore. Tony Fernandes describes the last seven weeks 'as the worst 50 days of my life' following the AirAsia tragedy . AirAsia flight QZ8501  crashed into the sea between Surabaya and Singapore with 162 people on board . ‘I think the only way I do know how to manage these things is with my heart,’ says Fernandes, owner and chief executive of AirAsia. ‘Just confront it and deal with it. It has just been a nightmare to be honest. The only way I know how to deal with it is to deal with it. ‘I get text messages every day from the families. They all have my mobile phone number. I’ve been going to funerals and that’s hard. But the families have been amazing to us. They’ve given me strength.’ Fernandes dealt with the tragedy by flying immediately to Indonesia to assist with the search for the plane and, ultimately, the bodies. There he was confronted by the victims’ families. ‘That was really hard. What do you say to someone who has lost five people on their plane? I don’t know. Human nature, whatever, gives you the strength to find a way. Burying my own staff was a nightmare. Taking a 22-year-old girl on a plane and burying her in her home town. But you find the strength. ‘I apologised. It’s not our fault. We don’t know. But what else can you say? They were on my aircraft. And they’re not with them. And we just sat and talked and made them feel very comfortable that whatever happens, we would find them and we wouldn’t give up. And I think that was very reassuring. We haven’t found everyone yet. There are still more than 50 people unaccounted for. But we just talked to them and let them talk to me, show me pictures and tell stories.’ The QPR owner is also chief executive of AirAsia and has attended the funerals of those killed in the tragedy . In such circumstances it would be inhuman to worry about football and what was going on at QPR, and the club necessarily was not his first priority. ‘I remember turning on to watch the Sheffield United game [in the FA Cup] — and turning it off pretty quickly. No, it wasn’t top of my list. I remember there was a draw with Crystal Palace. I still wanted QPR to win. I still had one eye on looking at Twitter and hoping to see a goal. ‘Your life becomes split in two: you have to deal with the pain but you also have to make sure you deal with the people who are still alive and provide their livelihoods and QPR is one of those.’ Almost two months on, his energies are still clearly focused on the crash investigation but he is now as committed to QPR as ever in what has been a difficult period. He insists he was surprised as anyone that Harry Redknapp resigned three weeks ago after a quiet transfer window. ‘No one believes me but I never expected Harry to want to resign,’ he says. Chris Ramsey (right) has been tasked with keeping QPR in the Premier League after Harry Redknapp resigned . Tony Fernandes shares a joke with QPR defender Nedum Onuoha after visiting the training ground last week . However, the ‘boring’ transfer window does mean QPR are now shedding their image as a soft touch. Fernandes knows what agents in the game think: that QPR is the place you go in order to offload older and expensive players. ‘Or players looking for a massive pay-out,’ he says. ‘I hate it. I hate it. That’s all gone and players know now. We’re going to have a great wage bill next year. A fair one.’ He cites the debut of midfielder Michael Doughty, 22, a QPR trainee, in the 2-0 win at Sunderland as the model the club will now aim for, with Les Ferdinand appointed director of football. ‘There were certain managers who wanted to go for more experience than youth,’ says Fernandes. ‘What do you do? You keep pushing the manager, saying: “Try this, try this, try this”. And he wants a different type of player. But at least this season everyone we bought [last summer] had some sell-on value and was young enough. We didn’t do Jermain Defoe. Emmanuel Adebayor was offered to us and we just didn’t do any of those. It never got past page one. We’ve created the right atmosphere now.’ QPR midfielder Michael Doughty made his debut for the Hoops against Sunderland two weeks ago . Fernandes shares a joke with QPR's director of football Les Ferdinand during the club's defeat at Hull . For now, Ramsey will manage the team and, even if the club is relegated, he may keep the job. ‘I don’t think that makes a difference, I really don’t. It’s how he manages the next 15 games.’ Before promoting Ramsey from coach, Fernandes tweeted about having spoken to his ‘dream manager’. The smart money is that he meant Paul Clement, the Real Madrid coach, whose father once played at QPR. He fits the profile of what Fernandes wants: a coach who will promote young players. Fernandes will not confirm that but admits that Clement and Brentford manager Mark Warburton have been considered. ‘Some of those names are definitely names we considered. I know Paul Clement. He’s a great guy and I’ve spoken to him many times. Mark Warburton has done a great job at Brentford — so you have to consider someone like that. Michael Laudrup was never in the picture. My focus is just on Chris right now.’ Brentford boss Mark Warburton and Real Madrid coach Paul Clement have both impressed Fernandes . Whatever happens, he claims to be confident the club are now under control. It has not always seemed that way. In 2012-13, the year they went down to the Championship, the club lost £65.3million. The club’s wage bill was £78.0m, more than its entire turnover of £60.6m. The accounts for 2013-14 are out next month and even if they have improved — several expensive players were offloaded, though they had to absorb the pain of losing Premier League TV money — it seems difficult to see how they can avoid a huge fine under the Football League’s new Financial Fair Play rules if they go back down. What complicates the matter is that the Football League have since changed their rules, making them more lenient, and Fernandes has sent a clear signal that he expects to be judged under the most-recent rules. ‘One of the great things is that a precedent has been set in that they’ve changed the rules already,’ he says. ‘That in itself is a great legal argument.’ And Fernandes says that the club can cope with relegation without huge amounts of fresh subsidies from himself and the Mittal family, which has kept the club afloat up to now. ‘That fear of getting relegated has gone now. If we get relegated, we get relegated and we build. Southampton were a League One side, right? Look at them now.’ Fernandes celebrates QPR's play-off victory at Wembley last May as the club clinched promotion . Since he took over in 2011, almost every transfer window has felt like panic stations, planning for the worst-case scenario. ‘Well, this time we’ve said: “**** it”,’ he says. ‘We’re going to think for the long term. Because every six months we were fighting against relegation and I saw a window and would buy players. It has always been that. ‘Then you’re in the Championship and you’re fighting for promotion and it’s, “OK, we need some more players. It’s worth buying because we’ll get £60m when we’re back in the Premier League”.’ It has taken almost four years but it seems as though he may have finally got on top of football.","AirAsia flight QZ8501 with 162 passengers crashed into the sea .

"Jacqui Lambie's controversial chief of staff Rob Messenger has been expelled from the Palmer United Party for making 'false and misleading statements'. Clive Palmer revealed the news on Thursday and said 'everything Senator Lambie says is really coming from her chief of staff'. The Palmer United Party (PUP) leader said: 'Senator Lambie is simply Rob Messenger's mouthpiece.' Scroll down for video . Jacqui Lambie's chief of staff has been expelled from Palmer United Party . Clive Palmer says Senator Lambie is simply Rob Messenger's mouthpiece . It follows Senator Lambie refusing to pass any government legislation even if it has the support of her party . A excerpt from Clive Palmer's statement on why Mr Messenger was expelled from the party . The statement does not go into any details about what those false claims are Mr Messenger is accused of. Mr Messenger has been working as Senator Lambie's chief of staff since her election and previously worked as a Queensland Liberal National Party MP and independent candidate, reports ABC. Tensions have been running high in PUP in recent weeks with Senator Lambie openly criticising the party's strategy. 'One thing I won't do is lie to the Australian people and I'm not going to sit here and make my PUP senators or Clive Palmer look good when I'm not feeling that way about them. 'I won't do that ... I just don't feel like they're helping me out. So if that means I've got to go it alone under the PUP flag then so be it, I'll just run it alone,' she told ABC's 7:30 program on Wednesday night. Mr Palmer threw down the gauntlet in his statement made clear Senator Lambie had not resigned and should challenge him for the leadership if she was not happy. Mr Palmer did not go into any details in the statement about the false statements Mr Messenger had allegedly made . Mr Palmer said Senator Lambie was 'focused on her own quest for power' rather than representing Tasmanians . He said: 'If what she says about being unhappy with her party's leadership is true, she should make a challenge. 'Otherwise get on with the job of representing the people who voted for her.' It has come in the days since Senator Lambie refused to pass any government legislation even if it has the support of her party. Senator Lambie denied there was a split in PUP on Wednesday night but said her relationship with Mr Palmer is 'up and down', reports Channel Nine. Mr Palmer also branded Senator Lambie a 'drama queen' and said 'rational arguments rather than threats were required' if she wanted to help PUP achieve the best outcomes for the Australian Defence Force. He added his concern that Senator Lambie had never raised issues on ADF pay in the party's 'proper forum'. He said Senator Lambie was 'focused on her own quest for power' rather than properly representing Tasmanians. Senator Lambie addressed her critics on Thursday afternoon and said she was 'very happy with my electoral team' including Mr Messenger. She said: 'They are 100 per cent loyal to me, and together we are fighting hard for members of our Defence Force, War Veterans and ordinary Tasmanians. 'I've requested that all my staff not be members of any political party. 'I want a non-political office and Mr Palmer’s confirmation that Mr Messenger is no longer a member of the Palmer United Party saves him the trouble of resigning. 'Mr Palmer’s personal criticism of Mr Messenger is disappointing. 'Mr Messenger and I have worked well together after Mr Palmer gave us the job before the last federal election to create a Veterans’ Affairs and Defence policy.'","Jacqui Lambie's chief of staff has been expelled from Palmer United Party .

"A gardener was able to take more than £200,000 from the bank account of an 89-year-old woman as a result of a ruling by the controversial Court of Protection. The handyman persuaded the confused and vulnerable woman to sign an agreement that he should control all her bank accounts, savings and property. The agreement – which was approved by the court even after social workers questioned the gardener’s motives – allowed him to put more than £200,000 of her money into his own account. He was stopped only when he tried to take nearly £150,000 more of her savings, causing her insurance firm to raise the alarm and the police to investigate. A gardener was able to take more than £200,000 from the bank account of an 89-year-old woman because of of a ruling by the controversial Court of Protection . Astonishingly, although the court has now ruled the man can no longer manage the woman’s affairs, it has ruled that his name should be kept secret. Details of the case were disclosed in a Court of Protection judgment under new legal rules demanding greater openness. But critics said the ruling wrongly protects the gardener and leaves other elderly and vulnerable people and their families without warning of his record. The extraordinary case will add to growing fears over the workings of the Court of Protection. Last week a damning inquiry found thousands of vulnerable people were being deprived of their liberty by decisions made in the secretive court under the Mental Capacity Act. The scathing report by a Lords committee said that the Act was being ‘wilfully used to oppress individuals and to force decisions upon them’ and should be changed urgently. The Court of Protection at Archway Tower, Archway, north London. One of the three courts where hearings take place . The gardener, now 69, was able to persuade the wealthy widow to give him a lasting power of attorney (LPA) after he began working at her home in Orpington, Kent, in 2006. The woman, who had spent her career working for the BBC World Service, has no children and only distant relatives. In August 2011, she signed a will in which she promised to leave four-fifths of her estate to the gardener. Two months later, she signed over to him the right to control her affairs through an LPA. Her signature was witnessed by her accountant, and two friends completed a form in which they said she understood what she was doing and was not being pressured into it, the Court of Protection found. A recent enquiry said many elderly or vulnerable people are dumped in residential homes to make it easier to control them or simply to save money. Picture posed by model . However, social worker Jenny Payne told the Office of the Public Guardian, which is part of the Court of Protection and regulates LPAs, that she had ‘concerns about [the gardener’s] conduct’. She told the court that the woman had been found on a bus in a confused state and taken to hospital but that the gardener had turned up on the ward, declared there was nothing wrong with her and insisted that she be discharged into his care. Despite this, the gardener was granted power of attorney. According to the judgment: ‘As the power of attorney was for property and financial affairs, and because the NHS concerns were of a personal and welfare nature, the Public Guardian felt that he was unable  to intervene.’ Six weeks after the gardener won power of attorney in February 2012, the widow was moved into a residential care home in Bromley with dementia. Over the following months, a series of payments were made to the gardener from her assets. They included a banker’s draft for £7,000, cash withdrawals totalling £8,520 and a gift the gardener made to himself of £38,000. A further £8,340 went on his salary for house clearance, rubbish removal and gardening. He paid a £599 deposit for a Motability car for his wife, together with £55-a-week car hire payments and petrol money of around £30 a week. In February last year, he sold the widow’s house for £165,000 and moved the money into his own account. An investigation began only when the gardener asked Aviva to pay him the proceeds of a £140,000 investment bond held  by the widow. A manager at the insurance company immediately froze the money and the Office of the Public Guardian started an investigation. After he discovered he was being investigated, the gardener changed the name on the account into which he had put the money, putting it into the woman’s name. Investigators for the Public Guardian found the woman did not even know who her gardener was and did not understand the powers she had given him. They also found he visited her care home only once every three weeks. At a court hearing, the gardener protested that if the LPA were to be struck out, he would not be able to afford the Motability car and would no longer be able to take the woman to visit her husband’s grave. But Senior Judge Denzil Lush ordered the LPA to be revoked. He said the gardener had broken its terms in several ways and his claim to a salary was ‘inherently artificial’. Because there has been no criminal charge ‘it does not imply that his behaviour has been impeccable’, he said. He ordered that the woman’s affairs should be managed by a publicly-appointed official who will pay her care home fees from the proceeds of the sale of her home. Although the gardener was investigated by police, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute. He will keep more than £60,000 of the money he took from the woman’s accounts and estate. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who has campaigned against secrecy in the courts, said: ‘This is not exactly naming and shaming. ‘It is clear that the secrecy here is acting to protect someone who has been trying to extort money from someone, and will do nothing to protect other elderly people in a similar situation.’ The Lasting Power of Attorney was introduced under the 2005 Mental Capacity Act, which set up the Court of Protection – only now being opened to public scrutiny after a series of scandals. LPAs were designed to allow someone to hand control over their lives to a trusted spouse, friend or professional. Whoever is named has the right to dictate the medical treatment of a vulnerable person, and is given the right to control financial affairs even before a person is deemed legally unable to make decisions for themselves.","He persuaded the vulnerable woman to sign over her bank accounts .

"German politicians are considering a new way of keeping sensitive information away from spies – reverting to typewriters. The idea of re-introducing manual typewriters was floated by the man fronting an inquiry into U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) activity in Germany. Christian Democrat politician Patrick Sensburg, head of the Bundestag’s parliamentary inquiry into the NSA surveillance scandal, was asked on television whether politicians were considering a return to older technology. Sales of typewriters have jumped in Germany following allegations about American agents spying on MPs . Speaking on the Morgenmagazin TV programme, he replied ‘As a matter of fact, we have – and not electronic models either’ before adding ‘Yes, no joke,' The Guardian reports. It comes a year after allegations surfaced that the mobile telephone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been bugged by American agents. Just last week her government told the CIA station chief in Berlin to leave the country, in a dramatic display of anger after German officials unearthed two suspected spies. The move has added to the damaged relations between Berlin and Washington. But concern about U.S. spying in the country has grown so much that MPs are now considering ditching computers in favour of typewriters - as well as maintaining some of their existing security measures. Mr Sensburg added: 'Of course we have to keep our internal communication secure, send encrypted emails, use encrypted telephones and other things, which I'm not going to say here.' The prospect of German MPs reverting to typewriters comes a year after allegations surfaced that the mobile telephone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured, had been bugged by American agents . The decision to order the CIA representative out came after dramatic reports of U.S. espionage in Germany. Public outrage at the revelations put pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to take action against the United States. Last week, Berlin said it had discovered a suspected U.S. spy in the Defence Ministry. That came just days after a German foreign intelligence worker was arrested on suspicion of being a CIA informant and admitted passing documents to a U.S. contact. The scandal has chilled relations between Berlin and Washington to levels not seen since Merkel's predecessor opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. It would not be the first time a country had turned to less sophisticated technology to counter spy activity. Russia's Federal Guard Service opted to use more typewriters after classified NSA documents were leaked by the organisation's former contractor Edward Snowden.","German MPs considering a return to typewriters to combat spy activity .

"Google was last night accused of taking an over-zealous approach to the removal of stories from its search engine because it was ‘cheaper just to say yes’ to all demands. Some 70,000 people have asked for stories about them to be removed from search results, in what critics have described as a re-writing of the past and a danger to free speech. Google’s actions follow a European Court ruling earlier this year which created the ‘right to be forgotten’ and has provoked fury among MPs. Google was last night accused of taking an over-zealous approach to the removal of stories from its search engine because it was 'cheaper just to say yes' to all demands . The decision allows people to ask that ‘irrelevant, outdated or otherwise inappropriate’ information be hidden from search results. However experts say the criteria remain unclear. Tory MP Dominic Raab said last night: ‘This draconian European Court ruling risks turning internet search engines ... into a refuge for scoundrels and crooks.’ A spokesman for the European Commission, Ryan Heath, said the legal ruling should not be an ‘open door for people to create more work for Google or Photoshop their own lives’, adding that European ministers should sign off on a cross-continental data protection law. He also told Radio 4’s PM programme he thought Google had not exercised good judgment over a deleted article by BBC journalist Robert Peston about millionaire banker Stan O’Neal, who is blamed for helping cause the financial crisis. Some 70,000 people have asked for stories about them to be removed from search results, in what critics have described as a re-writing of the past and a danger to free speech . He said: ‘It may be that they [Google] have decided it is simply cheaper to just say yes to all of these requests. This really does give a bit of a kick to the national governments and says they have got to get their act together now ... so there is a bit more common sense and so that there is a legal certainty there for journalists.’ Last night the Daily Express revealed it had been notified that a story published by the newspaper in 2009 about the conversion of George Osborne’s younger brother, Dr Adam Osborne, to Islam was being removed from search results. The MailOnline website has also received removal notifications, but publisher Martin Clarke has said that the website will continue to carry lists of articles that have been hidden in search results. A spokesman for Google – which fought the decision in court – said: ‘We have recently started taking action on the removals requests we’ve received after the European Court of Justice decision. This is a new and evolving process for us. We’ll continue to listen to feedback and will also work with data protection authorities and others as we comply with the ruling.’","70,000 people have asked for stories about them to be removed .

"British Gas has launched an investigation into solar panels at dozens of schools and businesses after a series of mystery fires. Some 92 schools that signed up for free panels have been told their equipment will need improvements before it is considered safe to use. It comes after solar panel fires in three schools were confirmed by British Gas following a tip-off to The Mail on Sunday. A third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at Sutton Bonington Primary School in Nottinghamshire (above) Although an investigation after the first two was ruled 'inconclusive', it is believed the energy giant was forced to carry out improvements when a third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at Sutton Bonington Primary School in Nottinghamshire. More than 90 schools and 27 business fitted with the suspect equipment have been left without free solar energy since April. The news is likely to come as a blow to Energy Minister Greg Barker, who the same month unveiled plans to put solar panels on the roofs of 24,000 schools. British Gas has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire County Council said the panels had been installed as part of British Gas's Generation Green project, which gives schools free equipment in return for a Government green subsidy payment. A British Gas spokesman would not reveal the cost of the shutdown, although sources say it could run 'well into six figures' once compensation – for the extra cost of mains electricity – is included. Gab Barbaro, managing director of British Gas Business Services, said: 'Safety is our number one priority. Following an incident in April, we decided to turn off solar panels at certain non-domestic sites as a precaution while we undertook a full investigation. British Gas has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe (File photo) No one was hurt and we have worked with independent experts to establish the cause. 'As a further precautionary step, we are upgrading part of the solar installations at these sites.' Professor Stuart Irvine, director of Glyndwr University's Centre for Solar Energy Research, said panel fires were unusual. He added: 'The cause here may lie in wiring or junction boxes, where power is converted for the grid, rather than the panels themselves. 'There's an argument that the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) needs to look at this. We must make sure there's adequate testing of components and sufficient protection for buyers.' A spokesman for the DECC said: 'As legal action is pending, it would not be appropriate to comment.'","92 schools and 27 business have been told their equipment will need improvements before it is considered safe to use .

"Claims: James Kitson, 32, said a Tesco colleague scrawled 'JA Kitson is a deaf c***' on a toilet wall . A Tesco shelf stacker is suing the firm for almost £100,000 after claiming he was hounded out of his job for being deaf. James Kitson, 32, walked out of his job of 15 years over bullying claims - including when a colleague scrawled 'JA Kitson is a deaf c***' on a toilet wall, a tribunal heard. He said senior staff at the Warwick store refused to launch a proper investigation and passed him over for a promotion as part of a catalogue of claims. Mr Kitson appeared before Birmingham Employment Tribunal yesterday at the start of a two-week hearing. Mr Kitson, from Southam, Warwickshire, said senior staff had ignored company policy to take into account his hearing problems, that mean he cannot hear anyone behind him. He is now suing Tesco for £97,400 compensation, claiming emotional distress caused by disability discrimination and bullying that caused him to leave the company. He is also claiming breaches of EU working laws after saying he was forced to work back-to-back shifts less than 11 hours apart. And he claims he was ignored for a new role because he lodged an official complaint against 'vindictive' bosses. He told the hearing  he began working at the Warwick branch while doing his A-levels in 1999 and had an exemplary record. He had been promoted to be a team leader, still working on the shop floor, but things came to a head before he walked out in September. 'I would not normally use the men's toilets at work, but due to an abscess I needed to use them to sort it out every few hours,' he said. 'It was a Sunday so the store closed at 4pm that day and only staff were around after that. 'When I went in I noticed the words 'JA Kitston is a deaf c***' scratched into the back of the door. 'It had my middle initial in it, which is only available from official Tesco records so it had to be a member of staff.' Exemplary: The tribunal heard Mr Kitson worked at this Tesco branch in Warwick since leaving school in 1999 . He claimed his name was added to a list of people who needed to attend a meeting for a new contract - but when he turned up he found the name had been added by an unnamed colleague, and there was no contract waiting. Store manager Owen Culshaw admitted he had never launched an official investigation into the graffiti incident. He told the tribunal: 'I asked a colleague to look into it, to make some informal enquiries. 'I didn't see a point making it formal and interviewing everyone, because I did not think the chances of anyone admitting to doing it were very high. 'You are given a handbook when you join about equality. Everyone at Tesco gets one. 'It is not replaced when a new one comes out, but it is on everyone's file digitally so can be accessed. Store manager Owen Culshaw said everyone had an equality handbook, adding: 'I didn't see a point making it formal and interviewing everyone, because I did not think the chances of anyone admitting to it were high' 'We have a disability policy book, but I haven't read it all, it is there to refer to. The book is over 3,000 pages long. 'When Mr Kitson had his last performance review he did not like the findings. I am told he ripped up the documents and walked out of the store there and then.' Mr Kitson, who is representing himself, denied he had stormed out of the store and claimed line manager Paul Fisher had not given him time to prepare for the interview. 'Paul Fisher made the store an offensive environment to work in,' he added. 'I was victimised by Paul Fisher in the review.' A Tesco spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on the specific allegations made against us as the hearing is ongoing. However, we are defending the claim and deny the allegations put to us. We take our responsibilities as an equal opportunities employer extremely seriously - everyone is welcome at Tesco'. The tribunal continues.","James Kitson, 32, worked for supermarket giant in Warwick for 15 years .

"Two nurses today admitted neglecting elderly patients at a scandal-hit hospital run by the Welsh NHS. Natalie Jones, 40, and Lauro Bertulano, 45, pleaded guilty to falsifying medical records and wilfully neglecting patients at the Princess of Wales Hospital. Another nurse Rebecca Jones, 30, has already pleading guilty after a police investigation into the falsification of patient notes at the 1,500-bed hospital at Bridgend, South Wales. Natalie Jones, left and Lauro Bertulano, right, pleaded guilty to falsifying medical records and wilfully neglecting patients at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, south Wales at Cardiff Crown Court . Rebecca Jones, pictured, had earlier admitted the neglect of Lillian WIlliams before her death in 2012 . A total of 15 nurses from the same health board working in the Princess of Wales hospital and Morriston Hospital in Swansea have been suspended as part of an ongoing internal inquiry into neglect. It follows by families whose elderly relatives have died after alleged 'neglect, poor care and mistreatment' at the Welsh NHS hospitals. Natalie Jones, from Bridgend, pleaded guilty to the wilful neglect of two vulnerable patients 'lacking capacity' in September and October 2012. Bertulano, also from Bridgend, pleaded guilty to the wilful neglect of six vulnerable patients between May and September 2012. Cardiff Crown Court heard the two and Rebecca Jones admit the neglect of 82-year-old Lillian Williams weeks before her death at the hospital in November 2012. Lillian WIlliams, pictured had, been neglected by  nurses in the weeks before her death in November 2012 . Jade Pugh, 29, left, and Clare Cahill, 41, right, both pleaded not guilty to wilful neglect at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, south Wales and will stand trial at Cardiff Crown Court next year . Her son Gareth Williams, speaking after the court hearing in Cardiff today, said his family welcomed the guilty pleas - but said it had taken too long for the health board and police to take their complaints seriously. He said: 'We feel absolutely devastated that these nurses were left on the ward with patients for months after the authorities had been alerted to what was going on in the Princess of Wales Hospital. 'They should never have been allowed to continue working for so long.' Mr Williams said he alerted police and health chiefs in October 2012. Rebecca Jones was not taken off her ward until May 2013, Lauro Bertulano was not stopped from working until August 2013 and and Natalie Jones was still working with patients until her arrest in March 2014. Fellow nurses Jade Pugh, 29, and Clare Cahill, 41, pleaded not guilty to wilful neglect at the same hospital. They will stand trial next year.

"What happens when top skateboarders from all over the world are given unprecedented access to Helsinki Airport? This video captures the fun tricks skateboarders from America, Japan, Russia, and Finland were able to perform alongside jumbo jets, after they were given a free pass to the airport. The first-ever airport skate session was hosted by Arto Saari, a Finnish professional skateboarder and photographer. For two days in October, top skateboarders came together to take over the Helsinki Airport in Finland . Invited by skateboarder and photographer Arto Saari, participants came from America, Japan and Russia . After letting the skaters loose, Saari stepped behind the lens to record some of their epic stunts. From hangars to the airport bar and everywhere in between, the skateboarders turned every baggage reclaim turnstile and blast fence into their own personal playground. Passing travellers couldn't help but stop and stare in awe as the stunts unfolded all around them - some even as they were enjoying pints at the pub. After letting the skaters loose, Saari stepped behind the camera to film some of the epic stunts performed . From airport hangars to the indoor pub and baggage reclaim turnstiles - nowhere was off-limits . 'Everything that we set up for it, we got the stuff we wanted and more,' Saari said of the project's success . The Helsinki Airport is widely regarded as the gateway between East and West - connecting Europe and America with Asia - so it's only appropriate that Saari bring top athletes from around the globe to this central meeting point. The Arto Saari Invitational, as it was called, might have been the first of its time, but given it's success, it may not be its last. 'Everything that we set up for it, we got the stuff we wanted and more,' Saari said.","Organised by professional skateboarder and photographer, Arto Saari .

"Astonishing drawings of Adolf Hitler and his henchmen sketched in 1931 by a British artist who was allowed into the dictator's lair have emerged. Helen McKie was the only woman allowed to sketch in Hitler's Munich headquarters, called Brown House, and she produced 17 chilling pictures of the Nazi monster and his inner-sanctum. Drawn two years before Hitler came to power and eight years before the start of World War Two, the images are a glimpse into the early stages of Nazism. Life-like: Astonishing drawings of Hitler and his henchmen sketched in the early days of the Nazi party by British artist Helen McKie have come to light . Inside the lair: Helen McKie was given access into the heart of the fledgling dictator's Munich headquarters two years before his bloody rise to power . The Brown House became the Nazi HQ on January 1, 1931 and it was named after the colour of the uniforms. The drawings were put into an album and McKie wrote inside: 'Sketched in Hitler's Brown House Munich by special permission of Hitler's aide-de-camp Bruelenen - I was the only woman ever allowed to sketch here.' The pencil sketches have emerged from the family of the late Mark Dineley, a well known arms and armour collector. They have now been offered for sale at auction with an estimate of £7,000. Incredible access: Helen McKie was the only woman allowed to sketch in Hitler's infamous Brown House lair and she produced 17 pictures detailing the day-to-day life of the Nazi party . Trouble: This drawing by the British artist shows police controlling a disturbance outside the Brown House . The captioned drawings show the entrance to the HQ, a Nazi saluting outside the council chamber and other interior scenes. One shows Hitler standing rather effeminately, a pose which the artist copied from a portrait hanging in the council chamber. Another of the captioned drawings shows 'three smiling Nazis with their beer tankards in the beer hall under the Brown House.' She also depicted the interior of the room of the 'Committee of Control' with three Nazis in conversation. Behind the scenes: This sketch shows two Nazis opening a curtain to a civilian . Glimpse into Nazism: This drawing by Helen McKie shows Nazi officials inside a committee room at Hitler's Munich headquarters . And there is also one showing two helmeted policemen outside the Brown House controlling a disturbance created by civilians. As well as Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Goring and Rudolf Hess had offices there and it was also home to the Nazi sacred relic, the 'blood flag'. This was the swastika that was splattered with blood during the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, when Munich police opened fire on the Nazis. McKie, who was born in London in 1889 and died in 1957, was an illustrator in various magazines and became known for painting military figures in World War One. Entrance: A guard stands in the reception hall of the Brown House . Evil: An inscription in the supreme council chamber. All of Helen McKie's images from inside the Brown House will be sold at auction on November 17 . She lived and worked in Chelsea throughout her life, but travelled extensively with her work. Her Nazi sketches are being sold at Dominic Winter auction house near Cirencester, Gloucester. Chris Albury, from the saleroom, said: 'With the benefit of hindsight these drawings are quite chilling. 'They were drawn shortly before Hitler seized power and close to a turning point in German and world history. 'McKie is an interesting artist who gained a reputation during the First World War and she is well known as a transport artist. 'One of her paintings was presented to Churchill during World War Two and she was a good commercial artist. 'She managed to gain access to the Brown House and although these are only sketches there is a lot of movement and human quality.' The Brown House was damaged in October 1943 and largely destroyed in an Allied bombing raid late in World War Two. The rubble was cleared away in 1947, leaving an empty lot. The auction takes place on November 17.","Helen McKie was the only woman allowed to sketch in Hitler's Munich headquarters .

"Myles Hobson is living, breathing proof, of the benefits of Kalydeco, the 'wonder drug' which is giving real hope to Cystic Fibrosis sufferers. More than a million people in Australia carry the CF gene and a child is born with the disease every four days. It is the most common, life-shortening genetic illness. There is no cure. When he began the trial at the Children's Hospital Westmead in Sydney's west, Myles Hobson, 12, was in serious physical trouble - his lung function had dropped in the 40 per cent range. Myles Hobson performs a lung function test at the Children's Hospital Westmead. His mother Karen insists he has improved dramatically in just two months on the revolutionary drug Kalydeco (Ivafactor) Myles' lung function is nearing 90 per cent now, after just two months on the trial at the Children's Hospital, almost double what it was a few weeks ago . Regular visits to the CF clinic in hospital are required to keep Myles and other CF patients well enough to do the simple things like attend school . The Hobson family on an all-too-regular visit to hospital. Both Emily (front) and older brother Myles have Cystic Fibrosis . As luck would have it, the only reason the Singleton Heights Public School student in northern New South Wales was able to take part was when one of the 20 participants dropped out. 'I was horrified to think why someone had to drop out,' said his mum Karen. But the dramatic improvement after just two months in the trial has provided the Hobsons with great hope for the future because their daughter Emily, 8, also has CF. 'It's been a long and amazing few weeks and Tuesday marked two months of Kalydeco (treatment) for Myles,' she said. 'It's a miracle, it's the closest thing we will get to a cure for CF I think, a real breakthrough. 'His health was really bad, I had a little boy who was pale and tiny and he'd miss weeks at a time from school, since he's been taking it he hasn't missed a single day through sickness.' 'His health was really bad, I had a little boy who was pale and tiny and he'd miss weeks at a time from school, since he's been taking it he hasn't missed a single day through sickness' said Myles' mum Karen Hobson . Infections caused by bacteria in the lungs can lead to lengthy hospital stays for CF patients like Myles Hobson . The range of medications and pieces of medial equipment Myles needs to use to treat his CF . Researchers say that Kalydeco is able to treat the underlying cause of CF by helping 'unlock that gate' and restore the function of the CFTR protein. Other CF treatments have focused on symptoms only . Kalydeco (or Ivacaftor) is a pill taken twice a day for the treatment of CF in people ages 6 and older with the G551D mutation. It's been found to help improve lung function and lower sweat chloride levels and helps patients gain weight . Kalydeco (or Ivacaftor) is a pill taken twice a day for the treatment of CF in those aged six or older and who have the G551D mutation. There are more than 1000 known mutations of the CF gene. This helps improve lung function and lower sweat chloride levels and helps patients gain weight, all indicators that the drug is working. The defective gene in Cystic Fibrosis leads to a build-up of thick mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. When the lungs become clogged, it makes it very difficult to breathe but also traps bacteria in the airways. This can lead to infections and inflammation often causing severe lung damage, and eventually, respiratory failure. Pancreatic problems are ever-present also, with the mucus preventing the release of digestive enzymes that help the body break down food and absorb important nutrients. CF is considered just as deadly as heart disease and cancer but there are no outwardly visible signs someone is suffering the condition. Researchers say that the Kalydeco drug is able to treat the underlying cause of CF by helping 'unlock that gate' and restore the function of the CFTR protein. This allows for a proper flow of salt and fluids on the surface of the lungs. This helps to thin the thick, sticky mucus caused by CF. Ready for another check-up. Myles puts on a brave face as he gets set to undertake more treatment for CF . Karen looks back at the birth of her second child, Emily, eight years ago and admits what she and husband Andrew were told, broke their hearts. 'They told us to take her home and love her and that we'd probably not have her for long.' Within a few weeks the couple would learn both their children had Cystic Fibrosis. 'I fell apart. I already knew how serious a condition it is, I had a friend who had CF, we grew up together and she passed away at a young age,' she said. 'But I can't believe how much our lives have changed in two months. 'Myles lung function is now at 87 per cent - that is the highest it has been in his life.' Just a few months ago, Myles was doing it tough, his lung function had fallen to 47 per cent. But things have turned markedly. His weight gain is also significant. 'It's astronomical - his last weight on Tuesday (at hospital) showed he has put four kilos in just two months,' his mum added. 'That is huge for Myles. He has so much energy and for the first time ever is looking for food in the middle of the night. 'His chest X-ray is the best it has ever been. He is a different little boy and we cannot be happier and more excited for his future. 'A few weeks ago some of the mums got together for a game of netball in 35 degree heat and Myles was playing with us. Normally he'd be looking for a tree to sit under but he was out there running around for more than an hour.' 'Let's do this!' Myles Hobson has been part of a trial of the Cystic Fibrosis 'wonder drug' Kalydeco and his improvement since taking the little blue pill has stunned his family . The Federal Government recently approved the drug for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), helping at least 250 Australians affected by the G551D gene mutation. 'The PBS subsidy of this medicine, which would otherwise cost approximately $300,000 a year per patient, will bring great relief to the patients and the families of people affected by this life threatening condition,' said Health Minister Peter Dutton. 'With this new treatment many patients can experience an improved quality of life with reductions in respiratory and gastrointestinal complications, improved lung function and fewer hospitalisations.' Sister and brother Emily and Myles Hobson both have Cystic Fibrosis but the advent of Kalydeco treatment in Australia has given them and their family real hope for the future . Myles Hobson leaves hospital after more treatment for his Cystic Fibrosis. By taking Kalydeco twice daily he has dramatically improved his lung function which was seriously low just two months ago . Kalydeco is also being used in a Phase 2 clinical trial targeting the most common Delta F508 mutation, in combination with another oral medication, VX-809. Myles will remain on the trial with 19 others until May next year. His sister 'a pocket rocket dancer', according to her mum, will be eligible to receive the same medication within the next month.","Kalydeco (Ivacaftor) is a revolutionary blue pill developed in the US and now approved for Australia's Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme (PBS)

"The world can be a scary place for a seal pup less than 72 hours old. But even in the bitter, windswept bleakness of a Scottish beach, a helping hand is never far away. Sealed with a kiss, a young grey seal is seen nurturing her newborn baby through the first few days of its life. Scroll down for video . The young grey seal gives her baby a reassuring pat on the head as they contend with the elements on a windswept Scottish beach . The pair lean in close as the newborn, who is just days old, looks to his mother for reassurance . The seals nuzzle up together, with the mother never being more than a few inches away during this critical time . With a reassuring pat on the head and a nose to nuzzle up to, she will never be more than a few inches away during this critical time. Indeed the pup is so young that its fur still has a yellow tinge from the fluid of its mother’s womb. The scene was repeated all over an undisclosed location on the east coast of Scotland, which wildlife photographer Anna Henly discovered when she came across a 50-strong colony that had come ashore to bear their young. The seals were pictured together in a undisclosed location on the east coast of Scotland by wildlife photographer Anna Henly . The young seal is so young that it still has a yellow tinge to its coat due to the fluid of its mother's womb . Those first moments are crucial for mother and offspring – from the moment it is born, she licks the pup, calls to it, pets it and protects it. Around 40 per cent of the world’s grey seals breed around Britain, with numbers increasing by about 7 per cent a year. A grey seal will spend most of its life – which can be up to 40 years long – at sea. Yet they are often seen close to shore, and there are dozens of areas around Britain where seals regularly congregate to rest, moult or breed. Unlike whales or dolphins, they give birth on land. Around 40 per cent of the world's grey seals breed around Britain, with numbers increasing by seven per cent . The pup can count on the protection of its mother in its first few days before it goes splashing around in the water independently . Although some breeding grounds may appear inhospitable, that waterproof coat and a thick layer of blubber protects the seals from cold and wet. And the more inaccessible the sites are, the less likely they are to be disturbed by humans. For the meantime, this pup can count on the protection and support of its mother before it goes splashing around independently in the water. But the bond will soon be broken. In a few weeks, when it loses its cuddly white coat, the pup will be abandoned by its mother and sent off to fend for itself. After a few weeks, the seal pup will be abandoned by its mother, pictured, and it will have to fend for itself .","Two seals were pictured together on a beach on the east coast of Scotland .

"It was far from a typical wedding and even farther from what Kristi Warriner envisioned her big day would be like. But according to the Texas bride and mom, it was even better. They married in the neonatal intensive care unit so their son, which was born 15 weeks early, could be the ring-bearer. Warriner and her fiance, Justin Nelson, lost one of their twins when she went into labor 15 weeks early at Fort Worth hospital on September 2, according to The Star-Telegram. Their surviving son, J.J., was 'touch and go' for weeks, weighing less than two pounds at birth. Best day: Kristi Warriner and Justin Nelson look at their son, J.J. after they were married in the Cook Children's Medical Center NICU in Fort Worth on Tuesday . Happily married: The couple, along with eight-year-old daughter Carissa and little J.J., celebrate after the ceremony, which was planned with the help of hospital staff . But J.J. now weighs 6 pounds, 8 ounces and appears to be improving each day.

Local businesses donated the bride’s wedding gown and flowers. One of family’s friends lent the outfit for tiny ring-bearer J.J. to wear. 'It’s not what you dream of as a little girl - it’s even better,' Mrs Nelson told The Star-Telegram after the nuptials. 'I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect wedding.' Of great importance to the bride and groom was representing the son they lost at the ceremony, who they named Colt. In Colt's place was a Dallas Cowboys teddy bear that they sat next to J.J. Little fighter: J.J. Nelson is getting stronger each day. His parents put this teddy bear in next to him as a representation of J.J.'s twin brother, who they named Colt but who died in premature labor . 'We thank God every day for J.J. getting better and stronger,' Mrs Nelson said. 'Our biggest mission with all this was to help others know they are not alone.

"Paddy Ashdown has launched an extraordinary attack on the British government, accusing ministers of adopting a policy to 'drown more refugees in the Mediterranean'. The former Lib Dem leader condemned the decision to end support for rescue operations for illegal immigrants because it might encourage more people to attempt the dangerous crossing from Africa. He called for the SAS to be sent in to target the people traffickers charging more than £2,000 per person for a place on a rickety boat. Lord Ashdown condemned the government's refusal to back rescue operations in the Mediterranean, but Home Office minister Lord Bates insisted the human traffickers were to blame for deaths . More than 100,000 have reached Italy since the turn of the year and some 2,000 have died trying, according to the UN refugee body UNHCR. The Italian mission in the Mediterranean has been wound up after rescuing tens of thousands of people, but Britain insists offering help will act as a 'pull factor' to others to seek refuge in Europe. The UK government claims there are between 300,000 and 600,000 people in Libya waiting to make a crossing, but the numbers have started to fall. But in a short debate in Parliament, Lord Ashdown said ministers were trying to defend 'a completely untenable position'. He added: 'Why does the Government's policy seem to be to support measures that can have only one result - to drown more refugees in the Mediterranean - rather than a policy whose aim is to lock up more people traffickers? 'Only one has ever been arrested—in Egypt, which is one of the main departure countries.' He urged the government to deploy the SAS in a targeted mission to root out those responsible for the trade in vulnerable people. 'A few years ago when Her Majesty's Government used all the resources at their disposal, including Special Forces, to rid the Caribbean of drug smugglers. 'Why can we not do the same thing to rid the Mediterranean of people traffickers?' The Home Office insisted that the government is working closely with other EU member states to address the 'distressing situation'. The Italian government has stopped search and rescue operations after thousands were picked up this year, including 600 would-be immigrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea in a single weekend in September . Home Office minister Lord Bates said: 'We need to tackle the traffickers who are exploiting this situation by placing vulnerable people in unseaworthy vessels and setting them afloat in exchange for €2,000 or €3,000 a head. 'That is absolutely morally outrageous. They are responsible for the deaths.' Home Secretary Theresa May is due to meet Italian ministers to discuss the crisis, and will consider requests for more help from Britain. Frontex - the European Union agency dealing with border security – is using drones to track attempts to cross the sea from above. Last month the Foreign Office ruled out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, claiming that they 'create an unintended 'pull factor', encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths' But the stance was repeatedly criticised in the Lords yesterday. Crossbencher Lord Hylton said: 'It has become clearly unacceptable to allow some people to drown to deter others from risking their lives at sea.' And shadow Home Office minister Baroness Smith of Basildon asked Lord Bates: 'Do you really believe this needless loss of life - people drowning in the Mediterranean - will ever act as a deterrent to the criminals drowning people or those desperate enough to get into small boats?' In March this year around 2,128 migrants were rescued off the coast of Italy in two different operations conducted by the Italian Navy . Lord Bates told peers: 'There are very early figures but there is some evidence from Frontex in a brief that I have received in the last 48 hours that there is a turning in the trend here. 'Remember it went up from 70,000 a year to 150,000, deaths went up from 700 to 3,000. We think that there are between 300,000 and 600,000 in Libya waiting to make the crossing. 'The indications are that in October the numbers fell. There could be other reasons for that, we are following it very closely, but this is something we take very, very seriously indeed.' The Refugee Council has warned that the UK's stance will contribute to more people 'needlessly and shamefully dying on Europe's doorstep'.","Ex-Lib Dem leader calls for SAS to target people traffickers .

"A pensioner whose aunt met Hitler and a second married a fascist leader is living in a beach tent with his piano after being kicked out of his house by his wife. Ben Treuhaft, 66, whose mother Jessica was one of the infamous Mitford sisters has set up on the beach after the row with his 39-year-old wife. Mr Treuhaft is now facing a court battle with Edinburgh City Council after erecting his new tent on Portobello beach. Ben Treuhaft, 66, playing his piano inside his tent on Portobello Beach in Edinburgh . In a bid to thwart Edinburgh City Council's attempts to evict him Mr Treuhaft has had a bigger piano installed into his tent . Ben Truehaft, (pictured) admits that his new piano is so large it can barely fit into his tent . Soon after pitching his tent, council officials served Mr Treuhaft with an eviction notice ordering to leave the area. However, the American born musician, who has since moved in with his new girlfriend Mirka Rdzak, 31, has vowed to fight the council. Mr Treuhaft has said he will now install a bigger piano that will be harder for the council to shift. He said: 'It's an escalation of the piano war. The council escalated the situation by threatening me with a notice of eviction, so my response is to put a bigger piano on the beach. 'They have no shame whatsoever in pursuing this ridiculous claim and I'm not going to make it easy for them. 'I'm selling the old piano for £3.99. The new one is a 600-pound pianola - it's much wider and heavier and will be harder to move. 'The movers barely got the sucker into the tent. 'I'm going to fight the eviction notice. It's all 'pi-anarchy'. The piano needs to stay there because the people of Portobello love it.' Mr Treuhaft keeps a close eye on the removal men as they take away his smaller piano which he is going to sell for just £3.99 . Just one more push and Ben Treuhaft will have his new larger piano delivered . Ben Treuhaft enjoying a relaxing break on his piano before battle with the local council commences . The father-of-two walked out of his home in Morningside in Edinburgh after a row with his wife. His mother Jessica rebelled against her privileged aristocratic upbringing by running away from home and marrying a communist nephew of former prime minister Winston Churchill. Meanwhile, two of her sisters Unity and Diana were die-hard fascists - even meeting with Adolf Hitler. Mr Treuhaft is a trained piano tuner and moved to Edinburgh last year to set up a shop. Edinburgh City Council say his tent breaches management rules which prohibit camping within one mile of a public road. Ben Treuhaft has an interesting history according to his colourful family tree . Mr Truehaft's mother Jessica (pictured) was one of the infamous Mitford sisters who scandalised British society during the 1930s . Mr Treuhaft's aunt Unity Mitford (right) was a personal friend of Adolf Hitler (left) Another of Mr Treuhaft's aunts Diana Mitford (centre) was an ardent fascist having married leader of the British Union of Fascists Sir Oswald Mosley (right), here meeting Oswald Pirow (left) of South Africa's New Order Movement . Nancy Mitford (right) was Mr Treuhaft's eldest aunt on his mother's side . Here are Unity, Diana and Nancy Mitford photographed in 1932 . They are now pursuing action through the courts with a notice of intent to evict.Mr Treuhaft said: 'I'm going to take legal advice. They are giving me half a week before they serve me with an eviction notice. 'Once they do it, I will have 48 hours to move the tent. I will do whatever they want, but I'm not moving it myself. 'It's a good thing for Portobello, because people can use it as a shelter and play music. 'I'm trying to get the community to support me so we can keep playing the piano.' Mr Treuhaft's aunt Deborah Mitford married the 11th Duke of Devonshire pictured outside Chatsworth House . Diana Mitford (right) originally married Bryan Guinness, heir to the brewing fortune before divorcing him for Sir Oswald Mosley . Mr Treuhaft's sixth aunt was novelist Nancy Mitford who died in June 1973 . A council spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Treuhaft has been served with court papers and that they would remove his piano tent if he did not. She said: 'We have received complaints from members of the public and we have growing concerns about the safety of the tent and its contents. 'Court papers have been served on Mr Treuhaft; if he does not remove the tent and contents voluntarily, we will remove them in the coming days.' The Mitford sisters were raised in the Cotswolds to Lord and Lady Redesdale. They had one brother Tom who was educated at Eton. But despite their privileged upbringing as members of the aristocracy, the six daughters went on to shock polite society with their impulsive, hedonistic lifestyles. Nancy Miford . Nancy was educated at home by a governess along with her sister Jessica. Despite the lack of formal schooling, she became a successful novelist with a string of books. Her most successful books were The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate. She also wrote for Vogue when she moved in with author Evelyn Waugh and his wife, before marrying Peter Rodd. That relationship was a disaster, ending in divorce. She moved to Paris after the war and died aged 69. Pamela Mitford . She was the least 'newsworthy' of the girls known as 'the quiet sister' who married Derek Ainslie Jackson. Diana Mitford . Diana would not have been out of place if she was appearing on the Jeremy Kyle show, such was her unconventional lifestyle. She married Bryan Guinness, heir to the brewing fortune and had two children. However, domesticity was not in her DNA and divorced him, before marrying Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists. Both Diana and Mosley were jailed during World War II because of their strong fascist beliefs. Unity Mitford . Unity was an ardent fascist like her elder sister and traveled to Germany in the 1930s, where she was a personal friend of Adolf Hitler. When war broke out in 1939, Unity shot herself in the head but was saved by surgeons. She returned to Britain but had suffered brain damage. Jessica Mitford . Unlike Diana and Unity, Jessica was a firm communist and ran off to Spain with Winston Churchill's socialist nephew Esmond Romily. Romily was shot down during WWII while fighting for the allies. Jessica left Britain and moved to the United States where she married Robert Treuhaft - Ben's father. Deborah Mitford . The youngest sister, Deborah met Andrew Cavendish at the outbreak of WWII. They married soon afterwards. After the death of Cavendish's father, her husband inherited the title 11th Duke of Devonshire and the family's home of Chatsworth House.","Musican leaves his wife after a row before moving into a beach tent with his piano .

"Cellulite affects everyone from the super slim . to the ultra curvy and from detox diets to miracle creams, there are no shortage of gimmicks out there to help banish the dreaded . lumps and bumps. And now, one company has taken the battle against unsightly orange-peel skin one step further with its gold-infused leggings. Proskins - an anti-cellulite compression wear and slimming legging company - has today unveiled the 24-carat gold legwear that promise to banish cellulite. Can these gold leggings banish cellulite? Proskins has unveiled . 24-carat gold leggings which promise to improve the appearance of your legs in as little as three days . So how do they work? The black leggings are packed with tiny gold particles which are full of thousands of hyaluronic acid molecules. Hyaluronic acid is a powerful moisturiser that occurs naturally in the skin. As we age, the natural hyaluronic acid in the skin decreases, leaving it looking tired, dull and dry. Proskins Gold claim the hyaluronic acid in the leggings penetrates deeply into the skin to hydrate and moisturise and leave it with a fresh, youthful appearance. Bedtime beauty: The black leggings, as well as gloves and eye masks, are packed with tiny gold particles which are full of thousands of hyaluronic acid molecules which moisturise skin . Proskins say it's the first time ever that these ingredients have been used in leggings, as well as in gloves and eye masks, which the company also offer. They claim that their gold garments can provide intense hydration for legs, tackle crows’ feet around the eyes and smooth hands in just three days. Beat the bumps: The leggings also promise to help to contour and improve the appearance of problem areas and the moisturising and antioxidant benefits continue for up to two days after wear . The leggings also promise to help contour and improve the appearance of problem areas for up to two days after wear. The brand says unique yarn technology means the micro-capsules are guaranteed to remain in the garment for at least 100 washes. Model Sophie Anderton is a fan and has even said that she would rather wear the mask, gloves and leggings to bed than a sexy negligee. She said: 'Now that I am 36, having youthful looking legs is certainly a lot harder than when I started out modelling nearly 20 years ago - no matter how many trips you make to the gym. 'But in less than three days of wearing them, I noticed that my legs were far more hydrated and super smooth. They definitely had a ""youthful glow"" and the effects didn’t stop after I stopped wearing them, which is a big bonus.' The leggings cost £145 and the eye mask and gloves are £45 each.

"Katie Webb was found hanged in her bedroom on April 24 this year . A 12-year-old girl was found hanged in her bedroom after she had argued with her mother about being untidy, an inquest has heard. Katie Webb was found unconscious in her bedroom on April 24, this year. Her devastated father Daniel, 34, told an inquest he had a row with Katie two days before she died but put her mood 'down to hormones'. Her mother Anne, 32, also told the hearing she had 'argued' with Katie on the day of her death about her messy bedroom at the family home in Evesham, Worcestershire. Speaking at the hearing at Stourport Coroner’s Court on Monday, Mr Webb said: 'It was mine and Katie’s very first spat. I put it down to hormones.' Two days later he heard a loud scream from his wife Anne who had discovered their daughter hanged in her bedroom. Mr Webb rushed to the room where he tried to give his daughter CPR before paramedics arrived. He told the inquest: 'I went straight to where the screaming was coming from to see Anne holding Katie and screaming ""help me, help me, help me"". 'Then this really nice man pulled me out of the way and said ""You’ve done enough, let someone who knows what they’re doing try"". I just broke down.' Katie was airlifted to Birmingham Children’s Hospital but could not be saved. The inquest heard Worcestershire County Council’s social services division had placed Katie under a Child Protection Plan in 2010 following concerns around neglect. This was downgraded to a Child in Need Plan in May 2012 after the family made good progress and was even removed entirely in September that year. But the plan was reactivated in March this year after social workers found a diary Katie has been asked to complete which contained an entry saying: 'If I don’t do my chores I will get a whack.' Her parents denied it was true and Katie later told a social services worker it had never happened. Katie had been a pupil at Simon de Montfort School, Evesham. Geraint William, the Senior Coroner for Worcestershire, concluded there was no evidence Katie had been bullied either at school or online . The inquest heard Worcestershire County Council’s social services division closed their case on Katie on April 23 - just one day before she died. Geraint William, the Senior Coroner for Worcestershire, concluded there was no evidence Katie had been bullied either at school or online. He recorded an open verdict saying he didn’t feel he had enough evidence to confidently record a verdict of suicide or accidental death. Addressing Katie’s parents, Mr Williams said: 'There’s absolutely nothing I can say that makes this look better. 'This will never, ever go away for you but it will get easier to live with and frankly that’s all you can hope for.'

"A Liverpool fan who bears an uncanny resemblance to Luis Suarez  is begging his fellow supporters to leave him alone after continually being mistaken for the star striker.

"The U.S. government is making covert cash payments to compensate the families of innocent civilians killed in drone strikes, it has been claimed. Faisal bin Ali Jaber, a Yemeni man whose nephew and brother-in-law were killed in a drone strike in 2013, says he was given $100,000 'hush money' after taking his case to Washington. Mr Jaber says he was given the freshly minted bills in a blue plastic bag by officials at the Yemeni National Security Bureau (NSB), who told him the money was from the U.S. Government. Faisal bin Ali Jaber, 56, says he was given $100,000 in 'freshly minted' notes by the U.S. government after he went to Washington DC to protest the killing of two of his relatives in a drone strike . Walid Abdullah Abd al-Mahmoud bin Ali Jaber, 26, a police officer (left), and Salim Ahmed bin Ali Jaber, 43, an imam who had denounced Al Qaeda, were killed in a drone strike in Yemen last year . Walid Abdullah Abd al-Mahmoud bin Ali Jaber, 26, a Yemeni police officer, and Salim Ahmed bin Ali Jaber, 43, an imam who had denounced Al Qaeda, were both killed alongside three suspected militants when a drone unleashed hellfire missiles on their village last year. Their deaths sparked anti-American protests in the village of Khashamir, and attracted the attention of charity Reprieve who sent lawyers to represent Mr Jaber. Late in 2013 he travelled to Washington DC to speak with Congressmen and members of the National Security Council about the deaths of his relatives. Stephen Pomper, an Obama aide responsible for multilateral affairs and human rights, attended the meeting, along with a junior colleague, Mr Jaber told Yahoo News. While the officials promised to consider what Mr Jaber had told them, no immediate action was taken, and he was left in limbo. However on July 8 this year, at 10am, he was called to the headquarters of the NSB, who work closely with the CIA, where authorities handed him a blue plastic bag filled with notes. They told him the money was from the U.S. government, and that they were only passing it along. The $100 bills were bound in rubber tape. Mr Jaber added: 'The money was almost brand-new. The serial numbers were sequential.' At first Mr Jaber refused to accept the cash, saying that he wanted a formal apology from the government , not a shady pay-off. While the Yemeni government investigated the strike, and awarded Mr Jaber compensation after admitting fault the U.S. has never acknowledged the deaths (pictured, Mr Jaber's village after the attack) Mr Jaber says he was handed the cash by Yemeni security officials in Washington, who told him it was from the U.S. government and that they were passing it along (pictured, shrapnel from the drone strike) However after a conversation with village elders, in which they told him how badly the victims' families were struggling, he agreed to take the money and went back for it the following day. He said: 'My family received money from the US government as an admission of their guilt for ""mistakenly"" killing our relatives in a drone strike. But this is not justice. 'There are many other families in Yemen who have lost innocent relatives in US drone strikes but do not receive hush money for speaking out. 'If the US can admit their ""mistake"" in a back room of the Yemeni security services, they can surely admit it publicly and apologise for what they have done to my family, and many others in Yemen.' According to Reprieve, the the Obama administration has never publicly admitted that Mr Jaber's relatives were killed in error, or acknowledged that they were innocent civilians. Mr Jaber initially refused to take the cash, branding it 'hush money', but after village elders reminded him of how much his relatives were struggling, he accepted (pictured, blood spilled during the strike) The deaths have also not been investigated, and no formal apology has ever been made. Yemeni authorities, meanwhile, readily admitted that Mr Jaber's family had been killed in error, and paid him the equivalent of $55,000 compensation after carrying out their own investigation. Cori Crider, attorney for Mr bin Ali Jaber, said: 'President Obama is as reluctant as ever to admit the full extent of the US drone program in Yemen – but money talks, even if the White House won’t. 'Cash payments without full accountability won’t quell the outrage about civilian drone deaths, and continued US strikes will only bring further instability to Yemen. 'The victims' families want and deserve an explanation, while the American people need to hear the truth about what is being done in their name.'","Faisal bin Ali Jaber, 56, has two relatives killed in 2013 U.S. drone strike .

"For rogue foreign currency traders hoping to rig the system, there was a 60-second window to cash in. At 4pm, the most important part of their day, they used internet chatrooms to share confidential information about orders from clients for foreign currency. The corrupt bankers knew they could make hundreds of thousands of pounds profit for their firm – and so boost their bonuses – in a matter of seconds. Scroll down for video . UBS, Citibank, HSBC, RBS and JP Morgan were fined £2billion and Barclays will also be fined at a later date . For it is when rates for a wide range of currencies are set in a market where trillions of dollars change hands every day. So they would would conspire with each other to move the rate of a currency up and down by placing huge orders and persuading others to follow suit. Because foreign exchange is a global 24-hour market, with institutional clients such as pension funds, big companies and hedge funds placing huge orders for currencies, banks take a snapshot of how much is being bought and sold during a 30-second period just before and after 4pm. This is known as the 4pm WM Reuters Fix and is used as a peg for determining the rates clients receive when they order currency. Traders pushed the ‘fix’ currency rate up or down by submitting a rush of orders during this 60-second window. This skewed the market’s impression of supply and demand, so changing the price. Traders placed their own orders before 4pm to profit from the subsequent movement in prices. Typically they ganged up with traders at other banks as it is easier to move rates up or down if they worked together. In the hours before 4pm, tight-knit groups of traders would share confidential information about client orders to buy or sell a particular currency. Messages were typically exchanged in internet chatrooms, often given colourful nicknames such as Three Musketeers, the A-Team and the Co-operative. Punishment: Five of the world's biggest banks, including HSBC, have been fined a total of £2bn for colluding to make money from the foreign exchange market. They used a 60-window in the trading day to rig rates . When they failed to make a killing, they would berate each other. One HSBC employee complained to a trader from another bank who had not disclosed a large order in advance: ‘You are useless… how can I make free money with no ****ing heads up.’ One bank would typically take the lead if it had received a large order from a client asking to buy a certain currency at the 4pm fix rate. Shameful: New evidence published by the FCA reveals the bragging messages sent by bankers online . If the bank sells the currency to the client and then the rate goes up at 4pm it stands to lose money. But traders managed this risk by buying currency in the market to sell to clients later. If the rate goes down at 4pm then the bank makes money. To ensure this happens the trader would work with counterparts at other banks urging them to push through sales of currency during the 60-second window at 4pm to drive the rate lower. In one example, HSBC colluded with traders from at least three other firms to attempt to drive the sterling-dollar rate fix lower. Shocking: One conversation between traders led to a deal that made giant UBS $513,000 and one trader joked about how a colleague bragged about his bonuses . The Financial Conduct Authority said traders had shared confidential information about client orders prior to the fix, and then used this information to attempt to manipulate the fix downwards. The sterling/dollar exchange rate fix fell from £1.6044 to £1.6009 in this particular example, making HSBC a £100,000 profit. Afterwards, traders congratulated themselves, saying: ‘Loved that mate... worked lovely... pity we couldn’t get it below the 00’, ‘there you go.. go early, move it, hold it, push it’, ‘nice works gents..I don my hat’ and ‘Hooray nice teamwork’. In another case RBS generated a profit of £390,000 in seconds. One trader involved in the scam commented later: ‘We ******* killed it right... [another firm], myself and RBS.’ Royal Bank of Scotland was fined a total of £399million including £217million by the FCA and £182million by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). HSBC was fined £389million including £216million from the FCA and £173million from the CFTC. Swiss bank UBS was fined a total of £503million including £234million by the FCA, £182million by the CFTC and £87million by the Swiss regulator FINMA. America's Citibank was hit with penalties of £420million including just under £225.6million from the FCA and £194.6million from the CFTC. JP Morgan Chase was fined £417million including £222million by the UK regulator and £195million from the CFTC. However Barclays, the third British bank expected to be fined, said it was 'in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement' with more investigations from other authorities still to come.","RBS, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, UBS and Citibank fined in UK and U.S.

"Two multi-millionaire internet entrepreneurs who bought a derelict Devon pub have finally met the villagers - and bought them all a pint. Michael and Xochi Birch made £370 million when they sold Bebo, an early social network, the website to AOL in 2008. The Californian-based couple have now snapped up the the Farmers Arms pub in Woolsery, Devon, and have vowed to restore it to its former glory. At a meeting to explain their plans for the watering hole the husband and wife greeted locals with free wine and beer. Scroll down for video . The crumbling Farmers Arms public house in Woolsery, Devon, has been snapped up by the Bebo entrepreneurs . Michael and Xochi Birch made £370 million when they sold Bebo to AOL in 2008. They have since bought it back for $1 million for 'fun' A total of 200 locals attended the meeting at the village hall to hear Michael Birch discuss his plans for the derelict pub . One local who attended the meeting (pictured) said 'When we heard the news that Michael had bought the pub it was like all our Christmases had come at once' Mr Birch hired the community hall and invited all 1,200 residents of the village to hear his ideas for the crumbling public house. The 44-year-old, who was born in Cheshunt, Hertforshire,  has a family history in Woolsery dating back to the 1700s and considers it his 'spiritual home'. The father-of-three recalled, with a pint in his hand, how he used to visit the pub on his many visits to the area. 'I have six generations of my family buried in the village church and I still have family living in the village today,' said the philanthropist, who named his son Devon. 'I have a huge emotional connection to the village and I have fond memories of drinking in The Farmers Arms and was saddened to hear that it had closed.' The super wealthy couple have also bought the nearby Manor House Inn, which they will turn into a hotel . 'I'm meeting with architects while I am here but it is still early days. I want to make sure I get everything right.' Thirsty locals were left with a three-mile hike to the nearest pub after the Farmers Arms was shut in December 2012. Its thatched roof was covered by a tarpaulin and villagers became worried about the safety of the building. They managed to get the pub registered as an asset of community value in a bid to save it but that was reversed by Torridge District Council after the previous owners appealed. Mr and Mrs Birch have also bought the nearby Manor House Inn, which has been unoccupied for eight years, which they will turn into a hotel. Michael and Xochi Birch bought the residents of Woolsery a drink to outline his plans for the crumbling village pub . Repairing both will cost more than £1million. Job Andrew, Mr Birch's great-great grandfather, built Woolsery village shop, which remained in the family until it was sold in 1961. His grandmother, Millicent Andrew, was born in the village shop's premises in 1900, and his grandfather Joseph Burrow was born at Ashcroft Farm. Peter and Sonia Hamilton who founded the Woolsery Action Group in a bid to save The Farmers Arms were among 200 supporters who toasted the mogul's intervention. Peter said: 'When we heard the news that Michael had bought the pub it was like all our Christmases had come at once. 'The closure of the village pub has had a detrimental effect on the village.' The social networking website was launched in 2005. Users could upload blogs, photos, music and videos to their pages. Bebo, alongside MySpace was one of the contenders to Facebook in the early 2000s. At its peak it had about 40 million users. It was sold by Michael Birch to AOL for £370 million in 2008. Bebo  was eclipsed by Facebook as well as other social networking sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr. AOL's reluctance to invest in the site has been blamed for its decline. Bebo sought bankruptcy protection in 2013 and Mr Birch  bought the company from its receivers for $1 million. Sonia added: 'I hardly see anyone in the village now so we are all excited to get the pub back into the heart of the community.' Ben Trevor, who just moved to the village five months ago said the purchase has created a real buzz. He said: 'There's a great atmosphere in the village at the moment - it is such exciting news.' Father-and-son, Gordon and Clive Leonard, owned and ran The Manor House from 1992 to 2002, were also in attendance. Clive said: 'It's exciting to see what he has planned - the pub has been a great miss to the village. 'It's the best news the village could ever have had.' Mr and Mrs Birch set up Bebo in 2005 with the social media website shorthand for 'Blog Early, Blog Often'. It was a huge success and became one of the world's most popular websites with AOL buying it for $850 million three years later. The couple made $600 million from the sale but then had to watch as the site crumbled due to poor management and the staggering growth of Facebook. Last year they bought the site back for $1million 'for fun' to see if they could inject life into it.","Michael Birch and his wife, Xochi, sold Bebo for £370 million in 2008 .

"A man from Oakland, California spent five years recreating all the dishes from one of the best restaurants in the world in his very own home. Alinea in Chicago is more than just a restaurant it's a savory explosion. Chef Grant Achatz's three star Michelin reverie uses molecular gastronomy to create otherworldly dishes such as edible helium balloons and chocolate spheres that erupt open onto the plate. Allen Hemberger dined at the Chicago restaurant once in 2008 and after his final course spent the next five years creating over 400 dishes in a journey he calls, 'The Alinea Project.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Did it himself: Allen Hemberger dined at the Chicago restaurant once in 2008 and after his final course spent the next five years creating over 400 dishes and researching every aspect of them . Pop art: One of the artfully designed items on the menu is an edible helium balloon that tastes like Apple . Multi-faceted: The dishes have different textures and ingredients, some of which evoke emotional reactions . Hemberger, who worked as a visual effects artist by day, spent years researching how to make each dish, where to buy the ingredients, and even hand crafted certain utensils used in the restaurant when he couldn't find them in the store. In a short documentary about the gastronomic journey directed by Daniel Addelson, Hemberger details how what began as a hobby turned into an obsession as he slaved away trying to create each dish the way in was prepared in the restaurant. At times Hemberger recounted feeling inadequate and he pointed to one recipe involving a gel swirl that kept falling apart try after try. To make the dish work he felt as though he 'cheated' by having to add more gel in order to get it to hold. Hemberger emailed chef Grant Achatz with a question about the dish who then kindly invited him to fly to Chicago for a demo on how to make the challenging swirl. The two bonded in the kitchen and when the gel was finally done it fell apart just like it had for Hemberger at home. Making magic: While Allen Hemberger's kitchen isn't quite like the one at the world class restaurant, he still had an impressive go at recreating each and every dish Alinea has to offer . The inspiration: Allen Hemberger is pictured here with chef Grant Achatz, the visionary creator behind Alinea . Even chefs make mistakes: Allen Hemberger recounts trying to get gel to stick together like the recipe says but then later learning the the recipe was wrong and his intuition was right . Molecular gastronomy: Some of the food preparation looks more like it's being done in a lab than in a kitchen . 'The recipe might be wrong,' said Achatz who recommended adding at little more gel. At that moment Hemberger made the realization that he was capable of taking ownership over each dish without having to worry about making it to its absolute perfection. His process and intuition became the evolution, not just the dish itself. The short documentary also explores the relationship that Allen Hemberger has with his wife Sarah who describes herself as a picky eater. Even though the cooking process took up most of her husband's time and she didn't like the texture of some of the foods she was supportive of him and their relationship blossomed as beautifully as one of Achatz's dishes. Sarah is a part of the creative process and helped her husband with the book entitled, 'The Alinea project.' Allen Hemberger started a Kickstarter for the book so he could tell his life changing story of recreating each plate and learning some invaluable lessons along the way. The kickstarter originally had a $28,500 goal but he's managed to raise $42,000 in dough thus far. Those wishing to book reservations or learn more about Alinea in Chicago can do so here. Surprise after surprise: Diners at Alinea should prepare themselves for the delightful unknown . Unique: Each dish is a combination of flavors and complex ingredients melded together in scientific perfection . Love: Not only does Allen Hemberger love recreating food, he loves serving it to his supportive wife Sarah who has helped him through the process of actualizing his passions .","Allen Hemberger dined at the Chicago restaurant Alinea  in 2008 and after his final course spent the next five years creating every item on the menu .

"Homeowners pay £47,000 more to live ‘the good life’ in the countryside rather than in Britain’s towns and cities, research shows. Rural properties cost about 26 per cent more than homes in suburbs and city centres, despite the gap closing in recent years. Buyers pay an average premium of £46,600 for homes in the country, a study by Halifax found. Research has found homeowners pay £47,000 more to live ‘the good life’ in the countryside rather than in towns and cities . The cost for country living varied wildly across England and was greatest in the West Midlands, where rural properties were about £89,000 more. This compares to the north-east where it cost only £17,570 more to live in the countryside. Prices in urban areas have been rising faster over the past five years, increasing by 18 per cent compared to 12 per cent in rural areas, but it continues to be the cheaper option. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: ‘It typically costs significantly more to buy in rural areas with a substantial premium existing in all the regions of Great Britain. Rural properties in Britain cost about 26 per cent more than homes in the suburbs and cities . ‘This reflects the aspiration of many to own a property in the countryside. ‘The relatively high prices, however, put rural homes out of the reach for many, particularly the young. ‘This is reflected in first-time buyers accounting for a smaller proportion of homebuyers in the countryside than in urban areas.’ Regardless of where you are hoping to buy - whether it be in the countryside or town - getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

"From kissing an 13ft alligator on the nose just a week after it had bitten someone else to walking over broken glass, this fearless daredevil is a real life female Jackass. Stunt-woman Rachel Star Withers, 29, is giving Johnny Knoxville a run for his money by completing crazy stunts and pushing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. Ms Withers of South Carolina, said completing stunts was an 'excuse' for her to push her limits and 'find out what is possible'. Scroll down for video . Rachel Star Withers kisses a 13ft long alligator which had bitten someone else just a week before . Ms Withers gets to know the alligator a little better, before leaning in to plant a kiss on its nose . The 29-year-old adopts a cautious stance as a feisty alligator rushes at her with open jaws . She has been compared to stunt man Johnny Knoxville who is the star of the Jackass movies and TV show . She said: 'I'm the kind of person who sees someone do something cool and then I want to do it too. 'Real life is way scarier than my stunts, and I think pushing my fear in my controlled environment helps me to take on the world.' Ms Withers rates the alligator kiss as her 'most dangerous', but said it was 'so worth it'. A photo of the stunt is now the wallpaper picture on her cellphone, something that reminds her 'that I'm a badass when I'm having a rough day and feeling down on myself'. Ms Withers said she has always been 'extremely daring', as she comes from a family of travellers and risk takers. For the past eight years, Ms Withers has completed a host of daring stunts, which she researches before attempting. Ms Withers said stunts are an 'excuse' for her to push her limits and 'find out what is possible' Ms Withers uses her breasts like a hammer to crush a stack of beer cans lined up along a bench . Ms Withers shows off her bruised hand and the brick that injured her when she broke it with her fist . The stunt woman covers her eyes and braces herself as a friend prepares to shoot her with a pellet gun . Something which has probably helped her avoid serious injury. So far the daredevil has only suffered bruising. Ms Withers says she has an 'ongoing list of stunts I want to perform', and videos them when the mood takes her. She said: 'I just hit record and whatever happens happens. Some of my best stuff is completely unplanned. 'The most common reaction I get is people say I'm crazy.' But Ms Withers is never deterred: 'Pretty much everything I attempt someone tells me it's too dangerous or not possible. Leaning back, Ms Withers opens her throat as a friend slowly places a sword into her mouth . In freezing conditions Ms Withers goes outside in just shorts and a bikini top and rubs snow on her body . 'For things I know that no one will want me doing, I usually don't tell them about it till after I am done shooting.' Thanks to her wild antics, Ms Withers has appeared on a host of TV shows, including NBC's American Ninja Warrior and America's Got Talent, as well as MTV's Ridiculousness and What the Flip?. Far from saying the classic, 'don't try this at home', stunt line, Ms Withers says anyone can perform daring tricks, 'if you take the time to learn'. For her next trick, Ms Withers is 'saving up for an epic trip' involving sharks.","Rachel Star Withers kissed an alligator a week after it bit someone else .

"Turned into a laughing stock: Valerie Trierweler . France's first lady Valerie Trierweiler collapsed and was rushed to hospital after being told of President Francois Hollande’s secret trysts with an actress, it emerged last night. Distraught Miss Trierweiler, 48, was admitted for treatment following the publication of photographs of the French leader sneaking in and out of his love-nest. Last night she was still in hospital undergoing tests and was being ‘left to rest’, a spokesman said. Sources said Miss Trierweiler was being treated for shock and exhaustion, while one newspaper said she was ‘very depressed’ by the revelations, which place her grand lifestyle under threat. As first lady, Miss Trierweiler – who is not married to Mr Hollande – has enjoyed all the perks of a presidential wife with a retinue of staff and a generous budget. But her place in the 59-year-old president’s affections appears to have been taken by Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old actress who has been conducting a secret affair with the Socialist head of state since last year. Mr Hollande, whose popularity was already at rock bottom as France teeters on the brink of economic crisis, has been urged to ‘clarify’ his love life. An opinion poll yesterday showed the vast majority of French voters – 89 per cent – want him to separate from Miss Trierweiler, which would make her the first ‘premiere dame’ in history to be kicked out of the Elysee Palace. It reflects mounting anger that the already unpopular Miss Trierweiler maintains her own office at the palace, costing French taxpayers a small fortune. The Paris Match journalist has five staff working for her, at a cost of £17,000 per month, and her taxpayer-funded perks included homes across France, and private jets and limousines at her disposal as she represents the nation at home and abroad. Miss Trierweiler became Mr Hollande’s live-in girlfriend following his separation from fellow Socialist politician Segolene Royal, the mother of his four children. Mr Hollande is was said to have taken her as mistress while still living with Miss Royal. Miss Trierweiler has been a deeply controversial figure since moving into the Elysée following Mr Hollande’s presidential election win in 2012. She was told on Thursday evening that the French magazine Closer was preparing to publish a seven-page exposé of Mr Hollande’s philandering. A palace source said: ‘She didn’t believe it at first. She thought they could just get their lawyers to stop the magazine publishing the story. ‘Then she was told it couldn’t be banned. She was upset, very upset. ‘She is being humiliated, and effectively turned into a national laughing stock.’ Scroll down for video . Secret tryst: Actress Julie Gayet, 41, is said to have spent several nights with the president . Asked about her future, the first lady’s spokesman, Patrice Biancone, said she had been in hospital since Friday but was expected to leave today, adding: ‘She needs rest. Then she will decide what to do.’ The photographs allegedly showed the two-timing president going to comical lengths to keep their his romantic liaisons with Miss Gayet a secret. Mr Hollande was pictured disguised beneath a helmet and a dark coat arriving on a three-wheeled moped driven by his bodyguard. He spent the night there on several occasions. One morning, his publicly-funded bodyguard returned carrying breakfast croissants. Mr Hollande has threatened legal action against Closer for breaching his privacy but has not denied the affair. Troubled: French President Francois Hollande and Valerie Trierweiler at the Elysee Palace in March 2013 . France has some of the strictest privacy laws in the world and previous French presidents Nicolas Sarkozy, Jacques Chirac and Francois Mitterrand all secretly cheated on their wives. Opponents claim the scandal exposes publicly-funded deceit, security lapses and the enormous cost of a first lady who no longer has legitimacy. Paris is buzzing with speculation over who tipped off  the magazine – including  the extraordinary suggestion the president himself was responsible for the leak  as a way of getting rid of split-skirt-wearing Miss Trierweiler. Laurence Piau, the editor of Closer, said Mr Hollande was ‘clearly in love’ with Miss Gayet, a mother of two, and wanted a future with her. Closer said President Francois Hollande was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet, backing its claim with photographs after months of swirling rumours .","Valerie Trierweiler collapsed from 'shock and exhaustion' after revelation .

"Chris Hughton says that the FA are now serious about increasing the number of black and ethnic minority managers in football – but he wants to see substantive results in terms of appointments rather than good intentions. Hughton, who with Chris Powell and Keith Curle is one of only three black managers in the game, despite 25 per cent of players coming from black and minority backgrounds, takes on Arsenal in the FA Cup on Sunday having been appointed by Brighton at the turn of the year. And the former Norwich manager said: ‘I see a real enthusiasm from the stakeholders in our game, the PFA, certainly the FA and the LMA to address some of the imbalances. I think we're seeing an upturn in the number of black and ethnic potential coaches wanting to participate in courses and that's certainly a way to go. But it's about transparency as well, making sure that black and ethnic coaches are in a position to be interviewed for jobs and of course getting transparency in feedback from clubs.

Chris Powell, along with Hughton and Keith Curle, is one of only three black managers in the game . ‘As I said, there's a real enthusiasm and it's how you act upon that. If we're hearing things like that from the FA, then it's their responsibility to see that that comes into practice.’ But Hughton is not a supporter of the ‘Rooney Rule’, a stipulation by the NFL in the USA the football teams had to interview at least one minority candidate for any coaching position to increase diversity. ‘I understand and respect the reasoning for the Rooney Rule’ said Hughton. ‘They saw, similar to here, an under-representation of black coaches at the higher level. I've spoken about a, I think, real enthusiasm to change that. And if we can change that without legislation that's the best way. ‘I'm always conscious of my role and it's something that I'm very proud to do. When you speak to potential black and ethnic coaches that want to go into the game, one aspect that they always speak about are of course role models in the game. They would like to see representation, more at higher level. And any part I can play in that I am delighted to do.’","Chris Hughton, Chris Powell and Keith Curle  only black managers in game .

"White House Ebola response coordinator Ron Klain may have become an accidental folk hero to fans of crushing bureaucracy everywhere on Wednesday, when a U.S. senator asked high-ranking Obama administration officials to describe his work. The vague answers sounded like something plucked out of a Dilbert cartoon. 'Even though the President has named a so-called Ebola “czar” to coordinate our response,' Senate Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Richard Shelby complained, 'all reports indicate that he has no actual authority to direct government agencies here.' He asked two cabinet secretaries and two other experts what Klain has 'brought to the table' in his role as government-wide coordinator. Assistant Defense Secretary Michael Lumpkin praised him for 'an excellent job of doing that, just that singular focus on coordinating.' Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby wanted to know what the Obama White House's 'Ebola czar' has been doing, and witnesses were vague in their answers . A packed hearing room listened Wednesday to an update on the federal government's plan to fight Ebola, and to justifications for $6.18 billion in new spending . 'It's a very important role,' added Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, 'in terms of when a whole-of-government effort is occurring.' 'And Mr. Klain has stepped into that role and added value to our policy coordination.' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson insisted that it's critical to have 'somebody who is dedicated full-time in the White House who is doing exactly that.' All the witnesses said Klain had been in regular touch with them, ranging from 'every single day' to 'countless times,' but no one articulated a specific task he took on or accomplished. Klain wasn't present in the room: The White House has kept him away from both Capitol Hill hearings convened since his appointment last month. Dilbert, a widely read comic strip by Scott Adams, follows the foibles of a man caught in the cogworks of a big-company bureaucracy. Dilbert is tapped to 'coordinate' a minor business project in this 2010 Scott Adams cartoon . Days later the boss was the only person interested in hiring a coordinator to harmonize his staff's approach to a problem . Shelby asked Burwell whether Klain has the authority to direct government agencies to do anything, and she replied that his 'coordination' authority stops where government power begins. 'Policy coordination with regard to the execution of the agencies' responsibilities – those sit with me and with the heads of our operating divisions like Dr. Frieden,' she said, referring to the CDC director who has been the administration's public face on Ebola preparedness and epidemiology. Shelby and other Republicans, though, have complained about a White House that was slow on the uptake when the an Ebola victim first turned up in Texas. He said Obama's team has 'sent mixed messages on the issue of quarantine,' and 'did not call for enhanced airport screenings for travelers entering the U.S. from West Africa until months after the epidemic became severe.' 'Not surprisingly,' he said, 'Americans have been frustrated by the lack of clarity and coordination within their government.' White House Ebola czar Ron Klain emerged from behind the scenes on Tuesday to talk with the Obama administration-friendly MSNBC, but hasn't spoken in congressional hearings . BUSY ADDING VALUE: Klain (2nd left, back row) sits in on Ebola meetings with some of the witnesses who testified Wednesday, but they couldn't articulate anything specific that he's accomplished . Even though there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in the U.S. right now, Deputy Secretary of State Heather Higginbottom warned that Americans aren't yet out of the woods. 'It is important to realize that epidemic is not yet controlled,' she told senators, 'and that the number of cases will continue to grow.' Klain privately briefed congressional leaders on Friday at the White House and appeared Tuesday on MSNBC – saying that 'we’re going to see occasional additional cases of Ebola in our country.' The Senate Appropriations Committee hearing was called to explore the Obama administration's request for $6.18 billion in emergency funding to fight the disease. Democratic chairwoman Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, gaveling her last hearing before Republicans take over in January, seemed to be in favor of releasing the money. 'We're working together with the international community to stop the spread of the virus within the three countries,' she noted, 'as well as to contiguous countries and other locations around the world. That is why protecting the United States is essential.' 'Policy coordination ... sits with me,' said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, seeming to confirm that Klain has no authority to take action . RON KLAIN WHO? Obama's 'Ebola czar' isn't exactly a rousing success, with 40 per cent of Americans saying they've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he's doing a good job . Klain, a longtime Democratic Party operative who served a chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, has had a rough start in his role. In a MailOnline/YouGov poll during the last days of October, just 10 per cent of Americans said they approved of his job performance. That's a lower number than the dismal ratings of Congress itself. Fully 40 per cent of adults surveyed said they had never heard of him. Following the October 24 Ebola hearing in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California said it was understandable that Klain didn't appear since he was getting up to speed. But 'we do not expect that that would be repeated if there’s a followup hearing,' he cautioned.","Senators convened Wednesday to hear Ebola funding requests from cabinet-level agencies .

"Living in Massachusetts or New Hampshire may mean you’re more intelligent than residents of California and Mississippi. That's according to a recent study of reading levels and IQs, based on 500,000 Twitter messages posted by people across the U.S. The study used a computer algorithm to score tweets based on spelling, grammar and word choice, and found a significant difference in state-by-state intelligence. Zoom in on a state to find its average reading score based on tweets . Top 5: . Vermont - 5.75Wyoming - 5.51Massachusetts - 5.33Minnesota - 5.32 Maine- 5.30 . Bottom 5: . Louisiana - 4.2Alabama - 4.4South Carolina - 4.4Mississipi - 4.5Arizona - 4.6 . Average: 4 . Californian real-estate group Movoto has now used this data to create a series of 3D interactive maps showing a breakdown of reading level and IQ by state, based on the Twitter feedback . Overall scores were relatively low, with the majority of states falling between a fourth grade and sixth grade reading level. ‘The required brevity of tweets is likely the cause of this, and the comparison of states is the real measurement of interest,’ said Chris Kolmar, chief economist from Movoto. Interestingly, state-by-state results seemed to match up to previous official state education performance statistics. For example, of the five states that ranked the lowest in grade-level reading ability during the analysis of tweets, four of them also ranked in the top six of worst-educated states in 2011. These included Vermont, Wyoming and New York. Click on a state to find its average reading score based on tweets . Top 5: . Massachusetts - 104.3New Hampshire - 104.2North Dakota - 103.8Vermont - 103.8Minnesota - 103.7 . Bottom 5: . Mississippi - 94.2California - 95.5Louisiana - 95.3Alabama - 95.7New Mexico - 95.7 . Average: 97 . The most intelligent states, based on reading level on Twitter, were all in the north and are split equally between the northeast and the cluster of states that include Minnesota, both Dakotas, and Montana. In the State of the States in Education report, which is based on 2009 data, half of those states were listed as a top 10 state for 8th-grade reading proficiency. The majority of the states coming up somewhere in the middle, with average scores were located in the west, southwest, midwest, and along the east coast. ‘An interesting question which is not explored here would examine the reason behind this correlation,’ said Kolmar. ‘Are worse writing skills correlated with lower IQ scores, are IQ tests necessarily biased to the better educated?’ The states with the lowest IQ were found to be Mississippi, Alabama, New Mexico, Louisiana and California. Somewhat unexpectedly, high-school graduation rates didn’t match up with a state’s tweeting abilities. ‘Perhaps there should be a class on incorporating proper grammar, spelling, and word choice into tweets,’ Kolmar concluded.

"Gertrud Scholtz-Klink was chief of the Nazi bridal schools and trained women to become 'perfect' wives to SS men . A sinister set of rules for would-be wives of Nazis in the Third Reich has been discovered three quarters of a century later. Several ‘bride schools’ were set up with the aim of providing the perfect partners for Adolf Hitler’s henchmen. Regulations dictated that young women would be taught ‘washing, cooking, childcare and home design’ before they could walk up the aisle with the men who would staff death camps and rule conquered lands with an iron fist. They were also instructed in social niceties – such as how to hold conversations at cocktail parties – and how to bring up their children worshipping not God or Jesus Christ, but Hitler. ‘This is participation in the resurrection path of our people,’ said Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, chief of the Nazi bride schools which began 75 years ago when the first was established on the island of Schwanenwerder in the Wannsee lake outside of Berlin. Along with the rulebook found in the Federal Archive were certificates adorned with the Germanic ‘Tree of Life’ which were presented to young girls who passed the six-week course to marry their sweethearts in the SS, Hitler’s paramilitary defence force. The bride schools were a collaboration between Scholtz-Klink and SS chief Heinrich Himmler, who was obsessed with German superiority over all races and the need for a ‘strong family life to create a strong, pure nation’. The schools were a collaboration between Scholtz-Klink (centre) and Heinrich Himmler (left) who was obsessed with German superiority over all races and the need to create a 'pure nation' Intelligence files from the time show that Himmler could often be seen 'sneering' around to 'catch glimpses of girls dancing' Himmler signed a decree in 1936 . ordering all women who wanted to marry a member of the SS to participate . in the special training courses. Not only would they learn how to . become ‘good wives’, but they would also ‘acquire special knowledge of . race and genetics’. Failure to comply meant refusal of the marriage . certificate. The documents show that the Nazis . regarded women, above all else, as breeding machines and ‘sustainers of . the race’, in the language of the schools. Scholtz-Klink praised motherhood under . the Nazis as ‘divine’ and in a speech to senior party leaders in 1935 . ranted: ‘You need us, you depend on us. 'We are into something good, we . participate in the resurrection way of our people. Women must be the . spiritual caregivers and the secret queens of our people, called upon by . fate for this special task!’ But the doctrine of the bridal schools . began to falter the bigger the toll the war took on the home front. With slave labour imports still not enough to plug the manpower gap left . by men sent to fight Hitler’s war, Scholtz-Klink had to dream up a new . ideal of womanhood – one less involved with babies and more about . turning lathes and operating steel furnaces to turn out the material . needed for the fighting man. Role model: Hitler's depute Hermann Goering, with his wife Emmy and child . Scholtz-Klink was the highest ranking . female Nazi in the history of the Third Reich. She ruthlessly followed . the party line, disallowing any female with Jewish or gipsy blood, or . mental illness or physcial deformity, from attending her bridal courses.

"Monaco has become a byword for expensive transfers and world-class players once again in recent years with James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao passing through the club and restoring some of the lustre of the Glenn Hoddle and Mark Hateley years. The glamour associated with AS Monaco had faded considerably when Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev took over in 2011, when the club were languishing in the French second division. But having finished second to Paris Saint-Germain last season, Rybolovlev has scaled back investments, selling James to Real Madrid and loaning Falcao to Manchester United as the club attempt to establish themselves on an even keel. Radamel Falcao was released by Monaco with Manchester United paying his £285,000-a-week wages . After shining in the World Cup, James Rodriguez joined Real Madrid for £63m last summer . Promotion under Claudio Ranieri in 2013 and an outlay of £140million, which also included the likes of Joao Moutinho, brought its own problem, with some French league sides complaining that Monaco’s tax arrangements — foreign players such as Dimitar Berbatov pay almost no income tax — constituted an unfair advantage. Eventually, Monaco paid £37.5m as a one-off payment to the French League to preserve their unique identity. ‘The idea was to put Monaco back on the map of French football and European football as soon as possible,’ says vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev. ‘I think we did that. I think people recognise that we’re good as we attract attention to the French league.’ Monaco’s win at Nice on Friday leaves them in fourth place. ‘Our ambition is to win the title in the next few years and stay in the top three and be an important actor of the European stage,’ said Vasilyev. ‘We can’t be in the top 10 but we can be an important player.’ Glenn Hoddle (left) and Mark Hateley (right) flank Vadim Vasilyev on their visit to Monaco .","Monaco finished second to PSG last season but let talents such as Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez depart .

Hicks even spent a week learning everything about the party prince, such as his military training, schooling, scandals, and girlfriends so he could hold up the ruse.

"It is difficult to avoid feeling like you have stepped into a bygone era when speaking to Harry Kane. He is the classic example of the local boy made good, with all the ingredients of what was once expected of a player present in his life story. As he prepared to take on Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final, he was reminiscing about his trip to Wembley to watch Spurs beat Chelsea in the same competition in 2008. Harry Kane will try to take his  form to Wembley when Tottenham play Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final . Kane (right) celebrates with his Tottenham team-mates after scoring an equaliser against West Ham . Kane, second from the right, poses with David Beckham at the launch of his academy in 2005 . Kane scored twice as Tottenham came from behind to beat Arsenal in the recent north London derby . There is the fact that he went to David Beckham’s school, played for the same junior team as Essex’s most-famous face and met the player when he was a star-struck 11-year-old. Then add the fact that he is a Tottenham academy graduate who, a little over a year ago, was not widely expected to be much more than a fringe player but who has now turned into one of the Premier League’s most exciting players on the verge of an England call-up. This is how football used to be: before the Premier League, before £5.1billion TV deals and before globalisation. Just for good measure, he says he wants to stay at Tottenham for life. Of course, that is an aspiration rather than a guarantee but at times it does feel as though the Harry Kane story is too good to be true. Kane (centre) headed his second goal for Tottenham against Arsenal to secure the win at White Hart Lane . So perhaps it was inevitable that cold reality would intrude on his fairy tale eventually. After all, no one is afforded grace in the post-Twitter world, as Kane has now discovered. One of the best in a series of impressive performances saw him score twice against Arsenal. The following day photographs emerged of a 10-year-old Kane in an Arsenal shirt at their 2004 Premier League victory parade for the Invincibles team. According to Tottenham fans he ‘is one of their own’ but at that moment he appeared to have a past, even though it does seem harsh to judge a 10-year-old who was swept along by a moment of a title euphoria. Just to be clear, Kane’s loyalties quickly became undivided and committed to the team up the Seven Sisters Road. ‘At that age I think most kids are just football fans,’ he said. ‘They love watching football. Obviously I love Tottenham and love them as a club. And I think the derby game definitely showed that. People will always have opinion and pictures but that’s this day and age and Twitter and what you’ve got to deal with. ‘In the way it was a compliment that those pictures came out because if I hadn’t have scored against Arsenal, they never would have. The derby was a very special day for me and one I won’t forget.’ Kane (left) celebrates after scoring the winning goal for Tottenham against Arsenal in the Premier League . England manager Roy Hodgson (centre) was present as Kane inspired Tottenham to a win over Arsenal . Kane is an academy graduate alongside midfielder Ryan Mason (left) and Andros Townsend (right) Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (left) has looked to give younger players a chance in the team . There is also a more serious side to his story. In an age in which clubs import 16-year-olds, Kane, along with Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend, represent the rise of the home-grown English players. Every football think-tank concludes that such players are the lifeblood of the English game but finding a Premier League manager willing to risk playing an academy graduate is a rarity. Luckily for Kane, Tim Sherwood, who was his academy manager at Spurs before blooding him in the first team, and present boss Mauricio Pochettino have shown faith in him. But, he agrees, that it seems harder than ever for English players to make that breakthrough. ‘I think it is,’ said Kane. ‘There’s a lot of money in football and if a team haven’t got an answer, they just go and buy someone and they think that’s the answer. That’s not always the case. We’ve got great players here, with the likes of me, Ryan, Andros as well as [Algerian] Nabil Bentaleb. We’ve got young players who have shown that you don’t always have to buy players. ‘There are players that are home-grown and in your academy that are good enough. It’s just whether or not they get the chance and maybe it’s just that enough young players coming through don’t get a chance on the big stage. That’s a big thing. But fortunately for us, we did and we were able to take it.’ Kane believes that Nabil Bentaleb (left) will prove to be an important player at White Hart Lane . Kane (left) scored twice when Tottenham beat Chelsea 5-3 in the Premier League on New Year's Day . Kane (left) slots past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet (centre) to score for Tottenham at Anfield . He is wary of drawing comparisons with Sunday's opponents, Chelsea, but they have yet to turn a trainee graduate into a prominent first-team player since John Terry made his debut in 1998, though Ryan Bertrand, now at Southampton, did appear in their 2012 Champions League-winning team. ‘Clubs are different,’ said Kane. ‘Obviously Tottenham have been very good and we’ve managed to use our young players in a very good way. Chelsea are Chelsea. It’s hard to say what they want to do. They’ve been buying a lot of players and things like that. But I don’t know. ‘Maybe they will look at us and maybe other teams will look at us and start looking at the academies and see the players we have. But, again, it’s such a cut-throat league and the pressure on the managers is tough, so you have to have a strong manager to do that.’ Yet Kane’s journey from the academy has not been smooth. He was released by Arsenal at eight, by Watford at 10 and even initially by Tottenham after trials. He then had spells on loan at Millwall, Orient, Norwich and Leicester. It is not the usual superhighway to success that a gilded youth might expect. Harry Kane has played for England's Under 21s, but is expected to soon be named in the senior side . Kane (left) was loaned to Norwich, as well as Millwall, Leyton Orient and Leicester before his Spurs chance . ‘I had set-backs but I still always had that belief that I was going to play for Tottenham,’ he said. His coaches from that period confirm that he had great self-belief and that he had an incredible ability to learn. The header he scored against Arsenal is a new weapon in his armoury; and his speed has improved since specialised gym work. ‘Even when I went out on loan to clubs, it was always to come back and be a Spurs player. I had good loans at Orient and Millwall and I had probably not so good loans at Norwich and Leicester. At Norwich I was injured and then I went to Leicester and I found myself on the bench. But I still used that to my advantage as an experience. I had to do that here at Spurs for a while, be on the bench and wait for my chance. It’s definitely something that’s helped me with my game.’ He also had the benefit of having Beckham as a role model. They had both attended Chingford School — ‘he was a big inspiration, a player I adored’ — and then, as an 11-year-old schoolboy, Kane met Beckham when he launched a soccer academy at the 02 Centre in London. ‘I was a little skinhead then,’ he laughs. ‘Some of you may have seen the pictures!’ Now Kane, 21, is in the spotlight, attracting covetous glances from other clubs, though he can only imagine being at White Hart Lane. ‘If I’m at Tottenham in 10 years’ time, still playing regularly, then I will be very proud and very honoured. I love the club, they’ve given me a base, growing up as a kid and it’s something that I want to do. I love playing here.’ He appears genuine, uncomplicated in the best sense of the word. And just discussing the prospect of playing at Wembley adds an excitement to his voice. Kane (centre) will hope to inflict misery upon Chelsea again when they meet at Wembley on Sunday . The striker will try to continue his formidable rise in his first appearance at Wembley for Tottenham . Kane was present as a fan when Tottenham last won the League Cup in 2008, which was against Chelsea . ‘I’ve been there a couple of times with England but the one that stands out for me is the 2008 League Cup against Chelsea, which we won. ‘I was there as a fan, with the family and that was a great day out, to see them lift the trophy and all the fans stay behind. Staying with them is something I’ve been thinking of leading up to this game. And if I’m up there lifting the trophy it would be something very special.’ And, for the record, he was definitely a Tottenham fan at that final.","Harry Kane will try to lead Tottenham to Capital One Cup glory at Wembley .

'Women are so critical of their bits, but why be miserable when you can do something about it?' Raegan has now had her first laser treatment in a series of four. 'I have had my first treatment, and have three more to go before Christmas. I was nervous before my treatment but the procedure was very comfortable.' 'The head of the device they use to treat you looks like a giant pen, but once you get over that it just generally feels nice. It’s run across your labia and gently heats the tissue - that’s what makes the skin tighten. 'It’s a bit embarrassing I guess, but it’s totally non-invasive and painless.'

However, despite all these efforts, Raegan claims she is ‘terminally single'. While she has her heart set on David Beckham, Raegan says instead she only attracts ‘creeps’ and ‘pervs’.

Making myself ""plastic fantastic"" seemed like an easy way to make guys . fancy me, but men just assume I’m ""up for it"".' 'I get offered sex all the time, but I can’t remember the last time a bloke asked me out for dinner.' Raegan is still holding out for a Prince Charming who can see beyond her ‘sexy looks’. 'Just . because I look fake and a bit ""out there"", it doesn’t mean I don’t want . a fairytale romance,' she said. 'I’d much rather a nice lad who wanted . a relationship.'

"Jose Mourinho says he has set himself the goal of winning every major trophy in England once again in his second spell at Chelsea — starting with the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley. Mourinho, however, says his love for English football has been tested by the suspensions of Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic, the latter missing Sunday's final, and by refereeing decisions in recent weeks, which he considers controversial. Mourinho is already one of the most decorated managers ever in English football having won two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and two League Cups in his first spell at Chelsea. He says his target is now to repeat the grand slam of trophies. Jose Mourinho (pictured in 2005) won the League Cup twice in his first spell as Chelsea manager . Mourinho (centre) is thrown into the air after securing La Liga victory with Real Madrid in 2012 . Mourinho (centre) also won the Premier League twice in his first spell as Chelsea manager . ‘I had the one aim of winning every title in the three most important countries — Italy, Spain and England,’ he said. ‘I had that aim and if I had missed one I would not have been happy. If I missed a cup or a super cup (community shied) I would not be happy, I wanted to win every title in those countries and I did that. ‘I achieved my goals in terms of the trophies I want to win. I won the trophies in every country; the Champions League, the UEFA Cup, now the Europa League. Now it is about repeating it. I want to change the numbers. Two League Cups and I want more. One FA Cup and I want more. Two Premier Leagues and I want more.’ After managing Porto to two league titles, a domestic cup, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League, Mourinho went on to Chelsea and then to Spain and Italy. He won La Liga with Real Madrid as well as Serie A twice with Inter, as well as the Copa del Rey and the Coppa Italia and, of course, the Champions League with Inter in 2010. But Mourinho maintains that his passion for English football has been tested since his return in 2013. Matters have come to a head with Matic’s two-match suspension for retaliating to a horror tackle by Ashley Barnes, for which the Burnley player received no punishment. Asked whether he would still say that he loved English football, he said: ‘Good question. That I love it? Yes. I would not change my feelings about it. About my desire to work for this club? No change. Exactly the same. But in this moment maybe in two, three, four months, maybe I can change my feelings. In this moment I’m a bit disappointed, yes.

And to finish matches with the best feeling is not just because you win. ‘I remember clearly when we lost our first game of the season, at Newcastle, and after the game I told the media this was the way I like to lose. Great referee, no controversial decisions, we played well and tried everything and were unlucky — this is the way I like to lose. ‘But I don’t want to go. I only go when Mr Abramovich tells me to go.

"So there is no curse of Selhurst Park and meeting Crystal Palace in the FA Cup holds no special fear for Liverpool. Having quieted one unhappy spirit from a past life by beating AFC Wimbledon in January, Liverpool returned to south London on Saturday evening, to the venue where their title hopes disintegrated last season, to face the team which still celebrates beating them 4-3 in an FA Cup semi-final in 1990. Ultimately they prevailed but not without the odd scare. Liverpool are not yet so strong and confident in themselves that they can dismiss the superstition surrounding a jinxed team with the authority of an assured sceptic. After all, they lost 3-1 here only in November.

Booked: Henderson, Can, Mignolet . Goals: Sturridge 49 Lallana 58 . Referee: Robert Madley . Manager: Brendan Rodgers 7 . *Ratings by Sami Mokbel at Selhurst Park . But thanks to goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana and notably an impressive second-half performance by Mario Balotelli, Liverpool progressed. Having hit the winner against Tottenham and set up Lallana on Saturday, this was comfortably Balotelli’s best week since his return to England. Not saying much, perhaps, but there are at least glimmers he might make a longer term contribution to Liverpool. For Brendan Rodgers though it was about exorcising the demons of Selhurst Park: not that infamous 3-3 draw last season, which he considers a mere footnote in their failure to win the title. It is the 3-1 defeat from earlier in the season which he feels represented a nadir. They have only lost once since then. ‘We were at a real low point at that time with players still trying to adapt to the pressures of playing at Liverpool and the expectancy,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘I needed to find a way to make it work. We’d been playing 4-3-3 but it wasn’t working for us with key players out, so we had to arrest that negative momentum and get back the aggression and intensity with which the team had been playing. ‘After the game we had to have an intervention and we did that. It was ironic coming back here, getting the victory and putting in a real good performance. The players’ response from that moment has been incredible and hopefully we can continue to the end of the season.’ Liverpool though did not convince initially. Early on, Martin Skrtel was having one of those games where marshalling a back three looked a thankless task. Palace had space aplenty in which to drive and Skrtel was left exposed. The opening goal came from his mistake in the 17th minute. Joe Ledley chipped in a teasing ball and the Liverpool defender neither met it, nor cleared it but simply allowed it to skim off his head to Dwight Gayle, who nodded it goalwards. Simon Mignolet smothered that effort but only cleared the ball to Fraizer Campbell, who drove it in. started well, scored a goal with a ball over their back three, but that kind of hampered us,’ said Alan Pardew. ‘We got a bit too deep. I was desperate to get the team up the pitch a bit.’ Pardew was right that Palace sat back but they looked solid enough and Liverpool’s best efforts were limited in that first half.

He probably got a toe to the ball but was taking a huge risk. Lallana came close in the 22nd minute when fed by Jordan Henderson, forcing an excellent save from Julian Speroni. But Henderson, in the 30th minute, and Philippe Coutinho in the 39th, would also try their luck from longer distances but found Speroni no less alert. The decisive moment of the match came in the 43rd minute with Skrtel again in a muddle, failing to clear and allowing the ball to ricochet off him towards Gayle. With just Mignolet to beat, Gayle shot low but saw his shot saved by the foot of the Liverpool keeper. ‘That turned out to be a pivotal moment,’ said Pardew. ‘We would have been very difficult to beat if that had gone in.’ Credit though to Rodgers. He was bold in bringing on Balotelli at half-time and playing two up front. And his team never tire of passing the ball, patiently nurturing their build-up until they found Henderson on the edge of the box.

Sturridge begins his trademark celebration dance solo before later being joined by his team-mate Moreno . He delivered a sublime dipping cross aimed at Sturridge. It was a lovely piece of skill but there was still much to do. Sturridge simply fixed his eyes on the ball and struck a low volley past Speroni, who should have kept it out but was beaten by the sheer speed of the striker’s reaction. For a man who has had five months out, Sturridge is finishing remarkably cleanly and consistently. There was now undoubtedly a more confident swagger about the visitors and Balotelli seemed to pick up the vibe with his free-kick in the 58th minute. With Skrtel as the decoy, he managed to drive it through the Palace wall forcing Speroni to parry it. First to the scene was the onrushing Lallana, who finished from close range to make it 2-1. Palace endeavoured to come back at Liverpool. But with the cushion of a goal lead and able to sit deeper than before, Rodgers’ team afforded them less space and therefore fewer opportunities and ultimately they controlled the closing periods of the game. Liverpool march on for now. Steven Gerrard is injured but his team-mates are keeping alive the prospect of a Wembley finale to his Liverpool career. And maybe that could prove the start of something for Balotelli and Liverpool. Lallana then struck to put Liverpool ahead just before the hour mark against Crystal Palace in the fifth round clash .

"The stunning view from the world's largest paper airplane as it soars above an Arizona desert has been captured in a new ad for GoPro cameras. The plane, called the Arturo Desert Eagle, measures a massive 45 feet long and 26 feet wide with a 24 foot wingspan, and has been known to reach speeds of up to 98 miles per hour. The plane is based on the original Arturo Desert Eagle design developed in 2012 by the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson. A paper plane crew member fixes a camera to the body to capture the craft's flight . Before launch, the plane must be taken thousands of feet into the sky via helicopter .

Towed approximately 4,000 feet into the sky before being released . The model's origins can be traced to a local newspaper contest for six-to14-year-olds to see who could build the paper plane that would fly farthest. The winner was Arturo Valdenegro, 12, who then used his plans to build a larger model named after him. At the time of the flight, the Arizona Aerospace Foundation's executive director Yvonne Morris told The Telegraph: 'The arresting visual of the paper airplane . in flight rekindled the childhood creativity in all of us .

The original model also had a helping design hand from Art Thompson in Lancaster, who helped in the design of the B-2 stealth bomber.

"Michael Essien finds it hard to contemplate the thought —next week Frank Lampard will, injury permitting, return to Stamford Bridge as a Manchester City player. He might once again score a goal which could prove crucial in tipping the two-horse title race in City’s favour — just as he did in scoring the equalising goal against Chelsea in September. For Essien, stalwart of Jose Mourinho’s greatest Chelsea side, a Champions League winner, and Lampard’s long-time midfield partner, that would be unthinkable. Frank Lampard looking dejected as Manchester City lost to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on Saturday . Frank Lampard came off the bench but could do nothing to prevent his side from losing 2-0 . Michael Essien has mobilised an army of footballers to help fight Ebola in West Africa. The Ghanaian had to deny he was suffering from Ebola after reports surfaced that he had contracted the virus — but the incident has inspired him and his wife, Akosua, to campaign against the stigma of the disease, which has claimed more than 8,000 lives since last year. Rio Ferdinand, Samuel Eto’o and Fernando Torres have all signed up. He has resisted the opportunity to return to the Premier League preferring to stay at AC Milan rather than play against Chelsea. And he is unsure how Lampard will be able to keep his emotion in check for a game which would be highly charged even in normal circumstances but which is also a critical game in the destination of the title. ‘It will be difficult — I don’t know how he’s going to do it,’ said Essien. ‘It will be a very strange situation. I cannot see myself doing that against Chelsea. ’Of course, should AC Milan return to the Champions League, Essien might one day face his former team. ‘That would be a bit different,’ Essien insists.‘But with a different team in England, going back to play your old club when you’ve been there for so long... wow! It’s going to be difficult. But, at the end of the day it’s another game and he’s professional.’ Michael Essien played for Chelsea from 2005 before joining AC Milan at the start of this season . He and Lampard formed a formidable partnership at the heart of the Blues midfield for many years . Essien alongside Jose Mourinho at his unveiling as a Chelsea player in August 2005 . Despite his own reservations of making the kind of switch Lampard has, Essien is confident that Chelsea fans will receive his former team-mate warmly. He was applauded by away fans at the Etihad earlier in the season, despite scoring the equalising goal. But the murky details of his move to City, which was initially announced as a loan from New York City, have turned some Chelsea fans against him, as has the fact that he has turned out to be a crucial player in the title race, contributing valuable goals as City chase Chelsea. But Essien believes that Chelsea fans will not forget what Lampard gave the club. ‘Well, you know how fans are but I believe the Chelsea fans are always going to give him their warmth and respect everything that he did for the club,’ he said. 'I’m sure that they will give him a welcome.’ Former Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle agrees with Essien and says that Lampard deserves to be treated well next Saturday. ‘I’m hoping he receives the kind of reception reserved for much-loved returning players,’ he said. ‘The key point that is sometimes lost in the confusion over whether Frank was joining New York City or Manchester City — which was admittedly a strange situation — is that Chelsea didn’t offer Frank a new deal last summer. ‘The club clearly decided they could do without him. Maybe his opportunities would have been limited, given how strong Chelsea have been this season. 'But from that point on, Frank had to find himself a team. Perhaps you could understand why some fans were upset with him if he had been agitating for a move or demanding to leave even though Chelsea wanted him. ‘But he only left to play for someone else when the club didn’t want him. It seems pretty clear that he loves the club and the fans and always will.’ Lampard scored a late equaliser for Manchester City when they faced Chelsea in September . The Manchester City midfielder refused to celebrate at the Etihad Stadium after scoring against his old club . Lampard greeting long-time team-mate John Terry at the full time whistle after the draw . Lampard will not overshadow the key issue of the day, which is whether Chelsea can open up an eight-point gap with 15 games to play. For many that would seem an unassailable lead. ‘City have to get something from the game,’ said Hoddle. ‘To get back eight points between now and the end of the season looks tough. It’s one thing to close an eight-point gap before Christmas but with just 15 games to go would be hard. Chelsea they would have to lose three games to close that gap.’ Essien is of the same mind. ‘In England you can never say the title is decided in January but if they win the game, they will give them a massive advantage,’ he said. ‘It’s a big week with the Liverpool semi-final as well but Jose Mourinho loves dealing with these kind of games and will always get the best out of his players.'","Manchester City set to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next Sunday .

"They had been meticulously planning their costumes for quite some time. The annual summer sports day had a long tradition of fancy dress and, eager to impress, the pupils of Sacred Heart Catholic School kept their outfits under wraps for weeks. They wanted to surprise their parents and teachers as they made their entrance at the school in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. And surprise them they did. With a flourish and a fanfare, they revealed their costumes - to outraged gasps from the crowd. Bad taste: A girl strides into her school at Chiang Mai dressed as Adolf Hitler, seemingly oblivious to the offensiveness of her costume . Shock: Smiling pupils carrying a Swastika flag were met with horror from foreign parents and teachers, who were left reeling at the bad taste of the procession . The smiling pupils arrived at the . school dressed in full Nazi regalia and carrying large Swastika flags, . leaving foreign parents and teachers open-mouthed. Leading the march into the sports . ground was a girl dressed as Adolf Hitler - complete with toothbrush . moustache - seemingly unaware of the offence . she had caused. She was followed by a procession of pupils dressed as SS guards - brandishing plastic machine guns. Stunned ex-pats were appalled. Surely the pupils were aware of what the Swastika and Nazis represented? Under fire: Thailand's education system was criticised as it emerged that not even the teachers knew what Swastika and Nazi costumes represented . Apparently not, as it emerged that not even the Thai teachers at the school understood what all the fuss was about. A . teacher at the school said: 'It was . all very embarrassing. Traditionally the students wear fancy dress on . the summer sports day and they like to keep everything they are . preparing quiet. Nobody saw any swastikas around the school before the . event. 'But then on sports . day when we saw these Nazi storm troopers we were appalled. We told the . Thai teachers that this was not on. But they did not understand what was . wrong with the display.' History lesson: The school was asked to put the Holocaust - and Adolf Hitler - on the curriculum . Today, a delegation from the . consulates of Britain, the United States, France and Germany descended . on the school to protest about the controversy - and called on teachers . to put modern history and the Holocaust on the curriculum.

"Lamborghini has unveiled its Egoista concept car as part of its 50th birthday celebrations. The design of the Egoista, which means 'selfish' in Italian, was inspired by an Apache helicopter and has carbon fibre and aluminium frame - traditionally seen on lightweight F1 cars. And just like F1 cars, the Egoista has been made for one person only, and to get out of the car drivers must remove the steering wheel, lift up the roof and climb over the bodywork. Scroll down for video . The Lamborghini Egoista, which means 'selfish' in Italian, was designed by Walter De Silva and was inspired by an Apache helicopter. The concept car only seats one person and the driver must remove the steering wheel and climb over the carbon fibre bodywork to get into the vehicle. The interior of the Lamborghini Egoista has minimal instruments. A removable steering wheel column sits in the centre. Above it is a heads-up display, similar to those seen by jet fighters, showing only important driving information. When the driver climbs out of the vehicle he can only rest his legs on the designated areas, so not to crush or damage the carbon fibre frame . The car's 'cockpit' is covered by a mechanically operated orange shield. The shield has anti-glare glass and is made of antiradar material. The driver's four-point seatbelt is made up of different colours . As part of Lamborghin's Grande Giro Tour, owners, collectors and fans drove various Lamborghini models from the Italian firm's 50 year history across Italy. The parade began on Friday in Milan before heading to Bobbio, and Forte dei Marmi. It then continured to Bologna and ended at  Sant’Agata Bolognese, the Lamborghini headquarters, on Saturday. A total of 350 of the Italian supercars are taking part in the Tour. Lamborghini is celebrating its anniversary throughout 2013 with events all over the world. The company gave 10 per cent of the money made on the tour to a fund for rebuilding social centres destroyed by an earthquake in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy, last year. The car was unveiled by Lamborghini's President and CEO Stephen Winkelmann at an event in Italy. It was designed by Head of Design for Volkswagen Group, Walter De Silva. Speaking on the final day of the Grande Giro Tour - Lamborghini's tour around Italy to celebrate its 50th anniversary - De Silva said: 'This is a car made for one person only, to allow them to have fun and express their personality to the maximum. 'It is designed purely for hyper-sophisticated people who want only the most extreme and special things in the world. 'It represents hedonism taken to the extreme, it is a car without compromises.' The interior of Egoista has a racing seat with four-point seatbelt, and each strap is a different colour. There is also a head-up display, similar to those seen by jet fighters, showing speed, fuel levels and other important information. The Egoista has 5.2-litre V10 engine with 592 brake horse power. Egoista's designer Walter De Silva designed the car to look like the profile of a 'bull preparing to charge, its horns lowered', based on Lamborghini's famous icon. It has two white front lights, two red rear lights, a red flashing light in the upper part of the 'tail', two orange 'bull's eyes' as side markers, and another two lights on the roof. To get out of the car, the driver has to . remove the steering wheel and rest it on the dashboard, open the dome . with an electronic command, stand up in their seat, sit down on a . precise point of the left-hand bodywork, then swivel their legs 180 . degrees from the inside of the cockpit to the outside of the vehicle. The cockpit is completely removable . and De Silva said: 'It is made completely of carbon fiber and aluminum, . and represents a sort of survival cell, allowing the driver to isolate . and protect themselves from external elements. 'We . kept an eye on the future when designing the Egoista, with the idea . that its cockpit could have been taken from a jet aircraft and . integrated into a road vehicle, to provide a different travel option.' As the Egoista is made from lightweight materials including aluminum and carbon-fiber, the vehicle has no-walk zones; places the driver can't stand because his weight would crush the bodywork. These zones are marked out like they are on airliners, and are shown at the bottom of this image. The exterior is designed to look like the profile of a 'bull preparing to charge, its horns lowered'. This design is based on the Lamborghini brand's icon, and Lamborghini's is also known as the House of Raging Bull. The top of the vehicle has  flaps built into the bodywork that move depending on the driving conditions. Two . rear flaps activate automatically at high speeds to increase stability, . while a series of air intakes on the back of the engine hood provides . the cooling air flow to the powerful V10 engine. The V10 engine sits in the rear of the Lamborghini Egoista. Also known as the 'tail of the bull', it has been designed to be fully open with the mechanics in view. This reduces weight but also creates a more aggressive look. While the front of the vehicle has a profile intended to increase down force, the rear is fully open with the mechanics in view, reducing weight but also with the result of creating a more aggressive look. The Lamborghini Egoista does not have traditional headlights, instead it has LED clearance lights which determine its position in three dimensions, as seen on spacecrafts. It has two white front lights, two red rear lights, a red flashing light in the upper part of the tail, two orange 'bull's eyes' as side markers, and another two lights on the roof, red on the left and green on the right.

Hidden behind the front air intakes . at the base of the join between the central body and the two side . sections, are two xenon headlamps. As . the Egoista is made from lightweight materials such as aluminum and . carbon-fiber, the vehicle has no-walk zones - places the driver can't . stand because his weight would crush the bodywork. These zones are marked out similar to how they are on airliners. The top of the Lamborghini Egoista has flaps built into the bodywork that move depending on the driving conditions. Two rear flaps activate automatically at high speeds to increase stability, while a series of air intakes on the back of the engine hood provides the cooling air flow to the powerful V10 engine . Additionally, the body is made from a special antiradar material, and the glass is anti-glare with an orange gradation. The rims are also made from antiradar material embellished with carbon-fiber plates to improve their aerodynamics. According to Lamborghini, though, no-one will ever drive the latest concept car. According . to De Silva: 'It's as if Ferruccio Lamborghini were saying: I'm going . to put the engine in the back, I don't want a passenger. I want it for . myself, and I want it as I imagine it to be. It is a fanatical vehicle, . Egoista fits it well.' Describing the Lamborghini Egoista, the design team said: 'If Lamborghinis are cars for the few, this one goes further. It is a car for itself, a gift from Lamborghini to Lamborghini, resplendent in its solitude. The Egoista is pure emotion, Never Never Land, which no one can ever possess, and which will always remain a dream, for everyone.'

"Resigning: Ina Drew has resigned from JPMorgan Chase after the bank lost $2billion . The boss of the British-based trader thought to have cost one of the world's biggest banks $2billion in trading losses was herself paid $14million last year. Ina Drew, 54, is considered one of the most powerful women on Wall Street and has been at the head of JP Morgan Chase's London-based Chief Investment Office since February 2005. Regarded as a key lieutenant of chief executive Jamie Dimon, she was effectively in charge of Bruno Michel Iksil, the Frenchman nicknamed 'Voldemort' and 'the London Whale'. She . received a cash bonus of $4.7m, a share award of $7.1m, options worth . $1.5 million and a base salary of $750,000, according to regulatory . filings by the bank. It was also revealed today that two London-based executives were . forced out in the . wake of the fiasco. Achilles . Macris, who ran the London desk that made the botched trades, was . expected to depart along with one of his senior lieutenants, Javier . Martin-Artajo. The bank's ‘black hole’ - equivalent to . £1.2billion - was revealed during its second quarter amid fears . Mr Iksil's trades could cost JP Morgan a further £750 million in the . coming months. Shares in the bank dropped by 9.3 per cent  yesterday as U.S. and British regulators . launched investigations into the losses. The verdict from credit agencies has been grim, with Fitch knocking JP Morgan down a rating and Standard & Poor's putting the bank on a negative outlook. The slump knocked $14bn off the bank's equity value in what the Dow Jones index showed to have been the stock market's worst week of the year so far. Fellow finance giants Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also suffered as investors predicted the impact would spread. JP Morgan is America's largest bank, . holding £1.43trillion in outstanding loans and other assets, and employs . 240,000 people in 60 countries. This week it emerged that Mr Iksil . works under Ms Drew in the corporation's Chief Investment Office, where his job . was reportedly supposed to oversee mitigating risk. CEO . Jamie Dimon, who admitted JP Morgan had made 'egregious mistakes', issued a statement claiming that the bank had hit trouble. He said: ‘In hindsight, the new strategy was flawed, complex, poorly . reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored. Speculation: Bruno Michel Iksil, a London-based trader, dubbed Voldemort after Harry Potter's nemesis in the films, is also speculated to resign over the loss to America's largest bank . Others: A third executive, along with Drew and Bruno Michel Iksil, is also expected to resign but has thus far gone unnamed . ‘The portfolio has proved to be . riskier, more volatile and less effective as an economic hedge than we . thought. There are many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment. ‘It puts egg on our face and we deserve any criticism we get.’ Mr Dimon spoke as U.S. regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission prepared to look into how changes in the way JP Morgan calculates risk might have obscured the potential for these trades to do such colossal damage. Yet despite the accusations levelled at Mr Iksil, there has been no suggestion that his trading tactics broke any rules. The . Daily Mail has learned that the trader, a father of four in his . mid-forties, has been living and working in London for the past seven . years. U.S. bank Allfirst currency trader John Rusnack pleaded guilty to . $691million fraud in 2002 - and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Toshihide . Iguchi, a former car dealer, lost more than $1billion at Japanese bank . Daiwa in fraudulent trading over an 11-year period from 1984 onwards. The . Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) was seized by . regulators in 1991 after auditors reported huge losses from illegal . loans to corporate insiders and trades. It collapsed with $16billion . debts and 250,000 savers lost money. Japan's . Sumitomo Corporation trader Yasuo Hamanaka lost his firm $2.6billion in . unrecorded copper market trades and was jailed for eight years in 1996. British . trader Nick Leeson single-handedly destroyed 233-year-old Barings Bank . in 1995 by making losses and setting up a secret account to hide them. He was jailed for six-and-a-half years. In his Bloomberg trading profile he talks of being able to ‘walk on water’ being ‘humble’ but in the City he has been nicknamed ‘Lord Voldemort ‘ - after Harry Potter’s nemesis - along with the names ‘London Whale’ and ‘White Whale.’ He was given the ‘Voldemort’ nickname because he was seen as such a ‘scary and powerful’ force in the City. One trader explained: ‘It was a play on the Harry Potter theme when people were frightened of Lord Voldemort and his powers and referred to him as ‘’He Who Must Not Be Named"".' In reality, according to friends and family, Mr Iksil is not a ‘larger than life figure.’ He rents a flat in Earls Court, West London, where he stays from Monday until Thursday. He then returns to Paris for a long weekend where he spends time with his wife Karen and the couple’s four children. Last night his sister - 41-year-old Sandrine Iksil - who lives in Leicester and works for a software company in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, told the Daily Mail: ‘Bruno rarely talks about his work and if you met him you would not think he is a trader in the City. ‘He is very quiet and is a family . man. He does not own a flash sports car and his main hobby would be . cooking. He enjoys being in the kitchen. He certainly has never talked . to me about his work. ‘He also insists on getting home each weekend to be with his wife and children. He works from home on Fridays. ‘I last saw him at Easter when he came to visit with his wife and children. They are just a normal family.’ Mr Iksil’s family originally hails from Russia before his ancestors settled in France. The dark-haired trader is reported to . have earned has earned about $100million (£62.2million) a year for JP . Morgan’s Chief Investment Office in recent years. Mr Iksil joined JP Morgan in 2005 having previously worked at the French investment bank Natixis (KN) from 1999 to 2003. He originally graduated in engineering from the Ecole Centrale in Paris. JP Morgan said yesterday they had informed the UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) of their situation. News: The company's stock plunged almost 7 per cent in after-hours trading after the loss was announced.  Other bank stocks, including Citigroup and Bank of America, suffered heavy losses as well (file picture) Mr Iksil was brought into the CIO unit to head its credit desk, where trades were vetted by management. The losses are an acute embarrassment for Mr Dimon after JP Morgan was considered in a healthy enough position to take over investment bank Bear Stearns and consumer bank Washington Mutual when they collapsed in 2008. The bank quickly paid off its $25bn federal bailout and initially enjoyed a good relationship with the Obama administration. In April, when the issue was first raised in financial papers and websites, Mr Dimon dismissed the matter as a ‘tempest in a teapot’. He himself earned a staggering £15 million last year and has publicly opposed new regulations being placed on banks, suggesting he has turned against the President. JP Morgan’s position has been made more uncomfortable by what those in the City called the ‘Volcker’ effect. Former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker - as well as Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King - claimed that investment banks should not be allowed to trade on their own accounts. As regulators continue to figure out how this restriction can be imposed, it remains unclear whether such a rule would have stopped JP Morgan from trading in the way that it did. Bad news: The trading loss is an embarrassment for a bank that came through the 2008 financial crisis in much better health than its peers. It kept clear of risky investments that hurt many other banks (file picture) Trying: JPMorgan wants to unload the portfolio in question in a 'responsible' manner to minimise the cost to its shareholders.

"Two pilots have been suspended from an airline after they allegedly left an Airbus carrying 166 passengers on autopilot and air hostesses in charge while they slept in business class. The Air India flight was travelling from Bangkok to New Delhi when both the co-pilot and the pilot left the cockpit after having spent some time instructing two flight attendants how to fly. But the pair had to rush back and seize the controls of the A-320 after one of them accidentally turned off the autopilot setting, sources said. An Air India official admits the cockpit was in control of the air hostess for 20 minutes . On Friday, the national carrier . suspended a pilot, the captain of the April 12 Airbus A-320 Bangkok- New . Delhi flight, his co-pilot, and two flight attendants who had . accidentally switched off the autopilot in the cockpit momentarily. According to sources, pilot . B.K. Soni and co-pilot Ravindra Nath napped in business class, leaving . flight attendants Kanika Kala and J. Bhatt in charge of the plane. A . senior member of the cabin crew witnessed the entire drama and brought . the matter to the notice of the airline's management. The Directorate . General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has started a probe into the incident. An Air India official admits the cockpit was in air hostess control for 20 minutes, sources say 40, but Director General of Civil Aviation Arun Mishra has said that the air hostesses stayed in the cockpit for the 'larger part of the three-hour flight'. Air hostesses are allowed in the cockpit, but only for the amount of time it takes to serve a cup of tea or a snack. 'It is a serious matter. We are investigating the case,' Mr Mishra said. The flight took off from Bangkok at 8.55 am. Half-an-hour and 33,000 feet into the flight, First Officer Ravindra Nath excused himself from the cockpit to visit the washroom. He asked flight attendant J. Bhatt to occupy the co-pilot's seat in his absence. Minutes after Nath exited, Captain B.K. Soni called Kanika Kala and asked her to take his seat. Soni did not leave the cockpit immediately, however. According to a source, he spent some time teaching the two airhostesses how to operate the aircraft before joining Nath in business class. After the flying lesson, Soni put the plane on auto-pilot, leaving the stewardesses by themselves in the cockpit for around 40 minutes. Auto-pilot does not mean pilots can leave the cockpit. They have to be present to monitor the flight path and can turn off auto-pilot mode if required. A statement issued by Air India on Friday stressed that 'at no point of time was the cockpit left unattended by the cockpit crew'. It then went to say: 'During the incident, due to distraction the co-pilot had touched the auto pilot disconnect button momentarily. But the same was connected back.' Captain Mohan Ranganathan, a member of Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council, a government-appointed aviation safety panel, blamed the 'lackadaisical attitude' of the DGCA for the increase in air safety violations. 'The DGCA should be held responsible for the increase in such cases as they have failed time and again to effectively enforce safety guidelines,' said Ranganathan.","Air India flight travelling from Bangkok to New Delhi when drama unfolded .

"As speeding tickets go it was just one of thousands handed out in the 1930's as the car took over a once provincial Germany and the autobahns opened the country up to the common man. But the man who received it was no ordinary motorist. He was Adolf Hitler, in the driving seat of the Third Reich, and definitely not amused the day he was booked for going too fast in his supercharged Mercedes limousine. But was he driving? Documents revealed Adolf Hitler had asked chauffeur Julius Schreck (pictured behind the wheel) to drive fast after he was given a speeding ticket near Igolstadt in 1931 . Hitler's long lost speeding summons has been found in a Bavarian archive. He was handed the fine in the tiny hamlet of Baar-Ebenhausen, south of the city of Ingolstadt, on September 19, 1931 - a little over two and-a-half years before he became chancellor and Fuehrer. A senior police officer called Probst . from the Bavarian gendarme station Reichertshofen put in his notebook . how a car travelling at 1.37pm on the road towards Munich was travelling . at a 'high speed'. Taking the blame: Schreck, right, stood to be banned after he was clocked driving more than twice the speed limit in Hitler's personal Mercedes . He also put down the number plate - II A – 19357 - which happened to be Hitler's personal car and sent to details to superiors in Munich to learn who the car's owner was. The incident happened long before the days of speed cameras. In his report Probst wrote: 'The speed of the vehicle was determined by two officials with two stop watches. 'The car drove over a measured distance of 200m in 13 seconds, which results in the average speed of 55.3 km per hour (34.3mph).' In a hurry: Hitler, pictured in Nuremberg in 1934, may have been rushing back to Munich after his half-niece Geli Raubal shot herself in the flat they shared . This was double the permitted speed limit on the road at that time and should have resulted in an immediate ban. Three days later Probst received the information that the car belonged to one A. Hitler, who lived at Prinzeregentstrasse 16 and he issued the speeding ticket. Hitler's former flat still exists only now it is, ironically, a police station. But it is doubtful if Hitler or his party ever had to pay a fine. Certainly no document surfaced alongside the original report stating that he had to cough up. There was, however, another document found in the archive with the word 'settled' stamped on it relating to the incident. Staff: Hitler poses for a signed photograph with members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party in 1929. (From left) adjutant Julius Schaub, Schreck, Hitler, future SS colonel Gerhard Maurer and psychiatrist Carl Schneider . Hitler said he was not at the wheel at the time but that it was being driven by his chauffeur Julius Schreck and that he had instructed him 'to drive as fast as possible' without saying why. But history records the probable reason. The day before his 23-year-old half-niece Geli Raubal, with whom he lived and who he loved madly, shot herself with Hitler's pistol at the Munich flat. It sent Hitler into a profound depression and senior Nazis on trial at Nuremberg after the war said no other single incident during the whole of the Third Reich affected him more. Historians speculate he was in something approaching a blind panic to get to Munich to begin the damage limitation exercise that he knew he must put in place to protect his burgeoning image as the saviour of Germany. As to Officer Probst, there is no indication that he ever advanced further in the police force for daring to send a summons to the future Fuehrer of Germany.","Documents reveal future Fuhrer claimed his lookalike chauffeur Julius Schreck was driving at the time .

A council spokesman said residents were told the rubbish would be removed in early November but the council was still waiting to hear back from contractors with quotes. 'The regulatory process, which must be followed, is very detailed and doesn't allow swift action to be taken or the financial penalties involved to be felt by an individual directly responsible for the problem,' he told the Central West Daily.","A woman is hoarding piles of rubbish outside her home in Orange .

"At the school my two eldest children go to they have a unique form of parental torture surely invented purely to make my life a misery once a year. ‘Open Homework’: these two words do not belong together do they? Like ‘sugar’ and ‘free’ or ‘drink’ and ‘moderation’ they should never be in the same sentence. So, what, exactly is ‘Open Homework’? Well, it’s just like normal homework — only worse. Lorraine has recently come into contact with 'Open Homework' which has seen her attempt various dubious tasks including knitting in order to encourage her daughter's creative thinking . It’s the kind of homework the tyrannical teacher from Matilda would set; Miss Trunchbull homework. The idea behind Open Homework is to encourage creative free-thinking in a young mind (a dangerous concept to start with for my rebellious pre-teen girls). What happens is a subject is given and you can do whatever you want with it: build a sculpture, write an essay, set it to music, turn it into performance art, make an omelette; anything as long as you can explain the mental acrobatics which helped you come up with your idea in the first place. Lorraine says that working full-time and Open Homework does not mix . Past themes of this annual working-mum-stress-increaser have included ‘flight’ and ‘black and white’. I marvel at some of the pupils’ resulting creations, really I do. Even though parents are forbidden from helping, some of the work is so magnificent it looks like it has been handed in by architect Zaha Hadid or crafted by Professor Brian Cox. Ours, however, tend to end up looking like they’ve been made in the craft room at a lunatic asylum by an inmate with questionable motor skills. This is because I really do try not to help, despite Open Homework sucking up most of my evenings and once waking me up in the middle of the night with a nightmare about the toddler getting hold of the wood glue and sticking a rug to the floor. This project throws me into a week-long Sunday-night-gloom, looming large in the lengthy daily to-do list because my children enthusiastically throw everything they have got at it. When I suggest a little editing of their ideas, some focus perhaps, or possibly a less ambitious ‘build’, as Kevin from Grand Designs would say, I am shushed. I am sent out with a shopping list that once included ‘something that looks like a bug’s eye’. We’ve made board games, built aeroplanes and once Gracie asked me to construct a life-size model of a Friesian cow. Even Blue Peter couldn’t do that, I say, but she replies: ‘Maybe we could knit one and stuff it.’ In a busy household of four children aged three to 12, this kind of project takes over. Bits of the different creations are to be found drying/setting/cooking everywhere. On Sunday I heard Gracie describing Open Homework to her grandma on the phone: ‘It’s this fun thing we do that Mum hates,’ she said. ‘Mum sort of comes up with an idea and then we do it for her.’ I feel the meaning of the mission has been lost. This year we have the number ‘100’ as the theme — no doubt inspired by the centenary of the war. Of course Gracie does not want to do something so obvious as this anniversary. ‘God mum, everyone will do that,’ she says. And so begins the fraught discussion of ideas. She will have ten, develop five into an embryonic project for which all manner of empty jam jars, egg boxes, candles and silver paint will be required. By day three of Open Homework I will feel like lying down in the middle of the road clutching a sign saying ‘do not resuscitate’ as she narrows down her choice to one idea. The girls approach this with far more enthusiasm than any other homework. Perhaps because of my antipathy they love it as much as I fear it. Maybe if I didn’t work I would have more time and enjoy taking part? Maybe not. I find normal homework, especially maths, gruelling but this no-rules homework pains me more. And we never have enough glue. We have now come up with an idea after hours of discussion. Does anyone know where I can get something that looks like a small marsupial?

"A taxi company in Stockholm is putting therapists in the back of its cars in an effort to help the notoriously reserved Swedes get in touch with their feelings. It comes after record number of Swedes reported feeling lonely, something which may have to do with them having the highest percentage of one-person households per capita in the EU - 47 per cent. Taxi Stockholm is hoping to combat this by offering fully qualified therapists en-route – for no extra charge. Therapy taxi: Taxi Stockholm will be offering their customers free therapy in the back of their cars . Three therapists are being sent out with drivers around the capital and will offer counselling and therapy for people while they make the journey. The therapists can be booked in advance and all of the taxi drivers have signed confidentiality agreements to protect the privacy of the passengers during their 'sessions' No trip is too short, according to Mia Fahlen, one of the psychologists involved in the Taxi Stockholm project. She said: 'We don't know exactly how long each trip will be, so we have to be flexible.' She believes even a ten-minute trip could be enough to get to the bottom of a customer's problems or point them in a direction that could change their lives for the better. Cab company: Three therapists are being sent out with drivers around Stockholm, because Swedes feel lonely . What is more - the experience will most likely be cheaper than booking an ordinary therapy session, with Ms Fahlen explaining that an hour-long discussion with her usually costs up to 1,200 SEK (£100). The therapist says she signed up to the scheme to chase the 'thrill of the unknown', but added that she could predict the main topic of worry from residents in the Swedish capital. She said: 'A lot of people are lonely. There are so many single people in Stockholm.' 'And a lot of the people I meet from abroad tell me they're frustrated with Sweden. They say it's really hard to meet people and that even when they try, the Swedes can be very quiet.' Natalia Santos, a press officer for Taxi Stockholm, said the idea sprung from a customer survey the company recently carried out, finding that many people seemed to enjoy the chance to talk to someone by speaking to the cab driver.","Cab company in Swedish capital offers free therapists for the ride .

"A woman had her flesh burnt and eaten, was violently raped and allegedly had noughts and crosses carved on her back by her ex-boyfriend in an horrific domestic violence attack. The couple had been together for about 18 months when the man, 41, forced the woman into a prolonged session of abuse at his cousin's Sydney home in 2006. The abuse the woman suffered was so shocking it took her six years to say anything and only came to light when police made a follow up call after the woman reported the domestic violence in 2012. Scroll down for video . A woman had her flesh burnt and eaten, was violently raped and allegedly had noughts and crosses carved on her back by her ex-boyfriend in 2006 in Sydney (file photo) Her ex-boyfriend, who cannot be named to protect the victim's identity, pleaded guilty last week to a string of charges, including sexual assault and kidnap, and will be sentenced in a Sydney court next year. There are several lesser charges he hasn't pleaded to. He allegedly forced her to lean over a dining chair and struck her with a belt, and held her face over a stove top, the police statement of facts says. When she tried to flee through the locked front door, the man forced the woman into the bathroom and repeatedly asked her 'Why'd you do it'? Police allege the woman had no idea what he was talking about. NSW Constable Genelle Warne was credited with helping the woman come forward after staying silent about the alleged abuse for six years . For what seemed like 'hours' to the woman, he peppered her with the question in-between heavy blows to her head. The woman was curled up in a ball in the corner when the man later returned to the bathroom with his cousin in tow, the facts state. He allegedly forced his girlfriend to kiss his cousin's penis. After the alleged sexual humiliation, the man used a hot hair straightener to squeeze the woman's toes, fingers and arm, the facts, tendered in the local court last year, state. The man then ripped off the woman's burnt skin and ate it. The assault continued in the bedroom where the man threatened her genitalia with a knife and allegedly drew noughts and crosses on her back. The man pleaded guilty last week to a string of charges, including sexual assault and kidnap, and will be sentenced in a Sydney court next year (file photo) As he sexually assaulted her, he held her so tight his fingers were covered in blood from her pierced skin. The victim remained at the home for two days and didn't see a doctor. The man, from Sydney's northwest, was charged last year.

"A simulated school shooting in Massachusetts   showed what 'active shooter' technology could do to help police catch a gunman if the horrific threat ever strikes. In the live demonstration, the 'gunman' entered the school armed with an assault rifle, opening fire with dummy rounds first in the school library and then rampaging through hallways and classrooms. But he had only a few minutes to wreak havoc. Smoke alarm-sized sensors installed in classrooms, hallways and other points throughout the building were activated by the sounds of gunfire, and police officers were immediately able to track his movements and quickly subdue him. Scroll down for video . Officers carry training weapons as they search the halls of the Methuen school during the live demonstration . Nearly 100 people gathered in the school auditorium to observe the demonstration of what the school district bills as the first such system operating in a public school in the U.S. Students were off for the Veterans Day holiday, so the Methuen grammar school was empty for the demonstration to take place. Police Chief Joseph Solomon said he believes such systems should be required in many public buildings, just as fire suppression systems and smoke detectors are. 'It's amazing, the short, split-second amount of time from identification of the shot to transmission of the message,' he said following the demonstration. 'It changes the whole game. Without that shot detection system, we wouldn't know what was going on in the school ... Valuable, valuable time can be lost. Unfortunately, with school crisis situations, it's about mitigating loss.' Police respond to the 'gunman' who entered the school with an assault rifle, opening fire with dummy round . Lieutenant Greg Gallant, of the Methuen police department, portrays an active shooter as he roams the halls of a school with an assault rifle, loaded with dummy rounds, during the demonstration . The system works using smoke alarm-sized sensors that are installed in classrooms, hallways and other points throughout the building and are activated by the sounds of gunfire . School Superintendent Judith Scannell said she hopes the district of about 7,300 students can find the money to pay for outfitting its four other schools. The new system was installed at no cost by Shooter Detection Systems, a Massachusetts-based company. CEO Christian Connors said it is installing the technology in two more schools in Virginia and California, as well as undisclosed airports. Founded in 2013, the company is among others across the country trying to market such 'active shooter' systems to the owners and operators of malls, airports, government offices, schools and other public buildings. Smoke alarm-sized sensors installed in classrooms, hallways and other points throughout the building were activated by the sounds of gunfire . Later this month, Savannah College Art and Design in Georgia is expected to become the first college in the country to launch such technology, using a system developed by California-based company SST. Mr Connors said his company's technology is based on systems successfully developed for the military to help soldiers locate enemy fire during battles and could cost anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000, depending on the size and structure of the building. Methuen has never been targeted, but three schools briefly were placed on lockdown last month after a psychiatric patient at nearby Holy Family Hospital reported a man with a gun in the clinic. Methuen long has been among the more active districts in the state in addressing school safety. Officers were immediately able to track the movements of the 'gunman' (pictured) and quickly subdue him . Graph shows how school shootings and fatalities in the United States have increased . Situated about 30 miles north of Boston, the district was one of the first to post uniformed police, known as school resource officers, in its schools. Methuen was also among the first to conduct 'active threat' drills for police officers following a rash of school shootings across the country, including the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 children and school staff. Suzanne Kennan, a resident who lives across from the school, said she had not been aware the district made the upgrade, but she said she supported the investment. 'Unfortunately we're at a point where we have to do something like this,' she said. 'Instead of burying our heads in the sand and thinking this will never happen, they're doing something. You never know where this is going to happen next. Why take that chance?' The new system was installed at no cost by Shooter Detection Systems, a Massachusetts-based company .

"A teenager with a rare condition which causes her to faint says she is sick of being accused of drunkenness when she passes out in public. Paige Bartram, 17, suffers from a rare syndrome known as Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) which causes her to faint if she stands up for longer than 30 minutes at a time. But, she says people often walk past her when she has fainted and assume she is a drunken teenager. Paige Bartram, 17, has a rare condition which causes her to faint if she stands up for more than 30 minutes . On one occasion, Paige, from Leeds, even had to be rushed to hospital after being left unconscious for more than half an hour before anyone came to her rescue. She said: ‘My condition has taught me that the public can be very naive. ‘If I faint in public people just ignore me because they think I’m drunk - I was once left in town in the middle of winter for about half an hour. ‘Even paramedics have told me that people are more likely to think I’m wasted because I’m a teenage girl. ‘It makes me very cautious if I go out alone, and sometimes I’ll just have to sit on the floor for a few minutes if I think I’m going to faint. ‘It can be quite annoying - the fact that people jump to the conclusion that I must be some kind of alcoholic. Paige says that when she faints in public people tend to assume she is drunk. Once she had to be taken to hospital (pictured) after being left unconscious in the street in winter for 35 minutes before anyone helped her . On another occasion (pictured) Paige had to be taken to hospital after fainting and falling down some stairs . ‘Sometimes it can be hard, but I always try to remain positive.’ Paige is currently on medication to try and control her condition, but until a suitable treatment is found she has to learn to live with her symptoms. She said: ‘If I go out and about, I just have to make sure I take time to sit down and have a rest - if I don’t, I’ll just collapse. ‘I’m 6ft tall, so when I do faint I can really hurt myself on the way down, so I have to be really careful. PoTS is an abnormal response by the nervous system to standing up. It causes an increase in heart rate and altered blood supply to the brain. This causes dizziness, fainting, tiredness and palpitations. Other symptoms of PoTS include shakiness, shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches and stomach problems. Some patients find the condition very disabling while others have mild symptoms and get better without any treatment. The condition can be triggered by an illness, pregnancy, trauma and immunisations. It can also occur in teenagers who experience a sudden growth spurt. In some cases the condition results from another illness such as diabetes, MS or Lyme disease. Source: PoTS UK . ‘Sometimes I will just sit on the floor if there isn’t a chair around - although I don’t really like to as I can get pretty funny looks. ‘If I don’t take the time to sit down I’ll just faint and that’s when it can be very difficult. ‘I wear a medical bracelet but people tend to just leave me.’ While Paige is always careful about condition, she has had some serious accidents in the past. She said: ‘I was once at the top of the stairs and I fainted. ‘I fell all the way down and had to be rushed to hospital as they suspected I’d fractured my neck. ‘Although it was scary it taught me to take the condition seriously and be very careful. ‘Before, I tried to beat it, but it taught me that I need to learn to live with it.’ Paige first began fainting five years ago at school. She said: ‘It started when I was about 12 years old, and I just kept fainting every time I stood up. ‘It soon became everyday life, but I knew it wasn’t normal so I went to the doctors. ‘At first they had no idea what it was and my symptoms were just dismissed. ‘By the time I was 16 they started to suggest that it was all psychological and I was putting it on and doing it for attention. ‘They were asking me if I got on with my mum, if I was stressed or there were any other problems in my life - it was very frustrating. ‘I didn’t want to see a psychologist so eventually I did some research myself and came across a charity called STARS - they had loads of information about PoTS and I realised that must be what I had. ‘I asked my doctors if they could refer me to a PoTS clinic in Sheffield - that’s where I finally got an official diagnosis last November. Paige has a condition which means her nervous system responds abnormally to standing up. She is pictured wearing a jacket made for her by her father . ‘It was a relief to know that I’d been right along, but quite scary to discover that I had a medical condition.’ PoTS is an abnormal response by the nervous system to standing up. It causes an increase in the heart rate and altered blood supply to the brain. This causes dizziness, fainting, tiredness and palpitations. Other symptoms can include shakiness, shortness of breath, chest pain and headaches. Paige says that over time she has learned to manage her condition by sitting down regularly . Now, Paige does her best to live her life, despite her unusual condition. She said: ‘I don’t get really upset about my condition because there’s nothing I can do about it. ‘I try to live my life as normal, I just have to have more breaks than other people. ‘I’m lucky to have an incredible family and boyfriend who always look out for me and keep my spirits up. ‘I just want to tell my story so more people know about this.’ Trudie Lobban MBE, Founder and CEO of STARS, said: ‘This case is a classic example of how hugely debilitating PoTS can be. ‘Common symptoms include a racing heart on standing up, palpitations, fainting, dizziness, chest pain and weakness. ‘There is a significant lack of awareness about PoTS among both the public and the medical profession. ‘We often find the disorder is under-recognised by physicians, which can impact on the patient’s quality of life through misdiagnosis or being informed symptoms are “all in their head”. ‘As a consequence, historically many patients with PoTS have been given a diagnosis of ME, anxiety or panic attacks. ‘Despite the lack of awareness, the disorder is quite common. In young women, some estimates put the number of people with the condition higher than one in 100. ‘At STARS our main aim is to raise awareness of PoTS and other disorders which cause unexplained loss of consciousness. ‘Our Heart Rhythm Week, from 2 - 8 June 2014 is our opportunity to focus on a broad range of disorders, like PoTS, which affect a person’s heart rhythm and can cause debilitating symptoms like Paige’s.’","Paige Bartram, from Leeds, has Postural Tachycardia Syndrome .

"A judge has handed down a five-year prison term to a man accused in the death of a central Ohio child-rape suspect who died after a jail assault. Defendant Zachary Butler also was fined $1,500 on Wednesday and ordered to serve three years' probation after prison. A report by the Champaign County Sheriff's Office says inmate David Piersol was beaten on April 5 at Tri-County Regional Jail in Mechanicsburg and died a few days later. Piersol was in jail after being charged with allegedly raping a young girl. Butler, of Richwood, took responsibility for the assault and apologized to Piersol's family. But he also suggested other inmates continued to attack Piersol in a jail bathroom afterward.

"It has been revealed that less than a week before Lamar Odom was arrested on suspicion of DUI he was involved in a three-car collision on the exact same freeway. The crash was not reported to authorities, however a journalist for the Los Angeles Times has claimed that his car was rear-ended by another vehicle hit by Odom's white Mercedes on Saturday. The LA Times claims the incident took place around 6pm and the journalist named Adolfo Flores alleges that Odom became reluctant to hand his insurance details over. t is the only the type of family drama that Kris Jenner wouldn't want broadcasted on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Troubling times: Lamar Odom, pictured in March, was reportedly involved in a 'three-way car collision' on the same freeway less than a week before his DUI address . It is the latest twist in a worrying time for Khloe Kardashian's husband, who was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in the early hours of Friday morning. To make matters worse, it has now . been revealed that Lamar was paid a visit by two drug counselors just . hours before he was charged with a DUI. TMZ reports . that the counselors - who work with the National Basketball Players . Association - contacted Lamar to offer help and he accepted. During . the visit to Lamar and Khloe's house, TMZ report that he was very . receptive with a source telling them 'it was very positive'. However, after the pair left, Lamar then got into his vehicle and never came home. The NBA star was later held at Van Nuys police station on $15,000 bail but was released from custody at 8.30am. He was pulled over just before 4am for driving too slow at 50mph on the 101 Freeway in the San Fernando Valley. Not again: Lamar, seen on Wednesday, was reportedly reluctant to hand over his insurance details to the driver . Trouble: Lamar Odom, seen making a stop at Taco Bell on Wednesday, was arrested for DUI in the early hours of Friday morning . Booking sheet: The NBA star is understood to have failed several field sobriety tests before refusing to submit to chemical testing . Odom did not immediately respond to police, passing three exits and driving erratically, TMZ reports. He failed numerous field sobriety checks but refused all chemical tests, according to police. eland Tang, the California Highway Patrol public information officer, told Radar Online: 'Lamar Odom was driving 50 mph on the 101 freeway. He was driving in a serpentine manner which is pretty bad. That is like when the officer does a freeway break. Across all the lanes of the freeway. I’m surprised he wasn’t rear ended.' After 'failing' field sobriety tests, he was taken into custody and Tang said: 'He did what no one should ever do, he refused the chemical tests. 'That means that his license is . revoked and Lamar could get the most powerful attorney in the world and . he is still not going to have a license for a year.' Impounded: Odom's car was brought to North Hollywood and held in the valley tow yard, pictured here on Friday . Van Nuys police station: Lamar was kept in custody for several hours before being released after posting $15,000 . Hiding his addiction: Lamar's brother-in-law, Rob Kardashian - pictured leaving the couple's house on Friday - is reported to have known about the NBA star's alleged drug use . Returning home: An assistant was seen driving Lamar's DUI vehicle back to his house in LA later on Friday . It follows weeks of troubling allegations about drug abuse and serious marriage issues with his wife of four years. Reports claim he has been battling an addiction to 'Oxycontin and crack cocaine' for two years. He has also been accused of cheating with two different women while on the road as a basketball player. Loyal wife Khloe, who was pictured . looking downcast as she arrived at a LA gym on Thursday, is apparently . desperate to 'save' her husband from his alleged drug problems and work . through their marital woes. Something the matter? It's virtually unheard of for Kris Jenner to keep a low profile, but it seems Lamar's troubles may be playing on the momager's mind as she was seen arriving in Burbank on Thursday . A source has said: 'She is in love and does not want a divorce.' Both have been pictured with their wedding rings on separate outings this week. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star reportedly staged an . intervention earlier this month, but the meeting didn't go as planned and Lamar vanished, . but was later tracked down to a hotel in Los Angeles. He returned to his L.A. home on Monday after staying away for several days. Khloe . apparently kept the details of her marital problems a secret from most . members of family, and insiders say they were 'shocked' to learn of the . extent of the issues. (Sources tell Radar Khloe's brother Rob, who lives with the couple, has been aware of Lamar's alleged drug problems for over a year.) Showing the strain: Khloe Kardashian looked downcast as she arrived at the gym on Thursday . The 6-foot-10-inch forward has played for the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks. He broke into the NBA with the Clippers in 1999, playing for them for four seasons before spending the 2003-04 season with the Heat. He had his best years during his six seasons with the Lakers, beginning in 2004-05. The team won NBA championships in 2010 and 2011 and Odom won the NBA's sixth man award in 2011. After spending the 2012 season with the Dallas Mavericks, he returned to the Clippers last year. He became a free agent at the end of the season. His once glittering career now appears to be in tatters. Going through a tough time: Khloe and Lamar, pictured in May 2012, have been married since 2009 . 'Players are starting to return to their teams, and Lamar doesn't have a . team,' an NBA insider told People earlier this week. 'He's gone from making $8.5 . million last year to being out of work at this point.' 'There's an old saying in the NBA: . Are you more valuable than your problems? And it's just reached the . point with Lamar where he is not more valuable than his problems,' the . insider said . 'Up until about two years ago, Lamar . Odom was averaging about 15 points and eight rebounds a game and you . know what? You deal with his off-court problems for that. When Lamar . Odom averages four points a game, he's not worth the problems.' However the source added that Lamar . could still be in with a spot on the Los Angeles Lakers, although he . would probably have to take a significant pay cut.

"Andros Townsend has pleaded with manager Mauricio Pochettino to keep him in the side against Burnley in the FA Cup third round – so that 2015 can be the year he finally makes himself a Tottenham first-team regular. Townsend, whose spectacular goals helped England to qualify for the World Cup, but whose 2014 was blighted by an ankle injury which caused him to miss the World Cup, scored for Spurs on Thursday night in the spectacular 5-3 win over Chelsea, the first time he has started successive Premier League games under Pochettino. And even though the Argentinian is likely to make changes to the team that beat Chelsea so comprehensively, Townsend hopes he is not among them. He has been a regular in the Capital One Cup and Europa League but now wants a long run of games to convince Pochettino that his future remains at Spurs. Andros Townsend celebrates scoring in Tottenham's 5-3 victory over Chelsea at White Hart Lane . The Spurs forward has started the last two Premier League games and wants to play against Burnley . ‘That’s the aim,’ said Townsend. ‘I’ve played the last two Premier League games. I cannot remember the last time I did that. I’m not looking for a rest and I want to play every game I can and stake a claim for a regular place. ‘Everyone wants to play 90 minutes every game but you have to accept that’s not going to happen. I have played in every cup game and that has helped me build up my confidence. Hopefully I can get a run in the Premier League side and stay there. ‘I’ve been here since the age of eight. If I can stay at Spurs and get a run in the Premier League team then of course I don’t want to look anywhere else. I have played the last two Premier League games so that’s where my focus is and doing well for Spurs. Townsend burst on to the international scene in 2013 but injury forced him to miss the World Cup last year . The 23-year-old is confident that his injury problems are now behind him . ‘For the manager to trust you and to throw you in against two of the best teams shows great confidence. Hopefully I can repay that faith in me. He is happy with how things are going. You can see that as I have played the last two games he is not looking to ship me out at the first opportunity. That has given me confidence and hopefully now I can get a run in the team and show what everyone what I’m capable of.’ Pochettino says that Townsend is too important to the squad to be allowed to leave and the player himself is convinced that now his injury problems are over he will rediscover the form which in the autumn of 2013 saw him hailed as one of the most exciting English talents in the Premier League. An ankle injury in April meant he missed the World Cup and disrupted his start to this season. ‘2014 was not a good year for me with form, fitness and injuries,’ said Townsend. ‘Hopefully I’m over the worse of it now and the performances are going to be better and I can get back to the form I had in 2013. I’m not going to look back. You can’t do that. But injuries did come at the wrong time. Now that’s over and in the past, it’s a new year and new start.’ Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino says Townsend is too important to be allowed to leave . Tottenham travel to Burnley on Sunday for the FA Cup third round, a repeat of the 1962 Final, which Spurs won 3-1. Despite struggling for form at times, they have now lost just two of their last twelve games. They are in the Capital One Cup semi, the Europa League last 32 and sit fifth in the Premier League, two points off Champions League qualification. ‘We’ve got great confidence from our league form in recent weeks,’ said Townsend. ‘Everyone wants that to continue. The Christmas period is a tough time anyway but to play Manchester United and Chelsea back-to-back is extremely difficult. So we will take heart from that going into our next game. ‘We have a big squad. We have seen this season we have rotated in the Europa League and Capital One Cup competitions. We have a squad who can challenge in four competitions in on four fronts.’","Tottenham face Burnley in the FA Cup third round on Sunday .

"In a video that proves even the most powerful men in the world can still be reduced to meek mice , Chinese leader Xi Jinping appears to be whipped into shape on stage with a single look from his wife. It's clear who the boss is in Mr Xi's marriage after the hilarious video appeared online showing his wife, Lady Peng Liyuan, throwing her husband a severe look and exerting her ability to make her husband work. The powerful pair attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Beijing this week along with a range of world leaders. However, Peng Liyuan was unimpressed when her husband refused to wave to the waiting crowd and she certainly let him know her true feelings. Scroll down for video . In a video that proves even the most powerful men in the world can still be reduced to meek mice, Chinese leader Xi Jinping appears to be whipped into shape on stage with a single look from his wife . The powerful pair attended the Asia-Pacific summit in Beijing this week along with a range of world leaders . In the awkward encounter, the First Lady of China happily waved at the crowd, beaming in her detailed purple dress. However, her smile slightly dropped when she noticed her famous husband had his hand down by his side, refusing to wave to the audience. With one harsh side glance from Lady Liyuan, Mr Xi inping's hand shot into the air, fearing the wrath of his lady love. Following his confident wife's lead, Mr Xi plastered a smile on his face and proceeded to wave intently at the delighted audience. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Australian leader Tony Abbott also blanked the audience, preferring to keep their hands by their side instead of partaking in the welcoming wave. Xi’s wife, Peng Liyuan, who was once a popular folk singer, is famous in her own right in China and has taken on a very public role as the First Lady. Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan walk on to the stage at the summit with Barack Obama a range of other dignitaries . She accompanies her husband on economic trips abroad and happily poses for waiting photographers. Officials in China have worked hard to build up the image of Mr Xi and Lady Peng as a wholesome, loving couple. Photos have been distributed of Mr Xi picking flowers for his beloved wife, holding an umbrella over her head in the rain and lovingly holding her hand on official assignments. These photos have been circulated on Chinese social media and have prompted a lot of adoration from the Chinese public. President Putin caused controversy on Tuesday when he draped his coat across Ms Peng's shoulders during a chilly night in Beijing . Xi was previously married to Ke Lingling, in early 1980s, however the couple divorced within a few years of marrying. The 61-year-old married  Peng Liyuan in 1987 and the couple have one daughter together, Xi Mingze, who attended Harvard University. President Putin caused controversy on  Tuesday when he draped his coat across Ms Peng's shoulders during a chilly night in Beijing. Mr Putin is seen as a heartthrob among most Chinese woman because of his macho image. Mr Xi came across as inattentive to his  wife's needs at the event. Chinese authorities, who were broadcasting the performance as part of a special TV segment dedicated to the summit, quickly moved to remove the video of Putin's act of chivalry from all social media and online forums, fearing Mr Xi's image would be tarnished.","The Chinese leader was whipped into shape with one look from his wife .

"A 22-year-old former netball captain says she ‘lost everything’ when severe ME caused her to be bedridden and to develop the 'bones of a 100-year-old'. Jessica Taylor, from Rochester, Kent, spent four continuous years in hospital and has not left her bed for seven years. While she was in hospital, she was so ill she couldn't recognise her family, had to be tube-fed and was unable to move anything other than her head. Scroll down for video . Four of the nine years Jessica has been ill, have been spent in hospital . As she has been in bed for so long, Jessica has now developed severe osteoporosis and was told by doctors that she has ‘the bones of an 100-year-old’. She remains so weak she is barely able to sit up and just moving from her bed to a chair requires the use of a hoist. Jessica told MailOnline: ‘My life is a world of one room. The ME caused me to lose everything in the end. ‘I’ve got a fight on my hands and I believe I am going to get better.’ Jessica first fell ill when she was 14. She suffered a bout of the flu which she never recovered from and, despite trying to push herself, her health rapidly deteriorated and within nine months she was bedridden. For two years Jessica (pictured in an ambulance) had to be fed through a tube and for 18 months she was unable to speak. She was also sensitive to light and sound so had to wear sunglasses and ear protectors . Jessica (pictured before her illness) developed ME when she was 14. She suffered from a bout of flu which she never recovered from and within months was confined to a wheelchair and then to her bed . She said: ‘I loved life and I wanted to be out there living it. ‘I put my illness to the back of my mind thinking it would go, but it didn’t happen that way.’ She added: ‘I was a lover of life and until ME hit, I was always out doing things.’ Doctors initially thought Jessica was suffering from glandular fever but her condition rapidly deteriorated until she was so weak she required a wheelchair. Soon afterwards, she was confined to her bed. Jessica (pictured in hospital) has been in bed for so long she has developed severe osteoporosis and was told she has 'the bones of a 100-year-old'. The condition means she could break her back or a hip just by sitting up . Jessica (pictured before her illness) was the captain of her school's netball team before her illness and says she was 'a lover of life' She said: ‘I tried to push myself, I wanted to achieve things and I wanted to do what everyone else was doing. ‘It was shocking – I had gone from being a healthy captain of netball to being stuck in a wheelchair. ‘The irony is that now a wheelchair would represent freedom for me.’ Jessica stopped attending school at the age of 15 and, in 2006, was admitted to hospital. She spent four years in Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Queen’s Hospital in Romford, and Burswood Hospital in Tunbridge Wells. After leaving hospital Jessica required round-the-clock care and has a carer for 12 hours a day . Jessica, pictured with her mother, Kate, was so weak and unused to sitting up that just being in a chair causes her to feel dizzy and nauseous . For 18 months she was so ill she was unable to speak or to understand anything that was being said to her and for two years she had to be fed through a tube. She was also extremely sensitive to light and sound meaning she had to wear sunglasses and earplugs constantly. She was unable to move at all other than to shake or nod her head and she required 24-hour a day care, including being washed and using a bedpan. She said: ‘It was incredibly painful. The fatigue is so intense it actually hurts.’ Having spent four continuous years in hospital, Jessica recovered sufficiently to return home part-time. Jessica (pictured with her sister, Ruby) says she still believes that she can get better but that even if her ME improves, the osteoporosis will hold her back . For two years she lived a life moving in and out of hospital. She has only recently moved home full-time and she still requires round-the-clock nursing care. She has a carer for 12 hours a day and her parents, Kate and Colin, and sister, Ruby, 18, care for her during the night. Jessica said: ‘It’s made us very tough – well bonded together. We are very protective of each other.’ She added: ‘I think my illness made my sister miss out on a lot of her childhood – the illness affects the whole family. Jessica (pictured on her 21st birthday with her sister, Ruby, and brother, Tom) said:  'I think my illness made my sister miss out on a lot of her childhood - the illness affects the whole family' Jessica (pictured with her mother and sister) said: 'I want to be well and I believe that can happen. I have high hopes of being able to walk and to do things for myself' ‘The attention inevitably has to be on the sick person and when I came home she looked after me. ‘She would say, though, that it was ok because she had her sister home.’ When she was 19, Jessica was also told she had severe osteoporosis because her bones had been weakened by lack of use. She said: ‘My bones are very weak – just sitting up I have to be extremely careful as I am at risk of breaking my back or hips. ‘I have to do really gradual movements and when I am lifted up I have to have a sling to protect my fragile body.’ Jessica (pictured before her illness) said: 'My bones are very weak - just sitting up I have to be extremely careful as I am at risk of breaking my back or hips' She explained that even if her ME improves, her life will still be seriously restricted as a result of her osteoporosis. She told MailOnline: ‘When I start to make improvements I am stopped by the osteoporosis. ‘I am still suffering severely – I can only do half an hour of activity, such as using my computer, before having to rest for half an hour. ‘I am currently trying to get used to sitting in a chair but I have to be hoisted into it and I suffer dizziness and nausea when I sit up.’ She is also so weak, and her muscles so wasted, that she is in danger of developing a dangerously fast heart rate if she tries to sit up. Jessica (pictured with her parents, Kate and Colin, and her brother, Tom, and sister, Ruby) has now launched a charity called Share A Star from her bed . Jessica has recently launched a charity called Share A Star from her bed. The charity aims to help improve the lives of sick children. She said: ‘I have lots of plans – Share a Star is now a massive part of my life. ‘I want to be well and I believe that can happen. I have high hopes of being able to walk and to do things for myself – the important thing is to gain some independence and then go to bigger things from there.’ She added: ‘I have so much to live for so have never been depressed – I believe you have to deal with the cards you are dealt. ‘I’d much rather be living but I don’t get angry – it’s just a waste of energy and I don’t have much of that! ‘A key thing for me is to retain a sense of humour and a positive outlook – those things are vital.’ Share A Star aims to improve the lives of sick children by making them feel special and by sending them goody bags in hospital. Jessica is pictured with some of the books and toys that go into the goody bags . Share a Star aims to make children who are in hospital feel special and sends them packs of goodies to relieve boredom. Jessica said: ‘We can’t offer the cure but we can help the every day. We are there through the journey.’ For more information about Share a Star visit www.shareastar.org or follow the charity on Twitter at @shareastar . In October, a team of runners, including Jessica's sister, Ruby, and her brother, Tom, ran the Bupa Great South Run to raise funds for Share A Star. The charity is now looking for runners to take part in the Bupa Great North Run 2014. Anyone who is interested can enter the general ballot which opens on January 7 at greatrun.org . Myalgic encephalomyelitis is a chronic condition that causes persistent fatigue that is not improved by sleep or rest. Myalgic means muscle pain and encephalomyelitis means inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The condition can cause long-term illness and disability but many sufferers - particularly children and young people - improve over time. It is estimated to affect about 250,000 people in the UK and is more common in women than men. It usually develops in the early 20s to mid-40s but children can also be affected - usually between the ages of 13 and 15. Most cases of ME are mild or moderate but up to one in four people with the condition have severe symptoms. Mild ME is defined as that which still allows the sufferer to care for themselves but means they may need to take days off to rest. Moderate ME is that which causes reduce mobility, disturbed sleep and the need to sleep during the day. Severe ME means the sufferer has severely reduced mobility. Aside from exhaustion, other symptoms include muscle pain, nausea, a sore throat, dizziness and sensitivity to light and sound. It is not known what causes it but it could be linked to a viral infection, an immune system problem, a hormone imbalance or a psychological problem. There is no cure but treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and medication to control pain and sleeping problems.

"Jerome Boateng was 11 years old when he discovered what racism in football sounds like. Barely out of primary school, he travelled to a game in the east of his native Berlin, where a watching father decided to pick on the fact that he was black. ‘Another kid’s dad called me... you know (the word).’ What he means is the ‘N’ word and he has a natural reluctance to speak it out loud. ‘I didn’t know how to take it. The whole game he was speaking to me and I started crying because I was small, 11 or 12 years old. ‘My dad came round. He didn’t talk to this guy, he talked to me and said, “Look. Calm down. Play your game. Don’t listen. Just show what you can do with the ball and that’s it”. And other parents came around and told the guy: “What are you doing? Just be quiet and let the kids play. Look how young they are!”.’ VIDEO Scroll down to see Jerome Boateng's beach training while on tour with Bayern . Jerome Boateng wants to become Germany's first black captain after being racially abused as a youngster . Boateng spent a single season at Manchester City before returning to his homeland in 2011 . Boateng has won the Champions League with Bayern Munich (left) and the World Cup with Germany (right) Boateng is understandably reflective as he ponders such painful childhood memories. To English audiences he is the one who got away from Manchester City. He spent a season there under Roberto Mancini, being played out of position, before being offloaded to Bayern Munich. Since then he has become a vital part of Bayern and Germany — winning the World Cup, where for many he was man of the match in the final, the Champions League, two Bundesliga titles and the German Cup twice. On Tuesday, Bayern resume their quest to win the Champions League under Pep Guardiola, taking on Shakhtar Donetsk. How City, who face Barcelona the following week, would love to have him as a regular partner to Vincent Kompany now.The pair were close friends, first at SV Hamburg and then during their time at City. As the son of a black Ghanaian father and white German mother, Boateng grew up in the multi- cultural district of Charlottenburg, in west Berlin, so his German experience was far removed from the stereotype of the country. In such an environment, racism was rare. He had only heard the ‘N’ word once before that junior football match and, even though the context was different, it still retained its power to shock and belittle. Boateng will return to Champions League action when Bayern Munich host Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16 . The German defender celebrates after scoring a late winner against former club City last season . Boateng covers Bayern coach Pep Guardiola in beer after winning the Bundesliga title last year . Aged 10, he featured in a rap music video, playing the part of the black MC as a child. Afterwards, the rappers, in an attempt to be friendly, used the ‘N’ word to him, as young black Americans often do as a term of comradeship. ‘I was making a music video and there were German rappers and I played him as a small guy,’ says Boateng, ‘Afterwards they called me: “Hey, you little. . .”, you know. And I just ran away and started crying because I never heard this word used against me. And then they came and tried to (explain). I was 10 years old — and that’s what I experienced, when I cried two times. ‘Then I spoke with my mum about it and she explained a lot of stuff to me and that’s she jealous of my colour and stuff like this. She was super-understanding. She said they don’t know, they are just jealous and to be proud that I had a colour like this. It was really good to know — she gave me a good feeling.’ The incidents are footnotes in his bigger story but colour is a part of his story. He represents modern Germany, just as Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski also do with their respective Turkish and Polish roots. Boateng’s half-brother, the former Portsmouth and AC Milan player, Kevin-Prince, opted to play for Ghana. For Jerome, whose father was always involved in his upbringing and lived near him despite the fact that his parents split when he was young, there were no mixed loyalties. ‘It was always Germany for me, 100 per cent. I know these people are just dumb, stupid,’ he said. ‘Where I grew up it was multi- cultural from the first day, as I had a lot of friends who are half this and half this. I have a lot of German friends also. How I am now, it’s because I grew up in Berlin with so many different cultures.’ Boateng (left) celebrates with Germany team-mates after being crowned 2014 World Cup champions .

Boateng is part of Germany's new multi-cultural generation that includes Sami Khedira (2nd right) Boateng celebrates with the European Cup after winning the Champions League in 2013 . He appreciates the importance of his story domestically and globally. He is currently one of the vice- captains of the German national team, with Bastian Schweinsteiger the main captain. Should he one day captain the team, it would send an important message — though he is clear he sees that as a future event rather than something imminent, as he feels a recent interview made it look as though he was lobbying for the job. ‘I just want to explain again because they took it as though I want to be captain now. ‘It’s not like I want to take something from Bastian. Joachim Low (the Germany national team manager) said in an interview that Toni Kroos or I can be captain also. I said that would be a big honour for me one day to be captain of Germany with my colour.’ He is aware of the roles Paul Ince, Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand have played in establishing the leadership credentials of black players in western Europe by captaining England. ‘They are good role models,’ he said. ‘France also; (Patrick) Vieira was captain. So for me it would be a great honour to be captain.’ Because it would send a message? ‘To all Germany and the world. Maybe they look on Germany and say it’s mixed but it’s not possible they have a black captain.’ Boateng is an impressive figure both in terms of height — he’s 6ft 4in — and his manner. The failure of City to integrate him at the club remains a puzzle to outsiders. ‘I was young. My girlfriend was pregnant, we wanted her to stay in Germany and have the baby there. Then I started with a knee injury. The coach promised that I’d play central defence — but I played right, I played left. Boateng struggled to settle at the Etihad after being played out of position on the right side of defence . The 26-year-old did not have to think twice about leaving Manchester after Bayern Munich came in for him . Boateng's half-brother Kevin-Prince  chose to represent Ghana instead of Germany at international level . ‘Then I had another knee injury, I had an operation also, so I was not happy with the whole situation. And then Bayern came. ‘But I learned so much, even in training, from the players there. That’s why I made the move — Vieira, Kompany, (Carlos) Tevez, (Emmanuel) Adebayor at this time — they are all great players. So I learned a lot about myself also and they gave me good advice and that’s why I say I’m not sad that I went to Manchester.’ Having been at City, he appreciates the scale of the ambition at the club and their desire to win the Champions League but he also knows that process is never as quick as winning a domestic league title. ‘It takes time because the Champions League is difficult and it’s different to the league and cup. One small mistake or one detail, it’s finished. City have the opportunity, for sure, to win it. They have great players, there will be great players in the future.’ This group of players at Bayern had to learn their lessons painfully and slowly, losing finals in 2010 and 2012 before finally winning at Wembley in 2013. Boateng’s first season at the club included the bitter disappointment of losing the final to Chelsea on penalties in their own stadium. ‘Even though they didn’t deserve it!’ he says, laughing. ‘No,’ he adds, correcting himself. ‘That’s football. If we don’t take it, they deserve it. That was the worst feeling in my life, really. I couldn’t eat for two days.’ A young Boateng plays for Germany against Russia in the U19 European Championship in 2007 . The defender makes a tackle on future team-mate Bastian Schweinsteiger while playing for Hamburg . Bayern Munich's loss to Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final spurred them on to win it the next year . At that stage Philipp Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Boateng and team-mates were caricatured in Germany as serial losers with club and country; always the nearly men. ‘I remember the day after the Chelsea final Thomas Muller sent a message, not only to me but to a couple of players, saying: “Look — this happened. But next year we take this cup. OK!” ‘When you come to a final you remember that message and that you have to take the chance. It’s not every day you go into a final.’ Though these days it feels as though Boateng has made cup final appearances a pretty regular feature of his life. And, you suspect his teams, both Bayern Munich and Germany, will have plenty more ahead of them.","Jerome Boateng reveals being subjected to racist abuse as an 11-year-old .

"Wimbledon and Liverpool stars look back on the biggest upset in modern FA Cup final history . The birth was chaotic and messy. It was the summer of 2002, and hundreds of pub footballers were descending on Wimbledon Common, famous for the Wombles and as the former training ground of the Crazy Gang. Wimbledon, FA Cup winners in 1988, were going back to their roots. Having seen an FA-appointed panel agree to relocate the club to Milton Keynes and, left without a team to support, a few crazy idealists and disenfranchised fans had the idea of re-forming and starting again at the bottom of the football pyramid, in the Combined Counties League. The only problem was they had no players. ‘It was unbelievable,’ said Joe Sheerin, who tried out that day and ended up as captain and one of the leading lights at the new club. ‘It was like no other trial I’ve ever seen. You had 400 people turning up. I don’t know how you can tell how anyone is any good from that. There were games going off all over the place.’ Adebayo Azeez (left) holds off York City's Marvin McCoy during AFC Wimbledon's FA Cup first round win . Former Wimbledon player Neal Ardley will lead Wimbledon out against Liverpool in the FA Cup third round . AFC Wimbledon have won five promotions in 12 years to earn the right to play Liverpool in the FA Cup again . Erik Samuelson, then a partner at PwC, and now the chief executive of the club and one of those deluded idealists, was also present. ‘Some people were there who could scarcely stand on one leg and swing the other. But they can say they trialled for AFC Wimbledon,’ he said. Yet on Sunday that same club will face Liverpool in the FA Cup third round, a repeat of their most famous hour in their former guise, when the old Wimbledon Crazy Gang beat mighty Liverpool in the 1988 final. A visit to training — no longer on the Common but at a proper sports ground — reveals a pristine pitch, a raft of support staff for manager Neal Ardley, including a chef for post-training meals and a sports scientist, as well as thriving under-21 and under-18 teams. Then there is the first team, who sit comfortably in mid-table in League Two. This is a club rebuilt. More poignantly, 23 years after the club left their old home of Plough Lane in Wimbledon — the club played at Selhurst Park for 12 years before the owners moved the franchise in 2003 — they are on the verge of returning. When Liverpool visit they will play at the 4,720-capacity Kingsmeadow Stadium in Kingston. The old Wimbledon ground is now a block of flats, but a proposal to redevelop a greyhound stadium a few hundred yards from that site into a 11,000-capacity community stadium would take Wimbledon back home — if Merton Council approve. Wimbledon pulled off one of the greatest shocks in FA Cup history by beating Liverpool in the 1988 final . Wimbledon captain Dave Beasant guesses right to save a penalty from Liverpool striker John Aldridge . Lawrie Sanchez glances home a header for what was ultimately the winning goal at Wembley . It is difficult to ascertain who has the more remarkable story: the old Wimbledon who rose from the Isthmian League to win the FA Cup and become a consistent force in the newly-formed Premier League; or this new incarnation, who, in 12 years and five promotions, have earned the right to compete against Liverpool again. Both are powerful narratives of the underdog, and the Liverpool game is a staging point in the journey. ‘It’s a landmark,’ said Samuelson who works for just a guinea a year. ‘Randomly choosing our significant moments, there are those trials at Wimbledon Common, our first game against Sutton United, getting into the Combined Counties League, winning the league, getting into the Football League, getting to third round of the FA Cup for the first time, and now playing a Premier League side competitively for the first time. ‘It’s another step on the march to getting back to where we feel we can justify and support ourselves,’ he said. ‘For me, that’s the Championship. For a fan-owned club to get to the Championship and survive and challenge for the Premier League, that would be as big an achievement as going from Combined Counties to Football League. What has happened is incredible in the proper grammatical sense of the word. It is unbelievable.’ AFC Wimbledon were formed in 2002 after Wimbledon's move to Milton Keynes . AFC Wimbledon line up for the first time after staging trials at Wimbledon Common . The hurt of having their club wrested from them to Milton Keynes still leaves a scar. ‘I cannot bring myself scarcely to mention the name Milton Keynes, let alone go there,’ said Samuelson. ‘But what I find really helpful is to channel the anger I still feel about that injustice into something positive. There’s no point seeking schadenfreude. I try not to look at their results, try not to care. I just try to make sure we get the benefit of all that energy that needs to go somewhere.’ Perhaps the healing began this season when Wimbledon beat Milton Keynes in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy, their first victory over the franchise club in three attempts. ‘When we beat Milton Keynes that meant so much to me,’ said manager Ardley. ‘I went in the dressing room after the game and screamed at the top of my voice. And some of players were like: “Wow! The gaffer’s normally calm.” But I wanted to be that person who said: “There you go guys; all that hurt.” I wanted to be that person and I was. And I wanted to get to the FA Cup third round and get a good draw and I’m so proud because everyone’s buzzing.’ The real battles are in League Two, where 16st Adebayo Akinfenwa is their iconic striker, a cult figure in the video game FIFA 15, while Dannie Bulman, 35, provides the midfield leadership. Ardley is Wimbledon to the core. He joined the club as an 11-year-old, was a 16-year-old YTS trainee when they won the FA Cup and progressed to play in a Premier League side who consistently finished in the top eight. He vividly recalls the club’s most famous day. ‘I remember that Liverpool team, I was a follower of them, it was breath-taking, the football they played and the players they had. And to get little old Wimbledon playing them on a big pitch at Wembley and them going for the Double ... it probably was and always will be the biggest shock in the FA Cup you’ll see.’ Sean Rigg  celebrates during AFC Wimbledon's victory over MK Dons in the St Johnstone's Paint Trophy . AFC Wimbledon will rely on cult hero Adebayo Akinfenwa when they come up against Liverpool . (L-R) Jordan Henderson, Lucas Leiva and Steven Gerrard train ahead of their FA Cup third round clash . Ardley only left when the old club terminated his contract due to financial problems. ‘On my first day I walked in fresh out of school and was given a paint pot and got told to paint the physio room. And you think: “I’m here to play football.” You don’t say it, but you think it. And then the first-team players came in and kicked the paint pot on the floor and said: “You’d better pick that up.” ‘I thought: “What have a let myself in for?” If you looked at someone the wrong way you could get taken into a room and given a little bit of a showing or what not. It was a little bit of a clump, knocked around a bit. And if you kept quiet about it you’d get a pat on the back few days later and someone would say: “You’ll do for us, you haven’t gone crying to the teacher, so to speak.” ‘If [manager] Bobby Gould caught you with your hands in your pockets you would have to do 60-second laps. There were a lot of people who looked at that and said: “This is not for me.” ’ Yet there was more to Wimbledon. In an 11-year spell, between 1986 and 1997, they finished in the top eight of the old First Division and the new Premier League six times. The lowest they finished was 14th. The new Wimbledon are very different. They are owned by supporters and community involvement is at the heart of the club. And having been scarred by the debts and mixed motives of investors in the past, Wimbledon run a balanced budget and do not pay huge wages. Ardley admits he wondered what he let himself in for when he first joined Wimbledon as a player . The AFC Wimbledon boss sees a new stadium as essential to getting the club in the Championship . A significant break with the past is that the long ball is not Ardley’s style. ‘I don’t want Route One fighting football,’ said Ardley. ‘I have to find the right balance to make sure we have enough steel and strength about us to cope with the demands of the league and at the same time have a bit of philosophy when we’ve got that the ball. We’re certainly not long ball.’ A return to their Plough Lane roots for Wimbledon AFC would complete the circle for Ardley. ‘A new stadium takes us to a whole new level, with the players you can attract, players you can afford,’ he said. ‘If we have aspirations of becoming a Championship club eventually, it’s a must. We drove past the site the other day on our way to give out presents at St George’s Hospital and, without being disrespectful, it’s a bit of an eyesore. It looks tired, it looks dated. And if you regenerate that and make it a real hub of sport, how much better would that look?’","AFC Wimbledon face Liverpool in the FA Cup third round on Monday .
