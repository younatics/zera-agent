"(CNN) -- I first became involved with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) five years ago, when I traveled to Tanzania to take photographs and film a documentary about EGPAF's work in Africa. Today, I continue to be inspired by the mothers, health workers, volunteers and government officials I met during my travels who remain dedicated to stopping this deadly virus from infecting another generation. But more than an inspiration, my trip to Tanzania was an education. I learned that not only is pediatric HIV almost 100% preventable, but that we have tools available to achieve an AIDS-free generation within this lifetime. By giving an HIV-positive pregnant woman access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, we can almost ensure that her baby will be born and remain HIV-free. Sadly, many of the women and children who need these crucial services still don't receive them. According to the 2013 UNAIDS Global Report, 700 children are infected with HIV every day. Most contract the virus from their mothers during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. And only one third of those children currently have access to the medications that will help them remain healthy. Another UNAIDS report from 2012 says without ART, half of all HIV-positive children won't live past the age of 2 and 80% of them will die before their 5th birthday. While these numbers are staggering, so is progress that has been made since Elizabeth Glaser first started her fight to help children with pediatric HIV more than 25 years ago. Pediatric HIV has been virtually eliminated in the United States and Europe and thanks to programs such as the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), we are closer than ever before to ending pediatric HIV in Africa and other resource-limited regions around the world. We can see evidence of PEPFAR's positive impact firsthand in stories like that of Tatu Msangi, a woman I met during my trip to Tanzania. Tatu discovered she was HIV-positive after becoming pregnant with her daughter, Faith, in 2004 -- when HIV/AIDS was killing millions of people each year and resources to treat and prevent the virus in Africa were very limited. But, thanks to PEPFAR, Tatu received the medicine she needed to prevent transmitting HIV to her child. Today, almost 10 years later, Faith is happy, healthy and HIV-negative. Tatu was so inspired by PEPFAR and EGPAF's work to help HIV-positive mothers and their children that she went back to school to become a nurse and now works at a clinic in Kilimanjaro. This past June, Tatu and Faith joined U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Washington, DC to celebrate the fact that since PEPFAR began in 2003, 1 million babies, just like Faith, have been born HIV-free. Preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV is the first step toward achieving an AIDS-free generation. I encourage everyone to take a few moments out of your day to learn more about the fight for an AIDS-free future. Tweet, post to Facebook, or even just talk to someone you know about pediatric HIV and what each of us can do to make sure that this generation is the last one to face this devastating epidemic.","Photographer Nigel Barker is an ambassador for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation .

"New York (CNN) -- The 10 Haitian students from Sts. Joachim and Anne's School in New York's Queens Village boarded the yellow school bus thinking they were headed to the library on a special school trip. When they got off, however, it wasn't at a library but at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. It was the beginning of a day full of surprises. The children, ages 7 to 13, are survivors of the catastrophic Haitian earthquake of January 2010. Several of them lost friends and family and they themselves became refugees. They all have gone through trauma and have painful memories. But Wednesday was a day to put those memories aside, if even for a short while, and to enjoy a baseball game and other good times provided by the New York Yankees. Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter hustled up the dugout steps and greeted the kids, ""How you doing? I'm Derek Jeter. Nice to meet you."" ""Young lady how are you?"" asked Yankee manager Joe Girardi. The Yankees call this HOPE Week. It stands for Helping Others Preserve and Excel, an initiative in which the Yankees reach out to an individual, family or organization they think is ""worthy of recognition and support."" This is the third year for the charity event. ""It's an opportunity for us to give back, but in the long run, we're the ones who are truly blessed by these people"" Girardi told CNN. The kids were treated to seeing the baseball superstars take their batting practice before the game. One of the children, Charles, got to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. After the game, first baseman Jorge Posada had the students race around the infield bases before they boarded a double-decker tour bus along with a few of the Yankees for a tour of the city. Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia said of the kids on the tour, ""Being able to hang out with them going on a bus tour in New York City, I think is pretty cool and I've never done it. The kids are excited, so we are excited."" When the kids got to midtown Manhattan, everybody piled out of the bus and into the lobby of the Empire State Building for the ceremonial lighting of building, followed by a skyline view from the 86th floor observatory. Nine-year-old Frantz Blues summed it up pretty well when he said, ""New York is really, really big."" From there it was onto a pizzeria, where Derek Jeter boarded the bus with some pies. He knew the kids were glad to see him, but not because of his 3,000-plus hits: ""It's fun, but you know I think the kids are more happy with the pizza than me showing up."" The children's principal, Linda Freebes, acknowledged what the day meant for the youngsters: ""I'm sure that they will treasure this memory forever. And all the unhappiness they had, this is a glimmer of sunshine and hope in their lives.""","A group of Haitian children are surprised with a trip to a Yankee ball game .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate Wednesday passed legislation meant to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Mobile phones are one of the technologies that did not exist when the original FISA law was written. The vote was 69-28. Below, CNN's National Security Producer Pam Benson explains what is in the bill, why the bill is controversial, how the bill may affect Americans' civil liberties and why privacy advocates object to it. Question: What is the purpose of FISA and why is it being changed? Benson: FISA governs the way the United States gathers foreign intelligence through the interception of electronic communications. The law was enacted in 1978, partially in response to the intelligence community and other U.S. agencies spying on Vietnam anti-war protesters and other Americans. The FISA law requires court orders when the target of any eavesdropping is an American citizen or individual living in the U.S. Warrants are not necessary if the target is overseas.  Watch Bush call the bill 'long overdue' Â» . The law is considered outdated. New technologies such as e-mail, the Internet, cell phones and fiber optics have dramatically changed communications. The new technologies have raised legal issues that the original law did not address. For instance, the U.S. intelligence community can target phone calls of an Iraqi citizen overseas, but that person's call to someone in Pakistan might be routed through a telecommunications switch in the United States. Under the current law, a FISA warrant would be required since the communication is passing through the U.S. [Some say] the current law unnecessarily slows down U.S. intelligence officials as they track foreigners. The controversy over President Bush's warrantless domestic eavesdropping program also prompted calls for change in the FISA law. The so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program was ordered by the president after the 9/11 attacks. It allowed for spying on the communications between U.S. residents and people overseas if it was believed one of the parties was linked to terrorism. Telephone carriers now face lawsuits for assisting the government in eavesdropping on suspected terrorists after 9/11. The plaintiffs claim their privacy rights were violated when the companies provided communication records to the National Security Agency without a court warrant. Question: What are the key provisions in the FISA bill? Benson: The bill explicitly establishes FISA as the exclusive means for authorizing electronic surveillance; requires a court order for the surveillance of any targeted American, whether the person is in the United States or abroad; [and] requires a secret court set up to oversee FISA issues to sign off on provisions for removing the name of any American inadvertently captured in a communication with a foreign target. [It] prohibits reverse targeting, which is when intelligence officials eavesdrop on a foreigner's communications overseas as a means to spy on someone in the United States, and sets up a procedure for federal judges to determine whether a telecommunications company can be sued for providing the intelligence community access to its networks without a court order. Question: Under the proposed FISA bill, can Americans be spied on without a court warrant? Are their civil liberties protected? Benson: Under the new revised law, a warrant is required to spy on an American, including, for the first time, Americans who are abroad. If the intelligence community should unintentionally intercept a phone call or an e-mail involving an American, the agency involved must get a warrant if the person is of interest or take steps to erase that person's name from any report. The court will annually review procedures for protecting communications, but it will not oversee individual cases. Opponents claim this represents minimal court oversight and enables the government to spy on innocent Americans' phone calls and e-mails. The bill states that domestic electronic surveillance is authorized exclusively by the provisions of FISA. This is an effort to prevent the president from secretly authorizing warrantless eavesdropping, which some lawmakers and civil rights groups claim violates the public's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. However, the bill does not address President George Bush's claim that he has Article 2 constitutional authority as the commander-in-chief to order such activity during times of war. Question: Will telecommunications firms be prosecuted for helping the intelligence community conduct no-warrant surveillance of Americans? Benson: Although the Bush administration had wanted the telephone providers who cooperated with the surveillance program to receive outright retroactive immunity, this bill sets up a process for judicial review. A U.S. District Court judge hearing a pending case will determine whether the telecommunications provider received from the government letters which indicated the president had authorized the warrantless surveillance and that the program was considered lawful. If so, the lawsuit will be thrown out. Opponents argue this is a sham and say that the telecommunications are essentially being granted retroactive immunity because Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence (DNI), testified at a congressional hearing that all of the telephone carriers did receive government certifications. Some Republican supporters have called this process a ""formality"" and even Democratic proponents indicate it is likely that most, if not all, of the cases against the telephone companies will be dismissed. Question: Will there be periodic reviews of the law? Benson: The new law expires in 2012, enabling the next administration to review the program. In the meantime, the attorney general, the DNI and the inspectors general of the major intelligence agencies must provide periodic reviews of the surveillance program. The bill also requires the inspectors general of the agencies involved in the president's warrantless surveillance program to conduct a comprehensive review and issue an unclassified report to Congress within one year.","NEW: Senate votes 69-28 to update of to intelligence law Wednesday .

"(EW.com) -- Three weeks ago, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling conjured an Internet frenzy when she and Warner Bros. announced that a new adaptation of her book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a popular supplement to her Potter series was in the works. The announcement revealed that the film will be set in the same wizarding world as Harry Potter â but follow magizoologist Newt Scamander, a professor of magical creatures, and take place 70 years before Harry's journey began. EW caught up with David Heyman, who produced all eight of the original Harry Potter films, on the red carpet of his latest spectacle, Gravity (which reunited him with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban director Alfonso Cuaron), and asked him to dish about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them â or ""Fantastic Beasts"" as he called it for short. Heyman, who confirmed that he will be producing the film, said that Rowling hasn't turned in a finished script just yet, but that ""Jo is at work"" and tremendously excited about the project. ""She's not doing it for any other reason other than she loves the world and she had a story that she wanted to tell,"" he said. ""It's incredibly exciting,"" he continued. ""She doesn't have to go back to this world, but something pulled her back. This is not Harry Potter. This is not Harry, Ron, and Hermione. This is a separate story within a universe related to the Potter universe."" EW: J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. announce new movie franchise set in wizarding world . When asked about which creatures we might see in the film â you better believe I brought up quintapeds and lethifolds â Heyman demured. ""We follow Newt on his adventures,"" he said, grinning. The producer said Rowling has no shortage of plot ideas for Fantastic Beasts because she knows Newt Scamander's history so thoroughly â after all, she created him. ""The fact that she's going to this world means there are stories to tell,"" he said. ""When I was doing the Harry Potters, what was clear to me is that Jo's knowledge of this world is infinite. What you read in the books was just the surface of her knowledge. She had notebook upon notebook of stuff. I would call her and say, 'What's the sixth use of dragon's blood?' and she'd have it at her fingertips."" ""In the fifth film, I think it was, we had the Black family tree,"" he recalled. ""I called her, and literally 20 minutes later I receive this family tree, via fax in those days, with a hundred names and about six generations with birthdays, death dates, marriages, all figured out. She knew it."" So let's hope she's weaving all that knowledge into another truly magical tale â or even (dare we dream?) a whole series of them. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- A former vice president of product development at Tiffany & Co. was sentenced Monday in U.S. Federal Court in Manhattan to one year and one day in prison for stealing jewelry valued at more than $2 million from the luxury brand, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office. Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun, 47, pleaded guilty on July 26 to one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. Lederhaas-Okun admitted to stealing more than 165 pieces of jewelry, including diamond bracelets, earrings, rings and pendants, between November 2012 and February. She admitted to stealing jewelry starting as far back as 2005, according to a sentencing memo obtained by CNN. Lederhaas-Okun abused her position and authority at the company to check out the merchandise and resell the pieces for her own profit to a leading international buyer and reseller of jewelry with an office in Midtown Manhattan, according to the release. In addition to the prison term, Lederhaas-Okun of Darien, Connecticut, was also sentenced to one year of supervised release. She was also ordered to forfeit $2.1 million and to pay $2.2 million in restitution. ""With today's sentence, Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun has learned the price she must pay for stealing millions of dollars' worth of fine jewelry from her employer -- loss of her liberty and forfeiture of her ill-gotten gains,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the release. According to the release, a relative and an unnamed friend assisted Lederhaas-Okun in the jewelry transactions. In a federal complaint filed in July, the relative was identified as her husband. More than 75 checks were made to Lederhaas-Okun and her husband, ranging from $7,525 to $47,400, the complaint said. The former jewelry executive was terminated by Tiffany & Co. in February. The day after her termination, Tiffany's conducted an inventory review and discovered the jewelry was missing. Lederhaas-Okun continuously made false statements about what happened to the merchandise. According to the release, Lederhaas-Okun said she checked out the jewelry in anticipation of creating a PowerPoint presentation on her computer for her supervisor. According to the release, her supervisor was unaware of any presentation, and no draft presentation was found on her computer. In addition, Lederhaas-Okun claimed the jewelry could be found in a white envelope in her office, but a search of her office did not produce the envelope, according to the release. Tiffany's did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. CNN's Allison Malloy and Gabrielle Rodman contributed to this report.","Former Tiffany's vice president sentenced to 366 days in prison for theft .

"The Hague, Netherlands (CNN) -- The war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic was suspended until further notice Thursday over the prosecution's failure to disclose some evidence against Mladic, court spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic said. The abrupt suspension came only a day after the long-awaited trial began. Prosecutors had been planning to focus Thursday on the massacre of up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, for which they accuse Mladic of responsibility. But the defense called for a halt to the trial after it found that the prosecution had not shown it all the evidence against Mladic. Under court rules, the defense has a right to study prosecution evidence before a trial begins. It was not clear what the evidence was or how long the delay would last, but it could be a matter of weeks. Lawyers will meet the judge Thursday afternoon to discuss how to proceed. The prosecution says that it did not show the defense all of its evidence, an apparent error that became evident when prosecutors began to lay out their case Wednesday. Mladic is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia. The former general showed no remorse as his war crimes trial opened Wednesday, at one point even appearing to threaten victims in the court. He drew his hand across his neck as if cutting a throat while staring at victims of the war that introduced the phrase ""ethnic cleansing."" At other times, the man accused of being ""the Butcher of Bosnia"" stared at them, fire in his eyes, and he once growled at the survivors. The 70-year-old former Bosnian Serb general has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war. His trial is taking place at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands, a special court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war. On Wednesday, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He aimed to show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, who were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Sexual violence was a weapon of war, Groome said, describing a woman who said she had been raped more than 50 times, and women who were forced by Bosnian Serb forces to perform sex acts on members of their own families. Prosecutors will use survivor testimonies and video clips to make their case at a trial that is likely to last for months or years. Among those in the courtroom were the families of Srebrenica victims. ""Victims have waited nearly two decades to see Ratko Mladic in the dock,"" Param-Preet Singh, senior counsel in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, said ahead of the trial. ""His trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice."" 2011: Ratko Mladic captured . Mladic's trial began after a landmark war crimes ruling last month, when another international tribunal found former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone's notoriously brutal civil war. Taylor got a final chance to address his court Wednesday as Mladic's trial opened, and he said he was ""saddened"" by a verdict that he portrayed as unfair. ""Both trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account, no matter how senior their position,"" Human Rights Watch said. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Europe's highest-ranking war crimes suspect was discovered standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment, according to a government minister. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands. But from day one in custody, he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies. Before the trial that started Wednesday, he also drew a finger across his throat in court, a gesture aimed at some of the Srebrenica widows. At other times, he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea. He has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health. In July 1995, Mladic was in command of the Bosnian Serb army and led his soldiers into the town of Srebrenica. In the days that followed, the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys. Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as ""one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer."" In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia's battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia's Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Robertson: Bosnia's future is tied to justice . Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo's ill-prepared residents in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished. Some observers conjured images of Sarajevo in describing Syrian attacks on the besieged city of Homs earlier this year. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed.

"(EW.com) -- Pay no attention to the title: Martin Scorsese's new shoot-the-works epic ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" isn't about rapacious stockbrokers or shady financial shenanigans. It's about drugs. Lots and lots of drugs. From its twisted opening scene, where a floor of coked-up boiler-room meatheads toss dwarfs for bacchanalian sport, the feverishly paced film is hell-bent on making the audience feel like they just snorted a Belushian mountain of blow. You can practically feel your teeth grinding to dust. As with any high, though, it also doesn't know when to stop. From 'Hustle' to 'Mr. Banks,' the season's films make music into magic . Based on Wall Street evil genius Jordan Belfort's 2007 memoir about getting insanely rich from conning investors, ""Wolf"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral Horatio Alger with a rolled C-note up his nose. He gives a hell of a performance that's electrifyingly loose, perversely funny, and dripping with jerk charisma. Like Ray Liotta in ""GoodFellas,"" DiCaprio's character explains through wise-guy voice-overs how he pulled off one of the most brazen and boneheaded scams in history. The film chronicles Belfort's improbable ascent from eager brokerage-house trainee (under the gonzo tutelage of a scene-stealing Matthew McConaughey) to Black Monday casualty to silver-tongued swindler, cold-calling suckers to peddle them worthless stocks out of a former auto-body garage. Oscar Too-Due List: Which never-nominated actors really deserve a nod? He proves to be such a born salesman that in no time he and his merry band of macho Bayside, Queens, goombahs (led by a terrific Jonah Hill as Belfort's bucktoothed loose-cannon sidekick) have more money than they know what to do with. So they blow it on Bond-villain yachts, trophy wives, and insane quantities of coke. Soon the firm becomes a millionaire-minting mecca, attracting both wannabe Gordon Gekkos and the attention of a hungry FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who drools over Belfort's nouveau-riche toys while vowing to bring the drug-fueled Caligula down. It says something about DiCaprio's oily charm that you almost want him to get away with it. As bad judgment and paranoia take hold and the high rollers get careless about stashing their loot in Swiss banks, ""Wolf's"" pace never stops panting. And you can't help but be amazed that it's the work of a 71-year-old. After five decades behind the camera, Scorsese still works with the frantic energy of a man who's got something to prove. But the director also has to know that his film could have used some trimming. Clocking in at just a minute under three hours, ""Wolf"" starts to repeat itself as we're given one scene after another of men behaving badly. If you're feeling charitable, you could argue that the movie's running time is meant to mirror its theme of excess. Then again, you could also say that it's just way too long. There's a reason roller-coaster rides last for only a few minutes. Still, Scorsese has pulled off something tricky with ""Wolf"": He's given us a thrilling cautionary tale about a guy who never for a second seems the slightest bit sorry for what he's done.

"(CNN) -- A wreck involving two trains, one of which was carrying crude oil, sparked a large fire Monday that sent huge flames and dangerous smoke into the sky, North Dakota authorities said. There were no reports of injuries from the accident, said Sgt. Tara Morris with the Cass County Sheriff's Office, but ""with the oil on fire there are hazardous conditions, and we are directing all people in the area to shelter in-place and stay indoors."" Firefighters will be forced to let the fire burn out, which may take as long as 12 hours from the time of the accident (2:12 p.m. CT), because they cannot get close enough to the flames, she told CNN. The incident occurred one mile west of Casselton, a town of 2,300 residents about 25 miles west of Fargo. Huge plumes of smoke could be seen in Fargo, Morris said. The sheriff's office advised all residents in Casselton and two nearby townships to evacuate because the winds were shifting due to a high-pressure system. A Red Cross shelter in Fargo was available, the sheriff's office said. Morris said it was unclear how the accident happened and authorities are trying to determine whether one of the trains derailed before they collided. About 10 of the cars on the train carrying oil were fully engulfed in flames. At least a dozen firefighters are involved, she said. An official with the Federal Railroad Administration said it will support a National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the accident. CNN's Aaron Cooper and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","NEW: Sheriff urges residents to leave town because winds are expected to shift .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The wet tissues pile up as pollen from trees swirls in the air, clogging noses and tickling eyes without relief. This is what parts of March, April and May are like for many Americans. The earlier in the allergy season you seek treatment, the better, experts say. Some years are worse than others, and pollen forecasters try to keep the public up to date on how the season progresses. So, how do we know when it's the ""worst in years""? There are no nationwide government pollen trackers, but private companies do monitoring. SDI Health LLC, the company that runs the popular Web site pollen.com, has 480 pollen monitoring stations in the United States, said Gerry Kress, the company's owner. ""We're forecasting a heavier season this year than last year,"" he said. Pollen.com's national pollen reports and forecasts are based on the pollen count and the number of people affected by pollen allergies in different areas of the country, Kress said.  See map of worst U.S. cities for allergies Â» . SDI takes into account the weather patterns and the types of pollen in each area to predict the number of people who will suffer from pollen allergies from February 1 to May 31.  How much do you know about allergies? Take the quiz Â» . While there may be more allergy sufferers generally in the United States, different areas will have distinct experiences. The Northeast, because of the high population and the types of plants that grow there, is usually the strongest allergy area, and it will likely have a heavier season than last year, SDI predicts. A large area from Minneapolis, Minnesota, all the way to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will also be stronger, as will areas from Louisiana to South Carolina, Kress said. The area around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Wilmington, Delaware, and New York will be about the same as last year. The West Coast, Texas, and many Southern states, on the other hand, will have fewer than or about the same number of allergy sufferers as last year, he said. Other pollen analysts have their own ways of characterizing and forecasting the season. Allergy sufferers in the Southeast may have a particularly tough season this year, said Dr. Stanley Fineman, an allergist with the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic. That's because there were high tree pollen counts in February, followed by a low pollen count during several weeks of colder weather, and now there's a lot of pollen again, he said. Patients may experience a priming effect from this, he said. Having been exposed early in the season, then re-exposed after a period of low pollen, people's sensitivity may be heightened, and they will have a more drastic, violent response to this new round of pollen. Then there's the role of the economy. Dr. Jeffery Adelglass and his group at the Allergy Testing & Treatment Center in Plano, Texas, predict a mild to moderate season in urban areas such as Dallas, Texas. If people drive less to save gas money, that would lower the level of pollution, which exacerbates allergies, he said. ""As the economy picks up, we expect to see a return of the runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing and wheezing that we're accustomed to,"" Adelglass said. People who live in rural areas will still experience quite a bit of pollen, he said. The pollen spreads further with the wind when there's nothing to block it, such as city buildings. How is pollen measured? Many experts use a Rotorod, a special machine manufactured by SDI that has small rods that collect pollen throughout a given 24 hours. Then, a technician will take the rods off to analyze the pollen. The pollen count reported on the Web site atlantaallergy.com through  Rotorod measurements is how many pollen grains there are per cubic meter of air in 24 hours, Fineman said. A low reading is 0 to 30, moderate is 31 to 60, high is 61 to 120 and extremely high is anything over 121, Fineman said. This week got off to a particularly bad start for Atlanta allergy sufferers, with Monday at 192, Tuesday at 618, and Wednesday at 1063, according to Fineman's group's scale. By comparison, in 2008, the corresponding days had pollen counts of 10, 17 and 214, respectively. Thursday morning, the city experienced heavy rain, and the pollen count dropped to 78. One offensive variety is pine pollen, which Atlanta and other Southeastern U.S. residents know well as the green stuff on their cars every year. Major pollens also include birch, oak, sweetgum and sycamore. But even relatively low pollen counts cause some people to suffer, he said. People seem to be having problems earlier in the season because of a warming trend, which makes the trees pollinate earlier, he said. In the Dallas area, Adelglass's group also uses a Rotorod. Grass pollen levels are beginning to elevate and will get worse in April and May, he said, while right now it's the trees -- juniper, maple and elm, he said. Thursday, the highest levels of pollen in the Dallas area were from maple at 682 grains per cubic meter, according to his group's measurements. See pollen counts for the Dallas-Fort Worth-Plano area . Pollen levels tend to drop on rainy days, but rain also waters the grass, he said. Treating the sniffles . About 17.6 million Americans have diagnosed allergic rhinitis, also called hay fever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. SDI data show that about 20 million people suffered from allergies across the country in the week ending March 20, a slight decrease compared with the same week last year. A variety of antihistamines are available over the counter. A recent survey by the American Pharmacists Association of 1,000 pharmacists found that for adult antihistamines, 32 percent of recommendations in a week were for Claritin, 28 percent were for Zyrtec and 25 percent were for Benadryl. For multisymptom allergy and hay fever products, 35 percent of recommendations in a week were for Claritin-D, 26 percent were for Zyrtec-D and 10 percent were for Actifed Cold & Allergy. The survey had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Sometimes allergy patients need additional help. Allergists can prescribe stronger prescription medications and nasal sprays. They may also do a skin test to see exactly which kinds of pollen, dust or even pets may be causing symptoms. Allergy shots, which introduce small amounts of allergens into the body to build tolerance, are recommended for people with severe symptoms, especially those that lead to sinus infections, or people who have occupational concerns about taking traditional medications, Adelglass said. ""I wouldn't like my airplane pilot to be taking sedating antihistamines. I wouldn't like my chef to be sneezing in my soup. I would like my policeman wide awake at night, not taking medicines that impair his judgment and alertness, "" he said. The earlier in the season people get treatment for allergies, the better off they will be, Adelglass said. ""Once their system gets primed, it only goes from bad to worse,"" he said.

"London (CNN) -- Britain's late TV presenter and radio host Jimmy Savile sexually abused hundreds of people and carried out more than 30 rapes, police said Friday, as they unveiled a report exposing ""vast, predatory and opportunistic"" abuses across six decades. Nearly three-quarters of his victims were children, the report said, with the youngest only 8 years old. Most but not all were female. Read more: Victim tells of abuse at hands of Savile . Since the inquiry was launched three months ago, about 600 people have come forward to provide information, 450 relating to Savile, London's Metropolitan Police said. From this, 214 crimes have been recorded, including 34 of rape or penetration, across the country. The earliest claim against Savile, who was still a household name when he died in 2011, dates from 1955 and the latest from 2009, when he was in his 80s. Savile used his celebrity to ""hide in plain sight"" as he opportunistically preyed on the children and young people with whom he came into contact as he presented BBC children's show ""Jim'll Fix It"" and music show ""Top of the Pops,"" the report said. Dozens of offenses on BBC premises have been reported across a 40-year span between 1965 and 2006 -- the last at the final recording of ""Top of the Pops."" Who was Jimmy Savile? Fifty allegations against Savile relate to hospital premises, including hospices, the report said. Another 14 relate to schools, including a reform school he visited regularly between 1970 and 1978. The scale of his abuse is believed to be unprecedented in the UK, it said. The report by London's Metropolitan Police and a child protection charity, the NSPCC, titled ""Giving Victims a Voice,"" brings to a close a sordid chapter. Police set up Operation Yewtree to investigate sexual abuse claims after a documentary by broadcaster ITV in October unleashed a flood of allegations against the star, who before that was seen as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity. Read more: How celebrity child sex scandal has rocked the BBC . The investigation had three strands: one involving complaints against Savile alone, another termed ""Savile and others"" and a third involving only others. The publication of the report ends the first strand of the inquiry. However, investigations continue into allegations made against the other suspects, some linked to Savile and others not. A number of arrests have been made. ""It paints a stark picture emphasizing the tragic consequences of when vulnerability and power collide,"" Commander Peter Spindler, of the Metropolitan Police, said of the report. Revealed: Disgraced TV star's charm offensive with ex-PM Margaret Thatcher . ""Savile's offending footprint was vast, predatory and opportunistic. He cannot face justice today but we hope this report gives some comfort to his hundreds of victims, they have been listened to and taken seriously. We must use the learning from these shocking events to prevent other children and vulnerable adults being abused in the future. They will get a voice."" The BBC, whose reputation has been tainted by the affair, said it would continue to work with police to investigate the claims. ""The police report into Jimmy Savile contains shocking revelations,"" a statement said. ""As we have made clear, the BBC is appalled that some of the offences were committed on its premises. We would like to restate our sincere apology to the victims of these crimes."" The BBC set up three inquiries of its own amid questions about how Savile's abuses went undetected for so long. One is looking at the culture and practices within the BBC and another at its handling of past sexual harassment claims. The third, which reported on the broadcaster's decision to drop a program investigating allegations Savile in late 2011, slammed senior management as ""completely incapable"" of dealing with the crisis that erupted. The BBC's botched handling of the affair forced the director general, George Entwistle, to resign. The UK Department of Health, which is conducting its own investigation into the access Savile had to hospitals and other institutions, said the police report ""highlights the shocking scale of offending by Jimmy Savile over five decades and shows the need to learn lessons from his crimes."" With the police review concluded, civil claims are likely to be brought as some victims seek compensation for the abuse they suffered at Savile's hands. About 73% of them were younger than 18 when they were targeted. Four-fifths of the victims were girls and women, the report said. The majority of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 at the time of the abuse, and the oldest was 47. Of the 34 reported offenses of rape or penetration, 26 victims were female and eight were male, police said. ""There is no clear evidence of Savile operating within a paedophile ring although whether he was part of an informal network is part of the continuing investigation,"" the report added. Most of the alleged offenses were committed around the city of Leeds, where Savile lived, and in London, where he worked. The peak of offending reported to police was between 1966 and 1976, when Savile was between 40 and 50 years old. Separately, a review by the Crown Prosecution Service was critical of the decision by two police forces not to file charges against Savile after investigating four separate allegations of sexual abuse. In 2007 and 2008 Surrey Police investigated three complaints that he had engaged in sexual behavior with young girls. During the same period, Sussex Police investigated a complaint by a young woman. Alison Levitt, chief legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said police were too cautious in their approach and should have asked more questions to push inquiries forward. The alleged victims and their accounts were treated ""with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required,"" she said. ""Having spoken to the victims I have been driven to conclude that had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach a prosecution might have been possible."" Peter Watt, director of child protection advice for the NSPCC, said the scale of Savile's abuse ""simply beggared belief."" But, he added, one positive is that nearly 800 additional children have been protected from abuse because the publicity around the Savile case has encouraged people to call the charity's helpline. For many, it's the first time they've spoken out about abuse, he said. ""We are optimistic that this signals a watershed moment for child protection in this country. We must seize the opportunity if we are to make a lasting change,"" he said. The report's authors acknowledge that it is too late to act on the claims against Savile, but they say the investigation met ""the need for hundreds of victims to have official recognition of the serious crimes they have suffered and to know they have been taken seriously."" Millions of Britons who grew up watching Savile on TV's ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Jim'll Fix It"" were shocked by the fall from grace of an entertainer who'd been awarded knighthoods by Queen Elizabeth II and the late Pope John Paul II for his charitable work. Savile died in October 2011 at age 84, soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia. His death was followed by a series of glowing tributes, including BBC specials. CNN's Jonathan Wald and Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","Savile used his celebrity to ""hide in plain sight"" and targeted the vulnerable, police say .

"(CNN) -- The 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded Monday to Sir John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for work that revolutionized the understanding of how cells and organisms develop. The Nobel Assembly's announcement at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, is the first for what will be a series of prizes announced this week. The Norwegian Nobel committee will announce the most anticipated of the annual honors -- the Nobel Peace Prize -- on Friday in Oslo, Norway. Gurdon, 79, of Dippenhall, England, and Yamanaka, 50, of Osaka, Japan, share the prize jointly for their discovery that ""mature, specialised cells can be reprogrammed to become immature cells capable of developing into all tissues of the body,"" according to the Nobel Assembly, which consists of 50 professors at the Karolinska Institute. Gurdon discovered in 1962 that the cells are reversible in an experiment with an egg cell of a frog. Yamanaka discovered more than 40 years later how mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become immature stem cells ""that are able to develop into all types of cells in the body,"" the assembly said in a statement. ""These groundbreaking discoveries have completely changed our view of the development and cellular specialisation. We now understand that the mature cell does not have to be confined forever to its specialised state,"" the Nobel Assembly said. ""Textbooks have been rewritten and new research fields have been established. By reprogramming human cells, scientists have created new opportunities to study diseases and develop methods for diagnosis and therapy. Separated by more than 40 years, the work of Gurdon and Yamanaka led to a practical medical use for stem cell research that sidesteps the main argument by anti-abortion opponents. Now embryonic-like stem cells can be created in the laboratory from adult cells of the same organism, rather than using aborted fetuses or embryos, explained Visar Belegu, a stem cell researcher at the Hugo W. Moser Research Institute, part of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. Gurdon pioneered cloning through cell reproduction in a tadpole in 1962. In 2006, Yamanaka figured out how to reprogram mature cells so that they revert to their primitive state as ""induced pluripotent stem cells,"" or iPS cells, capable of developing into any part of the body, Belegu said. The Nobel Prize awarded Monday is the first for reprogramming cells, which scientists consider a major breakthrough in medical treatment. For example, a person suffering from Parkinson's disease can have personal iPS cells created from their blood, Belegu said. Those cells, which can be stored forever, can then be used to make new dopaminergic neurons that can be implanted to replace the cells damaged by the disease, he said. Read more: Nobel winner died days before award announced . The prizes given to Gurdon and Yamanaka were created in 1895 by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel honor work in physics, chemistry, literature and peace. Economics was added as a category in 1968, and the first prize awarded for economic sciences was in 1969. The monetary award that accompanies the Nobel Prize was lowered by the foundation this year by 20% from 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.5 million) to 8 million kronor ($1.2 million) because of the turbulence that has hit financial markets. On Tuesday, the committee will announce its award for achievement in physics. The next day, the winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be announced.

A date for the announcement of the literature prize has not been set. Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 101 times. The youngest recipient was Frederick G. Banting, who won in 1923 at the age of 32. The oldest medicine laureate was Peyton Rous, who was 87 years old when he was awarded the prize in 1966.

One-half of the prize in medicine went last year to Ralph Steinman, who died just days before the Nobel committee's announcement. Read more: IVF doctors, families celebrate creator's Nobel Prize . He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity. Steinman, a Canadian immunologist, died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 68. He used a kind of experimental dendritic cell-based immunotherapy he designed in his treatment, according to Rockefeller University, where he conducted his research. The Nobel committee was unaware of his death. Had it known, its own rules would have precluded him being selected as a winner. The other half of the prize went to Bruce Beutler and Jules A. Hoffman for discovering proteins that detect bacteria in the body and activate the immune system's first line of defense, a process known as innate immunity. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","The pair's work revolutionized the understanding of how cells and organisms develop .

"(CNN) -- Strategically located in the eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus has stood at one of the geographical, cultural and economic fault-lines between East and West since ancient times. In mythology, it was the birthplace of the Ancient Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, however the island has seen plenty of conflict throughout its history. When the Roman Empire divided in the 4th century, Cyprus came under the rule of the Byzantine Empire, developing the Hellenistic-Christian culture that remains the hallmark of Greek Cypriots today. But for the next 1,500 years, Cyprus remained at the mercy of successive waves of foreign invaders. During the Arab-Byzantine wars between the 7th and 11th century, Cyprus was subject to everything from small piratical raids to full-scale assaults in which thousands were slaughtered. The cycle of invasion and foreign rule continued to the mid-20th century as Cyprus fell variously to Richard I of England during the Third Crusade, the French under the Lusignans and the Venetians in the 15th century. Read more: What's Cyprus' connection to wine and the crusades? When the Ottoman Empire launched a successful full-scale attack in 1570, the scene was set for the divisions between Turkish and Greek Cypriots that exist on the Mediterranean island until today. Cyprus in the 20th century . By the time Cyprus came under British administration in 1878, Greek Cypriots were already agitating for union with Greece. A referendum in 1950 that was boycotted by Turkish Cypriots came out heavily in favor of union with Greece. Inter-communal violence fractured the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities after the country gained independence in 1960 and Turkey threatened to invade in a series of events that became a Cold War flashpoint in 1963 and 1964. Only the involvement of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson halted a Turkish invasion when he stated that the U.S. would not stand beside the NATO member in the event of a Soviet invasion of Turkish territory. In July 1974, the Greek military junta backed a coup d'etat in Cyprus. In response Turkey launched military intervention and by August it had landed thousands of troops and successfully partitioned the island along what is known as the ""Green Line."" Around 180,000 Greek Cypriots were forced south and some 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved into vacant properties in the northern Turkish occupied zone. Cyprus has existed as a de-facto divided country ever since and the events of the bloody summer of 1974 still dominate, not just the politics of the island, but Greco-Turkish relations in general. In 1983, the administration in northern Cyprus declared the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)""; an entity that is not recognized internationally by any country other than Turkey. Efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in failure. Attempts at reconciliation . In 2004, the Annan Plan, named after then U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, led to a referendum on reunification which was supported by Turkish Cypriots but rejected by the Greek side as being too heavily weighted in favor of the Turkish side. Despite this setback, Cypriots have been chipping away at partition. In 2008, Greek Cypriots demolished a key section of the barrier dividing the island's capital city Nicosia. Ledra Street -- a pedestrianized shopping area -- became the sixth crossing point on the divided island. At the time, the move was welcomed by then leader of the Turkish north Ferdi Sabit Soyer who was reported as calling it ""a positive development."" In 2004, Cyprus gained accession to the European Union which recognized its entry as a whole but suspended its legislation in the Turkish north, saying that ""these areas are outside of the customs and fiscal territory of the EU. But the EU notes that this does not affect the personal rights of Turkish Cypriots as EU citizens."" Economic ups and downs . Erratic growth in the 1990s -- largely due to fluctuations in tourist arrivals that reflected the island's political instability -- gave way to stronger growth. The Republic of Cyprus was first listed as an advanced economy by the International Monetary Fund in 2001. According to the IMF, Cypriots are among the most prosperous people in in the Mediterranean region with GDP per capita surpassing $26,000 in 2012. Economists say the turnaround was made all the more spectacular when partition is taken into account. After 1974, Cypriots in the south lost 65% of their hotel and tourist accommodation, 46% of its industrial sector and 56% of its mining and quarrying production. Read more on Cyprus: Betting on an off-shore gas bonanza . The Republic of Cyprus experienced rapid economic growth as it rebuilt its tourism industry after losing much of its infrastructure in the north after the invasion of 1974. In the north, however, the economy struggles. According to the CIA World Factbook, its GDP remains one quarter the size of the south and, with Turkey its primary public and private investor, its per capita GDP is around half that of the south. Meanwhile, Cyprus has successfully parlayed its role as a hub between East and West, rising as a significant business center in the region and becoming a haven for the assets of many wealthy Russians . In 2012, however, the growth story faltered and Russian bank accounts along with those of Cypriots and EU citizens with unsecured funds were badly hit. In a major economic crisis, Cypriot banks exposed to local property companies, the Greek Debt Crisis and hammered by a junk rating downgrade by international ratings agencies, Cypriot banks teetered on the verge of collapse. Only a Ã¢âÂ¬10 billion ($13.7 billion) EU bailout package, which included those losses for depositors, averted a financial disaster that threatened to drag the Mediterranean financial sector down with it. Ironically for partitioned Cyprus, the solution from the Eurogroup was to split the country's second largest bank - the Cyprus Popular Bank - into two banks; one ""bad"" which would be wound down over time and one ""good"" that would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus.

"(CNN) -- Since Kim Jong Il's death was announced on Monday, many people have marveled at the mourning scenes featured on North Korean state television, made viral on the Internet: North Koreans prostrate, weeping, hitting the ground. Many have asked whether the anguish is genuine. How could citizens mourn the passing of a totalitarian, such a gross abuser of human rights? The answer may be found in the human rights abuses themselves. It is a lamentable characteristic of totalitarian regimes that they often demand acts of deceit from those they oppress. Often it is a matter of simple survival. Those who hate the regime are obliged to demonstrate patriotism. To fail is to risk persecution. The only alternative is to flee, a choice made by tens of thousands of North Koreans in the past two decades. North Korea is unambiguously a totalitarian state. An estimated 200,000 North Koreans are held under brutal conditions in remote forced labor camps called kwan-li-so. Citizens are deprived of the freedom to speak, to dissent, to assemble, to seek remedies for grievances. Perhaps worst of all, there is no freedom from fear -- knowing that one can be imprisoned and tortured for minor trifles, sent to a kwan-li-so for being related to someone who displeased the state, or face a kangaroo court trial and possible public execution for a long list of political or economic ""crimes."" Even those who manage to keep out of trouble suffer from the government's deadly economic mismanagement and a ""military first"" policy: death from famines, widespread stunting in children from persistent malnutrition and untreated illness. It is difficult for many North Koreans to obtain adequate money or food without committing acts that are criminal or, given the crackdown on economic crimes, potentially suicidal. For many, to live in North Korea is to live in fear for one's very existence. In a context like this, there is no way to know what is genuine and what is theatrical. Totalitarianism and fear impair the idea of truth and the concept of objectivity. Rather than focusing on the televised tears of mourners for Kim Jong Il, we should be asking what needs to be done to ensure that someday North Korean television will show the tears of the fathers, mothers and children who have seen their relatives suffer or die because of the acts and omissions of Kim Jong Il and his father, Kim Il Sung, before him, during their unbroken 63-year rule. The ""Great Successor,"" Kim Jong Un, is still largely untested and doubts persist about whether he is really in charge in Pyongyang, but many hope that change is more likely now than a week ago. The international community should use this transition period to press the new leader to break from the criminal tyranny of the past and steer the country in a new direction. Kim Jong Un could start by taking note of calls made in the latest U.N. General Assembly resolution on North Korea, and allowing a visit by U.N. special rapporteurs. Change needs to come to North Korea, in one form or another. Those who will lead North Korea now, Kim Jong Un and the generals and ministers who control the state apparatus, need to remember that history has not been kind to tyrants. Totalitarian regimes can linger, and often do, but ultimately gross injustices are unsustainable and those who commit them can (and now often do) face the punishments of international justice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Sifton.","Many wonder if North Koreans' grief over the death of Kim Jong Il is genuine, says John Sifton .
Sifton: How could citizens mourn the passing of such a gross abuser of human rights?

""Representatives from major American distributors -- some of the Hollywood studios."" ""When we say it's a low budget film, people presume a couple of hundred thousand [dollars]. People can't figure out how it's possible. What Marc's achieved has left people astonished."" It was by advertising for volunteer zombies on social networking site Facebook, borrowing make-up from Hollywood blockbusters and teaching himself how to produce special effects that thrifty director Price was able to make the film for less than the price of a zombie DVD box set. ""The approach was to say to people, 'OK guys, we don't have any money, so bring your own equipment,' "" the the 30 year-old director told CNN. With help from a makeshift band of friends and volunteers, Price shot and edited the feature -- which ingeniously spins the zombie genre on its head by telling the story entirely from the zombie's perspective -- over a period of 18 months while working nights part-time as a booker for a taxi company. Online social networking was an invaluable tool in both generating buzz and cheaply sourcing the undead: ""We went on Facebook and MySpace and said 'Who wants to be a zombie?' "" Price told CNN. ""We managed to get 50 brilliantly made up zombies and stuff them into a living room."" In keeping with Price's beg and borrow approach, most of the zombie make-up in the make-up artists' cases was inherited from other movies. ""One of our make-up people came off 'X-Men 3,' so we were having the same latex that was put on Wolverine,"" he told CNN. Price says he came up with the idea to make a no-budget film because he realized that he and his friends would never be able to scrape together enough money to make even a low-budget film. ""A couple of friends were round a few years ago watching Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead,' recalls Price. ""And we were lamenting the fact that we could never make a zombie film -- we wouldn't be able to acquire a budget."" ""Then I just woke up before everyone else -- I was probably a bit hungover -- and I wondered if a zombie movie from a zombie's perspective had been done before."" The end result is ""Colin,"" a zombie film ""with a heart,"" Price says, shot using production values cribbed from endless re-watching of making-of featurettes and director's commentaries from his personal DVD collection. Zombie fan Web site zombiefriends.com called it ""as original, compelling and thought provoking as [George] Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead,'"" while horror magazine SCARS predicted it would ""revolutionize zombie cinema."" Price hopes that the film will generate enough interest to kick-start his career and allow him to make another film. ""Hopefully we'll be able to generate some interest and maybe try to get some kind of a budget for our next film -- maybe a bigger budget, Â£100, I don't know."" Price's cost-effective filmmaking may make him the envy of film executives sweating over whether their latest projects will break even, but even ""Colin"" may suffer at the market: ""In a strange way it's kind of counter-productive."" admits Price. ""Anyone involved in sales will say, 'Oh, it cost [$70], well how much do you expect us to pay for that?' but with the current economic climate it seems to be a great way to make movies."" So, what exactly did Price spend the famous $70 on? ""We bought a crowbar and a couple of tapes, and I think we got some tea and coffee as well -- not the expensive stuff either, the very basic kind,"" Price told CNN. ""Just to keep the zombies happy.""","Hollywood distributors have shown interest in zombie movie made for $70 .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince William is going back to school to prepare for when his father becomes the king. The Duke of Cambridge will attend a 10-week agriculture management course at the University of Cambridge starting in January, Kensington Palace announced Monday. What William, 31, learns during the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership could help him when he takes over responsibility for the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate that includes farmland, from Prince Charles. The seminars, lectures and meetings are a ""bespoke programme,"" meaning they are customized for William. ""The course has been designed to help provide The Duke with an understanding of contemporary issues affecting agricultural business and rural communities in the United Kingdom,"" the palace announcement said. Prince Charles is the patron of the Cambridge program, according to his website. Prince William's active military service came to an end in September after more than seven years. He is in the middle of a transitional year during which the Duke ""is considering a number of options for public service,"" Kensington Palace said.","Duke of Cambridge will attend a 10-week agriculture management course .

"(CNN) -- A Las Vegas cabbie who returned $300,000 left in his car has received a $10,000 reward from the poker player who lost the cash. But cab driver Gerardo Gamboa and his bosses on Friday still weren't revealing the name of the 28-year-old professional gambler, whom they earlier described as a famous figure on the poker circuit. ""It's good enough, I really appreciate it,"" Gamboa said about the reward. ""I wasn't expecting anything from the people I help. I never expect anything from the people I do good for, but I really appreciate it and that he appreciated what I'd done for him."" Before the gambler forgot his paper bag of cash in the cab's backseat, the poker player tipped the cabbie $5 on a $9.90 fare, Gamboa said. The brown paper bag, with wads of $100 bills inside, was discovered when Gamboa picked up his next fare. ""I really appreciate that because when somebody gives me $5 it means they appreciate my service,"" Gamboa said. When pressed for the high roller's name, however, Gamboa was, well, poker-faced himself. ""You know, he doesn't want me to mention his name, and I want to keep his privacy. He doesn't want any publicity,"" Gamboa said. The gambler and cabbie didn't say much during the two-mile ride Monday between hotel casinos in Vegas. ""We didn't have any conversation,"" Gamboa said. ""The only thing I told him was I take him where he was going. He didn't say hi or bye but he was an outstanding person, his attitude and everything, and how grateful he is since I found his money."" Meanwhile, Gamboa's native country of the Philippines is going to honor him. The office of President Benigno Aquino III called the cab company and said it will send a resolution of commendation to him, said Bill Shranko, chief operations officer at Yellow Checker Star. ""They are so proud of me, and I am so proud of what I have done,"" Gamboa said. His countrymen, family and employer hold that pride, he said, ""because I did the right thing and didn't think twice because I was not interested in those money that did not belong to me."" He has been surprised by the international attention. ""I have a lot of people calling me and telling me how honest I am. That's the way I am, that's the way my parents raised me when I was a kid,"" he said. Yellow Checker Star gave Gamboa a $1,000 reward, made him driver of the year, and gave him a steak dinner for two. His boss also gave him four paid days off. Those who make their living in the cab business are enjoying the moment: Cabbies are no longer maligned -- whether it's for running up the fare or refusing to stop when hailed on the street -- and are generating international good will, Gamboa's boss said. ""This is the best thing to happen to drivers worldwide because they don't have a good reputation and they work incredibly hard, 12 hours a day, and they do a tremendous job for tourism worldwide,"" Shranko said. On New Year's Eve -- one of the busiest days in the cabbie business -- Gamboa will be back at work on the Las Vegas Strip. That's where the cabbie picked up the forgetful gambler and proved his honesty in a town better known as sin city.","Poker player rewards Las Vegas cabbie who returned $300K left in backseat .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A political power struggle in Turkey has intensified with media reports of the suspension of more than 10 police commanders who were part of a corruption probe that targeted suspects close to the Turkish government. The suspensions came on Wednesday -- a day after a wide sweeping corruption probe led to the detention of high profile businessmen, bureaucrats and the sons of three cabinet ministers in dawn raids on Tuesday. Some post changes were partly due to ""administrative changes,"" and others were a result of ""investigation into allegations of misuse of office,"" according to a statement released by the Turkish police. The detentions on Tuesday were seen by many as part of a political reckoning in Turkey between Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and an Islamist movement believed to control portions of the judiciary and the police. The Gulen or Hizmet movement is led by Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric in self imposed exhile in Pennsylvania. The more than 50 people detained follow three separate investigations that have been ongoing for more than a year, according to a written statement released by the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office. ""Allegations in two of the investigations include public servants accepting bribery and misuse of office, and are generally under the Acting Against Construction and Coastal Law and include as suspects some government workers as well as civilians,"" the statement said. Erdogan has been critical of the raids which ensnared the sons of three cabinet ministers calling it a ""a very very dirty operation."" He believes the operations are being led by gangs with connections abroad. ""This has enthusiasts and planners abroad, and their extensions are in our country,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""I am not going to elaborate on who they are...you can guess who they are. As you know, there was a period started with Gezi protests, they didn't achieve their goals then...now they have taken a new step,"" he said referring to anti-government demonstrations that began late last May over plans to build a shopping mall in Gezi Park. Gulen has denied any involvement in the operations through a letter released by his legal representative in Turkey. ""The esteemed Fethullah Gulen has neither the smallest interest or concern for these investigations and the public servants who are carrying them out,"" said a statement issued by Gulen's lawyer on Thursday. The letter also responds to statements made by ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) members. ""We would like to openly express the following: 'waging war against the government,' 'starting an operation,' 'playing dirty games,' 'setting a trap,' or 'cornering' are only misdirection and are nothing more than imaginary malicious allegations,"" the statement said. The sons of Interior Minister Muammer Guler, Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan and Environment and Urban Planning Minister Erdogan Bayraktar were detained in the raids, according to local media. ""We will always respect the judiciary. The governments support will always be behind the judiciary,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc in a speech but that ""it is not right to convict the ministers or the other people named in this process in advance and to hold the government responsible."" Concerning the removal of police commanders form office, Arinc said, the chain of command of police procedure was not followed properly and resulted in the suspensions. There have been widespread press reports that the Interior Minister whose son was one of the detained in the raids, did not have prior knowdlege of the operation. ""Everyone was unaware of the operation started by the department head. You can keep the names a secret but share them with your supervisor. Is there anything more tragic than the interior minister learning his son has been detained from the press,"" said Arinc. Police carried out dawn raids in Istanbul and Ankara, according to local media, including the headquarters of Halkbank, a public bank that was alleged to play a role in sidelining sanctions on Iran in a gold for oil scheme last year. The head of a large construction company, Ali Agaoglu, was also brought in within the scope of the investigation though the CEO of the company later told Dogan News Agency that Agaoglu was not the focus of the investigation. Local commentators and analysts see the raids as the most public confrontation of the developing rift between Erdogan's ruling party and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric living in Pennsylvania whose loose network of followers are thought to hold key positions within the judiciary and police force. The Hizmet Movement, the name preferred by Gulen's followers, has in the past thrown its support behind the AKP led by Erdogan but the two have been publicly at odds over the last month. ""It was a forced marriage and now it's an ugly divorce,"" said Ahmet Sik, a journalist who wrote a book on Gulen and his influence within the judiciary and the police force. Last month Erdogan announced that he would shutdown college admission tutorial centers, a large source of revenue and recruitment opportunity for the Gulenists. On Monday, Hakan Sukur, an ex-footballer and Gulen follower, who was elected on the AKP party ticket to parliament resigned his membership in the party citing the governments stance on tutorial centers. ""This is all a judicial process, it would not be right for me to say anything until the outcome,"" Erdogan told reporters in Konya. But in a fiery speech he delivered there he said ""those who are receiving the support of financial circles and media cannot change the direction of this country. Those who are supported by dark circles from inside and outside the country cannot change the direction of Turkey."" Turkey is expected to hold local elections in 2014 and many analysts see this as a test of Erdogan's grip on power after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","Analysts say the detentions show rift within Erdogan's party .

"(CNN) -- Tuscaloosa and the University of Alabama paid tribute Saturday to first responders who aided neighbors staggered by the April 27 tornado that cut a swath through the city and killed 47 people. The Crimson Tide's first football game since the storm included a video, a musical program and a moment of silence for the victims, among them six university students. A houndstooth ribbon painted on the field symbolized legendary coach Paul ""Bear"" Bryant and a community still in grief. ""It was just wonderful. It really was,"" the Rev. Kelvin Croom said of the observances. ""It was a time to come together."" It was also a victorious day for No. 2 Alabama, which defeated Kent State University 48-7. No one could have predicted how much of what happened off the sidelines this year would mean to Saturday's contest. For the 101,000-plus fans who jammed the stands, the contest against the Golden Flashes was an opportunity to pause from rebuilding to enjoy the rites of autumn. Kent State sent four players in late July to help in the rebuilding and conduct a clinic for underprivileged kids. Since then, Alabama fans have expressed their appreciation. ""The ovation when we came on the field was pretty amazing,"" said Alan Ashby, assistant athletic director for communications at Kent State. ""The crowd was very supportive."" ""I am an Alabama fan. Now I'm (also) a Kent State fan. I saw the character and class of Kent State athletics,"" said Bob Johnson, executive director of Habitat for Humanity Tuscaloosa. Habitat and Alabama head coach Nick Saban's ""Nick's Kids Fund"" were instrumental in the building of a new home for a family displaced by the tornado. Saban, who played and coached at Kent State, wants to build 13 homes, to match the number of national championships the Crimson Tide has won. Last fall, Dana Dowling, her husband, Bob, and two teen children routinely yelled ""Roll Tide!"" from their home near Brookwood, a community east of Tuscaloosa. On April, 27, the front wall of the Dowlings' mobile home blew in. The bedroom was sucked out. The roof was left unattached. Now, only days away from moving into their new home, the Dowlings attended the game as guests of the opposing team and visited with new Kent State head coach Darrell Hazell. More than 100 University of Alabama students, including gymnasts, cheerleaders and football and basketball players, pitched in on the Dowling residence, too. ""When one brother is down, we are all down,"" said Croom, pastor of College Hill Baptist Church, largely destroyed by the tornado. ""I absolutely adored all of the guys,"" Dowling said of the Kent State and Alabama volunteers. Athletes just wanted to help, rather than be recognized, she said. ""Not many people get what we got,"" Dowling said of the new residence and outpouring of love and support. The family couldn't qualify for a conventional mortgage because Bob Dowling, who works as a disaster recovery technician, doesn't receive checks 52 weeks a year, she said. By going with Habitat, the Dowlings will go from a $600 monthly mortgage to less than $400. Kent State running back Jacquise Terry said he's become closer to the three teammates who went with him from Ohio to Tuscaloosa. ""There is more to life than football."" ""My heart is still going out to families,"" the Phenix City, Alabama, native told CNN Friday as he traveled on the team bus. The tragedy has touched almost everyone in the city. Alabama offensive tackle D.J. Fluker lost his apartment in the storm. He helped out with the Dowling home. Deep snapper Carson Tinker's girlfriend, Ashley Harrison, was killed. ""Everyone expects him to be in a negative place, sad and down,"" said Alabama associate athletics director Jeff Purinton. ""He thinks it's his responsibility to be positive."" A scholarship has been established in Harrison's memory. Visitors to Tuscaloosa still see scenes of devastation, though most of the debris has been removed. ""You make a turn and all of a sudden everything is gone,"" said Kent State's Ashby. ""No limbs. No trees. Houses off their foundations."" The Kent State athletes were heartened by the response they got during their visit, Ashby said. ""People came up and thanked us. One guy said, 'Roll Tide and go Flashes!' "" While the fact that Saban is a Kent State alum made a connection for the trip, ""We knew it was the right thing to do,"" Ashby said. Students on the Alabama campus agreed the game was an ideal time for the community to come together. ""I think that it means a return to normal,"" said Lance Ledbetter, a junior from Grant, Alabama. ""This whole community has been so upset about this tornado. Let's take our mind off rebuilding for a second and get back to rooting on Alabama football."" CNN's Reynolds Wolf contributed to this report.","Program includes video, moment of silence .

"Washington (CNN) -- For those who worked the Beltway sniper case in Washington a little more than a decade ago, the manhunt for a highly trained gunman suspected of targeting cops and their families in Southern California has some startling similarities and clear differences as well. In the California case, the mood is tense among police officers as they continue the search for Christopher Dorner, who is suspected of killing three people to settle a score for what he called an unjust firing from the Los Angeles Police Department. Similar fear gripped the Washington-area for nearly a month in October 2002, when John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo terrorized the city and its suburbs during the sniper case. They operated out of an old sedan, firing from a hole in the trunk, and struck in broad daylight and at night. They randomly gunned down 13 people, killing 10 and wounding three, going about their daily routine -- never suspecting for a second that they were in the sights of a killer. They were each felled by a rifle shot while at a gas station, doing yard work, going to school, or heading into a shopping center. Police bulletins, road blocks, and false leads and sightings around the notorious shootings fueled drama and tension in a region already on edge over the drumbeat of threats of another al Qaeda attack on the capital. Police were methodical and eventually caught a break, arresting the pair at a rest stop in Maryland. The Los Angeles case offers some similarities. - It involves a manhunt originating in a major metropolitan area with reported sightings in different communities raising fears. - The case involves multiple victims in multiple attacks. - Dorner was in the Navy and served in the Persian Gulf. Muhammad, who was executed in 2009, was in the Army and also served in the Gulf region, many years before. - Dorner is a trained marksman as was Muhammad. - Schools in some areas where California searches are concentrated are closed. In the sniper case, outdoor public events were canceled. LA cops stalked by suspect, and a brutal history . But differences between the two cases are clearer and, in some ways, should set the broader public at ease, say former detectives, law enforcement officials and a forensic psychiatrist familiar with both cases. ""During the D.C. sniper shooting the public had no idea who was doing it. ... The public saw this as random victimization without rhyme or reason,"" said Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist. Dietz worked on the Washington sniper case as well as the ""Unabomber"" mail-bomb case. ""In contrast, in the California matter, the public understands his targets are much more focused. They consist of certain named individuals and their families,"" he said. Dorner, 33, is wanted in the killing of two people in Irvine, California, on Sunday and in the shooting of three Los Angeles-area police officers on Thursday, which killed one of them. One of the victims in Irvine was the daughter of a retired Los Angeles police officer who Dorner knows, authorities said. The technical details of the California case may differ, but the level of fear people feel as they listen to accounts of the manhunt for a well trained suspect who authorities say has a vendetta is similarly acute, said Jim Trainum, a former homicide detective with the Washington Metropolitan Police Department who worked on the sniper case. ""Crime in general is nebulous or out there but when it strikes next to you, you think 'it could be me,'"" Trainum said. Neighbors have echoed that sentiment. Opinion: In rampages, it's about revenge . ""It's too close to home. It's kind of scary,"" Dorner's neighbor, Dan Gomez told, KLAS. Dorner, authorities said, is bent on vengeance against Los Angeles Police Department officers he claims ruined his life by forcing him out of his dream job. He detailed his rage in an 11-page manifesto. In that letter -- provided to CNN by an LAPD source -- he vowed to violently target police officers and their families, whoever and wherever they are. The motives in the D.C. sniper case were never entirely clear. Muhammad and his accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, then 17, taunted police with written messages, phone threats and demands during the rampage. During two trials and in years of appeals, Muhammad had professed innocence. Malvo remains in prison. Another difference is what authorities already know about the suspect in California. In the early days of the D.C. case, there were few clues and many false leads about who was behind the shooting, the type of vehicle involved, and where the suspect or suspects might have been. ""I was manning the e-mail tip line and there would be hundreds of them,"" Trainum said. ""There was one where they had the shootings mapped out on an upside constellation of Orion. We had people going around copying down the numbers of white vans and e-mailing them. There's always that concern that they'll miss that crucial tip because there is so much static."" That static complicated matters, Trainum said. ""In the D.C. case, everyone speculated that he had sniper training and that he was a police officer. In fact, we got tips about police officers who we had to put under surveillance. In D.C., anybody could have been a target. Out there (the California suspect) has a target list but it is obvious that he will kill anyone who gets in his way."" Alleged cop-killer's manifesto details threats . CNN's Mike M. Ahlers and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","Similarities but important difference between the L.A. manhunt and the D.C. sniper case .
Suspected L.A. gunman is targeting cops and their families; D.C. sniper victims were random .

"Washington (CNN) -- Effective Tuesday, ""Spice"" will not be a legal alternative to pot. The Drug Enforcement Administration is making the sale and possession of synthetic marijuana illegal for at least one year. The agency says the action is necessary ""to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety."" The ban that takes effect Tuesday was announced by the DEA in November, with the agency saying then it would make possessing and selling the chemicals used to produce synthetic marijuana  illegal in the United States for at least one year while the DEA and the Department of Health and Human Services study  whether the chemicals should be permanently controlled. Five chemicals most commonly found in products like ""Spice"" and ""K2"" are being classified as Schedule I controlled substances, a category reserved for unsafe, highly abused substances with no medical usage. The DEA said in November it was using its ""emergency scheduling authority"" to temporarily control the chemicals. The drugs are manufactured overseas and are typically laced on plant material and sold as herbal incense or plant food. They create a marijuana-like high when smoked. According to the DEA, increased use of synthetic marijuana has lead to a surge in emergency-room visits and calls to poison-control centers.  Adverse health effects associated with its use include seizures, hallucinations, paranoid behavior, agitation, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, racing heartbeat and elevated blood pressure. ""Fake pot"" has already been banned in 18 states and several countries. All five branches of the U.S. military prohibit military personnel from possessing or using them.","The DEA announced in November it was taking action to temporarily ban five chemicals .

"Washington (CNN) -- On one of the coldest nights of the year, there was no mistaking the northwest Washington home of Democratic operatives Kiki and Joe McLean with the Mississippi Delta or Alabama Gulf Coast. But it smelled like the South inside the stately brick home Thursday night, attendees said. The aroma of black-eyed peas, ham, biscuits and sweet tea drifted from room to room as roughly 60 Democratic operatives chatted and exchanged ideas about how their party, one that once dominated the South, could start a comeback from years of Republican victories. The Southern Progress Fund, a super PAC of Democrats whose goal is to provide money and infrastructure to down-ballot Democrats in the South -- state legislators, attorneys general and mayors -- put on the ""Southern Supper."" ""We are trying to turn the South blue,"" said Amanda Crumley, the group's executive director. ""This event is all about how Democrats can win in the South again."" And no detail at the event diverged from that goal, Crumley said. For dessert, the group turned traditional red velvet cupcakes blue, symbolic of what it's trying to do in the South. First on CNN: Republicans move to overhaul 2016 primary . LBJ's gloomy prediction . Since President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, only two Democratic presidential campaigns have won Mississippi, Alabama or Georgia: Native son Jimmy Carter swept the Deep South in 1976, while Southerner Bill Clinton won Georgia nearly 20 years later. But those victories are distant memories. Johnson proved to be a prophet. After signing the landmark civil rights legislation, he lamented to an aide: ""I think we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come."" In 2012, for example, out of the 25 congressional districts in those three states, Republicans won all but seven. All three states have a Republican governor, and Republicans control each state's legislature. Will challenges from right hurt GOP chances of taking back Senate? Nevertheless, Southern Democrats said they are poised to make a comeback and prove Johnson's ""long time to come"" is over. They point out the generation that vehemently rejected Johnson's Civil Rights Act is dying off. And in its place is a younger, more progressive and diverse group of Southerners. ""His prophecy was right, but that generation is about over now,"" said Rickey Cole, chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party. ""It can happen. In order to win in this part of the country, we have to play a nearly perfect game, and we have to capitalize on any fumbles and turnovers on the other side. But we can win."" Rebuilding in red America . Democrats once dominated the region. Between 1876 and 1964, Georgia only went against a Democrat once in presidential elections. Mississippi and Alabama, likewise, supported a candidate other than a Democrat two times. Their stranglehold on Southern politics bred loyal, proud Democrats who tightened their grip. But when political fortunes turned, they turned quickly. Democrats have won some statewide races but faced repeated national and congressional defeats. In looking back on the years of the ""Solid South,"" some Democrats said they now believe their near-century of dominance hurt the party. ""Southern Democrats never developed an opposition type or style of party that you have to be in today's world,"" said former Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a founder of the Southern Progress Fund. ""Democrats in the South have not had the ability to push back on various issues."" The biggest campaign moments of 2013 . Musgrove's point: If there is political parity, each party understands winning and losing. When the massive shift of power occurred in the 1960s and '70s, Democrats weren't prepared to be in the minority and didn't have the infrastructure to dig themselves out. Musgrove, who ran a competitive but losing race for the Senate in 2008 against Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, said for years during the Republican domination of the South, he thought the national party would swoop in to help rebuild. But it never happened. ""I kept waiting for someone to ride in on a white horse and say, 'Here is help,' "" Musgrove said with a laugh. ""Now, there is some obligation in the South for us, as Democrats, to make sure that we work to built that infrastructure, that bench, and that we help."" That's the mission of Musgrove's super PAC. The group plans to help candidates by not only raising money but by also providing campaigns with data about which voters in a certain area are persuadable -- information that has helped Democrats on the national level. In the South, Musgrove points out, that information could be even more important. With a small margin for error in most races, knowing which voters could be persuaded by a Democrat's argument is key, he said. What's more, the former governor sees the effort as not only a way to win the South as soon as possible but also to help create a culture of winning. ""From our vantage point, successful candidates are well-funded candidates that have the resources and infrastructure to get their message out,"" said Crumley, the group's executive director. Searching for signs of hope . Ask a Southern Democrat if he or she can win statewide, and you will get a wide array of anecdotes and theories. Some point to the last Democratic governor in each state, while others to President Barack Obama winning 43.5% of the vote in Mississippi without spending any money there in 2012. But the most often-cited anecdote -- by far -- is the success that Southern Democrats had in 2013 municipal elections in Mississippi. For the first time in nearly 30 years, a Democrat was elected mayor of Tupelo, while Meridian elected its first-ever black mayor -- a Democrat. After the win, Southern Democrats heralded the day as ""Blue Tuesday"" and celebrated the victories as a sign of things to come. 10 more secrets from campaign 2012 . The key to those races, operatives say, is that Southern Democrats managed them and proved -- in a small way -- that winning in a deep red state is not impossible. ""It is essential to build bottom up and especially in the South as we reconnect with voters and share a consistent and solid message out there that is different from the Republicans,"" said Burns Strider, a Democrat from the South who worked with Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Strider, who has long helped national Democrats reach Southern voters, said he is more hopeful than ever before that Democrats could make headway in local elections in 2014 and 2016. Speaking with an unmistakably Mississippi twang, Strider said the key to winning ""persuadable voters"" in the South is convincing them you share similar heritage and values. ""We are Southerners, we are Democrats; we hold the same values you do,"" he said, mimicking the pitch he could make to voters. ""We are moving a little bit beyond strident partisanship, and we are able to develop messages now that are going to stick."" Musgrove echoed that message. ""I may not know how to run a commissioner's race in New York, but I do know how to win in Mississippi,"" he said. ""I do know that Alabama is the No. 1 team in America. I do know where Talladega is. I do know what NASCAR racing is about, and I attend a lot."" Their point: It takes Southerners to win in the South. Hitting the 'white win number' Roy Barnes is Georgia's last Democratic governor to date. He won 53% of the overall vote in 1998, but there was a stark black-white divide -- Barnes lost the white vote by 21% but won the African-American vote by a whopping 82%. For Barnes, the key to victory was not getting too buried by losing the white vote and winning big with the black vote, according to Jon Anzalone, a pollster who focuses on Southern Democrats. Any Democrat running in the Deep South, he said, should expect to lose the white vote. ""Whether you are running for governor or senator, it is about hitting the white win number,"" Anzalone said. ""You have to hit a certain number of whites, which means you have to make a certain number of whites comfortable that you are a Southern Democrat and not a national Democrat."" But for Democrats in the South, there is a noticeable push and pull between the gains they are making because of changing demographics -- with both Georgia and Mississippi now more than 30% black -- and the negative setbacks the national party is causing because of unpopular positions on guns, religion and many social issues that even Democrats admit Republicans have won on down South. So as reliably Democratic voters -- African-Americans and Hispanics -- move into these states and slowly lighten the shade of red, Republican candidates have made it a point to tie their Democratic challengers to the national party. ""The comparisons were that I was a another Nancy Pelosi,"" said Bill Luckett, who became the Democratic mayor of Clarksdale, Mississippi, this year. ""I got bashed with it a bit,"" he said with a laugh, noting that he thought it would be hard to turn a gray-haired, burly Mississippian with a thick drawl into Pelosi, the liberal House minority leader who hails from the San Francisco area. Pollster Anzalone admits that one of the biggest problems Southern Democrats have is ""the perception of what a national Democrat is."" But the Pelosi comparison didn't stick to Luckett, and he won the Clarksdale mayor's race fairly easy. What he had working in his favor were demographics -- Clarksdale is a majority-black town in the Mississippi Delta. Some see a problem with being tied to the national party, while others -- such as Musgrove -- believe that while in some races ""candidates will need to differentiate themselves,"" the majority of Southern Democrats ""have a lot to be proud of"" in the national party. Musgrove acknowledges that turning the South blue will be difficult. ""Most people would say that just couldn't happen,"" he said. But in his opinion, Democrats have to try.","Super PAC has a steep climb to try to take back South from Republicans .
Democrats once held stranglehold on region, which has turned red since 1960s .
Southern Democrats believe they have to create a culture of winning from cycle to cycle .
They point to small victories in campaigns that Southern Democrats managed ."
"Editor's Note: Lt. Gen. Russel Honore led the military response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As Commanding General First U.S. Army, Honore commanded Joint Task Force - Katrina. In the aftermath of Katrina, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin called Honore ""a John Wayne dude"" who can ""get some stuff done."" Honore, 60, is a native of Louisiana and has many relatives living there. He retired from active service in March and is a CNN contributor. The following is an edited interview with Honore conducted last night. Russel L. Honore says Americans must embrace a culture of preparedness for a host of disasters. (CNN) -- How is this situation different from the response to Katrina? Katrina didn't have nearly the organized evacuation of the lower parishes that we've seen. If you start with this evacuation, you give it a thumbs-up. The levees have been reinforced, they're in better shape. The question is:  Are they good enough? After Katrina, the federal government left planners down there for over a year to write this plan that's being executed now. All indications are that there is good coordination, good collaboration. Evacuation is the easiest part of fighting hurricanes. This is like the pre-game show. You've got power, you've got cars. The hard part is after the storm, doing search and rescues, taking care of people who should have evacuated and didn't. People on the street have spent the past three years just trying to recover. This is a region that is really struggling, it's an area that is very nervous. We owe them the best that can be done. What kind of condition are the levees in? The government decided that we're going to fix the levees that were broken. They have been repaired in the finest fashion. But don't think that we're going to have 100 percent protection [from the levees]. There's a limit to what you can do to protect yourself from flooding. iReport.com: Leaving home? Share your story . People talk about the Dutch. But the Dutch don't get hurricanes. When you're dealing with a storm surge of 30 feet, you're talking about a whole different ballgame. We have over 300 miles of levees. I would not count on levees during a hurricane to save your life. Levees will give you early warning. If you're living behind a levee, you need to be prepared to evacuate at any time. That's Russel Honore's rule No. 1. If you live along the Mississippi River or on the Gulf Coast, rule No. 2 is: It's going to flood. What about the people who didn't evacuate? The key thing, if they're sheltered in place -- if you're at home now, you can still expect to lose power if you're within 120 miles of the storm, and well before the eye of the storm occurs. ... You need to be prepared to lose power for up to a week. You need to have food and water on hand, you need good batteries for your weather radio. You need to be aware you could start seeing tornadoes on the coast.  Watch residents leaving Â» . What are the longer term lessons? We need to build a culture of preparedness. We need to assure that every kid who goes to school in America knows how to swim. The number of EMS teams and ambulances is not tracking with the growth in population. We need to teach more of our people first aid. The federal government ought to be there to back the states up, we need to build a culture of preparedness in each. Why are we sending people there to issue them ice and water? We should be empowering people to act locally. The key to hurricane preparation is family preparation. If families are prepared, we lose fewer lives. Government has to set standards for institutions like nursing homes and hospitals and for homes where people with mental or physical disabilities are kept. They should be evacuated well before the general population. We have to decide how close we should have those types of institutions to the coastline and to areas that will probably be flooded. That part of the population is just too vulnerable. We need to create a national preparedness plan, with a local civil defense corps. We need dual trained teachers who can be disaster responders. We need to equip each high schools with satellite communications. We need drugstores with generators in each geographical area ... If you lose power, people can still get medicine. Gas stations along interstate highways need to have generators. We need cellphone towers that could be lowered before the storm and then raised after the storm. For every dollar you spend in preparedness before the disaster you save $9 after the disaster. Since Katrina, FEMA and DHS have focused on fixing the problems we saw with Katrina. It looks like they've gotten there, but we face a hell of a lot of things more than just hurricanes. I went to some government buildings Friday down in New Orleans. They still don't have enough back-up power. What do you think of the decision by the Republican Party to scale back parts of its convention because of the storm? It seemed to be the appropriate thing to do. But let's turn this into something. The American Red Cross has spent $20 million getting prepared for the storm. Let's turn it [the convention] into a fundraiser for the American Red Cross, let's turn this into a positive. They should challenge the Democrats to see who can raise the most money. The opinions expressed in this q-and-a are solely those of the subject of the interview.","Honore: New Orleans levees reinforced, they're in better shape .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll from a suicide attack in southwestern Pakistan has risen to 73, police said Saturday. At least 206 people were wounded in the Friday attack that the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for. Officials on Friday reported that 59 people were killed in the attack. Qari Hussain, a senior member of the group -- also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP -- said the attack avenged the deaths of Sunni religious leaders by Shiites. The TTP also claimed responsibility this week for a trio of suicide attacks Wednesday during Shiite processions in Lahore, which killed 31 people. The blast in the city of Quetta occurred during an Al Quds day rally, an annual event in the Arab and Muslim world that criticizes Israeli policies toward Palestinians. Dramatic television images showed what appeared to be the blast, followed by heavy gunfire and people dispersing. Images also showed many casualties being treated. The U.S. Justice Department announced this week that a key TTP leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, has been charged for his alleged involvement in the killings of seven U.S. citizens at an American military base in Afghanistan in 2009 and the attempted Times Square bombing this year. A $5 million reward is being offered for information leading to the capture of Mehsud and another top Pakistani Taliban leader, Wali Ur Rehman, U.S. officials said. Hussain said his group felt proud that the United States felt ""threatened"" by the Taliban. ""We will continue to attempt the kind of attacks we tried in New York Times Square, but next time, we will succeed,"" he said. ""Soon the world will realize that we are very effective."" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said U.S. officials ""strongly condemn the recent barbaric attacks on religious processions in Lahore and Quetta and on a place of worship in Mardan, near Peshawar. Our sympathies are with the victims and their families and all those affected by these cruel acts of hatred. We stand with all of the people of Pakistan who should have the freedom to peacefully observe their religion, especially during Ramadan, and focus on rebuilding their lives after the floods, not mourn friends and family killed in terrorist attacks."" In an apparently unrelated incident Friday in northwestern Pakistan, a suicide bomber blew himself up outside an Ahmadi worship place in Mardan, killing himself and a pedestrian, police said. The incident occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Waqif Khan, Mardan's police chief, said guards fired on the suicide bomber when he tried to breach the site's security barrier. After he was injured, the attacker detonated his explosives. Four other people were injured in the attack. Ahmadis, who call themselves Muslims, are considered heretical and have been persecuted in the Muslim world. Recently, there was fighting between Ahmadis and non-Ahmadi Muslims in Indonesia. Sunnis and Shiites do not consider the Ahmadis part of Islam because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God. As such, they have been targeted by Islamic extremists. Pakistan's population is largely Sunni Muslim. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistani Taliban claim responsibility for deadly bombing .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- African nations should have acted quickly to help quell the bloody fighting that has consumed parts of South Sudan this month, the President of the new country told CNN on Monday. As soon as an attempted coup took place and violence broke out, ""the original leaders and all African leaders should have come in with military support,"" so that the rebels would be ""crushed once and for all,"" President Salva Kiir said. However, he said, he did not ask them for help. East African nations have set Tuesday as a deadline for the two sides to engage in talks. If the other side, led by former South Sudanese Vice President Riek Machar, does not agree to talk, then ""we will fight,"" Kiir vowed. ""In both cases,"" he said, peace ""will be restored."" Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, at a news conference, said that if Machar does not agree to talks, the other countries will ""go for him."" Asked what that means, he said, ""defeat him."" Machar could not be reached immediately for comment. Machar is a longtime rival of Kiir. The men are from tribal clans. Kiir is from the Dinka tribe, Machar from the Neur. Kiir accused Machar of trying to stage a coup. Machar has denied the claim. Fighting broke out on December 15 in the capital city of Juba. It quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings that were lent credence by mass graves. Militia persuaded to retreat . Government officials have persuaded an ethnic militia loyal to Machar to retreat from Bor, Rachel Nyedak Paul, the deputy information minister in Juba, told CNN on Monday. An estimated 20,000 ethnic Nuer from the so-called White Army had been headed for the city, raising fears of more violence. Paul told CNN that she and other officials who are Nuer and originally from the North Jonglei province -- the same area where the White Army originated -- had a series of phone conversations with leaders of White Army on Monday. They told the leaders the current crisis was a political and not a tribal battle and told them to not get involved. The youths in the White Army are known for the white powder they use to cover their skin as an insect repellant. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: Ugandan president vows the region will help 'defeat' Machar if he doesn't agree to talks .

"(CNN)  -- A U.N. tribunal convicted two Serb cousins Monday of having burned alive more than 100 Muslims in what the presiding judge called a part of the ""wretched history of man's inhumanity to man."" Serb Milan Lukic has been found guilty of burning alive more than 100 Muslims. Milan Lukic and Sredoje Lukic were convicted of crimes dating back to the early 1990s, during the bitter ethnic conflict that ravaged the former Yugoslavia. Milan Lukic organized a group of local paramilitaries with ties to police and the military, sometimes referred to as the ""White Eagles"" or ""Avengers,"" according to an indictment. Before and during the war, his cousin Sredoje Lukic worked as a policeman before joining the group. The crimes include two incidents in which Muslim men, women and children were forced into homes that were then set on fire -- and some who tried to escape were shot. Milan Lukic was found ""guilty of persecutions, murder, extermination, cruel treatment and inhumane acts, as crimes against humanity and war crimes, in relation to six discrete incidents,"" the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) at the Hague said. He was sentenced to life in prison. Sredoje Lukic was found guilty of ""aiding and abetting the commission of the crime of persecutions inhumane acts, murder and cruel treatment."" He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Their crimes were committed during the 1990s. Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992 and Radovan Karadzic declared himself president of a Bosnian Serb republic. The Bosnian Serbs, backed by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav military and paramilitary forces, quickly seized control of most of the country and laid siege to Sarajevo, the capital. During the conflict that followed, the Serb forces launched what they called the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the territories under their control -- the forced displacement and killings of Muslims and Croats. The cousins' cases are a small part of the caseload the Tribunal has dealt with regarding violations of humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001. Since its creation the Tribunal has indicted 161 people on charges of serious violations of humanitarian law. The court found Milan Lukic responsible for the murder of 59 Muslim women, children and elderly men in a house in the town of Visegrad. ""On 14 June 1992, the victims were locked into one room of the house which was then set on fire,"" the tribunal wrote. ""Milan Lukic was found to have placed the explosive device into the room, which set the house ablaze. Milan Lukic shot at people trying to escape from the burning house."" Sredoje Lukic ""knew what would happen to the victims that he helped herd"" into the home, the court wrote in its judgment. Milan Lukic was also found guilty of the murder of at least 60 Muslim civilians in another house in Visegrad later that same month. The court found that he and others ""forced the civilians inside the house, blocked all exits and threw in several explosive devices and petrol, setting the house on fire."" In all, the court found that Milan Lukic ""personally killed at least 132 Muslim people."" The defense for both men denied the accusations against them, but the evidence demonstrated their guilt, the court said in its judgment. ""The perpetration by Milan Lukic and Sredoje Lukic of crimes in this case is characterized by a callous and vicious disregard for human life,"" presiding judge Patrick Robinson said. ""In the all too long, sad and wretched history of man's inhumanity to man, the Pionirska street and Bikavac fires must rank high. ""At the close of the twentieth century, a century marked by war and bloodshed on a colossal scale, these horrific events stand out for the viciousness of the incendiary attack, for the obvious premeditation and calculation that defined it, for the sheer callousness and brutality of herding, trapping and locking the victims in the two houses, thereby rendering them helpless in the ensuing inferno, and for the degree of pain and suffering inflicted on the victims as they were burnt alive.""","U.N. tribunal convicts Serb cousins of burning alive more than 100 Muslims .

"Chingola, Zambia (CNN) -- It's 10 minutes after the final whistle has blown but still no one knows whether their efforts have been in vain. The Libyan national soccer team sit in the dressing room at the Nchanga Stadium -- in Chingola, a small copper mining town on the Zambia-Congo border -- quietly waiting for news amidst the fog of sweat and redolence of rubefacient muscle rub. The team has just drawn 0-0 with Zambia in their final qualification match for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, a qualification campaign that began with the country under the rule of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, continued through the civil war and ended before the death of the former notorious leader. Victory was needed to be sure of progression to next January's tournament in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. A draw meant that results elsewhere had to go their way. As their campaign for Africa's biennial continental championship progressed with war as the backdrop, some players declared the team was behind Gadhafi. Others left the team to go and fight on the front line with the rebels. In unison, somehow, they qualified; news that will shortly be relayed to the team when confirmation of results from other matches are circulated. Six days earlier coach Marcos Paqueta is in good spirits in the lobby of his hotel in Tunis. The security situation is such that the team could not train in Tripoli. The Brazilian coach once famously won the under 17s and under 20s World Cups in the same year for his homeland, but signed for Libya in June 2010 when the Libyan Football Federation was run by one of Gadhafi's sons, Mohamed. ""When I was there the first time I contacted only the federation, then one time I have one meeting with Dr Mohamed,"" Paqueta explains of his dealings with the Gadhafi regime. ""He was happy because of the project I made for the national team and Libyan football. I focus only on sports. At that time you don't know about the country."" In the past, the Gadhafi family's dealings with soccer and its players had been much more hands on. His son Saadi played for Al Ahly Tripoli and installed himself as captain of the national team. The team plummeted to 186th on FIFA's rankings. But they also used soccer as a political tool. In 2000 Saadi's Al Ahly Tripoli traveled to Al Ahly Benghazi for a league match. Benghazi had long been associated with Libya's opposition and the team's fans paraded a donkey wearing Saadi's shirt. ""It is a bad story, not a funny story,"" says 29-year-old defensive midfielder Moataz Ben Amer, the current captain of Al Ahly Benghazi. ""The first half, Tripoli are winning. But the referee is no good. So Ahly Benghazi goes to the airport [in protest]. Saadi Gadhafi turned up with his dogs and the police and said: 'If you don't play the second half, we will kick you'."" Unsurprisingly, the players returned to play the second half, and lost 3-0. Colonel Gadhafi was so incensed that he ordered Al Ahly Benghazi's training ground to be destroyed. The club was also banned from domestic competition for five years. When Interpol released a ""Red Notice"" for Saadi Gadhafi in September, the allegations given were ""misappropriating properties through force and armed intimidation when he headed the Libyan Football Federation."" Paqueta's early results were encouraging. Libya beat Zambia, one of Africa's best teams, in Tripoli. But then in February civil war broke out, dividing the players. After Libya had beaten the Comoros Islands in March the team's former captain, 34-year-old Tariq Taib, declared that the players were 100 per cent behind Gadhafi. He even labeled the rebels ""rats and dogs."" Walid el Kahatroushi disagreed. The 27-year-old midfielder scored in that game but when the team gathered again in June, he decided to leave the camp and fight for the rebels when he heard a friend had been injured in the violence. ""Some people come to me and told me one of my dear friends was in the hospital and lost his arm ... in that moment I decided to leave the camp and join the front line ... in Jebel Nafousa,"" explains Kahatroushi. Life on the front line was hard. Friends would shield him from worst of the fighting until, in the end, he felt he had no choice . ""When I was there I was just about forgetting about football because the most important thing then is how to secure your life and secure the life of your friends. If it was about me I would never come back, you would never find me here playing football. But ... my friends on the front line told me: 'This is your future, you must go there. This is also like a war for you'."" Others left for the front line too, like goalkeeper Guma Mousa, but not all were so lucky. Ahmed Alsagir was shot in the shoulder and spent a month in hospital before returning to the front line. By the end of August Gadhafi had been toppled. A week later the team had to play their penultimate qualifier against Mozambique behind closed doors in Egypt. Aside from the trouble of getting the players out of the country, there were some more practical concerns. For one, Paqueta had to hold a clear the air meeting with the squad. The old pro-Gaddafi players were nowhere to be seen. A new kit had to be designed, with the rebel's flag stitched on to it. The Libyans fought out a 0-0 draw. ""The last game [against] Mozambique, it had a big impact on the people in Libya. Everyone was happy and everyone was talking about us,"" recalls Kahatroushi. ""We will do everything to qualify, Inshallah, because this will help our country too much. At least to bring them some happiness after all the sadness they have been through."" The journey south to Zambia took almost 24 hours, but the players are ready when they take to the pitch at the packed Nchanga Stadium. Libya's new captain, 39-year-old goalkeeper Samir Abod is the hero, making three world class saves. The match finishes 0-0. Some of the players collapse on the floor in tears. Others pray before returning to the dressing room. They wait. The quiet is broken when one of the coaches bursts in and breathlessly delivers the news. The blue-painted room erupts in celebration and song. The rebel national anthem is sung as the new flag is held aloft in the center of the melee. Ghana's victory and a last-minute equalizer for Guinea against Nigeria means that Libya has, against the odds, qualified for the Nations Cup. As a nation recovers thousands of miles away from the ravages of civil war under the new interim government, Walid Kahatroushi leads the celebrations and the chants. ""The blood of the dead,"" they sing, ""will not be spilt in vain.""","CNN travels with the Libyan national soccer team to Zambia .

"(CNN) -- Floating high above the Earth, astronaut Karen Nyberg pointed her camera at a swirling white cloud spreading across the planet. Little did she know the devastation that was unfurling beneath. This remarkable image of Super Typhoon Haiyan over the Philippines, was taken by the NASA astronaut during a five-month mission in space. It was one of many specular photographs taken by Nyberg -- who in 2008 became the 50th woman in space -- and was retweeted thousands of times by her followers back on Earth. CNN spoke to the mechanical engineering professor earlier this year, in a live broadcast from the International Space Station. Watch the full interview here . As she returned to Earth this week, we again caught up with the American astronaut to chat about her fascinating experiments and adjusting to life back on the blue planet. CNN: What was it like, taking a photograph like that and realizing the impact it might have on Earth as you looked out the window? Karen Nyberg: It definitely makes you think, because it's so beautiful when you look out the window. I couldn't even fit the entire storm in one picture. I used a 50 millimeter lens to capture as much as I could, but just knowing the devastation underneath this beautiful cloud is pretty sad. CNN: You've also taken some other photographs which have been just as beautiful, and not caused such a devastating impact -- like sunrises over Earth. KN: Yes, I love taking pictures and I enjoyed it more and more as the mission went on -- that's probably one of the things I'll miss the most. It was a great geography lesson for me too, to get these images from all over the world. CNN: Do you see the world in the same way, as before you went up as an astronaut? KN: You actually do see it a little differently -- in a strange way you feel closer to everybody. I wish everybody could experience that. CNN: What sort of experiments were you working on while you were up there? KN: A lot of the experiments were being done on us -- looking at our eyesight and how that changes, and looking at our bone density and how that changes by the effects of micro gravity. We also did a lot of experiments on fluids and combustion -- a lot of these are for developing systems to travel further into outer space, and a lot of them will really benefit what we're doing on Earth. CNN: A lot of astronauts apparently experience long-term vision problems after returning to Earth -- is that something that's happened to you, and do you know what causes it? KN: I had some vision changes during my stay on the space station, but it's coming back to normal again -- I think that's happened frequently to other astronauts. I haven't experienced long-term changes but we have done quite intensive studies on me and my crew mates. CNN: What are other changes you've noticed since coming back to Earth? KN: It seems like I never left in a lot of ways -- it's almost a time warp. You get back to home and work, and it's like you were never away. I think I'll need to go back and look at my pictures pretty soon and reminisce. To see more of Karen Nyberg's photographs from space, follow her on Twitter or like her on Facebook.

"(CNN) -- After nearly four years of hoping, waiting and praying, an Ohio family learned Sunday their missing son died in Iraq. A 2004 memorial at Glen Este High School in Ohio in honor of Sgt. Keith Matthew Maupin. ""It hurts -- it really hurts. You go through four years of hope,"" said Carolyn Maupin, whose son, Staff Sgt. Keith Matthew Maupin, was captured by insurgents in April 2004. ""It's like a letdown to me. I'm trying to get through that right now."" His father, Keith Maupin, said military officials informed the family Sunday afternoon that the remains of the 24-year-old Army reservist had been identified. ""Every parent knows the possibility exists that they may have to face the death of their child when they volunteer to go to war,"" he said. ""However, those who are fortunate make peace with that and support their soldier, because they enlisted at their own free will."" A Defense Department official also confirmed the identification, saying Maupin's remains were found last week but DNA results just came in. Coalition forces found the remains after a local Iraqi tipped them off, military officials said. Maupin, who was 20 at the time of his capture, and another soldier, Sgt. Elmer Krause, 40, were captured by insurgents April 9, 2004, after their convoy came under attack near Baghdad International Airport. A week later, Maupin was shown on a videotape, surrounded by several armed masked men. ""My name is Keith Matthew Maupin,"" he stated in the video. ""I am a soldier from the First Division. I am married with a 10-month-old child. I came to liberate Iraq, but I did not come willingly because I wanted to stay with my child."" Krause's body was found two weeks later. Later that summer, Al-Jazeera aired a videotape purportedly showing the execution of Maupin, but U.S. officials haven't confirmed the identity of the person on the tape. The U.S. Army continued to promote Maupin, who was a private first class in the Army Reserves at the time of his capture, to sergeant and then staff sergeant as they searched for him. Three U.S. troops remain missing in the five-year-old Iraq war: Pvt. Byron W. Fouty and Spc. Alex R. Jimenez have been missing since their military convoy was raided west of Mahmoudiya May 12. Spc. Ahmed K. Altaie disappeared October 23, 2006, and his status was changed to ""missing-captured"" nearly two months later. The news about Maupin came Sunday as roadside bombings in northern and western Iraq killed two U.S. troops and attacks on Iraqi police and others left another 19 dead, Iraqi police and U.S. military officials reported. One roadside bombing killed a U.S. soldier north of Baghdad, and a Marine died in another bombing in the western province of Anbar, the U.S. military headquarters there reported. No details of the attacks were released. The latest attacks bring the U.S. death toll in the five-year-old war to 4,009.  E-mail to a friend .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan government and rebel officials offered wildly disparate views of the situation on the ground Sunday, as gunfire and explosions continued to rock Tripoli not far from the home of embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, the ruler's son and a top official in his regime, insisted on Libyan state-run television that the rebels were losing every battle -- saying so hours after his father told supporters that the ""traitors"" and their NATO allies were lying and nearing their end. This perspective, however, contrasted with reports from CNN reporters, witnesses and rebel officials that government forces continued to lose ground all around the North African nation and faced fresh attacks in the capital. Faithi Baja, political affairs chief for the rebel's Transitional National Council, said early Sunday in a video statement that rebel fighters freshly launched operation inside Tripoli is ""going easily"" and they are inching toward Gadhafi's Bab al-Azizia compound. ""The revolution from inside Tripoli has officially started (Saturday) evening in many parts ... of Tripoli, and is expected to spread to all of Tripoli,"" Jumma Ibrahim, a rebel spokesman from the western mountain region around Zintan, said hours earlier. Heavy clashes broke out Saturday night in at least one neighborhood in Tripoli, marked by intense gunfire, explosions and people screaming as they ran through the street, a resident told CNN. Gunfire and explosions have become normal occurrences in the capital, but CNN personnel on the ground for weeks report that the fighting appeared to be among the most intense yet. ""Most of the neighhoods in Tripoli are rising up,"" Jumma Ibrahim said. But speaking just before midnight in Tripoli, government spokesman Musa Ibrahim insisted that all is safe and ""in excellent condition."" He said that the Libyan capital remains under government control, adding that the nearby highways remain open. He blamed small groups of ""armed gangs"" -- a term that Gadhafi loyalists have frequently applied to rebels -- for the blasts and gunfire heard overnight Saturday inside Tripoli. He insisted that government forces had put down the fighters ""within half an hour,"" making the statement at the same time gunfire continued to crackle intermittently around the capital. About two hours later, Moammar Gadhafi echoed his spokesman in claiming rebel officials were lying about the situation in Tripoli and beyond while predicting the six-month-long conflict would climax soon. In his audio address, broadcast on state-run TV, the Libyan leader blasted the rebel ""traitors"" and the NATO forces backing them as unethical and intent on destroying the county and ruining lives. And as he had done in a speech six days earlier, he tried to rally citizens to his side. ""A great thing, anyway, that despite the Christian air raids, you continue to be up in Tripoli,"" he said, an apparent reference to those who listened to his speech from Green Square. ""March forward, march forward, march forward. ""They have lost and used everything, and their last resort is their lying campaign. Now, this is the ending,"" he added. The rebel spokesman, Jumma Ibrahim, claimed opposition fighters control the main intelligence operations building in Tripoli. He also said some Libyan army personnel had defected and joined the rebels in the vicinity of the capital's airport, which he claimed the rebels were able to take over with their newfound support. Musa Ibrahim, the government spokesman, denied that the airport had switched hands -- insisting, as with the rest of Tripoli, it was safe and under the control of Gadhafi's forces. CNN could not immediately confirm how significant the fighting was, including whether rebel fighters had taken control of any parts of the city, including the airport. Jumma Ibrahim, the rebel spokesman, said the clashes in Tripoli were ""planned by rebels inside Tripoli in the neighborhoods of Fashloum, Souq al-Juma, Ben Ashur ... and other places."" This came after coordination with other anti-Gadhafi elements, added Baja. Musa Ibrahim confirmed that armed men had entered those three neighborhoods in the capital, but said they were confronted and defeated in a matter of minutes. Hours earlier, Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim rejected rebel claims that the governments of Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria have been asked to accept Gadhafi and his family. And Gadhafi, in his speech early Sunday morning, stated unequivocally that he is still in Libya. Officials from the United States and NATO, whose forces have launched scores of strikes on Gadhafi's forces, also said they have no indication the Libyan leader is making preparations to leave. Whatever his next move, international pressure on Gadhafi appears to be growing. Tunisia -- Libya's western neighbor that, until now, had been neutral in the conflict -- joined a host of other nations in recognizing the Transitional National Council as Libya's legitimate government. A U.S. official said Friday that Gadhafi might be preparing for a ""last stand"" in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances. A second U.S. official said the longtime leader's plan could involve a final military offensive against civilians, launched from his last major strongholds around the Libyan capital. The officials, who have knowledge of the situation on the ground, did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters. While uncertain of how upcoming events will unfold, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that U.S. officials in Benghazi have been working with the Libyan opposition ""on exactly what it's going to look like post-Gadhafi."" ""Impossible to say when he'll go, but it's clear that he will go,"" Toner told CNN. The fighting continues, meanwhile, on a number of fronts, including in the west, where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya, about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital. On Saturday, it appeared the rebels had taken control of all of Zawiya after pushing Gadhafi's forces beyond the east gate, according to CNN's Sara Sidner who is in the city. Artillery fire could be heard, and mortars were launched toward Zawiya on Saturday, she reported. Rebel fighters told Sidner that NATO had warned civilians to leave the main part of the city. NATO has not yet commented on that statement. Musa Ibrahim, the Libyan government spokesman, said late Saturday that Gadhafi's forces are surrounding Zawiya and still control it. Earlier, the rebels seized a major oil refinery in Zawiya and controlled only the western part of the city, said Hobab Jomaa, a rebel fighter. But Saif al-Islam Gadhafi sarcastically laughed at the idea the opposition would take Tripoli. And he was emphatic that he, his father and their supporters would not surrender. ""We are in our land, in our country,"" he said. ""We have no problem if it takes six months, one year or two years -- victory will be ours. This is our country, and we will not leave it."" CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Matthew Chance, Sara Sidner, Kareem Khadder, Roba Alhenawi, Ben Wedeman, Barbara Starr and Yasmin Amer contributed to this report.","NEW: Saif Gadhafi says the rebels are losing, insists""we will not leave"" Libya .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- If you're Iranian, you probably know both and Akbar Ganji and Googoosh. You also know that 30 years ago they had as much in common as Rush Limbaugh and Madonna. The story of how they came together this week on a street corner in Manhattan for a hunger strike is a glimpse of the evolution of the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the far-reaching impact of Iran's current opposition movement. Akbar Ganji went on a three-day hunger strike this week outside the U.N. to protest Iran's crackdown on dissidents. In 1979 no Iranian singer was more famous than Googoosh. She was Iran's Madonna, Sheryl Crow and Mariah Carey wrapped into one. She was rich, famous and adored by millions. Back then, the 29-year-old singer was also a symbol of an increasingly westernized Iran. In 1979 Akbar Ganji was 19. He was a devout Muslim and staunch supporter of a religious movement to overthrow the western backed Shah of Iran. Ganji says he had Googoosh's records, but his religious mentors convinced him that her music was un-Islamic. So he tossed the records in the trash. ""All my friends did,"" Ganji said. ""Back then everything had to be about the revolution."" In February 1979, Ganji's wish came true. The shah fell from power. In his place came the father of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. For Googoosh and Ganji, the tables turned. Googoosh never recorded another album in Iran. Ganji went on to become a member of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, worked for the government, then went on to become an accomplished journalist. The two very different roads traveled by Googoosh and Ganji began to converge in the mid-1990s. That was when Ganji started becoming disillusioned with Iran's theocracy. This wasn't what he had in mind, he says, when he struggled for freedom and change in 1979. As a journalist he described Iran's leaders as fascists and dared to accuse high-ranking officials of murdering political dissidents. In 2000, the government accused Ganji of being an enemy of the revolution and sentenced him to six years in prison. In 2005 Ganji went on a hunger strike. For 74 days he ate no food, surviving on water, tea and sugar cubes. Ganji left Iran for the United States after he was released from prison in 2006. Soon after he arrived, he says, he got a call from the singer whose records he'd trashed more than 25 years before. Googoosh was already living in exile in the States. ""I don't want to go into details of what she said,"" Ganji said. ""It was personal. She just wanted me to know that I was in her thoughts during my time in prison.""  Watch Googoosh and Ganji talk about the hunger strike Â» . This week, Ganji welcomed Googoosh at a rally as they started a three-day hunger strike in support of Iran's opposition movement. Dozens of Iranian artists, authors and intellectuals living in exile joined them in the hunger strike in front of the United Nations' headquarters in Manhattan. Many were draped in green, the official color of the opposition movement that claims Iran's presidential elections were rigged. The gathering called on the U.N. and the international community to help free the hundreds of detainees arrested by Iranian authorities after the disputed June 12 election. The names of the detainees were printed on a banner. The names in red were those who had been killed. When Googoosh arrived on Wednesday, her fans mobbed her. One woman wrapped a green scarf around her shoulders. ""As an artist I have a voice, and I can ask the world to help our people,"" Googoosh told CNN. Two Iranians with nothing in common 30 years ago now struggle for the same cause. ""No, I don't think anybody expected this,"" Ganji said. The hunger strike ended Friday evening, and Ganji called it a success. He said the hunger strikers also vowed to oppose any future appearance at the United Nations by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ""If he decides to come to the U.N., we have to bring 10 times as many people as we had this week to prevent him from making an appearance,"" Ganji said.","Akbar Ganji was committed to the revolution in Iran before souring on the regime .

"(CNN) -- A jury in Kentucky Friday night acquitted 17-year-old Joshua Young in the beating death of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, two years ago. Young also was found not guilty of tampering with evidence. Josh Gouker, Young's father, pleaded guilty to murder in Zwicker's death, and was sentenced on July 26 to life in prison. But prosecutors said Young worked with Gouker to beat Zwicker as the teen suffocated in the mud of a ditch behind a Kentucky high school. ""Trey Zwicker was brutally murdered at age 14 ... because Josh Gouker is a control freak and because Josh Young wanted to impress him,"" prosecutor Elizabeth Brown told the jury in Jefferson County Circuit Court during Friday's closing arguments. She said Gouker was upset with Zwicker's mother after she aborted Gouker's unborn child, and he wanted revenge. Jurors could have found Young guilty of murder whether they believed he acted alone or with someone else. The tampering with evidence charge accused Young of throwing away clothes and a bloody bat after the murder. Before deliberations began, Brown told jurors not to feel sorry for the defendant because he's young or because he had a bad father or a bad life. ""You cannot let sympathy add reasonable doubt,"" Brown said. ""He was not coerced into doing this. He bragged about it, laughed about it."" Leslie Smith, delivering the closing argument Friday for the defense, turned the spotlight on Gouker. She called him a ""jerk"" without a conscience and described him as a master manipulator who killed Zwicker alone. ""Do you really think he involved anybody else at all to carry out this horrible crime,"" Smith said. Smith also told jurors that the only reason investigators looked at Young is because of Gouker, who ""duped the police and then he duped them again and then he duped everybody. He's good at it, he's just good at it."" Smith closed her argument by questioning why Young is even on trial. ""Why are we here? Send this kid home -- wherever that's going to be. Just send him home,"" she said. Young wiped his eyes and his nose as he exited the courtroom during a short break between the attorneys' closing arguments. The jury in Louisville deliberated for about eight hours before returning its verdicts. Complete coverage of the trial on HLNtv.com.

"(CNN) -- American and US Airways recently announced their $11 billion merger. Is this the kiss of death to the legacy airline industry, which after the merger will only have three major carriers: United, Delta and American? Will the merger reduce consumer choices and increase prices? Is this another proof that airline deregulation is a big mistake and a sellout to corporate interests? Rest assured -- there's no reason to panic. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average round-trip ticket (net of fees paid at the airport, including baggage fees and on-board fees such as meals, both of which are important sources of new revenues) increased by 28% since 1995. In contrast, average retail prices in the same time frame increased by 47%, which means that the average air fare fell in real terms by about 15%. At the same time, crude oil prices (a key factor in airline costs) increased by a factor of 5, from around $17 per barrel to more than $90 per barrel. During this period, we saw many legacy airlines disappear, mostly through mergers. TWA -- the fourth major legacy -- was acquired by American in 2001. America West was absorbed by then bankrupt US Airways in 2005. Continental merged with United last year. Southwest, a major new entrant at the national scale since deregulation, took over ATA Airlines in 2008 and Air Tran in 2010, which previously absorbed ValuJet, another new airline since deregulation. Delta purchased Northwest in 2008. Although the U.S. airline industry is more concentrated than the rest of the world, in reality, its competitive nature changed dramatically. The entrance of new players at the national stage such as Southwest, JetBlue, and Virgin America, among many others, as well as the development of strong hub-and-spoke networks among the major airlines, put strong competitive pressure on the majors. On the one hand, the new entrants are all nimble. Southwest has been the only consistently profitable airline for 20 years. When compared to the majors, they all have lower labor costs, and more modern and standardized equipment -- leading to low operational and fuel costs. They tend also to be highly selective in the markets they serve. On the other hand, the majors' strengthening of the hub-and-spoke networks (by which travelers go from A to B via a hub in airport C) imply that entry into new markets -- what in the industry is called ""city-pairs"" -- is relatively simple. All a major needs to do is to start service between one hub and a given city to have service to hundreds of new city-pairs, all prior existing cities being suddenly connected to a new destination. So if an airline attempts to gouge its customers on a particular destination, other airlines with reasonably located hubs will have a strong incentive to add such destination to their networks, frustrating the gouging airline's ability to raise prices. It is in this framework that the American-US Airways merger needs to be looked at. Although there will be some competitive overlap, particularly at national airports where both American and US Airways have a substantial presence (US Airways providing the North East Shuttle service as well as regular service), such overlap will be investigated by the antitrust authorities. Actually, the two networks are quite complementary and will provide consumers with more choices and improved quality of service. In particular, East Coast residents where US Airways has its major eastern hubs will benefit from increased domestic and international connections. Although the combined airline may decide to streamline some of its hubs, other hubs, such as Phoenix (which is a strong Southwest hub), will provide the combined airline with a strong competitive position to recapture some of the market the majors lost to Southwest over the years (US Airways competes today with Southwest in about 80% of its routes). Overall, this merger, the last of the large airlines' merger wave, has the potential of being not only good for shareholders and airline employees, but to domestic travelers alike. It's not a bad deal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pablo T. Spiller.","American and US Airways recently announced their $11 billion merger .

"(CNN) -- Duty called a volunteer firefighter in New Hampshire on Christmas Eve to the site of a fatal car crash, where fate dealt him a heartbreaking blow. The mangled body of a dying woman he removed from the crushed SUV in the town of Brookline was his own daughter, CNN affiliate WMUR reported, citing police. Ellworth Austin said he knew both the volunteer firefighter, Steve Whitcomb, and the daughter, Katie Hamilton. ""It's a terrible tragedy,"" said Austin, who, like Whitcomb, runs a plumbing business in Brookline. ""It's Christmas ... and everybody is pretty teary-eyed."" The firefighter didn't recognize his daughter's body at the time, police chief Bill Quigley told local newspaper The Union Leader. ""Her father was the one who pulled her out of the car without knowing it was her,"" Quigley said. Hamilton, 30, died of her injuries caused when another vehicle struck hers from behind, pushing it into the opposing lane of traffic, where a third car collided with hers head on, Quigley told WMUR. Hamilton leaves behind not only her father. ""I know that she is a young mother,"" Quigley said. ""It's a sad, sad day for all of us, not just because it's Christmas Eve."" In Brookline, almost everyone knows Whitcomb and the tragedy he has suffered. The town of 4,000 holds Hamilton and Whitcomb in high regard, Quigley said. The drivers of the other vehicles were not hurt. Police think the driver of the car that rear-ended Hamilton may have been distracted, the chief said. ""We are pretty certain that speed and impairment were not a factor so that would rule it down to driver distraction at this point,"" Quigley said. Police are still investigating the cause, and no one has been charged, WMUR reported. Girl whose wish inspired mass Christmas carol celebration dies .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of people are missing after a mudslide that buried homes as Manuel pounded the country's Pacific Coast, Mexico's president said Wednesday. At least 58 people are unaccounted for in the municipality of Atoyac de Alvarez, Mexican Pesident Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto told reporters Wednesday, describing damage there as ""catastrophic."" The mayor of Atoyac, which is about 50 miles west of Acapulco, told CNNMexico that 15 bodies had been recovered and at least 70 people remained trapped under mud that buried 20 homes. PeÃ±a Nieto said hundreds of people have been rescued from La Pintada, the community in Atoyac hit by the mudslide. It's unclear how many people remain buried, he said. Manuel, which strengthened into a hurricane Wednesday evening, was one of three storms bringing devastating deluges and flooding to Mexico. At least 80 people were killed in the storms, Mexico's interior ministry said. In the Pacific resort city of Acapulco, thousands of tourists were stranded. ""Unfortunately, this took us by surprise,"" Veronica Garcia told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""It rained uncontrollably. The streets flooded, and we had to stay inside our beach house."" Garcia said her family was stuck on the home's second floor because of flooding. As if that wasn't enough, they had to face an agonizing decision: Who should be rescued? The Garcias were among some 40,000 tourists left stranded or cut off by weather that has claimed dozens of lives during a holiday weekend. As the water rose, Garcia and her four family members waited nervously on the upper floor for help, but no rescuers appeared to whisk them to safety. When local volunteers finally arrived with a small kayak, their relief was short-lived. Rescuers said the boat would only fit two family members. It was decided that Garcia would be rescued, along with one of her sons. A second round of agony followed as Garcia spent two days in a shelter before the rest of her family was rescued and everyone was reunited. The Garcias' story was only one of countless examples of tourists whose vacations were interrupted by severe weather. Mexico was being pummeled from nearly all sides Wednesday as Manuel, the remnants of Hurricane Ingrid and a new area of low pressure threatened most of the country with flooding or rain. Mexico's interior ministry said Wednesday that the storms are responsible for at least 80 deaths nationwide. And a state-by-state tally indicates the toll could be higher. In Guerrero state, where Acapulco is located, officials said at least 72 people were killed. Heavy rains and widespread flooding from Manuel there caused mudslides that cut off highways and buried homes, Acapulco Mayor Luis Walton told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Tuesday night. ""Acapulco is practically incommunicado,"" he said. On Wednesday, the rain eased and rescue operations and evacuations of tourists quickened. Manuel strengthened into a hurricane Wednesday evening and, as of 8 p.m. (11 p.m. ET), was churning with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of the Pacific coastal city of Altata, Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said. Manuel is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain over the state of Sinaloa, forecasters predicted. While Manuel cast a shadow over the Pacific Coast, a low pressure area on the Gulf side -- the remnants of Ingrid -- continued to batter the coastal states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz. Residents there sent photos to CNN showing streets that looked like rivers, with the tops of cars sticking out of the flood waters. And to the south, over the Yucatan Peninsula, another area of low pressure had a 70% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center said. More than 1 million residents across Mexico have been affected in some way by the storms, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters. Acapulco airport operator Centro Norte Airport Group moved its ticketing process to a convention center because of flooding in the passenger terminals. Several airlines were waiving fees and helping get passengers out as the airport began to operate again. A break in the rain allowed some 2,000 people to be flown from Acapulco to Mexico City as of Tuesday night. Mexico City resident Edgar Nava was one of them. When he arrived in Acapulco Friday and asked about the rains, he said police told him everything was fine. But Nava told CNNMexico he spent four nights terrified and trapped by flooding in an apartment with three friends. He flew out of Acapulco on a military airplane that evacuated tourists on Tuesday, leaving his car behind in the resort city. ""I never imagined it would be like this .... There is no way to take the highway,"" he said. ""Later I will have to figure out how to come back to get it."" The Acapulco city government said some 40,000 tourists had been stranded in the resort destination. The government set up special hotlines to help tourists, and businesses were offering special discounts for those who found themselves stuck. ""The aid is flowing,"" Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto told reporters. ""A large deployment (of resources) is being made specifically to the most affected areas."" The severe weather made it difficult for aid to be airlifted into the hardest-hit areas, but those efforts resumed Wednesday, he said.

"(CNN) -- A vigil for a teen who died in police custody turned violent in Durham, North Carolina, with riot police using tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd. At least six people were arrested at the Thursday night march to protest the death of 17-year-old Jesus Huerta, according to police. ""I could not be more proud of the restraint and professionalism demonstrated by our officers,"" Durham Police Chief Jose Lopez said in a statement to the media, adding that injuries to those marching were minimized because of his officers' actions. ""There was a march. The peaceful intent did not exist. We used the best practices in law enforcement,"" he said at a news conference Friday. Huerta's sister, Evelin Huerta, said a federal investigation is needed. ""The actions of the Durham Police Department, led by Chief Lopez, last night were a tried-and-true tactic to intimidate and spread fear in our community,"" she said. ""We call on Chief Lopez to resign immediately in light of his leadership that put dozens of armed police on the streets to scare residents and turned a memorial vigil into a war zone last night. We will not be intimidated by Chief Lopez and the Durham Police Department's tactics."" Protesters threw bottles and rocks at police officers and vandalized police property, Lopez said, defending his officers' reaction to the vigil. The Durham Police Department says Huerta died on November 19 from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser. The teen was being taken to the police station by Officer Samuel Duncan about 3 a.m. for a second-degree trespassing violation. The chief said at the news conference that gunshot residue tests were conducted on Huerta and the arresting officer, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation ""found that Huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it. Officer Duncan's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands,"" Lopez said. The gun used was not a police firearm, Lopez has said in the past, but state authorities are still investigating where the weapon came from, according to local media. Duncan is on paid administrative leave pending the investigation's conclusion, local media reported. Huerta's family, along with local activists, allege police foul play in the death of Huerta, who was affectionately called ""Chuy"" by his loved ones. Huerta's family has submitted a formal petition to local authorities for archives into the investigation, according to local media. ""People can see that we actually support him and that we need justice for Durham because it's not fair that this is happening, like the police is not giving us answers,"" Evelin Huerta told CNN affiliate WTVD. A separate vigil held last month by the family also turned violent and ended in arrests. The family has said it plans to hold a protest on the 19th of every month. ""Personally, I don't believe one word of what the Durham Police Department has stated,"" local activist Lamont Lilly wrote in an article published shortly after Huerta's death. ""It seems to me, and many others throughout the city, Durham police officers are simply covering their tracks with a concocted story that makes no physical or logical sense whatsoever."" Between 150 and 200 Huerta supporters marched Thursday from Durham City Hall to the parking lot of police headquarters. Some carried banners that read, ""Fue Matado Por La Policia"" or ""Murdered By Police."" Others in attendance alleged police brutality and the use of excessive force by officers at the vigil. ""They didn't really look like batons or night sticks, but they were thinner and longer and they were reaching over the banner, whacking people with them,"" protester David Kaplan told CNN affiliate WTVD. ""They were clearly upset with the fact that people were out expressing themselves and upset at the fact that it appears they murdered a 17-year-old child."" At least one demonstrator suffered minor injuries, and no officers were injured, the police chief said. In a prepared statement, police said, ""Permits are required for such events, but police officials extended compassion to the family by allowing the event. Police officers made several efforts to contact event organizers to ensure a peaceful event, but event organizers refused to speak with the police. The march became violent after participants left police headquarters and returned to downtown."" Images from the scene showed smoke billowing as riot police launched tear gas at the crowd. Some demonstrators wore masks to cover their faces. ""WTH Durham police? #racerelations,"" Monique Vasquez said in a tweet about the clashes. She told CNN her office was near Thursday night's incident. Responding to Spanish-language reporters at the news conference, Lopez said that as a Hispanic, he had trouble believing the allegations among the Hispanic community that Durham police unfairly target Latinos. The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation has looked into three deaths in five months involving Durham police officers, and two of those killed were Latinos, according to CNN affiliate WRAL. A similar case in July stoked skepticism in Jonesboro, Arkansas, when Chavis Carter, 21, died from a close-range gunshot while handcuffed in the back of a police car.","NEW: Jesus Huerta's sister says a federal investigation is needed .

"(Ars Technica) -- Home-brewers who may have dreamt about harnessing the power of Arduino to automate their process may find something to envy in the PicoBrew Zymatic, a project posted to Kickstarter Monday. The machine's makers purport to automate the process of home-brewing from beginning to end; owners simply add their ingredients and come back in a while to processed beer and an easy clean-up solution. Brothers Jim and Bill Mitchell, the latter a former Microsoft executive, constructed the first prototype in 2010 using, among other things, an Arduino controller and a custom heating loop. The two teamed up with Microsoft software architect Avi Geiger in the fall of 2011. More recent versions of the PicoBrew machine moved to custom AMTEGA controller boards and a number of custom parts, some rendered by Geiger himself. With the level of specificity provided by the PicoBrew, the founders state that users should be able to turn out recipes ""precisely on spec."" The machine can also import BeerXML-formatted recipes and translate and scale them to the PicoBrew's setup. The machine is sort of an odd meeting ground between the act of homesteading and using science and commercial techniques on a consumer level. The founders cite the amount of work and hands-on time home-brewing requires, although that's part of the charm for some enthusiasts. At $1,300, it's not really for the casual home-brewer. The PicoBrew has more potential clients in commercial craft breweries. One source in the Kickstarter video, Matt Linecum of Fremont brewery, notes that the machine could be used for quickly testing the quality of ingredients before committing to their use in a full batch.

"(CNN) -- For the past two seasons, Daniela Ruah has played junior field agent Kensi Blye on ""NCIS: Los Angeles."" But the vivacious olive-skinned actress first became famous in another country: her parents' homeland of Portugal. She even won the Iberian version of ""Dancing with the Stars."" Ruah is descended from a family of doctors. Her father is the former resident chief of otolaryngology (which is a fancy word for an eye, ear and throat doctor) at Boston University Hospital and her 92-year-old grandfather still practices medicine. The family moved back to their homeland when Ruah was 5. Fluent in Portuguese, Spanish and English, Ruah moved to London at 18 to attend university and eventually made her way to New York to study at the Lee Strasberg Institute. In her little time off, Ruah loves spending time with her dog and decorating her recently purchased home. She recently spoke with CNN about her show, her heritage and the advice she gets from a famous co-star. CNN: Your character has a big story arc this week. Daniela Ruah: We knew from season one that her father died when she was a teenager and this is the unveiling of what happened. She grew up never believing he had died accidentally. She's always believed foul play and she's been pursuing this her entire life. She gets asked, ""What are you going to do when you find the guy you think did this to your dad? Are you going to shoot him?"" And she says, ""Well, what if I do?"" It's a big dilemma between killing for vengeance and going the right way and dealing with things legally. There's a lot of turmoil going on inside her and it affects the team. CNN: The show is really popular and yet it gets no buzz. Do you ever feel like the redheaded stepchild? Ruah: (Laughs) - Well if I say yes, then I'm insulting redheads. CNN: But you know what I mean. Ruah: I think when it comes to buzz, and I'm just saying this on a very general note and from what I see, it could be completely wrong, but from what I see, buzz tends to come from younger generations, people who buy the products, people who go on the Internet, people who go on blogs. The generation that watches our show seems to be a little bit of an older one and I think that might be the reason. I know a lot of procedurals have huge viewership yet they're never nominated for awards. You never really see, as you say, a lot of buzz around them. CNN: So are you a pinup for 60-year-old men? Ruah: (Laughs) - Whatever floats their boat. It's funny, we have been nominated for a few teen choice awards and I think slowly the writers have managed to create a different appeal for a younger generation with the type of story lines, with the banter we have. CNN: Your character was introduced on the original ""NCIS."" Did you learn anything from the cast? Ruah: Mark Harmon was super sweet. He told me when you have to look at a screen, make sure your eyes are moving around. It makes it look like you're looking harder. Cote de Pablo (Ziva David), the fact that I realized she was in an out of hair and makeup in all of 20 minutes made me go, ""That's what I'm going to do. I refuse to be called in at 5 a.m. to get hair and makeup. I'm an agent; let's keep it simple, a ponytail."" The way they work and support each other. I really like those guys, I really do. CNN:  Your family is Portuguese and Jewish, which is pretty unusual. How many Jews are there, like five? Ruah: Yes and they're all my family! There's I'd say between four- and five-hundred. Not a lot out of 10ÃÂ½ million to 11 million people. My family is probably the biggest family there. But coming from a small community makes you want to follow the traditions of your family much more. CNN: Your dad is a major pooh-bah doctor. Was he disappointed that you wanted to become an actress? Ruah: I remember asking my father if he had preferred that I'd gone into medicine and his exact words were, ""Are you crazy? You have no idea what this lifestyle is like. It's a dog style life, being on call, sleeping at the hospital, studying for the rest of your life because of medical developments, it's research, it's surgery, it's such a long time to educate yourself in the field."" I do have a huge fascination for science and I love to hear what my dad has to say. He used to take me into minor surgeries when I was a kid and let me watch, so I definitely have a passion for it, but it's not as big a passion as I have for acting and creating characters. From the moment I told them this is what I want to do, they were supportive. CNN: You were on the Portuguese version of ""Dancing with the Stars."" Ruah: I did. I won. I got a trophy, but it's not metallic, I think its crystal. It's in my place in Portugal. CNN: Would you do the U.S. version? Ruah: I think there are phases in your life that make sense and I don't see being on ""Dancing with the Stars"" at this point in my life and career. That was that phase. I had a ton of fun, I don't regret it, but I think I'm past that now. I'm onto other things. CNN: What do you do in your time off? Ruah: On my very little time off? I just moved, so a lot of my time is dedicated to buying new furniture. It's the first house I've ever lived in. I've always lived in apartments and condos, so it's a big change for me. CNN: Do you go online a lot looking at sofas? Ruah: I do go online a lot. I was given some advice by [co-star and ""Scent of a Woman"" actor] Chris O'Donnell. He was like, ""Be careful, you're going to start buying items that you love and then you'll put them all together and realize nothing goes together,"" so what I did was buy a couple of pieces that I love and now I'm going to get a decorator to help me tie everything together. CNN: Is Chris O'Donnell your interior adviser? Ruah: Chris and Eric Olsen are really into real estate. Everybody's on the same page, they're just a few years ahead of me. They've had this experience before; I've never had this experience before. Before, when I rented, I was like I'm just going to buy cheap because I'll get rid of it in a year or two and all of a sudden you're buying for five to 10 years. CNN: Now when your friends come over are you like, ""Guys get your feet off the couch?"" Ruah: No, I have a dog so I don't want to come home and take my shoes off [or] otherwise I'll ruin the mint white carpet on the floor. I'd rather have a house that's nice but usable. Plus my friends aren't barbarians. They don't generally put their feet on my couch!","Daniela Ruah plays junior field agent Kensi Blye on ""NCIS: Los Angeles""

"(CNN) -- Wayman Tisdale, who became a successful jazz musician after retiring from pro basketball, died Friday morning after a two-year battle with cancer, his agent said. Wayman Tisdale greets Shaquille O'Neal during a game November 1, 1996. Tisdale, 44, died in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, hospital, where his wife took him when he had trouble breathing early Friday, agent Scott Pang said. Tisdale's death was ""a complete shock"" and came as he prepared to return to the recording studio next week to work on a project with jazz guitarist Norman Brown, Pang said. ""He was a real testament to the power of positive thinking,"" Pang said. ""Even after the cancer and amputating his leg above his knee, he never lost that smile on his face."" Doctors discovered Tisdale's bone cancer after he broke his leg in a fall down a flight of stairs, according to the official biography on his Web site. ""It really showed me what's important in life, man,"" he said in his bio. ""It's not getting as many houses as I can, not driving the biggest cars. What's important is family and being healthy."" Tisdale averaged 15 points and six rebounds a game over a 12-year NBA career, during which he played with the Indiana Pacers, Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns, according to the NBA Web site. ""He was the nicest man in the world with the biggest heart and an even bigger smile,"" Reggie Miller, Tisdale's teammate with the Pacers in the late 1980s, said in a statement to the Indianapolis Star. ""I thank him for befriending me and showing me there is more to life than just basketball."" Sam Perkins, also a former Indiana Pacer and best man at Tisdale's wedding, told the Indianapolis Star that Tisdale's enthusiasm went beyond the court. ""That's a real friend who's got your back and would do just about anything for you,"" Perkins said. ""That smile just gets you. He was upbeat all the time."" Former NBA player and coach Avery Johnson told the Indianapolis Star Tisdale was always smiling and had an unbelievably upbeat attitude. ""Every time he came in a room or before a game, he always had that smile,"" Johnson said. ""Now, he would elbow you afterward, but he always had that smile."" Tisdale was also considered a Sooner superstar during his stint at Oklahoma University. ""Wayman's one of the biggest reasons why I chose Oklahoma,"" said Stacey King, Tisdale's Oklahoma teammate and a former Chicago Bulls player. ""I wanted to be part of something special, and it made logical sense to go to OU, because I wanted to pattern my game after him. I wanted to be like him. People used to talk about 'Be like Mike [Jordan],' but I wanted to be like Wayman. We've lost a special person. I don't think there will ever be another Wayman Tisdale."" His jazz recording career began in 1995, two years before his 1997 NBA retirement, with a debut CD that rose to No. 4 on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart and crossed over onto the R&B charts, the bio said. Subsequent songs -- including ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now,"" ""Can't Hide Love"" and ""Don't Take Your Love Away"" -- were top radio hits. Singer and actor Jamie Foxx praised the basketball star's music career, telling Rolling Stone magazine in 2005 that his all-time backup band would be ""Sheila E on the drums; Herbie Hancock on the keys; Earth, Wind and Fire singing backup vocals; Prince and Slash on guitar; Randy Jackson on percussion; Wayman Tisdale on bass; Kenny G on the sax with Branford Marsalis; and Wynton Marsalis on trumpet."" Tisdale is survived by his wife, four children and one granddaughter.","NEW: Former teammates and friends mourn ""the nicest man in the world""

"(CNN) -- Japan is getting bigger and bigger and bigger -- one volcanic blast at a time. The growth so far -- compared to the size of the Asian nation's main Honshu island or the vast continent of Asia -- is minuscule, about 200 meters (650 feet) long by about 50 meters wide. That's small enough that, if the volcanic activity stops, the newly created island could wash back into the sea in months. But if it keeps going, it could enlarge even more and stick around for the long haul, expanding Japan's footprint in the process. ""A lot of it depends on how fast it erodes,"" said Ken Rubin, a University of Hawaii at Manoa professor and expert in deep submarine volcanism. ""Until it shuts off, it's too soon to tell."" Even it slips away, and even if such volcanoes poke up from the sea floor like this every few years, what's happened so far is exciting for volcanologists. And video of the steady eruption -- a stream of white smoke, interrupted by occasional blasts of blackish material -- is powerful imagery of what's unfolding, even if what's emitted doesn't spew anywhere as high into the sky as land-based volcanoes like El Chichon or Mount Pinatubo. Unlike these deadly examples, this Pacific volcano started its eruption -- on Wednesday, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, at the least -- in shallows off the small, remote island of Nishinoshima, hundreds of miles over sea due south of Tokyo. The national agency since issued a warning for those around the island crater. The most common type of volcano, by far, are those that erupt and spew material underwater: Rubin estimates ""probably more than 80% happen in the oceans, and we never know about them."" Volcanoes that erupt on land get the most attention, for good reason, given their impact on people, vegetation and (by virtue of their expansive eruptions into the atmosphere) on things like air traffic patterns and climate. What's happening near these isolated Japanese islands is more of a sea-land hybrid. It is rooted on the flank of a string of underwater volcanoes a few hundred feet from the main island, Rubin explained. What's being expelled into the air -- a mixture of water that appears as whitish, fluffy steam and darker coarse rock fragments -- is distinct from the magma, he adds. ""In the shallow sea water, ... it causes it to behave explosively,"" Rubin said. ""It's kind of a short-term thing. If it kept growing, it would act differently."" By ""differently,"" he means acting like a more traditional land volcano with the crater well out of the water. Whether or not that happens, people should be able to safely set foot on the island ""pretty soon after it stops erupting,"" Rubin notes -- assuming experts are 100% sure it won't blow again. If it's feasible, say, a year from now, remains to be seen. There was a similar case two years off the Canary Islands in 2011 where there was no breakthrough, and thus no new island. Two years earlier, a new island did emerge in such circumstances near the Pacific island of Tonga -- as happened in 1963 with Surtsey, an island that built up over four years in the 1960s off Iceland.","A volcanic eruption hundreds of miles south of Tokyo forms a new island .

"(CNN) -- One reader called me in tears. Dozens sent e-mails. The overwhelming message: What can we do to help low-income people in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, which has the highest income inequality of any county or parish in the country? CNN featured East Carroll Parish and Lake Providence, the parish's largest town, as part of the Change the List project. It's a place where about 40% live in poverty and 16% are unemployed. There's wealth there, too, but it's far from evenly distributed. Much of the response was incredibly heartwarming and generous. It reminded me that this country does have the empathy and caring it needs to mend our economic divisions. ""I just read portions of your story on Delores Gilmore,"" a prison guard who lives on the poorer side of Lake Providence, ""and I am moved to tears,"" one reader said in an e-mail. ""Although I know that structural change is the only way to truly help people like her, is there a way for me to make a donation to her and her family?"" Another wrote, ""Thank you for the enlightening story. I hope I can help some way."" And here's an excerpt of what I think was the most powerful response, which I received by e-mail: ""I watched this video and read the article this morning sitting in my 1,400-square-foot house, on my iPad. By the end I was bawling. My family is middle-class and we want for nothing. My husband and I are both college graduates, have great benefits, and our two young children have everything they need or want. ... I have been one of those that bemoaned government assistance and had that 'bootstrap' mentality. However, as your article suggests, how can that happen when there are places where there are no opportunities to be had?"" Because so many of you asked how to help, I've compiled a list of a few nonprofit organizations that are helping people find jobs, paying people's electric bills and strengthening neighborhoods in the area. You can find that list below. There's information, too, on how to contact Gilmore, the woman featured in the op-ed ""The most unequal place in America"" and the digital documentary ""Across Lake Providence."" I'd also ask you to participate in CNN iReport's ""Cross the Gap"" project. Part of fixing America's income inequality problems is first acknowledging how wide the rich-poor gap has become. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please send me an e-mail or a message on Twitter. NOVA Workforce Institute of Northeast Louisiana . NOVA, based in nearby Monroe, Louisiana, provides jobs training programs in Lake Providence and surrounding communities. While I was in town, I met a woman who started her own restaurant in part because she was working with the group, and another man who was getting help with resumes and applying for work in the area. NOVA takes donations through its website. Together for Hope . A project of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, Together for Hope tries to reduce poverty in some of the poorest communities in the United States. The group employs a missionary, Jenny Hodge, in Lake Providence. She has organized backpack drives and collected school supplies for all public school students in Lake Providence. Overall, the group focuses on neighborhood development, education and training and economic development. Hodge told me that while the group has a religious affiliation, ""our mission is not to start churches, evangelize or proselytize any specific denomination or faith group."" It's trying to help everyone in the community. Together for Hope takes donations online. There's a field where you can designate funds for Lake Providence, specifically, if you choose. Catholic Charities . A satellite office of Catholic Charities is open in Lake Providence a couple days a week. The group primarily pays utility bills and rent for low-income residents in emergency situations, said Sister Bernadette Barrett, who works with the group locally. Donations can be made online through the Catholic Charities office in Shreveport, Louisiana. Note you want your money to be used in Lake Providence. Contacting Delores Gilmore .

"(CNN) -- A pilot performing stunts in an east Florida air show died in a fiery crash Saturday when the Russian military plane he was flying broke from formation and plummeted to the ground, officials said. No one else was injured, the spokesman said. The incident occured at around 4:30 p.m. E.T. in Bunnell, Florida, at Flagler County Airport, according to Carl Laundrie, the county's communications director. Bunnell is about 25 miles north of Daytona Beach. The pilot, William E. Walker, 58, of Cookeville, Tennessee,was performing at the 2nd Annual Wings over Flagler air show when the crash occurred, according to a media release from the Florida Highway Patrol. The release stated that the crash was not alcohol related. ""During the aerial demonstration, the pilot lost control of the aircraft by unknown reasons,"" the highway patrol release stated. The pilot crashed about a half-mile from spectators attending the event, causing the 1983 Aerostar YAK-52 Russian military trainer aircraft he was flying to burst into flames, according to the highway patrol. The pilot was pronounced dead at the scene, the release stated. The fire was quickly extinguished and the remainder of the Saturday air show was canceled, Laundrie said. Event organizers plan to resume the show on Sunday, Laundrie said. Specialists with the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were headed to the crash site Saturday to open an investigation of the crash, according to the highway patrol.

"(CNN) -- At one point during her alleged imprisonment, the 19-year-old woman got hold of a razor blade. She thought about how it could be used. She considered cutting the man who was holding her hostage, a relative, so she could escape from his physical and sexual abuse. She also weighed whether to kill herself. But in the end, the woman decided that trying to get away wouldn't work, so she tossed the blade. The abuse continued. Those and other allegations were lodged in a complaint against Timothy Jay Vafeades, 53, who was charged Monday in Clay County, Minnesota, with kidnapping, false imprisonment and domestic abuse. Vafeades, a trucker, was arrested there last week after a routine scale inspection turned up that he had an active protection order against him and that the 19-year-old woman -- his passenger -- was the protected party. The inspection also determined there was an active warrant for him out of Sarasota County, Florida. More than six months earlier, the woman had left Sarasota to join Vafeades with the understanding that she could help with his trucking business, earn up to $10,000 and return home, the complaint says. He paid for her plane ticket out to Salt Lake City, Utah. That first night, she allegedly woke up to find Vafeades under the blankets on her bed, performing a sex act. She was scared and stunned and said she didn't want a sexual relationship with her relative, the complaint says. Vafeades allegedly told her that he had no intention of allowing her to leave or go back to Florida. He took her driver's license and Social Security card. The woman told investigators that she then started to accompany Vafeades on deliveries throughout the United States. The truck had a single bed, and they slept in it together. She and Vafeades had sex every two to three days, the complaint says. It goes on to describe several strange and controlling behaviors. Vafeades allegedly did not let the woman use public restrooms at rest stops or truck stops, nor did he allow her to take showers alone at truck stops. He also did not allow her to be alone or walk around truck stops by herself. They were required to hold hands. If he so much as thought she made eye contact with someone, he would yell and hit her back at the truck, the complaint says. The woman estimated Vafeades had hit her between 20 and 30 times. When he was arrested, the woman had a black eye, which she told investigators Vafeades had given her. He wore bracelets that he referred to as his ""slave bracelets,"" the complaint says. He would use those to hit her. Vafeades allegedly told the woman he was capable of killing her, and she believed he could. The woman sometimes referred to Vafeades as the ""Dentist,"" as he had several pairs of false teeth and an apparent obsession with vampires. He had one set of dentures made to look like vampire teeth and had ordered a set of false teeth for the woman, the complaint says. He also allegedly filed down certain teeth in her mouth. ""It's definitely very unique circumstances and definitely very predatory behavior,"" said Clay County prosecutor Brian Melton. Vafeades' attorney, Rex Tucker, declined to comment Tuesday. CNN was not immediately able to determine whether Vafeades had an opportunity to enter a plea. According to Melton, bond in the case was set at $1 million. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","Timothy Vafeades is charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment, domestic abuse .

After spending a couple of days basking on sparkling beaches and floating in turquoise waters, choose from almost endless activities: snorkeling, scuba diving, surfing, paragliding -- or kayaking your way to a secluded beach. And then there's the jungle, where the rush of water and cries of insects, birds and howler monkeys create a wild harmony that beckons you to enter. Punta del Diablo, Uruguay . In the past decade, this little fishing village of colorful cabaÃÂ±as (cabins) has become a kind of beach bum boom town, but it still retains a certain authenticity that some other towns along Uruguay's Atlantic coast have lost. Don't come here looking for the fashionable party scene and upscale hotels of Punta del Este, a favorite retreat of Argentines 120 miles to the south of here. The charm of Punta del Diablo is its complete lack of pretension. A five-hour bus journey (three and a half hours by car) from Montevideo takes you through rolling green hills and palm-studded cow pastures. But the asphalt ends as you enter Punta del Diablo. From here on, it's pine trees, vast sand dunes and crashing waves along local beaches that start in town and extend for miles along a wooded national park called Santa Teresa. In January and February, the town fills up, predominantly with Uruguayans, Brazilians and Argentines. But in December and March, it's much quieter. Thatched-roof beachside restaurants and bars serve fresh fish and pasta, or order a local specialty from one of the modest food stalls: fish or mussel empanadas, for about $2.50 a piece, washed down with Pilsen, the local beer. Rent a surf or boogie board or simply wander the dunes and beaches until you find your own private cove. Bicycle rentals are also available for exploring Santa Teresa, where you'll see birds and other wildlife. Road trip from South Africa to Namibia . Here's another epic driving adventure: a two-week trip from Cape Town to Namibia's Skeleton Coast. It's a journey that will take you through some of the most starkly beautiful, barren landscapes on Earth as well as to parks teeming with life. The drive starts in South Africa's scenic Western Cape province, winding through hills that plunge dramatically into the wild South Atlantic. You can plan excursions in West Coast National Park, home to seabirds, wildebeests, ostriches, tortoises and Cape mountain zebras. Here you can can kite surf, kayak, water ski, dive, fish and mountain bike. Carry on up the coast and cross into Namibia to see Fish River Canyon, known as the Grand Canyon of Africa. It's too hot to hike into the canyon during summer, but the views are incredible. Further north is the Namib-Naukluft National Park, an enormous conservation area in the Namib Desert. A sunrise trek up Sossusvlei, one of the tallest sand dunes in the world, is a must. To beat the intense summer heat, plan to arrive when the gates open at sunrise and hustle to the summit, where the morning light on the red dunes makes for spectacular photographs. After a stopover in Swakopmund, an odd seaside resort town that's a relic of Namibia's German colonial history, drive to the heart of the Skeleton Coast. Here the desert meets the sea at one of the most desolate places in the world. Shipwrecks litter its beaches, and at first glance there's little evidence of life, though you may spot a rare desert elephant or sea lions. It is hauntingly beautiful, especially when thick mists drift along eerie, barren beaches and through gold and red dunes. Next, cut inland to Etosha National Park, one of Africa's most incredible wildlife sanctuaries. You'll have the chance to spot lions, zebras, giraffes, rare black rhinos and leopards, as well as flamingos, ostriches and hundreds of other species of birds. On the way back to South Africa, stop at the Orange River, where you can refresh with a canoeing or kayaking trip amid more beautiful rock formations. Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand . About two hours' drive from Auckland, a narrow bit of land on the northeast side of New Zealand's North Island offers the chance to hike through native rain forests, go wine tasting and bury yourself in hot mud on an unusual beach. The brilliant blue waters off the Coromandel Peninsula are great for sea kayaking, snorkeling and diving; visit the Cathedral Cove Marine Reserve to see amazing underwater arches and coral reefs teeming with life. Coromandel is well-known for its walking trails, from a leisurely stroll through the cool forest to more rigorous hikes such as the Pinnacles Trail, which takes you first on an easy path through a river valley and eventually up a steeper trail to the summit where you'll be treated to breathtaking views of both sides of the peninsula. Your visit to Coromandel won't be complete without a visit to Hot Water Beach. The beach lies above two hot springs, which are only accessible at low tide. People flock to the beach with shovels to dig out their own steaming mud bath before the tide comes in and restores the sandy beach for the next seaside ""spa"" experience.","Why not chase summer all the way to the Southern Hemisphere?

"(CNN) -- The leader of a Tunisian militant Islamist group was arrested in Libya on Monday, state media reported, citing a security source. Libyan and American forces captured the militant leader, Tunisie Agence Presse reported. But the United States denied any involvement in the reported arrest of Seifallah Ben Hussein Mokni, who is also known as Abu Iyadh and heads Ansar al Sharia in Tunisia. ""Contrary to media reports, U.S. forces were not involved in any operations involving Ansar al Sharia leader Abu Iyadh today in Libya,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John F. Kirby told CNN. The Tunisian state media report accused Ansar al Sharia in Tunisia of ties to political assassinations in the country. Ansar al Sharia in Tunisia denied through its official Twitter account that its leader had been arrested in Libya. The statement said that the ""lying media"" reported the ""false rumors"" to ""play a dirty game"" and influence its members to respond physically.

"(CNN) -- While European carriers are facing turbulent times, some Asian airlines are hoping that a cut-price long-haul model will find a ready market in Asia's growing middle class. Globally, low-cost carriers have been the industry's success story over the past decade, with their market share rising from 8% of all seats sold in 2001 to nearly 26% this year, according to the Centre for Aviation. Budget airlines have largely focused on short- to medium-haul routes, with their success in winning passengers through low fares forcing many full-service ""legacy carriers"" to launch their own low-cost options in response. Efforts to apply the low-cost model to longer-haul travel -- most notably on trans-Atlantic routes -- have repeatedly met with failure, as witnessed in the collapse of Laker Airways in 1982, and Zoom Airlines in 2008. But now, in Asia, an increasing number of operators are beginning to offer long-haul air travel for low fares, opening a new frontier in the fiercely competitive aviation market. See also: Singapore stopover: Make the most of your travel time . Singapore Airlines' budget offering, Scoot, will begin operations later this year, joining Malaysia's AirAsia X and Australia's Jetstar, a Qantas subsidiary, in flying long-haul in the region. Scoot plans to fly to five destinations in Australia, Japan and China in its first year, before targeting other routes. Cebu Pacific, a budget carrier from the Philippines, will enter the market next year with a long-haul service targeting the Filipino Diaspora in the Middle East and further afield. Scoot CEO Campbell Wilson told CNN's Richard Quest that the low-cost market was rapidly growing in Asia. ""In eight years in Singapore, it's gone from nothing to about 25% of Changi's (Airport) throughput. There's a market that wants to travel no frills and wants to travel further afield."" Wilson denied that Scoot would simply cannibalize Singapore Airlines' existing customers, saying it was targeted to appeal to a separate, price-conscious customer base oriented towards leisure travel. ""I believe there's a whole market that doesn't even consider some airlines because of their positioning in the market, because of the perceived expense of flying, and because of the bells and whistles that they might not want,"" he said. But some have questioned the viability of low-cost long-haul as a business model. Scoot's launch will come on the back of news that AirAsia X is pulling out of its long-haul routes to Europe, after three years of flying into London and one year into Paris. AirAsia X CEO Asran Osman-Rani told Quest that the decision was due to specific issues with the European market, rather than with the low-cost long-haul model itself. ""That's unfortunately the reality of where Europe is today,"" he said. ""What we've seen over the second half of 2011 was that the number of Europeans in our passengers were steadily declining as a reflection of the economic situation. People were more worried about jobs, and leisure travel becomes one of the first things that gets cut back."" AirAsia X has subsequently announced it will suspend its services to Christchurch, New Zealand, from the end of May -- a decision it blamed on the spiralling cost of jet fuel. But Osman-Rani said the airline had proven low-cost long-haul worked in markets like China and Australia. ""I think there's nothing structurally wrong with the model,"" Osman-Rani added. ""I think it can work."" Andrew Cowen, managing partner of Mango Aviation, an advisory firm specializing in low-cost airline start-ups, agrees. He said Asia was a logical market for long-haul budget carriers to succeed, as a natural outgrowth of the low-cost short-haul carriers that had proliferated in the region in response to deregulation of the aviation industry. ""You've got an emerging and growing middle class in Asia, with increasing aspiration and ability to travel,"" said Cowen. ""It's also an extremely price-conscious market."" He did not believe that the lack of service and legroom provided by budget airlines would necessarily be a fatal turn-off for customers facing a 10-hour long-haul flight -- as long as the fares were low enough. See also: Business Traveller in Singapore . ""No entertainment? You can solve it by having your own iPad or PSP. Free food on a flag carrier, or buy it yourself on a low-cost carrier? It's not an issue. Most of us will have a bite to eat at the airport and can purchase something extra on board if necessary,"" he said. ""Besides, in economy class on the flag carriers there's not a lot of leg room to begin with."" Cowen added that low-cost carriers could pack up to 25% extra passenger seats in their aircraft, and also had a ""big advantage"" in not facing the substantial infrastructure costs borne by the legacy carriers, who were being forced to get into the low-cost sector themselves. ""They've realized if they don't, they're going to lose the market anyway,"" he said. Cannibalization needn't be a problem, according to Cowen. The success of a budget carrier like Jetstar in operating alongside its full-service counterpart Qantas shows how the two brands could collaborate to serve different segments of the market without poaching each other's customers. ""All of us don't drive a Mercedes Benz and all of us don't drive a Volkswagen Golf,"" he said. He predicted that Asia's four budget long-haul carriers would all succeed in the market. And, in a prediction likely to be welcomed by travelers the world over, he said that other low-cost, long-haul carriers were likely to follow in Asia, and in other regions when market conditions were right. ""I think we're going to see a lot more low-cost long-haul coming into the market,"" he said. ""It's only a matter of time.""","Four budget airlines in Asia will be flying long-haul routes by 2013 .
Skeptics doubt that the low-cost, long-haul model will work .

"(CNN) -- The Arab League formally recognized the new National Coalition Forces of the Syrian Revolution, state media in Qatar reported Monday. Various opposition groups agreed to form the new coalition Sunday. State-run news agency QNA reported the 22-member body approved the resolution to recognize the group, which unites Syrian opposition factions. Algeria and Iraq abstained from some of the provisions of the measure, said Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar. Father: Syrian government denies holding missing journalist . Al-Thani disputed that there was any difference in the position of the Arab League's vote and that of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-member group. ""That claim is absolutely untrue, and the position of the two parties is identical"" except for Algeria's and Iraq's reluctance to fully support the measure, QNA reported al-Thani as saying. Opposition forces in Syria have not had a unified vision for the country or single military plan to oust President Bashar al-Assad during the nearly two years of civil war. So the United States and Arab nations pressured the groups to get on the same page. After U.S. election, new push on Syria . Syrian opposition factions formally agreed Sunday in Doha, Qatar, to unite as the new National Coalition Forces of the Syrian Revolution, a spokesman for the Syrian National Council told CNN. First, the group agreed that they want al-Assad gone and that no one would talk with his regime. The only option, they concluded, is a totally new government, spokesman Mohammed Dugham said. SNC member Ahmed Muaz al-Khatib was selected chairman of the coalition. He is a former Sunni imam of the historic Ummayad mosque in Damascus. He has been detained at least three times since March 2011, most recently in April, according to a Facebook page created to promote his release. After his latest release he left the country, the page said. The new vice presidents are Riad Seif, a prominent dissident and businessman from Damascus who served in the Syrian parliament as an independent, and Suhair Atassi, who is from a prominent Syrian family and is well-known for being outspoken against the government. She has also been an advocate for women's rights, calling the civil war a revolution for equality. Al-Assad has his own group called the Syrian Human Rights Network. It accuses those who met to hash out the agreement -- and the countries who supported the meeting -- of sponsoring terrorism. Al-Assad has consistently refused to acknowledge the civil war in Syria, saying repeatedly his government is fighting foreign-backed ""terrorists"" bent on destabilizing the nation. In other developments regarding Syria: . Israel: We cannot intervene . Israeli President Shimon Peres played down his nation's response to the mortars from Syria that hit the Golan Heights, territory Israel has occupied for nearly four decades. ""The bloodshed which I regret so much in Syria has nothing to do with Israel, nothing whatsoever,"" Peres said in an interview with CNN on Monday. ""As an Israeli watching what has happened in Syria, I can hardly stand to see babies being killed by tanks of their own government. But we cannot intervene."" Israel returned fire in the direction that the mortars came from, marking the first exchange of fire with Syria between Israel and the war-torn country since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. ""We never took an initiative to fire,"" Peres said. ""And we don't take any advantage of the civil war in Syria. We don't consider that we should or can intervene."" He added, however, that ""if they want to have an additional war ... well, that's their choice."" The Israeli Defense Forces reported that there was no damage and no injuries, but the latest fire portends how what's happening in Syria could seriously rattle the entire region. The Golan is regarded internationally as occupied territory despite Israeli governmental control. It is home to 41,000 residents, including Jews, Druze and Alawites. Israel seized the territory from Syria during the 1967 Israel-Arab war, and it was eventually annexed. In addition to returning fire, Israel filed a complaint with the United Nations forces operating in the area. Fire coming from Syria into Israel ""will not be tolerated and shall be responded to with severity,"" the complaint said, according to Israeli military sources. Israeli Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich said she doesn't think the fire from Syria into Israel was intentional. ""We interpret it as ... leaks into Israel territory,"" she said. ""It's totally internal conflict in Syria. We believe that Israel is not the target here. We are looking at either stray bullets or stray mortars."" Peres said he hopes Syria won't make the same mistake again. Syria ""must understand their own limitations,"" he said. ""But if it ever happens, we shall defend ourselves -- that's what I can say. I don't want to exaggerate and to make great declarations and bellicose interests."" Peres continued, ""No, we are not interested. We understand that Syria has enough problems of their own. And it doesn't give us again any pleasure. But if they endanger our lives, we shall defend ourselves. That's what I can say in a certain manner. And I don't want to fire declarations because I don't like fire -- unnecessarily anyway."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reacted with a statement Sunday saying he ""is deeply concerned by the potential for escalation."" ""He calls for the utmost restraint and urges Syria and Israel to uphold the Disengagement Agreement, respect their mutual obligations, and halt firing of any kind across the cease-fire line,"" the U.N. statement said. Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, told CNN Sunday that ""a greater possibility"" from the exchange of fire ""is the inundation of refugees -- Christian, Druze, Alawites."" ""We'd give them refuge,"" Oren said. ""These are populations with which we have good relations. It's not unprecedented. We've been prepared for it for a long time, but it hasn't happened."" Peres, asked whether Israel would accept refugees from Syria, said: ""There are 24 Arab countries. There is one Jewish country. There are places. They speak Arabic. They are Muslims. Why should they come to Israel?"" He noted that there are Muslims in Israel, ""and we respect the Muslims here. They are our citizens."" But, he said, ""to add more doesn't make sense. There is a huge Arab world. Israel is ... of the space of the Middle East. ... They want to be Muslims. They want to be nations. Why create an artificial problem? What for?"" The solution, he said, is ""to stop the war and not create more refugees."" Sunday's incident in the Golan Heights area is the fourth U.N. complaint Israel has filed. So far no one has been injured. Syrian tanks entered the Golan Heights demilitarized zone last week and fired into Syria; bullets fired at the tanks in response struck an Israeli military vehicle in part of the Golan Heights that Israel claims as its own. Mortars also fell in part of the Golan that Israel considers its territory. Attacks across Syria . At least 155 people were found dead across Syria Monday after 90 people were killed Sunday, the LCC reported. More than 35,000 people are believed to have been killed in the fighting that began in March 2011, and more than 400,000 people have been displaced, according to opposition and U.N. estimates. Israeli airstrikes hit targets in Gaza .

"(CNN) -- At least 25 people were killed in what the United Nations called Friday a shocking escalation of violence in Ivory Coast, wracked by an electoral crisis that many fear is sliding toward another civil war. Doctors Without Borders treated 66 people with gunshot wounds and injuries caused by shell explosions in the wake of the attacks, according to a news release from the medical aid group. Women and children were among those injured, the statement said. France, Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, condemned Thursday's ""deliberate massacre of civilians"" and called on the U.N. Security Council to adopt sanctions against self-declared President Laurent Gbagbo and his circle, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero. The international community has widely recognized Gbagbo's challenger, Alassane Ouattara, as the winner of a November election and the legitimate leader of the west African nation. But Gbagbo has refused to cede power, with the stalemate resulting in uncertainty and bloodshed. The United Nations refugee agency reported heavy shelling in the Abobo neighborhood of Abidjan was responsible for the deaths. Many more were injured. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon condemned the shelling and urged the U.N. Security Council to take ""further measures"" against those found responsible for the violence. He said the U.N. would ""continue to take the necessary steps to protect the civilian population."" A statement from Amnesty International provided more details about the violence Thursday. Mortar shells fell on a market, the rights group said, describing it as one of the most serious incidents in the city since the current crisis erupted. ""This afternoon, before one o'clock prayers, women were selling their goods in the market ... in Abobo,"" an eyewitness told an Amnesty International researcher. ""Everything was quiet when suddenly we heard an awful sound and a shell hit the ground. At least 10 people, mainly women, were killed and others wounded."" Another eyewitness told the group's researcher that the attacks came just after prayers.  ""A woman ... came in with her baby,"" according to the news release. ""She was hit by a shell and died in the hospital a few hours afterwards. Her baby was wounded. Another 16 month-year-old baby was killed by the same shell."" Earlier in the week, attacks were reported in other parts of Abidjan, the commercial center of Ivory Coast, said a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""We are shocked at the escalating violence in (Ivory Coast), particularly in Abidjan, where this week was by far the most violent since the post-election crisis began,""  the agency spokesman said at a briefing Friday. A UNHCR monitor reported that 30 shops were burned Thursday and empty bullet shell casings littered the streets. A community radio station was also attacked and set on fire in the neighborhood of Adjame, and sporadic gunfire was heard in several districts of Yopougon, where heavy fighting took place Monday. The intensifying urban warfare has displaced hundreds of thousands of people attempting to flee to safer ground. About 75,000 have crossed borders, most into Liberia, according to the U.S. State Department. But thousands of others are out of their homes within Ivory Coast. Humanitarian agencies have reported hampered aid distribution due to security concerns and harassment. Human Rights Watch has blamed the violence on Gbagbo's security forces and said their actions give ""every indication of amounting to crimes against humanity.""","NEW: Women and children are among the dead in market attack, says Doctors Without Borders .

"(CNN) -- By the early 2020s, we will have the means to program our biology away from disease and aging. Up until recently, health and medicine was basically a hit or miss affair. We would discover interventions such as drugs that had benefits, but also many side effects. Until recently, we did not have the means to actually design interventions on computers. All of that has now changed, and will dramatically change clinical practice by the early 2020s. We now have the information code of the genome and are making exponential gains in modeling and simulating the information processes they give rise to. Read more: Le Web, the next ten years . We also have new tools that allow us to actually reprogram our biology in the same way that we reprogram our computers. RNA interference, for example, can turn genes off that promote disease and aging. New forms of gene therapy, especially in vitro models that do not trigger the immune system, have the ability to add new genes. Stem cell therapies, including the recently developed method to create ""induced pluripotent cells"" (IPCs) by adding four genes to your own skin cells to create the equivalent of an embryonic stem cell but without use of an embryo, are being developed to rejuvenate organs and even grow then from scratch. There are now hundreds of drugs and processes in the pipeline using these methods to modify the course of obesity, heart disease, cancer, and other diseases and aging processes. As one of many examples, we can now fix a broken heart -- not (yet) from romance -- but from a heart attack, by rejuvenating the heart with reprogrammed stem cells. Read more: Could Siri say dump him? Health and medicine is now an information technology and is therefore subject to what I call the ""law of accelerating returns,"" which is a doubling of capability (for the same cost) about each year that applies to any information technology. As a result, technologies to reprogram the ""software"" that underlie human biology are already a thousand times more powerful than they were when the genome project was completed in 2003, and will again be a thousand times more powerful than they are today in a decade, and a million times more powerful in two decades. Clinical applications are now at the cutting edge and will be routine in the early 2020s. By 2030 solar energy will have the capacity to meet all of our energy needs. The production of food and clean water will also be revolutionized. If we could capture one part in ten thousand of the sunlight that falls on the Earth we could meet 100% of our energy needs, using this renewable and environmentally friendly source. As we apply new molecular scale technologies to solar panels, the cost per watt is coming down rapidly. Already Deutsche Bank, in a recent report, wrote ""The cost of unsubsidized solar power is about the same as the cost of electricity from the grid in India and Italy. By 2014 even more countries will achieve solar 'grid parity.'"" The total number of watts of electricity produced by solar energy is growing exponentially, doubling every two years. It is now less than seven doublings from 100%. Read more: Can African unlock its solar potential? Similar approaches will address other resource needs. Once we have inexpensive energy we can readily and inexpensively convert the vast amount of dirty and salinated water we have on the planet to usable water. We are also headed towards another agriculture revolution, from horizontal agriculture to vertical agriculture, where we grow very high quality food in AI controlled buildings. These will recycle all nutrients and end the ecological disaster that constitutes contemporary factory farming. This will include hydroponic plants for fruits and vegetables and in vitro cloning of muscle tissue for meat, that is meat without animals, thereby ending animal suffering. By the early 2020s we will print out a significant fraction of the products we use including clothing as well as replacement organs. 3D printing is getting a lot of attention. There are niche applications such as printing our replacement parts for machinery, but the opportunity to begin replacing significant portions of manufacturing is still about five years away. If we look at the life cycle of technologies we see an early period of over-enthusiasm, then a ""bust"" when disillusionment sets in, followed by the real revolution. Remember the Internet boom of the 1990s followed by the Internet bust around the year 2000? That was around the time Google was getting started, and now we have multi-hundred billion dollar Internet companies. We're in the early boom phase of 3D printing enthusiasm and hopefully we've learned enough to avoid a period of undue disillusionment, but I do see the early 2020s as the golden era of 3D printing. For example, in the early 2020s, you'll have a choice of many thousands of cool clothing designs that are open source and that can be printed out for pennies a pound. Explore: Is 3D printing the dawn of a revolution? But that will not mean the end of the fashion industry. Look at other industries that have already been transformed from physical products to digital ones, such as books, movies and music. Despite enormous changes in business models (and the availability of many free open source products) the overall revenues for proprietary forms of these products remains strong. We can already experimentally print out organs by printing a biodegradable scaffolding and then populating it with a patient's own stem cells, all with a 3D printer. By the early 2020s, this will reach clinical practice. Within five years, search engines will be based on an understanding of natural language. Consider that IBM's Watson got a higher score on the American television game of Jeopardy than the best two human players combined. Jeopardy is a broad task involving complicated natural language queries which include puns, riddles, jokes and metaphors. For example, Watson got this query correct in the rhyme category: ""A long tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping."" It correctly responded ""What is a meringue harangue."" Read more: I'm the voice of Siri . What is not widely appreciated is that Watson got its knowledge by reading Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias, a total of 200 million pages of natural language documents. I does not read each page as well as you or I. It might read one page and conclude that there is a 56% chance that Barack Obama is President of the United States. You could read that page, and if you didn't happen to know that ahead of time, conclude that there is a 98% chance. So you did a better job than Watson at reading that page. But Watson makes up for this relatively weak reading by reading more pages, a lot more, and it can combine its inferences across everything it has read and conclude that there is a 99.9% chance that Obama is president. At Google, we are creating a system that will read every document on the web and every book for meaning and provide a rich search and question answering experience based on the true meaning of natural language. For example, it will engage you in dialogue to clarify questions and discuss answers that are ambiguous or complex. By the early 2020s we will be routinely working and playing with each other in full immersion visual-auditory virtual environments. By the 2030s, we will add the tactile sense to full immersion virtual reality. The telephone is virtual reality in that you can meet with someone as if you are together, at least for the auditory sense. We've now added the visual sense with video conferencing -- although not yet 3D and full immersion. The visual sense will become full immersion over the next decade. We'll also be able to augment real reality so that I could see you sitting on the coach in my living room and you could see me sitting on your back porch, even though we're hundreds of miles apart. Your augmented reality glasses will also be able to make suggestions to you for an interesting joke or anecdote that you could slip into a conversation you're having. There will be limited ways of adding the tactile sense to virtual and augmented reality by the early 2020s, but full immersion virtual tactile experiences will require tapping directly into the nervous system. We'll be able to do that in the 2030s with nanobots traveling noninvasively into the brain through the capillaries and augmenting the signals coming from our real senses.

"(CNN) -- Fashion luminaries Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were sentenced to prison in Italy Wednesday for failing to pay 40.4 million euros in taxes to the Italian government, their lawyer and a prosecutor said. ""This time it was not the case like the invoice for car repair,"" prosecutor Laura Pedio said of the crime for which the fashion duo was convicted. ""This time it's serious, complicated, sophisticated tax fraud crime."" Both men were sentenced to one year and eight months in prison and, in addition to what they owe in taxes, told to pay a fine of 500,000 euros. Their lawyer, Massimo Dinoia, vowed that the defense plans to appeal the convictions as well as the related fines and sentences. ""Dolce and Gabbana will not go to jail now or ever,"" Dinoia said. Dolce & Gabbana, fashion's golden duo . Four others associated with the upscale Dolce & Gabbana brand -- including Domenico's brother Alfonso Dolce and company tax consultant Luciano Patelli -- also face prison time, though Dinoia and Pedio did not know the length of all their sentences. While the decision was announced Wednesday morning in a Milan court, authorities did not immediately release details to the media or public. According to Pedio, investigators found that between 2004 and 2007 Dolce and Gabbana failed to tell Italian authorities about an offshoot company they'd set up in Luxembourg, costing Italy millions of euros in taxes. ""I'm very satisfied with the sentence,"" the prosecutor said. ""It was a very elaborate (use of an offshore company) that appeared legal, but was illegal."" The fashion magnates' defense team said this wasn't a sweeping verdict. In a statement, the lawyers said the court found Dolce and Gabbana innocent ""of the accusation of having unfaithfully declared their earnings,"" even as the two men were convicted on a ""taxes declaration omission."" It's not clear how the court ruling will impact the storied Dolce & Gabbana company, if at all. The two stylists debuted their brand in an October 1985 show in Milan. Since then, they have exploded to become one of the world's most recognizable and desired fashion companies, with an array of products and stores from Azerbaijan to Qatar to Singapore to the United States and many places in between.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- It's small, affluent, tech-savvy and it has a very obvious pollution problem -- Hong Kong is arguably an ideal destination for electric cars. MyCar, the electric vehicle developed in Hong Kong, would be perfect for the city, but faces big obstacles. And despite the absence of a car-making industry, the city can now boast a home-made electric car all of its own. MyCar, a two-seater micro car, will roll of the production line for the very first time in October and will be available for purchase. But you won't find it on sale in Hong Kong. Hong Kong still hasn't got its act together when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), according to the chief executive of MyCar's manufacturer, EuAuto Technology, Chung Sin-ling. She says the city lacks the necessary framework and policies that would make it viable for her company to sell MyCar here. So they are heading to Europe instead. ""In London they have government incentives to get people to switch from gasoline to electric vehicles,"" explains Chung, citing the waiver of the congestion charge and free parking for EVs in London as an example. ""But that has to be driven by the government. In Hong Kong they are still debating whether to use diesel or whatever."" Hong Kong is not without EVs though. Private organizations like local utility Hong Kong Electric has its own small fleet of them. But according to Chung, the restrictions they have to operate under mean introducing them now into the mass market isn't practical. ""[Hong Kong Electric] only use them inside their private site and they have to get a very special licence and they can't drive outside their site and they are restricted to certain uses,"" she says. ""We don't want those kinds of restrictions."" Make it hip, make it affordable . Europe to date has taken the lead when it comes to encouraging motorists to drive cleaner cars. Most notably, London has cracked down on car-related pollution with the introduction of a congestion charge and, more recently, with additional fees for heavier polluting cars to pay on top. Under the rules of the Low Emission Zone, for example, fees as high as $400 can be imposed on trucks and vans trying to enter Greater London that are more than six years old. ""There should be very high incentives for people [to drive EVs],"" says chairman of local pollution lobby group, Clear the Air, Christian Masset. But Masset says the political will is still not there to promote EVs in the city. He believes it is down to the market to stir up interest. ""This will only happen with market pressure - it is hard to see it otherwise,"" says Masset. ""If the EV became hip, then it would have an effect."" But in order for this kind of customer pressure to happen, customers need to want the cars in the first place. That's about education, says Professor Eric Cheng, director of the Power Electronics Research Center at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, whose team was involved in the MyCar project. And education needs to come from the government, he says. ""The government is not helping the car user,"" says Cheng. ""It hasn't put any special mechanism in place, any special law or regulation for motorists to drive EVs. I don't think the government has done anything to persuade motorists to use EVs."" Hong Kongers are not familiar with EVs he says, and are concerned about the technology so they need to be shown that EVs are just as good as petrol cars. One obvious way to demonstrate that would be to change the public transportation system from diesel-fueled to electric-powered, he says. ""Taxis, minibuses, buses can be forced to go electric but the government isn't doing anything,"" says Cheng. The government has in the past offered one-off grants to minibus drivers ranging from $7,000 to $10,000 to encourage them to convert from diesel to either LPG or electric. However Cheng says stronger measures are needed. ""Voluntary schemes do not work. The government needs to put a mandatory scheme [in place], to start off with public transport so people can get used to it and see that it is good."" And then there is the question of money. Cheng says the amount of money his department received to design MyCar was nowhere near enough and to him, it told him how important the government view EVs. ""The money involved was very small. It was about $130,000 for MyCar. It's nonsense. You need tens of millions of dollars. How can we build a new generation of EVs for Hong Kong? We need to train the new engineers, the graduates, technicians,"" he says. ""Car-makers want subsidies from the government, as the initial costs are very high. The government needs to give them financial support and I am not talking about one or two million Hong Kong dollars. We also need more investment in R&D."" In the meantime Chung is making plans to sell MyCar in London, her first stop the London Motor Show in July to stir up some more interest. One day she hopes to come back to Hong Kong. She says EuAuto Technology is ready now. The market isn't though. And that, she says, is something that is in the government's hands. ""We want to come here -- as long as the policy is there to make it happen,"" says Chung. ""It would be sad and kind of ironic if we can sell them all over the world and not in our own home town. ""We have the customer, the market demand, and the product - we just need the government to support it.""","New electric vehicle, MyCar, developed in Hong Kong, but won't be sold there .
Lack of government and market interest means MyCar will be sold in Europe .

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin state Sen. Glenn Grothman, who supports Gov. Scott Walker's repeal of a law that protected workers from pay discrimination, recently said, ""You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious."" As a graduating student surrounded by classmates about to assume their first jobs, I assure the senator that none of my female classmates is thinking, ""Salary isn't that important to me. I don't plan to work hard and don't need to be paid fairly, because I won't be a breadwinner. A man will come along to take care of that for me."" Instead, many young women about to enter the workforce are focused on paying off their student loan debt. Those who are also mothers are worried about how to financially provide for, and simultaneously care for, their young children. The single moms among us face even larger challenges. And we are worried about our sisters who don't have college degrees and so don't have the same earning power. What female students might not remember is that the men with whom we stand shoulder-to-shoulder at graduation don't face the same financial challenges. Many young women of my generation believe they live in a post-feminist world, without unfair sex discrimination -- a world in which career paths are designed with fathers and mothers in mind. Unfortunately, that world doesn't exist quite yet. A significant gender pay gap still persists. That's why we cannot be passive as we acknowledge Equal Pay Day, which marks the day when a woman's earnings catch up to what her male peers earned in the previous year. To millennials, it's startling to see that women still earn just 77 cents to the dollar of what men earn. Women of color are hit especially hard: African-American and Hispanic women earn 70% and 61%, respectively, of what white men earn. Without any male income in their household, single women and lesbians may feel the pay gap effect all the more. This wage gap costs working women and their families more than $10,000 annually and jeopardizes women's retirement security. This gap isn't just about women making different choices in their careers. Even after accounting for occupation, hours worked, education, age, race, ethnicity, marital status, number of children and more, a difference of 5% still persists in the earnings of male and female college graduates one year after graduation. After 10 years in the workplace, that gap more than doubles to 12%. Today we are fortunate to have critical laws like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, which overturned a 2007 Supreme Court decision that made it harder for women -- and all employees -- to pursue federal claims of pay discrimination. Although this important law restored fairness for workers who want to use federal law to challenge cases of discriminatory pay, it only addresses one piece of the larger puzzle. More needs to be done. Paycheck discrimination is not the only obstacle preventing women from having the same economic opportunities as men. As our country continues to focus on our economic recovery, leveling the financial playing field for women must be a priority. According to recent predictions, within a generation, more families will be supported by women than men. If these primary breadwinners earn lower incomes, it won't just affect their families, but also consumer spending and our larger financial growth. For starters, we need to further close the pay gap by fulfilling the promise of equal pay for work of equal value. Entire employment sectors shouldn't be paid less because they're considered ""women's work."" Because so much of ""women's work"" is paid at minimum wage, one way to begin to address this is to pass the Rebuild America Act, which would gradually raise the federal minimum wage and index the tipped minimum wage to keep pace with inflation. Women and families also need paid sick days and paid leave. The United States remains the only country in the developed world that does not mandate paid sick leave, despite the cost benefits to businesses, workers and our larger economy. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, employers lose hundreds of billions of dollars in productivity when sick workers stay on the job, while workers who are forced to stay home without pay because of illness lose critical income. These costs of unpaid leave take a disproportionate toll on women, who are more likely to have care-giving responsibilities and be unable to take time off to care for family members when they fall ill. Our generation can change this. We know what the problems are and we know what the solutions are, but we have to demand that our elected officials and business leaders take action. At the federal and state level, we have to fight efforts to repeal equal pay laws. We have to support increases in the minimum wage. And we have to demand that the United States join our global competitors in giving workers paid leave. All these issues affect our individual financial health and the strength of our collective economy. On this Equal Pay Day, I hope all young women -- and men -- join this fight and prove that none of this is about ""money being more important for men"" or for women. It's about the kind of country we want to live in, work in and pursue our dreams in. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sandra Fluke.","Sandra Fluke: Women care about wages as much as men do; they want to be paid fairly .
On Equal Pay Day, women still make 77 cents for every dollar that men make, she says .
Fluke: More families will be supported by women than men, making issue more crucial .

"(CNN) -- South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher has announced his retirement from international cricket after a freak accident during a tour match forced him to undergo surgery on a lacerated eye. Boucher was taken to hospital for an operation after spinner Imran Tahir's dismissal of Somerset's Gemaal Hussain caused a bail to flick up into his eye when he was standing up to the wicket. The 35-year-old, who has played in 147 Test matches for his country, will return to South Africa for further treatment as soon as he is able to travel. Boucher spoke of an ""uncertain recovery"" with the wicketkeeper understood to be battling to save the sight in his left eye. South African captain Graeme Smith confirmed Boucher's retirement from the international team and read out a statement made by the wicketkeeper to reporters at Somerset's ground in Taunton. ""It is with sadness, and in some pain, that I make this announcement,"" it read. ""Due to the severity of my eye injury, I will not be able to play international cricket again. ""I had prepared for this UK tour as well, if not better than I have prepared for any tour in my career. I had never anticipated announcing my retirement now, but circumstances have dictated differently. ""I have a number of thank you's to make to people who have made significant contributions during my International career, which I will do in due course. ""For now I would like to thank the huge number of people, many of whom are strangers, for their heartfelt support during the past 24 hours. ""I am deeply touched by all the well wishes. I wish the team well in the UK, as I head home and onto a road of uncertain recovery."" Boucher has been a mainstay of the South African over the past ten years and will remain locked on 999 international dismissals, including a record 555 in Test matches. He made a total of 467 appearances for his country during his 14-year international career. Smith also read out a statement from the team paying tribute to their departing colleague. ""Bouch, we have walked a long road together, and we are saddened to part under these circumstances. ""For the 14 years of your international career, you have been a true Proteas warrior, a patriotic South African, a fighter who asks nothing and gives everything. You have been a 100 percenter for this team. ""You have been more than a performer, you have been a motivator, an inspirer, an energizer... and a good friend to many. ""You leave us today with sad hearts, but also with a deep gratitude for your contributions to our team, and to us as people. The fighting spirit you brought to team remains with us. We wish you a good as possible recovery from your injury. ""As we bid you a farewell as an International cricketer and wish you well for your future, we keep you as a friend and respected Proteas warrior."" Boucher's role as wicketkeeper will now be fulfilled by AB De Villiers, the team announced.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two good Samaritans returned more than $275,000 that tumbled out of an improperly secured armored truck in Syracuse, New York, last week. But some not-so-good Samaritans seem to have walked away with another $60,000 that fell onto the street. An armored truck inadvertently strewed bags of money on the ground in front of the Syracuse Antiques Exchange. A Brinks armored truck inadvertently strewed more than a dozen bags of money on the ground in front of the Syracuse Antiques Exchange on Friday, according to Sgt. Tom Connellan of the Syracuse police department. The bags slipped out of an open door on the side of the truck. Apparently oblivious, the driver proceeded to his intended destination, a Brinks facility a few blocks away. David Jenks, the owner of the antiques shop, and Hanson Herring, who had just gotten a haircut at a nearby barbershop, Cuttin Up, were the first to approach the bags. Herring said at first he thought the bags merely contained garbage. Only when he began to inspect one did he realize, ""Oh man, this is money."" The money was in all different denominations, from coins to $100 bills. The two men then began to round up the bags and load them into plastic postal bins. Tim Taylor, an off-duty Syracuse police officer who happened to be browsing in Jenks' antiques shop, assisted them. As word spread that hundreds of thousands of dollars lay in the street, people streamed out of passing cars and adjacent businesses. For the most part the gatherers cooperated in the recovery effort. Herring attributed the crowd's willingness to turn over the money -- rather than run away with it -- to his imposing stature. ""Had I not been the size I was, it might have went a different way."" One man did display some reluctance to part with the bag he found. But Herring said that with a few words, he was able to persuade the man to release his grip on it. All told, the men recovered $276,160 divided among 14 bags. But two bags containing some $60,000 are still missing. Police said it remains unclear whether the missing bags fell from the truck at an earlier point along its route, or whether someone at the scene of the main spill managed to discreetly slip away with them. Connellan noted that it is grand larceny, a felony, to keep a sack of money one chances upon. ""We tip our hats to the people who did the right thing,"" he said. As for the Brinks Co., Herring said it rewarded him with a T-shirt and a gold coin commemorating the company's 150th anniversary. Brinks did not return calls for comment.","Improperly secured Brinks truck drops more than a dozen bags of money .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- A Dhaka court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of six people, including the owner of Tazreen Fashions Ltd., after a fire in the apparel factory left 112 people dead last year, officials said. ""A senior judicial magistrate, Wasim Sheikh, today (Tuesday) accepted the charges against 13 accused and issued warrants for the arrest of six people, including the owner,"" Mohammad Asaduzzaman, inspector of the Dhaka judicial magistrate court, told CNN. The criminal investigation department launched a probe after the fire on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital and found 13 people guilty of gross negligence of safety measures in the apparel factory, which manufactured clothes for Western retailers. They were charged with ""culpable homicide"" because of gross negligence that led to 112 deaths, a court official said. If proved guilty, the accused could be sentenced up to life in jail or be fined under the Bangladesh Penal Code. Of the 13 accused, seven have been arrested, and the court will now send arrest warrants to police stations in the localities where the other six reside. The court also asked police to report by February 25 if the six accused were arrested. The six include Delwar Hossain, the owner and managing director of the company, and his wife, Mahmuda Akther, the chairwoman of Tazreen Fashions. The other accused are officials for the factory, which burned down in November of last year. A government committee has said the fire was an ""act of sabotage."" The panel also said the owner of the factory should be held responsible for gross negligence and should face trial for the lack of safety measures that led to the 112 deaths. Most of the dead in the fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory in Ashulia were women. Almost half of the dead were burned beyond recognition and were buried under government supervision after DNA samples were taken. More than 200 people also were injured in the blaze. ""The owner of the factory should be brought to justice, as we find that proper safety measures could have lessened the fatalities,"" said Main Uddin Khandaker, head of the government committee and an additional secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs. He submitted a report on the tragedy to the home secretary this year. Hossain, the factory owner, has not yet been detained was not available for comment Tuesday. He has admitted to local media that his factory lacked proper safety measures. However, he said he had not been aware of that. Ready-made garments make up 80% of Bangladesh's $24 billion in annual exports.","A fire at Tazreen Fashions Ltd. in Ashulia killed 112 people in November 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., a former Seagram executive and president of the World Jewish Congress for nearly 30 years, died in New York Saturday, according to a spokesman for his family's foundation. He was 84. Bronfman died of natural causes, according to Jonathan Cohen, a spokesman for the family's Samuel Bronfman Foundation, named after his father, a wealthy liquor mogul. Edgar Bronfman was surrounded by family when he died, Cohen said. Bronfman devoted much of his life to advocating for Judaism and Jewish causes. He traveled to the Soviet Union in 1970 to lobby for greater freedom for Jews living there and helped to win restitution for Holocaust victims from Swiss banks in 1997. President Bill Clinton awarded Bronfman the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999. Bronfman also exposed the Nazi past of former Austrian President Kurt Waldheim. ""He was the first of his kind, a titan of industry that dedicated himself fully to advocating, advancing and encouraging the Jewish people,"" said Dana Raucher, executive director of the family's foundation. ""Edgar showed how vision and long-term thinking can impact the entire landscape of Jewish life. "" Bronfman, the son of Canadian liquor mogul Samuel Bronfman, became chairman and CEO of the Seagram Company in 1971. While at the helm, Bronfman worked to expand Seagram's presence abroad and to develop the company's holdings beyond alcohol, including acquiring Tropicana and investing in oil and DuPont, the chemical company. Bronfman retired from the Seagram Company in 1994 and passed the reins to his son Edgar Jr. He was president of the World Jewish Congress from 1981 until 2007. Bronfman is survived by his wife, Jan Aronson; his brother, Charles Bronfman; his sister Phyllis Lambert, four sons; three daughters; 24 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He was previously married to Ann Loeb, with whom he had five children, and Georgiana Webb, with whom he had two.","Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., who championed Jewish causes, dies at age 84 .

"(CNN) -- Five million dollars in five years. That's what CNN Hero Razia Jan's foundation is setting out to raise for its girls' school in Afghanistan. The group will begin rolling out its first-ever large-scale fundraising campaign in January. ""It will create a fund so that the girls in Deh'Subz can go to school for free as long as the school exists,"" said Patti Quigley, executive director of Razia's Ray of Hope Foundation. ""This will have a huge impact on their future. It would be like investing in a girl for 13 years with one donation."" The funds will also help the group create a two-year program for the school's graduates to get certified in teaching, midwifery, computer training or tailoring. A year ago, building a campaign of this magnitude would not have been possible for the group. With only Quigley and Jan handling the bulk of the work, they had little time to focus on the foundation's long-term plan. This year, however, they were able to make significant changes thanks to a special training program created by the Annenberg Foundation, a leading supporter of nonprofits worldwide. Last December, Jan and other top 10 Heroes from previous years, along with members from their organizations, attended the three-day intensive training designed to help the Heroes' nonprofits build a strong, sustainable foundation for long-term success. Annenberg provided the training -- known as Alchemy -- for free. ""We're here as a foundation to invest in visionary leaders so they can improve the quality of life for everyone, and these Heroes embody that perfectly,"" said Sylia Obagi, director of operations for the Annenberg Foundation. The Heroes underwent a condensed version of the foundation's multiple Alchemy trainings, which typically take place over 13 months. Annenberg, which has trained more than 700 organizations, tailored the program for the Heroes, who often start small and lack background in running a nonprofit. ""Getting the (CNN) attention internationally, they're given a gift that cannot be allowed to go by the wayside,"" Obagi said. ""Alchemy helps the Heroes leverage the affirmation and public attention of their work to benefit their organizations and put them on a path towards greater sustainability."" David Puckett, who travels to Mexico to provide prosthetic and orthotic care to people in need, translated what he learned at Alchemy into more consistent financial support for his group. ""(It) has broadened my view on how to cultivate and sustain relationships with donors,"" said Puckett, whose group in the first quarter of 2013 raised almost as much as its 2012 annual budget. ""I have learned that sharing our mission's vision is not just about telling the story, but that it needs to go more in depth by telling the story with passion in order to involve the potential donor."" On the last day of the program, the trainers had one-on-one sessions with each organization and helped them develop a customized plan, prioritize their goals and commit to taking necessary actions toward achieving them. After the training, participants worked for 90 days to implement specific goals. Each Hero then had a follow-up phone call with a trainer to review their progress. Obagi said the trainers specifically commented about the ""exceptional motivation"" they experienced with the Heroes and that they worked very hard achieving many of the goals. ""When we compare them with the regular Alchemy group, they're completing their goals at higher rates,"" she said. ""The steps they're taking, and the partnership they've developed with their board, are moving their organizations in the right direction."" Taryn Davis said Alchemy played a strong role in her group's growth this year. She and her American Widow Project nearly tripled the number of workshops and retreats they held for military widows in previous years. ""The training gave us the confidence to know that we can take big leaps,"" Davis said. ""They made us be open in our strong suits and our weaknesses. Hearing from other Heroes that their struggles were similar to ours really helped me and our team realize they're not just an issue in our organization."" Carolyn LeCroy expanded her organization internationally this year, which she attributes to a lot of what she learned at Alchemy. Her Messages Project, which helps children stay connected to their incarcerated parents through video messages, recently filmed messages with mothers in a Malawi prison and delivered them to their children. ""The trainers, speakers and interaction, with the feedback we received, made this one of the best trainings I know I have been to,"" LeCroy said. ""We walked away with stuff that was usable and practical. ... It not only showed us what we could improve on, but how to do it."" For Scott Strode's group, which provides free athletic activities and a supportive community for ex-addicts in Colorado, the training helped them bring on new board members with the experience and background needed to scale the program into new communities. ""In the spring and early summer, we'll be opening in Orange County, and we've tried to do it very thoughtfully,"" he said. ""Without the training, we may have run at a lot of different opportunities and spread ourselves thin."" In addition to the invaluable guidance, many participants were able to build friendships and network with fellow Heroes. ""Just being in a room with present and past Heroes who are making a difference was an honor,"" said Marie Da Silva, whose school in Malawi provides free education for AIDS orphans. ""Apart from working nonstop, we had many laughs and an opportunity to meet each other on a personal level, knowing more about each other's work from their hearts."" This year, Annenberg is again providing its free Alchemy training as part of the award package for the Top 10 Heroes. Along with a group of past Heroes, they will attend the seminar next month at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The group will be treated to a special evening event under the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which is on display at the Science Center, and an astronaut will address the Heroes. ""The kind of vision, aspiration and dreams the individuals who built the shuttle have to have embodies what the Heroes represent as well,"" Obagi said. ""It will be a fabulous night of inspiration that makes us rethink the importance of community service and how to give back, and how rewarding it is when we do.""","The Annenberg Foundation is focusing on supporting leaders in their philanthropy .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City thumped Arsenal and then downed Liverpool at home this month in the English Premier League so not many expected relegation threatened Crystal Palace to put up a fight at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. But the Eagles, rejuvenated under Tony Pulis, did just that and it took Edin Dzeko's goal midway in the second half to finally put the visitors away. City won 1-0 to improve to a perfect 10-0-0 in the league at home this season and, without its closest rivals playing until Sunday, overtook Arsenal by two points atop the division. Defending champion Manchester United also struggled -- though not as much as City -- as it played without the injured Wayne Rooney but edged Norwich City 1-0 to collect a sixth successive victory in all competitions. City manager Manuel Pellegrini made six changes to the side that doubled Liverpool 2-1 on Boxing Day, naming the likes of Alvaro Negredo, Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri to the substitutes' bench. Even though City bossed possession -- at 77 percent -- Crystal Palace matched the host in shots on target. And it was the first time City hadn't scored at least twice at home in the top flight this term. ""We didn't have a fresh team,"" Pellegrini told Sky Sports. ""And it's very difficult when you have one team that wants to play and the other wants to defend. ""That was the game we saw today. That's not what we're used to doing at the Etihad."" Although Pellegrini essentially said that Palace parked the bus, recently reinstated City goalkeeper Joe Hart made a string of good saves -- after sustaining a cut under his eye in a collision with Cameron Jerome -- before and after Dzeko broke through in the 66th minute. Welbeck winner . Rooney, in fine form, missed United's trip to Norwich due to a lingering groin strain but Manchester United said he should be available for Wednesday's clash against Tottenham. United manager David Moyes didn't start Danny Welbeck, either -- he has enjoyed recent success -- but the striker came off the bench to net the winner in the 57th minute. The Red Devils, who rallied to beat Hull 3-2 on the road Thursday, remained seven points behind Manchester City but climbed to sixth. ""To win back-to-back games in the Premier League in three days away from home is really difficult,"" Moyes told Sky. ""Some teams don't play until tomorrow. ""We had two games in three days, and I have to say the squad coped really well. ""I was delighted to get the result. I thought Norwich played really well."" Elsewhere, Cardiff City conceded deep in injury time and had to settle for a 2-2 draw against last-place Sunderland; Hull rebounded from the loss to Manchester United, routing poor traveler Fulham 6-0; and West Ham and West Bromwich Albion produced six goals in a 3-3 draw in London. Aston Villa snapped a four-match losing streak although didn't beat Swansea at home, drawing 1-1. Cardiff looked set to claim all three points in its first game since manager Malky Mackay was fired, taking a 2-0 lead. But Steven Fletcher pulled a goal back for Sunderland in the 83rd minute and Jack Colbeck equalized on a deflected effort in the fifth minute of added time. Arsenal travels to surging Newcastle on Sunday and Chelsea hosts Liverpool in a battle of third versus fourth.","Manchester City needs 66 minutes to open the scoring against Crystal Palace .

"(CNN) -- He is the Philippines' most famous sportsman who was moved to tears by the devastation wreaked on his homeland by Super Typhoon Haiyan. The typhoon hit the country earlier this month and has so far claimed over 5,000 lives, with boxing star Manny Pacquiao ensconced in his Philippines training camp for this weekend's fight with Brandon Rios. ""I was crying,"" the 35-year-old told CNN when asked about his first reaction to the typhoon. ""I feel so bad ... what happened. I want to visit them personally but I can't because I'm in training. I sent my people there to help them, what I did is focus on my training and pray to God."" Boxing's first and only eight division world champion left his training camp in Genereal Santos City earlier this week to head to Macau, China, where his WBO International Welterweight title bout with Rios will take place. Pacquiao is attempting to help his compatriots by sending aid to those affected by the typhoon. ""Right now we've sent them food, food is the most important thing,"" said Pacquiao, who is an elected official in the Philippine House of Representatives, serving Sarangani's Lone District. ""After that I have to help give them a fresh start in their lives."" Saturday's fight with Rios is Pacquiao's first since he was knocked out for just the third time in his career by Juan Manuel Marquez in December 2012, only his fifth loss in 61 professional fights. Pacquiao dismissed suggestions that defeat to Rios, the American who has lost just one of his 33 professional bouts, could see him call time on his 18-year career. ""I learned a lot,"" Pacquiao said of his loss to Marquez. ""It's part of boxing, sometimes you lose sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose and you have to accept it. ""I decided to continue my boxing career because I think I can still fight ...

""He was always best when he tried to tell his own story, or something he cared about."" The thing about being a storyteller, of course, is that stories are often embellished. Cash was no different. Despite being the subject of scores of articles -- and having written two autobiographies himself -- the tales of his life often varied, depending on the time, the setting and the tale-teller. This is not to diminish Cash's faith and character, but it proved a challenge in writing a biography, says Hilburn, a longtime music reporter who interviewed Cash several times and witnessed the famed 1968 Folsom Prison concert. ""The surprising thing to me was how much you had to check what John said. He would often exaggerate or dramatize what happened,"" he says. ""It would be a germ of truth, but he would make it into something more interesting to convey that truth."" Moreover, Cash's complete story was mostly hidden. When Hilburn asked Cash manager Lou Robin how much of the Cash story had been told, Robin replied, ""About 20%."" ""Johnny Cash: A Life"" attempts to clear the air. Herewith, a few of the fascinating stories from Johnny Cash's colorful life: . 1. His name was actually J.R. Cash. His mother wanted to name him John, after her father. His father wanted to name him Ray, after himself. So the two settled on ""J.R."" Cash didn't adopt the name ""John"" until he was in his teens. 2. He, ah, borrowed a lot of what became ""Folsom Prison Blues."" Cash was fascinated by prison songs, and more to the point, by loneliness. (He never served hard time himself, though he did a few nights in local jails.) For his signature hit, he was inspired by a prison documentary he saw in the Air Force and a Gordon Jenkins song called ""Crescent City Blues."" The Jenkins song has a similar structure, a similar melody and many of the same lines, but what Cash added was his distinctive directness -- ""I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die"" is all Cash -- and that uptempo chicka-chicka rhythm. He never denied using Jenkins' song. ""He will tell you in a minute that he stole the song,"" his longtime bassist, Marshall Grant, told Hilburn. ""But he made it a more interesting song."" (Cash did, though, end up paying Jenkins $75,000.) 3. The chicka-chicka sound was an accident. Cash's songs are noted for their distinctive rhythmic clicking sound, one that echoes the trains he liked to write about so much. You can thank the amateurishness of early Cash practices with Grant and Luther Perkins, the Tennessee Two. ""They were literally going from one note to the next like someone typing in a halting hunt-and-peck style,"" writes Hilburn. ""They just couldn't get beyond that simple, primitive sound. ... It was just about the only way they could play."" 4. He and Elvis Presley had the same manager. No, not Tom Parker. Try Bob Neal, originally a DJ at a Memphis radio station. Neal was a friend of Sun Records' Sam Phillips -- the two later founded a management firm -- and handled Elvis for about 18 months until Parker came into the picture in 1955. Neal let Parker take over Presley's management and took on Cash and other Sun Records musicians. But lightning struck him twice: Cash struck up a friendship with Stu Carnall, a California booking agent, who became Neal's management partner -- and then Cash's sole manager. ""All of a sudden Stu Carnall comes in and (Neal's) thinking, 'This can't happen twice,' and he takes him away,"" says Hilburn. Cash later left Carnall for Saul Holiff, who guided his career until the 1970s. 5. He didn't start wearing black for ""the poor and beaten down."" That may have become true, as he sings in ""Man in Black"" -- Cash always had sympathy for the downtrodden -- but the original reason was simply because he liked it. ""I'm comfortable in it,"" he told Larry King in 2002. And why not? Fashionistas will tell you: Black is stylish and hides a host of sins. 6. He was a champion hotel room destroyer. Wrecking hotel rooms is now associated with the excesses of rock stars -- Keith Moon was a particularly bad boy -- but Cash was so adept at it that he knew exactly what the furnishings cost. Hilburn quotes George Jones -- admittedly a pretty good tale-spinner himself -- who once got in an argument with Cash and went on a spree. With each item Jones broke, Cash named the price. Jones was then sent a bill by management. ""All of Cash's predicted costs were accurate right down to the penny,"" Hilburn writes. 7. The Nickajack Cave suicide attempt? Probably didn't happen. This story has become part of Cash lore. Hooked on drugs, miserable over his divorce, Cash crawled into Tennessee's Nickajack Cave in 1967 and waited to die. Instead, he found God and decided to quit drugs. But, Hilburn discovered, ""Nickajack Cave was underwater in the fall of 1967."" And Cash didn't get clean immediately; he was still taking pills at the 1968 Folsom Prison concert months later. The tale had a point, though. ""The story dramatized the feelings of helplessness and recovery,"" writes Hilburn. 8. There are more Cash-Bob Dylan duets out there. The two sang together on Dylan's ""Girl from the North Country,"" which appeared on Dylan's ""Nashville Skyline."" But producer Bob Johnston recorded several songs at the February 1969 session, including Cash's ""I Still Miss Someone"" and ""Understand Your Man,"" as well as some Jimmie Rodgers tunes. Though it has popped up on bootlegs, the music has never been officially released. ""I don't understand why Columbia doesn't release that album,"" Hilburn says. ""It might have confused fans at that time, but today, as a historical document, it's just amazing."" 9. He shouldn't be filed under ""country."" No offense to the denizens of Music Row, but Johnny Cash was bigger than country music. ""He never wanted to go to Nashville. He wanted to separate himself,"" says Hilburn. ""He wasn't aiming for that hit on the jukebox. He was as interested in gospel music and folk music and blues as he was probably in country music, and when rock 'n' roll comes along he incorporates part of that."" Cash, he continues, ""had a very wide vision. I never realized until I started writing the book and researching how strong an artist he was. He wanted to record the music he wanted to record, and that was pretty amazing.""","Johnny Cash is the subject of a new biography .

"London (CNN) -- Film-making was not an obvious career path for the young Annemarie Jacir. The daughter of Palestinian parents, she spent 16 years growing up in Saudi Arabia -- ""a country of no cinema,"" she says -- where public movie theaters have been banned for more than three decades. Jacir, who is also a poet, thought she wanted to write fiction, perhaps do screenwriting. But the possibility of film-making was not something that occurred to her until much later. Just as well it did. The Jordanian-Palestinian director's second feature film, ""When I Saw You,"" has been winning awards at film festivals around the world, part of a wave of Arab women filmmakers recently gaining critical acclaim worldwide. Having won prizes at film festivals in Abu Dhabi, Oran, Cairo and Berlin, the film will have its UK premiere next month in London at the Bird's Eye View Film Festival, an event devoted to championing women filmmakers and which is this year focusing on Arab cinema. Among the films on the schedule - six features, nine documentaries, plenty of shorts -- is director Haifaa Al Mansour's feature debut ""Wadjda"" -- the first ever feature by a Saudi woman, and the first feature film to be shot entirely in the conservative kingdom. Clearly things are changing. ""In the last couple of years we've seen the sudden emergence of women from across the Arab region winning big awards at the international festivals,"" said Will Young, producer of Bird's Eye View, which was founded in response to the fact that only about 10% of movies worldwide are made by women. The week-long festival begins on April 3 in London. Watch: Saudi film breaks boundaries . Set in Jordan in 1967, Jacir's film tells the story of an 11-year-old Palestinian refugee, Tarek and his mother, displaced by war to the Harir camp in Jordan. ""I was interested in the time period of the late '60s with the liberation movements -- the moment before everything went bad, everything got corrupt,"" she said. ""Young people dreamed of a better world and had agency in their own lives."" Jacir said that aside from funding possibly being harder to come by for women, she did not believe she encountered any particular obstacles related to her gender because, as a Jordanian-Palestinian director, she was creating films in a place without an established industry. ""When you're coming from a country in which everyone's building up together, I don't feel boxed in as a woman,"" she said. ""It's much easier to work as a woman in a country that doesn't have an established system the way Egypt or Hollywood does, one that women have traditionally been left out of."" Watch: A great year for Middle Eastern cinema . Recent interest in the Gulf, as evidenced by the rise of film festivals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, had led to increased funding opportunities, which she had taken advantage of for her second feature. ""The Gulf is interested in film and supporting filmmakers,"" she said. ""With my film, there was no censorship, there was no control of the subject -- that's a concern for a lot of filmmakers when you take funds, especially from conservative countries."" Sabine El Chamaa, a Lebanese director whose latest short ""Un Mardi (One Tuesday)"" won first prize in the short film category at the Dubai Film Festival and will be screening in the Bird's Eye line-up, agreed. ""There have been Arab filmmakers for a long time... it's just that the film industry, whether for women or men, is one that is difficult because there's no funding and you have to figure out your own manner of making films,"" she said. Even once films are made, filmmakers face obstacles, with distribution proving a particular challenge. While Jacir's films gained theatrical releases in a number of western countries, she also wanted to share them with Jordanian and Palestinian move-goers. ""Your cast and crew are from that country,"" said Jacir. ""You hope there's a broader audience but I think it's really important to prioritize your own audience and share your film with them."" Read also: Man-made desert lake - bird-watcher's paradise or ecological disaster? But cinema owners in the region are often reluctant to support local films. ""They say nobody wants to see local films, they want to see Hollywood films,"" said Jacir . Despite a positive reception at festivals, her first feature film did not gain theatrical release throughout the Arab world, leading her team to distribute the film themselves throughout the Palestinian Territories. It was then that she had encountered ""the other problem for cinema in the Arab world"" - piracy. ""Go into any DVD store and for one dinar, all these films are available,"" she said. ""I had dinner a recently with a friend of my mother's and she said really innocently, 'I loved Salt of this Sea, I found a copy of it then I made 100 copies and gave it to my friends. They don't see how that hurts the filmmaker."" Despite the obstacles faced in bringing their vision to the screens, Young said the recent a success of Arab women filmmakers ""was something incredibly exciting both within the industry and for audiences."" ""Both (Jacir and Al Mansour) come from countries that previously didn't have role models of women directors - hopefully that can encourage a new generation to express themselves.""","Arab women directors will be showcased in a forthcoming film festival in London .

"Washington (CNN) -- Enhanced security pat-downs that have been vilified by travelers as legal groping are here to stay, at least for now, the federal official in charge of transportation security told CNN on Sunday. John Pistole, the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, said he understood public discomfort over having a stranger touch the buttocks, breasts and genitals in trying to find possible hidden explosives, but he called the extra screening necessary. ""We're not changing the policies, because of... the risks that have been identified,"" Pistole said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We know through intelligence that there are determined people, terrorists who are trying to kill not only Americans but innocent people around the world."" Travelers who set off metal detectors at airport security are asked to undergo extra screening. If they refuse to go through an enhanced visual device that shows the body through clothing, they are required to submit to the thorough pat-down in order to fly. Incidents such as last December's failed bombing of a U.S.-bound flight by a man with explosives in his underwear and the recent detection of explosives in air cargo packages from Yemen prompted the enhanced screening. But the more thorough pat-down process has generated alarm and anger, with some travelers complaining they were given little warning of the procedure and that they felt violated by the touching of private parts. Critics, including conservative Republicans who generally oppose government regulation, say the enhanced screening is a knee-jerk and excessive reaction. ""I don't think the roll-out was good and the application is even worse,"" Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, said Sunday on ""State of the Union."" ""This does need to be refined. But he's saying it's the only tool and I believe that's wrong."" Democrats also acknowledged the difficulty of the issue. Asked if she would submit to an enhanced pat-down, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"": ""Not if I could avoid it. No, I mean, who would?"" On the same program, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the second-ranking House Democrat, said, ""I don't think any of us would want to undergo that,"" but added that ""most people understand that we've got to keep airplanes safe."" Clinton called for continuing study of the security situation to come up with the proper balance between protecting the public from terrorists and avoiding excessive screening. ""If there is a way to limit the number of people who are going to be put through surveillance, that's something that I'm sure can be considered,"" she said. Pistole also spoke of seeking a balance between safety and public comfort. ""I think it is situational, frankly,"" he said on CNN. ""So for you, you may say, 'I want this level of security because I want to know that everybody else on that plane has been screened thoroughly.' Somebody else may say, 'Well, I would rather manage some risk and say I don't want that thorough of screening, so I would rather take a higher risk.' "" For the TSA, he said, ""it comes down to how do we give the highest level of confidence to everybody on that flight that everybody else has been properly screened, including you and me?"" Pistole noted that few passengers face the enhanced pat-down -- only those who trigger an initial safety alarm in the metal detector or document-screening, and then refuse to go through the advanced visual screening. ""The advanced imaging technology is designed to detect non-metallics,"" Pistole said. ""So you just have to make sure you take everything out of your pockets. So if there's no alarm, there's no pat-down."" He also complained of ""horror stories"" about the enhanced pat-down that he said are ""frankly inaccurate, either misinformation or whatever."" At the same time, Pistole acknowledged that travelers received little warning of the enhanced screening procedures, and therefore those who faced the more thorough pat-down were likely caught by surprise. ""That's my responsibility, because I did not advertise this, if you will, and say we are going to do this new type of pat-down, because I did not want to provide a blueprint or a road map to the terrorists to say, 'here's our new security procedure, so here's all you have to do to,' "" Pistole said. Mica and other conservatives call for easing the use of enhanced screening for travelers who clearly pose no security risk. Mica cited Israel's use of passenger profiling based on travel history, age and other factors to determine more likely security risks. Pistole, however, said the United States doesn't use the same kind of profiling, and he also noted that travelers who trigger a security question in Israel also undergo a rigorous pat-down. ""That is top-notch security,"" Pistole said. ""The question is, do we profile here in the U.S.? No, we don't. So how then do we use intelligence that informs the decisions and judgements? And given what we saw from last night in terms of this new Web publication that describes in detail how the cargo bombs were done, how the design concealed, and how they are using technology to disguise and defeat the screening mechanisms we have in place; look, it's a difficult question.""","Air travelers upset over more rigorous screening, touching .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- International golfers were choking on the greens in Beijing over the weekend -- but it wasn't due to an outbreak of the yips. Hazardous levels of pollution descended on the Chinese capital during its biggest sporting weekend of the year so far, affecting competitors and spectators alike at an LPGA golf event and the China Open tennis championship, which boasted such big names as Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams. The sight of golfers wearing surgical-style face masks at the Reignwood LPGA Classic was hardly the advertisement that the sport was seeking for the first Ladies Professional Golf Association event to be held in China. Play was delayed for several hours Sunday to attempt to give the smog time to clear, before players including Germany's Sandra Gal and Colombia's Mariajo Uribe took to the fairways donning masks. Spectators at tennis' China Open, where Djokovic triumphed in the men's final and Williams in the women's, were also photographed wearing protective face masks. The pollution levels -- which saw visibility drop to less than 500 meters at times, according to China's National Meteorological Centre, and prompted the U.S. Embassy to advise its citizens to stay indoors and run air purifiers -- has led to questions being raised of the viability of international sporting fixtures in the northern Chinese city, or at least their continued ability to draw big names. Swedish doubles player Robert Lindstedt remarked about the dire conditions in his blog, labeling the air quality ""a disaster"" and ""a joke."" ""How much of your life disappears when you spend time here?"" he wrote. ""Already after a few days I feel that I am not doing (too) good. I get dizzy when I get up. Yesterday I couldn't recover between points in practice and was breathing heavily the whole hour. If you blow your nose in the evening, the paper turns black. It's just not healthy to be here. I should probably think about that next year."" David Shin, director of Sporting Republic, a company that organizes sports events in Asia, said it was unlikely Beijing would be able to continue to attract big names at sporting events unless pollution issues were addressed. ""Beijing will always have big sporting events because they'll get the sponsorship and support from local government. But in terms of the caliber of the athletes -- the top athletes will have concerns about coming to Beijing. Regardless of their prize money and the lucrative offers they'll get to participate -- they'll have doubts about whether it will affect their health in the long term. If it does, is it worth coming?"" READ ALSO: Djokovic beats new No. 1 Nadal to retain China Open title . Lindstedt is not the first athlete to raise concerns about competing in Beijing's smog. In 2008, reigning marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie refused to contest the event at the Beijing Olympics due to fears of the impact on his asthma, saying to do so would be ""committing suicide."" A year earlier, the women's tennis number one Justine Henin pulled out of the China Open in the city for the same reason, while in 2011, organizers at the event were forced to turn on floodlights in the afternoon to allow play to continue amid the heavy smog. Shin, whose firm organized the Beijing Vertical Marathon up a skyscraper in August, said the capital's pollution levels were a particular concern for potential participants in running events in the city, and were among the reasons why the city's marathon, to be held later this month, would likely struggle to attract top-tier talent. ""When it comes to runners, pollution in the air really affects their performance. We have to advise them to actually just stay at the hotel and train in the gym,"" he said. ""There are times when I've stayed at hotels in Beijing and haven't been able to see out the window."" The pollution issue meant the company had to give ""serious thought"" to running any sports events in the city. ""As an event organizer safety is our first priority,"" he said. ""Even if you have a few serious incidents where people have to go to hospital because of the pollution, then that makes it not worth doing."" The smog, which also grounded a number of international flights out of the capital, came at the end of China's October 1-7 ""Golden Week"" holiday, a peak travel time for Chinese families to travel. Six major highways were closed Sunday, exacerbating the problem. Djokovic acknowledged the pollution issue after the event, saying it was less than ideal, but that players knew what they were dealing with. The Reignwood LPGA Classic was won by one shot by China's Feng Shanshan, in her second career victory.","Beijing's biggest sporting weekend of 2013 was marred by hazardous smog levels .

"(CNN) -- Top aides to President Obama on Sunday signaled that some U.S. troops could start coming home from Afghanistan as soon as July 2011, but most would likely remain there for several years. In appearances on all the major talk shows, Cabinet officials and military advisers clarified the president's position after he walked a political tightrope by announcing he will send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and that some will start coming home in 19 months. National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the July 2011 start of withdrawal was ""not a cliff, it's a ramp"" for beginning to turn over security responsibility to Afghan forces. Noting the U.S. strategic interests in the region, including nuclear power Pakistan next door, Jones said: ""We're going to be in the region for a long time."" Gen. David Petraeus, the head of U.S. Central Command, said on ""FOX News Sunday"" that Obama's strategy ""doesn't trigger a rush to the exits,"" while Defense Secretary Robert Gates told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that ""there isn't a deadline."" ""What we have is a specific date on which we will begin transferring responsibility for security district by district, province by province in Afghanistan to the Afghans,"" Gates said. The challenge has been to meet the need cited by military leaders for more troops and resources to wipe out terrorist networks in Afghanistan and to help the Afghan government overcome the Taliban insurgency, while satisfying the Democratic Party's liberal base, which opposes the deployment of more troops. Gates explained the rationale for sending more forces on ABC's ""This Week,"" saying the Afghan-Pakistani border is ""the epicenter of extremist jihad."" ""And al Qaeda has close relationships with the Taliban in Afghanistan, and they have very close relationships with the Taliban in Pakistan,"" Gates continued. ""The Taliban in Pakistan have been attacking Pakistani civilians, Pakistani government officials, military officials, trying to destabilize the government of Pakistan."" Any success by the Taliban in either Afghanistan or Pakistan benefits al Qaeda, Gates said, adding that ""any safe haven on either side of the border creates opportunities for them to recruit, get new funds and do operational planning."" ""And what's more, the Taliban revival in the safe havens in western Pakistan is a lesson to al Qaeda that they can come back, if they are provided the kind of safe haven that the Taliban were,"" Gates said. In addition, Gates warned on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that U.S. casualties ""will probably continue to grow"" as troops take on Taliban strongholds. However, Gates rejected a comparison to the Soviet Union's decision in 1985 to send more troops to bolster its occupation of Afghanistan, which ended in failure less than two years later. ""The parallel just doesn't work,"" Gates said. ""The reality is the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. They killed a million Afghans. They made 5 million refugees out of Afghanis."" In addition, he said, the Soviets acted unilaterally, while the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan involves 42 countries with a mandate from NATO. In Congress, Republicans generally backed Obama's deployment plan but complained that announcing the start of a withdrawal was a signal to the enemy of a compromised commitment. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the unsuccessful GOP presidential candidate last year, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that a strategy must be flexible to succeed, rather than limited by a set timetable. On ""FOX News Sunday,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber's second-ranking Democrat, called the July 2011 start of a withdrawal a necessary signal to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. According to Durbin, Obama's message to Karzai was: ""We're not going to make Afghanistan a protectorate of the United States. You have to change your government. You have to show that you are willing to stand up and fight for your own country."" ""I think that message is long overdue,"" Durbin said.","Obama aides hit Sunday talk shows to discuss nuances of Afghan troop withdrawal .

"(CNN) -- The deadline for enrolling in the Obamacare insurance exchanges for those who want coverage that starts on January 1 is about to pass. Late last week, I became one of the 189,000 New Yorkers to sign up on New York state's partner exchange, NY State of Health. New York is one of 14 states that elected to set up its own exchange rather than rely on the federal government to do so. It is also one of the states that have accepted the Medicaid expansion. In other words, New York, led by a popular Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, is all-in on Obamacare, and I decided to go along for the ride. I did this despite being opposed to Obamacare, and I am increasingly convinced that it will eventually have to be either drastically reformed or replaced outright. Hardly anyone denies that Obamacare is in trouble. Though enrollment in the new exchanges has increased in recent weeks, it has still fallen far short of expectations. Many households that had purchased individual insurance policies in the past have had their policies canceled, and it is widely expected that many small business will receive cancellation notices in the year to come. Last year, the Obama administration argued before the Supreme Court that the individual mandate was so essential to the success of the Affordable Care Act that it was inseverable. Yet last week the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would not enforce the mandate against the not inconsiderable number of Americans who've had their policies canceled. The Medicaid expansion has succeeded in providing more low-income Americans with insurance coverage, though not in the more than 20 states that have so far refused to take part in it. President Barack Obama and his allies had expected that as Obamacare implementation demonstrated the benefits of the new health law, the public would come to embrace it. A new CNN/ORC International survey instead finds that 62% oppose the law, an increase of 4 percentage points since November. So far, at least, it seems as though the more familiar people become with Obamacare and its consequences, the less they like it. Like most Americans, I am an Obamacare critic, and I've been making the case against the President's approach to coverage expansion since it started to take shape. This isn't because I oppose government's role in helping people secure insurance coverage. I'm convinced that we would be far better off as a country if all Americans had enough health insurance to protect themselves from financial disaster, and that government can and should provide a health safety net. But Obamacare does both more and less than that. It limits innovation by insurers and providers that can help contain costs. It leaves many of the most dysfunctional aspects of America's health system, such as the monopoly power of big medical providers, largely untouched. It treats different households with the same income levels very differently, depending on how they happen to buy insurance. Its sliding-scale subsidies provide at least some families on the exchanges with a strong disincentive against earning more income. And by raising the bar for what counts as acceptable private insurance, there's a real risk that it will lead to a net decrease in the number of people who have private insurance. When I envision an ideal health system, I don't doubt that it would involve insurance marketplaces where consumers can compare different policies to make informed decisions. That is what the insurance exchanges are at their best. The big problem with the Obamacare exchanges is that they don't give insurers the option of offering consumers a wide range of products suited to their needs, and they don't offer enough flexibility on pricing. Obamacare's defenders often claim that conservatives are hypocritical to oppose the law because it relies on the kind of insurance marketplaces that conservatives favor. What these critics miss is that the problem isn't having insurance marketplaces per se. Rather, Obamacare is narrowly constraining the kind of products available on the marketplaces, and in doing it is pricing a fair number of cost-conscious consumers out of the market, even after factoring in subsidies. I should also note that I don't think Republicans have great solutions for America's health care woes either. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain introduced a controversial plan for coverage expansion that I greatly admired and which the Democrats fiercely attacked. Ever since then, Republicans have been extremely gun-shy about offering ambitious health reform proposals of their own. I was sympathetic to the Massachusetts coverage expansion law that passed in 2006 under then-Gov. Mitt Romney, which struck me as a reasonable solution for an affluent state with a small uninsured population. (The Massachusetts experiment hasn't turned out as well as I had hoped, but that's a story for another day.) And I've advocated a number of reforms designed to expand coverage, such as more federal funding for high-risk pools, federal and state reinsurance programs designed to make insurance more affordable and tax reforms designed to limit the health insurance tax subsidies that flow to high-income households while increasing those that flow to low- and middle-income households. None of these reforms is cheap, which is why they are opposed by the many of the same Republican lawmakers who oppose Obamacare. Eventually, the GOP is going to have to recognize that any durable health care fix is going to cost money -- less than Obamacare, perhaps, but not nothing. For now, however, millions of Americans like me who don't believe that Obamacare is the right way forward for the country will have to learn to live with it. For all my concerns about the Obamacare exchanges, I will say that as a healthy (knock on wood) New York City resident who is not eligible for subsidies, my experience with NY State of Health has been a good one. The reason is that New York state had already made a mess of its individual insurance market before Obamacare, and Obamacare might actually make it better, at least temporarily. New York is one of relatively few states in which average premiums will be substantially lower in Obamacare's first year then they have been in the recent past, as Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute observed in November. Roy estimates that average premiums in New York will decline by 40% under Obamacare, the biggest decline in the country. They will increase by 179 percent in Nevada, the state with the biggest increase. So why are premiums going down in New York? New York -- like Maine, New Jersey, Vermont, Washington and Massachusetts -- already has regulations on the books that impose community-rating and guaranteed issue on all insurers. That is, insurers have to accept all comers, regardless of health status, and they are strictly limited in the extent to which they can charge different consumers different amounts for insurance. But these states, with the exception of Massachusetts since its 2006 health law went into effect, don't impose a mandate. The result has been that sick people have flocked to the individual insurance market while healthy people have avoided it at all cost, and this in turn has led to higher premiums. By pushing healthy people to buy coverage, the individual mandate allowed insurers to lower premiums in the individual market in Massachusetts, and insurers are betting that it will do the same in New York. Indeed, some researchers have called New York state a ""poster child"" for the individual mandate. The question for insurers and New Yorkers buying coverage on the exchanges is whether the relatively low premiums on the New York state exchange are sustainable. If the individual mandate is never enforced (a very real possibility), insurers could find themselves losing enormous sums of money as the problems that plagued New York's individual insurance market in the past reassert themselves. (There are, to be sure, more attractive alternatives to the individual mandate that state governments might embrace, like default insurance.) People often accuse conservatives of rooting for Obamacare to fail. I'm personally rooting for an outcome in which all Americans can have access to affordable health coverage. I'm just deeply skeptical that Obamacare is the best way to achieve that goal. But if I'm wrong, if Obamacare and the new health insurance exchanges turn out to be a great success, I will be among the beneficiaries. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam.","Reihan Salam: I oppose Obamacare but I decided to sign up for the New York exchange .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For most of this week, the 74 people aboard the Russian expedition vessel MV Akademik Shokalskiy have been at a standstill -- trapped in the frozen seas off Antarctica. But the crew, researchers and tourists are taking their icy week in stride. The Russian vessel became locked in sea ice since Christmas Eve. Despite the cutting wind and freezing temperatures, Chris Turney, expedition leader and professor of climate change at University of New South Wales in Australia said morale has been high throughout and they had a ""great Christmas,"" though everyone was frustrated about not being able to venture out into the open ocean. ""We had a fantastic Christmas dinner, including secret Santa presents. It was important to keep the morale up,"" he said. ""There was ham and turkey, the chefs cooked a great meal for us. It was a welcome respite from the conditions outside,"" he added. Others on board also seemed to be having an enjoyable time despite the icy weather conditions. Alok Jha, a science correspondent at the Guardian who was also en route to Antarctica with the Australasian Antarctic Expedition said there was no shortage of the Christmas spirit. That was before a blizzard hit Thursday afternoon, which Turney described as the hardest part. ""We were experiencing a blizzard with winds up to 70 kilometers per hour. Snow was building up on the edge of the vessel and it was quite disconcerting. But, overall, people have been brilliant and as positive as can be, given the circumstances,"" he said. Currently, the ship awaits rescue from the Chinese ice breaker called the Snow Dragon, or Xue Long, that is expected to arrive later on Friday according to Turney, who spoke with the captain of the Chinese vessel. ""I just took a call from the Chinese vessel, Snow Dragon. They've made tremendous progress, and we're extremely appreciative,"" he said. Help is also coming via a French vessel called Astrolabe and an Australian ship, the Aurora Australis. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority who are coordinating a rescue said both ships are on their way to the stranded passengers. After two and a half days of waiting, Turney said the team spirit has kept them going. ""At the moment we've got very good visibility, winds have dropped,"" Turney said. ""We've got a large team coming to help us, it's incredible. Morale is good and we just want to reassure family and friends that we're well,"" he added. Meanwhile, Turney and the crew are kept company with cute, unexpected visitors in the Antarctic as they continue with their scientific research. ""It's great. Where you are in the most remote location in the world, they turn up, having a look to see what's going and then drift off after a while. They're wonderful company to have about,"" he said. The expedition is retracing the footsteps of scientific explorer Douglas Mawson's 100-year-old trek to study the Antarctic region. Turney said everyone aboard the expedition vessel is scheduled to return to southern New Zealand by January 4.","An expedition vessel has been stuck in frozen seas off Antarctica this week .

"(CNN) -- Facing growing global pressure over rising violence in his country, Syria's embattled president had little choice but to accept a U.N. special envoy's peace proposal, analysts said Tuesday. ""He has nothing to lose, and he has something to gain, and that is that he can potentially slow down the process of international isolation that is taking place,"" said Joshua Landis, an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma who writes a daily newsletter analyzing events in Syria. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his government ""understand that this is truly their last opportunity to hang on to power,"" said Murhaf Jouejati, a Syrian-born scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington. ""They cannot mess any more with the international community, lest they create a unified front against them,"" Jouejati said. Nations watching Syria after it accepts peace plan . Timing was likely a key factor in the Syrian government's response this week to special envoy Kofi Annan's six-point plan, analysts said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other global leaders are expected to discuss ways to assist the Syrian opposition at a ""Friends of Syria"" meeting in Istanbul Sunday. ""(Al-Assad) wants to slow that down, and by accepting this peace plan, it makes it difficult for Clinton to announce further measures while the United Nations is carrying out a negotiation,"" Landis said. Annan called Syria's agreement ""an important initial step."" But analysts cautioned that the next steps the Syrian government and members of the opposition will take are unclear -- and crucial in deciding the nation's future. Annan's six-point plan . Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Syria's agreement to Annan's plan is a ""fraud"" aimed at buying time. ""They can keep on negotiating and drag this out, because with every passing week they kill more dissidents. I think what the regime is hoping is they can crush all of this before anybody moves to help the opposition,"" he said. Russian officials, who met with Annan to discuss his plan over the weekend, likely encouraged Syria to sign on, Abrams said. ""The Russians have been talking about ending the violence, and it would be logical that they would advise Assad to talk a good game, and not to reject it, but rather to use it to gain more time,"" Abrams said. Along with China, Russia -- a long-time ally of al-Assad -- has vetoed recent United Nations resolutions to condemn al-Assad and his government's crackdown on anti-government protests. ""What the Russians have done is signaled that, 'Look, you have one opportunity, you'd better make it count.' Because it's not clear to anyone at the international level that the Russians and the Chinese are willing to press along with Assad indefinitely."" said Aram Nerguizian, a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Some analysts said a key difference in Annan's plan made it more palatable to the Syrian government: It doesn't require al-Assad to leave office. ""Previous efforts have been to get President Assad to agree to step down and initiate some kind of transfer of power from him to revolutionaries. Kofi Annan, of course is not asking that,"" Landis said. ""He is turning to the Chinese and Russians and hoping to draw them in and just stop the fighting, with Assad staying in power."" Nerguizian described Annan's plan as ""fundamentally different in ways that signal a willingness to step back from the brink."" In addition to allowing al-Assad to stay in power, Annan's plan also criticizes both sides for the violence, Nerguizian said. But allowing al-Assad to stay in power is an option opposition leaders aren't likely to support, Jouejati said. ""Something that is more serious would be, perhaps, a political dialogue in which Assad accepts to step down in order to form a transitional government. ... This is like having a political dialogue with Stalin. How does one have a political dialogue with another party that has a gun to the head of a civilian population?"" Jouejati said. The Syrian government ""is simply playing for time,"" said former U.S. ambassador to Syria Edward Djerejian. ""It will talk the talk of cooperation with the international community, but not walk the walk on the actual requirements that are necessary, such as really ceasing the use of lethal force against its own people in the streets of Syria,"" said Djerejian, director of Rice University's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. But even if the Syrian government is just stalling for time, that doesn't mean negotiations should stop, Nerguizian said. ""The reality is the alternative is to do nothing, and the alternative is to let a protracted crisis become a regional nightmare,"" he said. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Analyst: Syrian president ""has nothing to lose, and he has something to gain""

"(CNN) -- It was billed as a battle between Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, two of the top footballers in the world. Ronaldo was the clear winner as he scored the lone goal for Portugal in a 1-0 victory over Sweden in the first leg of their World Cup playoff -- although some would argue he should have been shown a red card prior to the brave diving header. Ronaldo met Miguel Veloso's sumptuous cross in the 82nd minute just as it looked like he -- and his teammates -- would have to settle for a draw in Lisbon. The tie, however, is still in the balance after Ronaldo missed another good chance, striking the crossbar in the 86th minute with a further header. ""It was an important step to reach the World Cup but not yet decisive,"" Portugal manager Paulo Bento told reporters. Earlier in the second half, Ronaldo appeared to headbutt Swedish defender Mikael Lustig. Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli opted not to punish the Real Madrid star but later showed him a yellow card for clipping Swedish keeper Andreas Isaksson. Ibrahimovic was silenced but will be looking forward to the return leg in Sweden on Tuesday. France faces an uphill climb to reach the 2014 World Cup, meanwhile, after losing 2-0 to Ukraine and Greece is almost in Brazil following a 3-1 win over Romania. In the lone other European playoff, Iceland -- bidding to become the smallest nation, in population, to reach a World Cup -- hung on for a 0-0 draw against Croatia despite being reduced to 10 men. In Lisbon, the start was far from cautious. In the fifth minute, Raul Meireles' through ball picked out Joao Moutinho and he did well to round the keeper. But his shot from a tight angle went wide. Sweden almost took the lead on its best opportunity of the evening. Lustig's teasing cross found its way into the box and Johan Elmander's diving flick sailed inches wide. The Swedes built on their early superiority -- Sebastian Larsson's shot stung the palms of Rui Patricio and Kim Kallstrom's fiercely struck free kick from a yard outside the box flashed wide of Patricio's post. Portugal, though, dominated possession in the second half and the Swedes were left to defend. In the 50th minute, Pepe and Helder Postiga caused havoc in the Swedish box and 12 minutes later only a great block prevented a certain Portugal goal. Sweden's resistance was finally broken courtesy of Ronaldo. ""We played a good game defensively,"" said Swedish boss Erik Hamren. ""The goal was unnecessary. We were careless with that cross."" France stutters . France last missed a major tournament in 1994 and must mount a comeback Tuesday at the Stade de France to keep the streak alive. The visitor rarely threatened and Ukraine took the lead when Roman Zozulia's effort eluded Hugo Lloris -- who returned to action after suffering a head injury while playing for club side Tottenham two weeks ago -- in the 61st minute. Laurent Koscielny brought down the impressive Zozulia for a penalty that Andriy Yarmolenko converted in the 82nd minute and the Arsenal defender later saw red as he tangled with Oleksandr Kucher. Kucher was also dismissed. Just last summer, France beat Ukraine on the road at Euro 2012. ""It's obviously a very bad result,"" France manager Didier Deschamps told French television. ""We have to believe (we can advance) but Ukraine are the team in the best position to qualify."" Iceland -- population 320,000 -- has never appeared at a World Cup or European Championship but kept its composure in Reykjavik even with defender Olafur Ingi Skulason's straight red card in the 50th minute and the loss of talisman Kolbeinn Sigthorsson due to injury. ""To defend for almost 45 minutes with one less man on the pitch, I can't describe in words what these players have done,"" Iceland manager Lars Lagerback told Icelandic television. Two goals from Kostas Mitroglou in Athens gave Greece a sizable advantage versus Romania, which saw red, too, when substitute Costin Lazar was sent off in stoppage time. Stalemate in Milan . In the highest-profile friendly Friday, Italy and Germany played to an ill tempered 1-1 tie in Milan. The Germans -- defeated by Italy in the knockout stages at Euro 2012 -- dominated the opening exchanges and pressed home their advantage through defender Mats Hummels' eighth-minute goal. Ignazio Abate subsequently netted his first goal for the national team midway in the first half. When Marco Reus and Lars Bender missed for Germany near the end, it extended the team's winless run against Italy. Not since 1995 has Germany downed the Azzurri. The game finished on a sour note, following a clash between Germany's Toni Kroos and Italian defender Thiago Motta. England, which benched keeper Joe Hart, fell 2-0 to Chile. Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez scored both goals for Chile as the South American side cut open the Three Lions' defense at Wembley. England must regroup Tuesday when it faces Germany.","Cristiano Ronaldo's goal gave Portugal a 1-0 win over Sweden in their World Cup playoff .

"(CNN) -- Rock star Joan Jett was removed from a parade float representing South Dakota in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade after ranchers protested her appearance, saying she's a vegetarian and a critic of their livestock production. Jett is a supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the world's largest animal rights group that promotes a vegetarian diet and condemns factory farms and ranches. ""I've decided to switch from South Dakota to another float because people's political agendas were getting in the way of what should be a purely entertainment driven event,"" Jett said in a statement Saturday. ""I will remain focused on entertaining the millions of people watching, who will be celebrating a great American tradition."" The trade group for ranchers in South Dakota complained about Jett's placement on the state's float for the New York parade, CNN affiliate KEVN reported. ""So, of course, when we learned that about Miss Jett, we were rightly concerned about her representing South Dakota and a state that is so heavily reliant on agriculture and livestock production to drive our economy,"" Jodie Anderson of the South Dakota Cattlemen's Association told the station. A Macy's spokesman said Jett and her Blackhearts band will be moved to another float, and another undetermined performer will take Jett's place on the South Dakota float, the affiliate said. A PETA leader said the controversy reflected what the group deems as problems in the cattle industry. ""Thanks to South Dakota's reactionary ranchers, people across the country have learned why Joan Jett supports PETA. The meat trade can't stand any scrutiny of its cruelty,"" PETA Senior Vice President Dan Mathews said in a statement. Many celebrities who support PETA have appeared on previous Macy's parade floats or performed without controversy, PETA spokeswoman Moira Colley said. They include ""Glee"" actress Lea Michele, Jay McGuiness of ""The Wanted"", singer Jay Sean, Alan Cumming and Carrie Underwood, Colley said.","Other celebs who support PETA have been on parade floats without controversy .

"(CNN) -- There are many well-known risk factors for death -- high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and Christmas. Yes, Christmas. Several studies show you have a greater chance of dying on Christmas, the day after Christmas or New Year's Day than any other single day of the year. This is true for people who die of natural causes, which account for 93% of all deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control. It's also true, researchers say, for people who die of the five most common diseases: circulatory problems, respiratory diseases, endocrine/nutritional/metabolic problems, digestive diseases and cancer. There's a spike in deaths for all age groups on those days with one exception -- children. David P. Phillips who was the lead author on a couple of these studies, noticed this trend when studying U.S. death certificates. Specifically, Phillips, a professor in the sociology department at UC San Diego, and his team looked at the number of people who died in emergency settings and those who were considered dead on arrival between 1979 and 2004. They found a spike in deaths on those three days. An earlier Phillips study from 2004 found a similar trend, specifically in cardiac deaths. A more recent 2013 study in Britain found patients admitted to hospitals as emergencies on public holidays are significantly more likely to die than those admitted on other days of the week -- including weekends. Scientists still can't explain this phenomenon, although there are plenty of popular theories. Andrew Meacham is the obituary writer at the Tampa Bay Times and president of the Society of Professional Obituary Writers. Over the years he has noticed his workload pick up over the holidays. ""We are always getting a slew of obits this time of year,"" Meacham said. ""I noticed this happened pretty regularly so I did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too."" He wondered if stress or sadness had something to do with it. ""I've written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hour or days or weeks or months. To me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here."" Phillips and his team looked at the number of deaths among the Alzheimer's population, theorizing they may be less aware of the holidays and the stress it can trigger. If stress were solely to blame, he figured, their deaths wouldn't spike on Christmas or New Year's. But sure enough, he found cardiac deaths were slightly higher at the holidays when Alzheimer's was listed as a secondary cause of death. More people do die in winter months than in any other season, so Phillips looked to see if there were more deaths in the states that experience colder temperatures. That wasn't the case, either. The cardiac mortality peak is slightly smaller in the states that border Canada, compared to states that border the Gulf of Mexico, he found. What about festive eating or drinking? Phillips' team found deaths were still up for people who were in inpatient treatment -- whose diet and alcohol consumption was strictly regulated. In fact, those who died with substance abuse listed as a secondary cause of death saw a smaller holiday peak than those who died from cardiac diseases alone. Despite popular belief, the suicide rate doesn't spike at the holidays. In fact, the suicide rate in December is at its lowest -- it peaks in spring and fall. The homicide rate also goes down for the holidays. Phillips thinks the true reason that Christmas and New Year's are a risk factor for death may actually have much more to do with access to care. People who aren't feeling well may be putting off a trip to the hospital so they can stay with their family to celebrate Christmas or New Year's, he said. Holiday staffing at the hospital may also be to blame, he said, citing statistics from Level 1 trauma centers. ""For those deaths, the spike was even sharper,"" Phillips said. ""Those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff."" He said he hopes his research could help hospitals and patients plan accordingly. If the worst does happen, resources are available. For instance, Stephanie Kohler, family services coordinator at the nonprofit Lory's Place in St. Joseph, Michigan, said she and her staff are prepared to help families find a healthy way to deal with grief over the loss of a loved one. ""We want to make sure we are ready for any phone calls to make sure people are all right in their grief,"" Kohler said. ""The holidays definitely are a harder time of year for people when this happens, especially since they are such a time steeped in tradition and family."" If you know someone who loses a loved one over the holiday, Kohler said be sure to be extra sensitive to their emotions. ""Everything can feel upside down for people. There are emotional landmines everywhere, so don't try to force anything,"" Kohler said. ""You don't need to fill the air with words. Tell them you are ready to listen. That can be more powerful than you know.""","CDC: Natural deaths spike on Christmas, the day after and New Year's .

"(CNN) -- Modern medicine is very good at some things, and really lousy at others. As I wrote in a blog last week, psychiatry is no different in this regard. We understand some types of aberrant behavior pretty well and can do things to help resolve it. But, unfortunately, in other instances-and often the most interesting ones-we can only mumble generalities that require no special expertise and that offer no hope for a diagnosis or treatment. Consider filmmaker Jason Russell, director of ""Kony 2012"", a much debated video about an African warlord. Several weeks ago, Russell was apprehended by police in San Diego after running naked through the streets, pounding his fists on the pavement and shouting incoherently. This is certainly an unexpected and bizarre turn of events for a well-regarded and previously normal filmmaker. However, from a psychiatric perspective, this behavior is neither unexpected nor bizarre. In fact, it happens all the time. If you'd asked 100 psychiatrists for their diagnosis of Mr. Russell upon first hearing the story, I'd bet more than 90 of them would instantly say ""manic episode"". Why? Because people who develop severe mania almost always demonstrate bizarre agitated behavior, and usually utter what sounds like nonsense to others. And as most psychiatrists will attest, nakedness is a behavior commonly seen in catatonic episodes. I can't begin to count the number of manic patients I've treated who went naked in public prior to landing in the hospital. And I'll never forget the mental images I have of various manic patients lumbering naked down corridors in the psychiatric inpatient unit, much to the dismay of everyone but themselves. Manic episodes can be caused by various factors. Most of the time they occur in people with bipolar disorder, which is a devastating psychiatric condition characterized by alternating manias and depressions. But manias also can be caused by drugs of abuse, medications, and more rarely, by medical problems such as hormone imbalances, seizures or brain tumors. Even in people with bipolar disorder, manias don't come out of thin air, but are usually sparked by stress and its evil attendant, sleep loss. This appears to have been the most likely causative factor in the case of Mr. Russell. The good news about manias is that they can almost always be treated, and sometimes very rapidly. Several classes of medications almost always resolve manic episodes within several weeks. Occasionally something as simple as a single good night's sleep will resolve a manic episode. I wouldn't believe this if I hadn't seen it myself on numerous occasions. In the end it appears that, according to his family, Mr. Russell has received the diagnosis of ""Brief Reactive Psychosis."" This label tells us nothing about what caused Mr. Russell's episode, what pattern of symptoms he experienced, or what his future is likely to hold. Like all current psychiatric diagnoses it is only a description of his symptoms. It says Mr. Russell was briefly psychotic and is now doing better. With a little bit of luck it will be his last such diagnosis.","Psychiatrist: ""Kony 2012"" filmmaker Jason Russell's behavior is neither unexpected nor bizarre.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- U.S. Navy personnel are taking precautionary measures after instruments aboard an aircraft carrier docked in Japan detected low levels of radioactivity from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, the Navy said Tuesday. The USS George Washington was docked for maintenance in Yokosuka, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the plant in Okuma, when instruments detected the radiation at 7 a.m. Tuesday (6 p.m. ET Monday), the Navy said in a statement. Personnel will limit outdoor activities and secure external ventilation systems there and at a nearby air facility in Atsugi. ""There is no appreciable health risk, and we are being very conservative in our recommendations,"" U.S. Naval Forces Japan Commander Rear Adm. Richard Wren said. In a recorded video message, Wren said the additional radiation exposure over the past 12 hours had been less than one month's exposure to naturally occurring background radiation. Workers are scrambling to cool down fuel rods and prevent a full meltdown in three reactors at the earthquake-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned Tuesday that the risk of further releases of radioactive material from the plant remains ""very high."" Radioactive steam has been released intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the reactors. But radiation levels at the plant increased Tuesday to ""levels that can impact human health,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. The announcement came after an explosion at the plant's No. 2 reactor. In addition, Edano said, the building housing the No. 4 unit -- which had been shut down before Friday's earthquake -- was burning Tuesday morning, . On Monday the Navy said it was repositioning ships after tests had detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members that had been conducting disaster relief missions in Japan. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. The Navy's Monday statement, however, provided some perspective, noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by ship personnel when it passed through the area was ""less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks, soil, and the sun."" CNN's Larry Shaughnessy and Bob Kovach contributed to this report.","NEW: Commander: ""We are being very conservative in our recommendations""

"(CNN) -- How much do you love your city? Enough to write a love letter to it? So much that you'd tattoo that love letter on your body? The Lexington Tattoo Project, which will leave hundreds of residents branded with an ode to their town, is the brainchild of artists Kurt Gohde and Kremena Todorova, professors at Transylvania University in Kentucky's second largest city. ""For years to come, this is a commitment to Lexington,"" Gohde said. Their fascination with tattooing as an art form started a few years ago when they co-taught a class called ""Creative Disruption,"" a course built around understanding -- and challenging -- the cultural and social conventions that dictate our lives. One of their most thought-provoking assignments asked students to place temporary but realistic-looking tattoos in a visible place on their body. They were then asked to visit a business and apply for a job. Gohde and Todorova said students came back with mixed responses; some felt like a conversation piece, others felt discriminated against. Gohde and Todorova acted as canvasses along with their students; Todorova chose to wear the fake tattoos off and on for two years. ""What was interesting to us, as well, was how our gender would affect how we are perceived,"" Todorova said. ""People were a lot more interested in my tattoos, but they looked at Kurt like he was a criminal."" Decoding the workplace dress code . This go-round, they decided to take it one step further, using the words of a local poet for an installation of permanent tattoos to be inked on Lexington residents. Poet Bianca Spriggs crafted a contrapuntal work -- a three-part piece in which the reader can view the left column as one poem, the right column as another poem, and both columns together as a third poem. The title: ""The ___________ of the universe: A Love Story."" ""It didn't start off as a love letter,"" Spriggs confided. ""I've been off and on in Lexington for about 20 years. Like any relationship, you have your ups and downs with the city. I tried not to think that people were going to have it tattooed on their body."" Spriggs enlisted social media to fill in the blank: ""Lexington is the ___________ of the universe."" Some of the responses were poetic, others were downright bizarre -- read ""errant nipple hair"" and ""B-list cult movie."" Still, Gohde and Todorova found someone to agree to be inked with every phrase and punctuation mark in the 496-word poem (including the title). Apparently this matters: Face tattoos . Participants submitted their top three phrases and Gohde and Todorova narrowed it down from there; they say only about 15-20 people had to resubmit phrases because they weren't available anymore. Spriggs participated in the project, too, choosing the phrase ""gravitational pull"" for a permanent spot on her left foot. ""I got that one because every time I tried to leave Lexington, something pulled me back -- as if my work here is not yet done,"" said 31-year-old Spriggs. In all, 248 participants will put their love for Lexington in ink. More than 60 people were first-time tattoo recipients (including the professors themselves). The oldest participant is 65. Tattoos and piercings: How young is too young? The tattoos were done by Robert Alleyne and Jay Armstrong at Charmed Life Tattoo, gratis, thanks to local sponsors. ""I loved the idea of a small part of the city that I call home coming together and using tattooing as the medium for the sake of a community art project,"" said Josh Weinel, 36, a participant in the project. Weinel chose to put the phrase ""Signal Flare"" along his left forearm. It was his 25th tattoo. Weinel's twin brother, Jason, also decided to participate in the project after learning about it from his brother. Opting for the phrase, ""The Roadside Attraction,"" Jason said the decision to partake was a no-brainer. ""I have left here many times, moving to Cincinnati, Chicago and Naples, always ending up back home in Lexington,"" Jason said. ""I wanted to be a part of something that was local and also original -- this was it. Lexington is one of the few consistencies in my life and will call it home for a very long time."" While tattoos have infiltrated popular culture, to some they will always remain taboo. ""I think the stigma, at a very base level, is because the Bible tells us not to,"" Gohde said. Much of the project's backlash comes from people quoting the book of Leviticus: ""You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves: I am the Lord."" On the flip side, the artists say the project has galvanized pride in Lexington. ""What we hope for is to create a community of people who are connected to each other but also to Lexington,"" Todorova said. The Lexington Tattoo project will premiere in the fall with a short film that highlights each tattoo; it will also unveil a hidden image built within the circle patterns surrounding the tattoos.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee says it is too late to remake uniforms that sport ""Made in China"" labels for the London Games, though vowed Team USA would march in clothing made in America during the opening of the 2014 Winter Games. The announcement Friday was an about face by the USOC a day after it defended the use of the Ralph Lauren designer uniform, which were widely condemned by lawmakers who questioned why the work was not given to the hard-hit American textile industry. ""We take seriously the concerns we've heard from members of Congress and the American public regarding the U.S. Olympic Team's Opening and Closing ceremonies uniforms,"" Scott Blackmun, the USOC chief executive officer, said in a written statement. ""With athletes having already arrived in London, and the apparel distribution process beginning this weekend, we are unfortunately not able to make a change for London. We are absolutely committed, however, to working with our sponsors to ensure that the concerns voiced are addressed."" What's really 'Made in America' In the statement, Blackmun said that Ralph Lauren would domestically manufacture the uniforms to be worn at the opening and closing of the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, in two years. Ralph Lauren's sponsorship as the official outfitter of the U.S. Olympic team began in 2008 and runs through 2020, according to USOC profiles of its sponsors. The controversy cast a spotlight on the plight of the U.S. textile industry, which has been hit hard in recent years by outsourcing and the economic downturn. ""Ralph Lauren promises to lead the conversation within our industry and our government addressing the issue of increasing manufacturing in the United States and has committed to producing the Opening and Closing ceremony Team USA uniforms in the United States that will be worn for the 2014 Olympic Games,"" the fashion company said in statement released Friday. According to the U.S. Labor Department, 10 years ago, there were more than 350,000 Americans employed by apparel manufacturers. Last month, that number was 147,300. In testimony before Congress last year, the American Apparel and Footwear Association said that 98% of all apparel and 99% of all footwear sold in the United States are manufactured abroad. The news the uniforms were made in China broke the same week House Democrats introduced a ""Make It In America"" jobs bill, striking a raw nerve with some lawmakers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said the USOC ""should be ashamed"" and called for the uniforms to be ""burned."" Initially, USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky took to Twitter to describe the uproar as ""nonsense."" In a statement on Thursday, he said: ""Unlike most Olympic teams around the world, the U.S. Olympic Team is privately funded and we're grateful for the support of our sponsors."" Public pressure, though, mounted with thousands taking to Facebook and Twitter to demand the uniforms be made in America. The first indication the USOC was changing its position came early Friday when Rep. Steve Israel and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats from New York, said they spoke with Blackmun. From our readers: Forget uniforms, U.S. Olympians should 'go naked' The two lawmakers wrote a joint letter on Thursday to the USOC urging it to make the uniforms in the United States. ""Just had a positive conversation re: uniforms with CEO of the @USOlympic Committee. Looking forward to hearing more soon,"" Israel said in a tweet. A short time later, the USOC and Ralph Lauren issued statements. Israel said he happy to hear the Olympic committee will require future uniforms be domestically manufactured ""but disappointed no US-made uniforms in London,"" he tweeted. Dara Torres, a former American Olympic swimmer who won 12 medals in a span of 20 years, said the Ralph Lauren uniforms -- with their blue berets and blazers and off-white pants and skirts -- looked great but would be better if they were produced domestically. ""Wearing the U.S. uniform, going out there to represent the United States, it would be nice if it was actually made in the United States,"" she told CNN. The USOC is no stranger to controversy over its sponsorships, with questions being raised over why it opted last year to extend BP's sponsorship through the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. It was questioned as early as the 2002 during the Winter Games in Salt Lake City about why American athletes donned berets made by Roots, a Canadian company. Headlines also were made this year in Australia when it was revealed its uniforms for the Olympics also were made in China. The Australian Olympic Committee responded to critics by saying it was not financially viable to make the outfits at home, according to local media reports. Some Canadian lawmakers became irate in 2008, when it was learned that Canadian uniforms for the Olympics in Beijing were made in China. American companies have made Olympic uniforms in the past, notably, Reebok, Levi's and Champion. For 2014, Team USA uniforms will be made in America .","The USOC says ""apparel distribution"" for athletes begins this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Another Africa Cup of Nations, another failure for the Ivory Coast's ""golden generation."" But while Didier Drogba may never get the chance to lift the continent's coveted trophy, another African football superpower is on course to end its own long wait for success. Nigeria set up a semifinal clash with Mali by beating the seemingly perennial tournament-favorite Ivorians 2-1 in Rustenburg on Sunday. The ""Super Eagles"" have not won the title since 1994, a year the team reached fifth in the world rankings -- the highest by any African nation. Since then Nigeria has had to settle for three third placings between 2002-10, and didn't even qualify for last year's tournament. It was a period of turmoil, as the country's president Goodluck Jonathan at first banned the national side for two years after a poor showing at the 2010 World Cup before world ruling body FIFA threatened even harsher sanctions, and the ruler backed down. Under the guidance of former international player Stephen Keshi, Nigeria came through Group C with a win and two draws this month and then beat a side that the coach called ""the top team on the continent."" ""I want to thank God for this wonderful victory, and sincerely thank my players for everything they did today. I hope we can keep going to the final,"" the former Togo and Mali coach told reporters ahead of Wednesday's semi in Durban. ""Ivory Coast are the top team on the continent with lots of quality, so we tried to speed up and try to catch out players like Drogba and Yaya Toure. ""I'm glad my team is progressing in every game -- there is great discipline in the team and I just hope we keep going that way."" Nigeria took the lead just before halftime when Emmanuel Emenike's free-kick went straight through Ivory Coast goalkeeper Boubacar Barry for his third goal of the tournament in South Africa. Cheick Tiote leveled with a header from veteran captain Drogba's free-kick on the left, but Sunday Mba gave Nigeria victory as he beat three men and unleashed a 20-yard shot that was deflected past Barry. The 24-year-old is one of five Nigeria-based players in the 23-man squad -- none from the country's top league featured in the 2008 or 2010 finals. ""The boys showed character. When I played for Nigeria I had to fight, fight, fight and they did that today,"" Keshi said. ""When the Ivorians leveled we tried to defend and work out our tactics, and we scored again. Sunday came up with a beautiful, beautiful goal."" Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi took responsibility for his team's surprise exit. ""I put forward the team I judged to be the best to pose problems to a good Nigeria side,"" said the Frenchman, who took over after last year's penalty shootout defeat in the final against Zambia. ""Of course our aim was to win the title, and for certain players this could be their last chance so, yes, there is disappointment in the dressing room. ""It's a great sadness for me as the players were working with one objective -- to win this Nations Cup -- but it proved not to be enough."" Drogba and most of the Elephants squad will now head back to Europe -- the 34-year-old will join his new Turkish club Galatasaray, where Ivory Coast teammate Emmanuel Eboue also plays. Two-time African player of the year Yaya Toure will go back to England with his brother Kolo to help Manchester City's faltering Premier League title defense. Meanwhile, Burkina Faso won the battle of first-time quarterfinalists in Sunday's other game, beating Togo 1-0 after extra time at Nelspruit. Jonathan Ptroipa headed the only goal from a corner in the 105th minute to set up a clash with four-time champion Ghana at the same venue on Wednesday.","Nigeria into semifinals of Africa Cup of Nations after beating Ivory Coast 2-1 on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council voted Tuesday to not only continue its peacekeepers' mission in the tumultuous Central African Republic but to authorize the use of force by European Union troops there, the world body said. The decision came just over a week after the nation tapped Catherine Samba-Panza, the mayor of the capital of Bangui, as its interim president. She replaced Michel Djotodia, the leader of the Seleka rebels who seized power in March only to step down earlier this month after failing to halt the escalating violence in the country. Nation pins hopes for peace on interim president . Those dangers remain high, the U.N. said in a news release Tuesday explaining the Security Council's vote. Specifically, the United Nations pointed to the ""increasing cycle of violence and retaliation"" and the ""continuing deterioration of the security situation"" in the Central African Republic. The U.N. peacekeeping mandate in that country now extends through January 31, 2015. The new vote also includes banning travel and freezing assets of some involved in the conflict, on top of an existing arms embargo. The resolution was adopted unanimously by the 15-member Security Council. The latest vote also urges Samba-Panza's government ""to speed up"" -- with the United Nations' support -- progress toward 'free and fair' elections"" to be held no later than February 2015. What's behind the turmoil in the Central African Republic . The Central African Republic, a former French colony, plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, in the latest in a series of coups since the country gained independence in 1960. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Djotodia, one of the Seleka leaders, became the nation's interim leader. Since then, political turmoil and violence have spiraled. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and to counter the attacks on Christian communities, vigilante Christian groups have fought back. The United Nations -- estimating more than half the country's population is affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis -- has said it fears a genocide is brewing, and aid agencies warn of a humanitarian crisis. France has taken the lead among European nations by sending 1,600 of its troops to the country. They join about 4,000 African troops. Convoy attack kills 3 children, 19 adults .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Fireworks, athletes and pageantry on a scale never before seen in the Olympics opened the Summer Games in Beijing on Friday as the Asian nation kicked off the biggest and most scrutinized Games in history. Fans celebrate the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, on Friday. Chinese President Hu Jintao declared the Olympics officially open, retired Chinese gymnastics champion Li Ning was carried through the air to light the Olympic cauldron, and pyrotechnics exploded throughout Beijing as the crowd of 91,000 at National Stadium cheered wildly. It was a stunning display from the nation of 1.3 billion people. Some media observers believe that the Opening Ceremony may be the most-watched television event in history. IOC President Jacques Rogge spoke of China's long-held ambition to host the Olympics. ""Tonight, that dream comes true,"" he said. Rogge mentioned the Sichuan earthquake, saying the world was moved ""by the great courage and solidarity of the Chinese people."" Emotion was high, as Friday's Opening Ceremony not only officially started the Summer Games but was a symbolic expression of a nation seeking its place as a global superpower.  Watch the excitement in Beijing as the ceremony begins Â» . The ceremony began at 8 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) on the eighth day of the eighth month of 2008 -- in a country where eight is the luckiest number. The opening was an artistic mix of performance and light depicting China's 5,000 years of history. Fireworks shot off across the Chinese capital as thousands of drummers, acrobats, martial artists and dancers performed under a light display at the National Stadium. Children representing each of the 56 ethnic groups in China marched out into the stadium, called the ""Bird's Nest"" because of its notable appearance. Dancers merged with objects that depicted China's ancient Silk Road, its Great Wall and ancient imperial past. Acrobats swirled around a giant sphere, depicting China's ambitions in space.  Watch why the Olympics mean so much for the Chinese Â» . Delegations from Afghanistan, Taiwan, North Korea and the United States were welcomed by huge cheers. But the loudest roars were saved for the Chinese participants. Waves of emotion greeted China's delegation as it entered National Stadium, led by flag bearer and basketball superstar Yao Ming. U.S. President Bush was joined by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and more than 100 heads of state, heads of government and sovereigns expected to attend, the International Olympic Committee said. The joy in Beijing was countered by grave news in Europe. As the Opening Ceremony was under way, Georgia's president said that his country was under attack by Russian tanks and warplanes. While in Beijing, Bush and Putin met to discuss the conflict. Earlier Friday, the anticipation over the Beijing Olympics was unmistakable in China's capital city. Thousands were on hand early at Beijing's Tiananmen Square to witness the traditional flag-raising ceremony by soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Blog: Anticipation was at fever pitch . This version of the Olympics brings with it controversy, discord that began in 2001 when the 2008 Games were awarded to Beijing. Criticism over China's policies on human rights for its citizens, its policies in Tibet and the persistent pollution across the country have been the focus of much international scrutiny and media attention.  Watch protests in Germany over China's Tibet policies Â» . For some world leaders, the decision to attend was a tough call. French President Nicolas Sarkozy threatened to boycott the Games because of human rights abuses in Tibet but later changed his mind. ""It's inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye,""  Hu said recently, ""so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect."" Political leaders do not attend Olympic opening ceremonies as a matter of protocol -- Bush is the first American president to attend them outside the United States -- but China seemed determined to have as many there as possible. ""They want those leaders to confirm the fact that China has returned to great power, prominence in the world,"" said David Zweig, a political analyst at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""They really want to say to the people of China that we, the Communist party of China, have done a great job.""  Watch why China has invested so much in the Olympics Â» .

"(CNN) -- Tensions between India and Pakistan flared Sunday in the Kashmir region, with at least one Pakistani soldier killed in the violence, its military said. But exactly what happened depends on the source. According to the Pakistani military, Indian troops crossed the Line of Control -- the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region -- and attacked a military post. ""Pakistan Army troops effectively responded and repulsed the attack successfully,"" but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, the military said. The Indian Defense Ministry, however, said Pakistani troops opened fire unprovoked on Indian posts in the north Uri sector of Indian-administered Kashmir. Indian troops retaliated and forced Pakistani troops to stop firing, the defense ministry said. The ministry did not immediately report the number of casualties, but said three civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling in the area last October. The territory under dispute lies in India's Kashmir Valley, separated from Pakistan by the 450-mile Line of Control. The two south Asian nuclear neighbors have had a bilateral ceasefire along the de facto border since November 2003. But the ceasefire has been violated repeatedly, with both sides accusing each other of offenses. Bilateral talks were temporarily suspended in 2008 following an attack by Pakistani militants in Mumbai, India's most populous city. The negotiations resumed last year. The conflict dates back to 1947 after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to India and Pakistan. Read more: South Asian rivals take baby steps to warmer relations . Kashmir was free to accede to either nation. Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the kingdom at the time, initially chose to remain independent but eventually opted to join India, thereby handing key powers to the central government in New Delhi. In exchange, India guaranteed him military protection and vowed to hold a popular vote on the issue. The South Asian rivals have fought two of three wars over the territorial issue -- in 1947 and in 1965. A third conflict between India and Pakistan erupted in 1999 after Pakistani-backed forces infiltrated Indian-controlled Kashmir in the Kargil area. Read more: 2 police officers killed in Kashmir attacks . Islamabad has always maintained that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan. A United Nations' resolution adopted after the first war called for a referendum allowing the people of Kashmir to choose which country they wanted to join, but that vote for self-determination has never been held. Pakistan wants that referendum to take place. India claims that Pakistan lends support to separatist groups fighting against government control and argues that a 1972 agreement mandates a resolution to the Kashmir dispute through bilateral talks.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Growing levels of conflict, terrorism, and the toppling of regimes in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as political violence in East Africa, are driving a rise in political instability worldwide, according to research by UK risk analysis firm, Maplecroft released on Thursday. Since 2010, one in ten of the countries surveyed have experienced a significant increase in the level of short-term political risk. These risks include governments asserting control over natural resources, regimes being ousted by popular uprisings and the expropriation of foreign investors' assets. The findings form part of the latest Maplecroft Political Risk Atlas, which uses 52 indicators to help companies monitor political issues affecting the business environment in 197 countries. Since 2010, Syria has deteriorated the most. It now ranks second compared with a 44th place ranking in 2010. Somalia topped the rankings. Afghanistan, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo also ranked in the top five. Egypt has been downgraded to ""extreme risk"" for the first time as a result of violence following the ousting of former President Mohamed Morsy and an increase in terrorist attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, the report said. Maplecroft warned that Syria, Egypt and Libya are ""now so bad"" that they will be ""mired in exceptionally high levels of dynamic political risk for years to come."" A fall in political violence in the Philippines, India and Uganda has contributed to these countries experiencing the biggest reduction in short-term political risk over the past four years. Improvements in the level of governance has also helped to lower risk levels in Malaysia and Israel in the same period. Social unrest . The report said there is a higher chance for social unrest to exacerbate political instability in Bangladesh, Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. ""This is due to the erosion of democratic freedoms, increasing crackdowns on political position and the brutality by security forces towards protesters, compounded by rising food prices and worsening working conditions,"" Maplecroft said in a statement. Another concern for foreign investors is that there has been a major increase in oppression by governments worldwide. ""This erosion of political freedoms is central to driving the wider risk of unrest and instability in the medium- to long term,"" said Charlotte Ingham, senior political risk analyst at Maplecroft. In the short term, foreign investors face a heightened risk of becoming complicit with the actions of these oppressive regimes, which poses a threat to a company's reputation, the think tank said. Empowered youth . Instability increases as the gap grows between political freedoms and social gains, such as education and computer literacy among young people. In 2010, prior to the the Arab Spring, Libya, Tunisia, Iran, Syria and Egypt were among the countries with the biggest divide between political freedoms and social gains. Maplecroft predicts that the growing imbalance between social gains and political freedoms in Bahrain, Azerbaijan and South Africa will heighten the risk of instability in those countries in 2014 and beyond. Although China is categorized as ""extreme risk"" in Maplecroft's ranking of oppressive regimes, the speed of the country's governance reforms is likely to be sufficient to limit the chances of widespread social unrest that could lead to a ""jasmine"" revolution, according to the think tank. But China's increased scrutiny of foreign business practices has created compliance challenges for companies operating there, the report added. Maplecroft cautioned that Vietnam's crackdown on social media and freedom of speech amid growing opposition may undermine the stability of the government in the long term. Poland has experienced a significant increase in the level of political freedoms over the past four years, according to Maplecroft, and now displays a ""near perfect balance"" between the level of political freedoms and social gains, which reduces the likelihood of protests and disputes over labor conditions. Political violence . East African countries saw the biggest increase in the risk of political violence, including terrorism, poor governance, and regimes vulnerable to popular uprisings. Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan scored in the ""extreme risk"" category, while Kenya and Ethiopia are ""high risk."" Eritrea, Tanzania and Mozambique also saw a change in their risk category. Three years after the Arab Spring, more than 60% of countries in the Middle East and North Africa region have seen a significant rise in political violence, demonstrating the long-term political risks associated with forced regime change, the report said. In the West, the impact of the global financial crisis continues to be seen in high levels of unemployment and underemployment. This, combined with austerity measures, has contributed to growing inequality and stalling or declining living standards, according to Maplecroft. Political landscapes both in Europe and the United States have become increasingly fragmented and polarized as populist parties flourished in response to growing voter dissatisfaction with established political parties over these issues.","New research finds the Middle East and North Africa, and East Africa are political risk hotspots .
The Philippines, India, Uganda, Ghana, Israel and Malaysia saw the largest decrease in risk .

"(CNN) -- Penguins can do the most ordinary or the most sinister of things, and still come across as cute. So you can just imagine the mushy effect on your insides upon seeing this little group of African penguins (also called jackass penguins, no joke) waddling around dressed in tiny penguin-sized Christmas outfits at Everland Amusement Park in Yongin, South Korea. Some dressed like Santa, some like Christmas trees, they walked, marched and melted the hearts of every squealing, DSLR-toting onlooker twice a day since the beginning of December. Zookeepers lead them around the zoo, also dressed for the occasion. While their march was slated to go on twice a day every day until Christmas, the schedule has been unexpectedly cut short due to the drops in temperature in South Korea. ""Today was the last day,"" said Everland's media spokesperson Kim In-chul. ""As they are African penguins they are not used to the cold weather so we wanted to make sure they didn't fall ill."" And what's the park's response to the Daily Mail's headline wondering if the march was ""Cute or cruel?"" ""It's exercise for the penguins and they are in a very safe environment with keepers they trust, so we don't believe it should be considered cruel in any way,"" said Kim.","African penguins dressed as Santa Claus and Christmas trees march around a South Korean amusement park .

"(CNN) -- Every year the holidays bring cold weather, family gatherings, gift-giving, and of course, the perennial debate over the Constitution and Christmas. Recently, a Long Island school district drew criticism following a performance that removed the holier lyrics from the traditional Christmas song ""Silent Night."" Some parents objected when the fifth-grade choir at the school in Kings Park, New York, left out phrases such as ""Christ the Savior"". The school superintendent said the principal and choir director removed the references to avoid ""offense to people of other faith,"" according to Newsday. But regardless of the reason, would it be legal for a school choir to perform ""Silent Night"" in its traditional form? To enter the fray we have to understand some of the basics about the often-uncertain relationship between the First Amendment and public schools. First, let's dispel the myths: The First Amendment does not ban all mention of any religion in public schools. As the Supreme Court has noted, ""total separation (between church and state) is not possible in an absolute sense."" After all, when our kids study world history, they are often studying religion. Wars, civilizations, exploration, and human culture have always been motivated in part by some form of dogma. To filter religion out of history leaves something that cannot, in good faith, still be called history. And while some Christmas music consists of light-hearted fare, other pieces are authored by Handel or Bach, and have undeniable value in a musical curriculum. Religion has always been a part of our civilization; the Constitution and our courts recognize this. Instead, the Establishment Clause only prohibits the ""advancement"" or the ""inhibition"" of religion by the state. Of course, that's a distinction that's much easier to describe than it is to identify in real life. When does a school cross the line into advancing or inhibiting religion? In 1971 the United States Supreme Court decided Lemon v. Kurtzman and formulated the ""Lemon Test,"" which is a three-pronged evaluation of the constitutionality of legislation concerning religion. A court will consider the following: . 1. The government's action must have a secular (non-religious) purpose. 2. The government's action cannot have the principal or primary effect of (a) advancing religion, or (b) inhibiting religion. It would be impossible to develop a public school curriculum that did not in some way affect the religious or nonreligious sensibilities of some of the students or their parents. Therefore, the test is not ""any effect."" Rather, the courts will look to the ""principal or primary"" effect. 3. The government's action cannot ""excessively entangle"" itself with religion -- that is, it cannot intrude into, participate in, or supervise religious affairs. So how does this apply to singing Christmas carols in school? Fortunately, the courts have squarely dealt with that issue, in the context of ... you guessed it ... ""Silent Night."" In perhaps the first case to deal specifically with Christmas music, an atheist father challenged the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, school board's use of ""Silent Night"" (and other songs) in the school's Christmas program. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals -- one of the last stops before the Supreme Court -- applied the Lemon test in Florey v. Sioux Falls School District, and held that both the study and performance of religious songs, including Christmas carols, are constitutional if their purpose is the ""advancement of the students' knowledge of society's cultural and religious heritage, as well as the provision of an opportunity for students to perform a full range of music, poetry and drama that is likely to be of interest to the students and their audience."" The court also reiterated that: . ""It is unquestioned that public school students may be taught about the customs and cultural heritage of the United States and other countries."" And that schools may ""allow the presentation of material that, although of religious origin, has taken on an independent meaning."" After Florey, it appears that the Establishment Clause does not prevent the singing of Christmas carols with religious origins by public school choirs, though the line seems very thin. For example, if instead of singing ""Silent Night,"" the kids were made to take a quiz testing them on the religious facts undergirding the song: . Q: In the song Silent Night, who is the ""Saviour""? A: Jesus Christ! Then the school likely crosses into administration of religious training, which is the domain of family and church, not schools. If nothing else though, it certainly appears that ""Silent Night,"" though much more religious than ""Jingle Bells,"" or ""White Christmas,"" is a street-legal public school choir song. So it appears that schools may include even religious Christmas carols in their curriculum without violating the Constitution. But, can a school go the other direction, and prohibit all Christmas carols from the curriculum? At least one federal court has held that they can. In Stratechuk v. Board of Educ., South Orange-Maplewood School Dist., the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that a school district's policy to bar performance of religious holiday music at seasonal shows, while allowing it to be taught in class, had a legitimate secular purpose of avoiding potential Establishment Clause problems, and was not ""hostile"" to religion. So schools appear to have broad discretion to include or prohibit Christmas carols, as long as they don't run afoul of the Lemon test. Navigating the constitutional perils of religion in school is not easy -- indeed, every year the holiday season brings with it an Establishment Clause debate.

"London (CNN) -- After violent December storms put a damper on many people's holiday season, this January was the wettest on record for parts of England. Met Office figures for January 1-28 show that southeast and central southern England had more than twice the usual amount of rain. A whopping 175.2 millimeters (nearly 7 inches) of rain fell in that period -- easily submerging the previous record of 158.2 millimeters, set in January 1988. Final figures for the month have not yet been released, but the totals are expected to go up, since the rain has kept on coming down in many areas. Meanwhile, southwest England and south Wales had their fifth wettest January since records began in 1910, according to the Met Office, and some areas have suffered dire flooding. The torrential rain has left villages on the Somerset Levels, a low-lying area of southwest England, under water for almost a month. The situation is so bad that the government's emergency committee, known as Cobra, has met to discuss what to do. Cameron: 'Not acceptable' British Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged Friday in a piece written for the Western Daily Press, a newspaper published in southwest England, that the government had been slow to act. ""Like everybody across the country I feel enormous sympathy for the people who live on the Somerset Levels and are suffering from the devastating impact of the flooding,"" he wrote. ""I know that a great deal of work has been done to try and alleviate the situation but it is not acceptable for people to have to live like this almost four weeks later -- and I am not ruling out any option to get this problem sorted out."" Military planners have been sent in to work with local authorities, he said, and a 24-hour pumping operation is now running to try to drain off the excess water from the Somerset Levels. Local residents have complained that the Environment Agency has neglected to dredge rivers over past years, exacerbating the risk of flooding. But the Environment Agency said in an online statement Tuesday that ""increased dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels would not have prevented the recent widespread flooding because of the sheer volume of rainfall."" As many as 40 homes and 65 square kilometers of land (25 square miles) are flooded, the agency said. Local and national newspapers have shown dramatic images of inundated homes, submerged fields and impassable roads, with some residents -- and emergency responders -- forced to use boats to get around. Flood warnings, flights affected . The sodden month of January may now be over, but the bad weather persists this weekend. The Environment Agency has warned that high tides and gale force winds could bring more flooding in some coastal areas, and nine severe flood warnings are in place. At the same time, continued rain may cause river flooding in parts of southern England where the ground is saturated and water levels are already high, the agency said. Stormy, gale force winds in Ireland have also affected some flights at Dublin Airport. Passengers are advised to check their flight status before traveling, the airport said Saturday. The Irish Met Office warned that coastal flooding is also likely Saturday for coastal counties in the country's west and south, thanks to the high winds, extremely high seas and very high spring tides. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Southeast and central southern England had more than twice the usual rainfall in January .

"(CNN) -- All Americans who presented themselves at the United Nations camp in Bor, South Sudan, were evacuated safely Sunday amid deadly violence in the country, the State Department said. A State Department official said about 15 Americans were flown out. U.S. personnel are working to confirm that no other U.S. citizens remain in Bor in need of evacuation, a State Department official said. ""This morning, the United States -- in coordination with the United Nations and in consultation with the South Sudanese government -- safely evacuated American citizens from Bor, South Sudan,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""U.S. citizens and citizens from our partner nations were flown from Bor to Juba on U.N. and U.S. civilian helicopters. The United States and the United Nations, which has the lead for securing Bor airport in South Sudan, took steps to ensure fighting factions were aware these flights were a humanitarian mission."" ""The U.S. government is doing everything possible to ensure the safety and security of United States citizens in South Sudan. We are working with our allies around the world to connect with and evacuate U.S. citizens as quickly and safely as possible,"" Psaki said. The United Nations moved noncritical staff out of South Sudan's capital, Juba, across the border into Uganda on Sunday, as the violence spread inside the world's newest country. U.N. civilian staff were moved from a compound in the flashpoint town of Bor to Juba on Saturday, the same day a U.S. mission to airlift Americans out was aborted when the aircraft came under fire. U.S. President Barack Obama said in a letter to congressional leaders Sunday that 46 U.S. service members took part in the mission, and he noted he ""may take further action to support the security of U.S. citizens, personnel and property, including our Embassy, in South Sudan."" Four U.S. troops were wounded in the attack in Bor and were expected to be moved to the U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, a senior U.S. official told CNN earlier Sunday. One of the injured ""went through some pretty serious surgery"" after being taken to Nairobi, Kenya, for wounds from the gunshots fired at the aircraft. All four have been able to speak to their families. Thousands displaced . Hundreds of people have been killed in a week of fighting, which has spread from Juba to oil fields farther north. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting the violence. Up to 40,000 civilians have taken refuge in United Nations bases in the country, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday. ""There are many more thousands of people who are very much in fear and vulnerable, and at this time, the priority of the United Nations is to (protect) the lives of civilians,"" Ban told a news conference in the Philippines. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates some 62,000 people have been displaced in total, with five of South Sudan's ten states affected by the violence. The U.N. has said some 20 people were killed during an attack Thursday by about 2,000 armed youths on a U.N. peacekeeping base in Jonglei state. Two Indian peacekeepers were also killed. After the attack, the assailants fled with arms, ammunition and other supplies, the U.N. said. 'We will not be intimidated' In a statement Sunday, the U.N. said it had made the decision to relocate noncritical staff from Juba to Entebbe, Uganda, as ""a precautionary measure to reduce pressures on its limited resources,"" while still providing assistance and shelter to more than 20,000 civilians who have gathered at its compounds in the capital. The U.N. Mission in South Sudan is planning to reinforce its military presence in Bor and Pariang, the organization said. Plans are also under way to relocate all noncritical staff from the U.N. compound near Bentiu in Unity state, and reinforcements will also be sent in. ""We are not abandoning South Sudan. We are here to stay, and will carry on in our collective resolve to work with and for the people of South Sudan,"" U.N. envoy Hilde F. Johnson said in the statement. ""To anyone who wants to threaten us, attack us or put obstacles in our way, our message remains loud and clear: we will not be intimidated."" Ban said the U.N. would ""transfer our assets from other peacekeeping missions,"" such as the one in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other areas, to the troubled country. ""We also seeking support from other key countries who can provide the necessary assets,"" he said. ""We are in shortage of capacity. When the United Nations compound was overrun by 2,000 armed elements, we were having difficulties."" Echoing calls from Western governments, Ban urged an end to the violence and called on Kiir and Machar ""to come to the table and find a political way out of this crisis."" ""They are responsible to the people of South Sudan to end the crisis and find the political means of addressing their differences,"" he said. Ban said he had dispatched a special representative to Juba to work with the U.N. envoy in the city. Washington is also sending an envoy. Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country.

"(CNN) -- Britain's electronic intelligence agency monitored delegates' phones and tried to capture their passwords during an economic summit held there in 2009, the Guardian newspaper reported Sunday. The targets included British allies such as Turkey and South Africa, the newspaper reported. The Guardian cited documents provided by Edward Snowden, the American computer analyst now spilling secrets of the U.S. intelligence community. The latest report was published on the eve of another economic summit hosted by the British government -- the Group of Eight economic summit in Northern Ireland. According to the newspaper, the documents show that the British signals intelligence agency GCHQ used ""ground-breaking intelligence capabilities"" to intercept calls made by members of the larger G-20 conference delegations at meetings in London. Analysts received round-the-clock summaries of calls that were being made, and GCHQ set up Internet cafes for delegates in hopes of intercepting e-mails and capturing keystrokes, the Guardian reported. One briefing slide explained that would give intelligence agencies the ability to read delegates' e-mails ""before/as they do,"" providing ""sustained intelligence options against them even after conference has finished."" Bigger threat: Snowden or NSA? GCHQ is Britain's equivalent of the National Security Agency, the highly secretive U.S. communications intelligence service. The Guardian reported that the NSA had attempted to eavesdrop on then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev during the conference as his phone calls passed through satellite links to Moscow and briefed its British counterparts on the effects. Snowden, 29, worked for the NSA through a private contractor firm until May, when he decamped to Hong Kong. He went public a week ago as the source of articles by the Guardian and The Washington Post, saying the NSA's efforts posed ""an existential threat to democracy."" Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said Sunday he was aware of the Guardian's latest report but declined to comment on it. ""What we should be focused on is how irresponsible and egregious these recent leaks are,"" he told CNN. ""It's impossible to know exactly how much damage is being done by these disclosures, but they will have an effect on our counterterrorism efforts."" Snowden's revelations about the NSA's collection of millions of records from U.S. telecommunications and technology firms have led to a furious debate within the United States about the scale and scope of surveillance programs that date to the days after the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington. Defenders say the programs -- approved by Congress after a warrantless surveillance effort under the Bush administration was revealed in 2005 -- have protected American lives by helping agents break up terrorism plots. Cheney defends NSA, calls Obama's credibility 'nonexistent' Retired Gen. Michael Hayden, a former NSA director, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS that what the agency collects are ""essentially billing records"" that detail the time, duration and number of a phone call. The records are added to a database that agents can query in cases involving a terror investigation overseas, and agents can't eavesdrop on Americans' calls without an order from a secret court that handles intelligence matters, he said. If a phone number related to that investigation has links to a domestic phone number, ""We've got to go back to the court,"" he said. But critics such as Sen. Mark Udall, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had raised questions about the scale of the program even before Snowden's leak. Udall told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that he doesn't believe the program is making Americans any safer, ""and I think it's ultimately, perhaps, a violation of the Fourth Amendment."" ""I think we owe it to the American people to have a fulsome debate in the open about the extent of these programs,"" said Udall, D-Colorado. ""You have a law that's been interpreted secretly by a secret court that then issues secret orders to generate a secret program. I just don't think this is an American approach to a world in which we have great threats."" But President Barack Obama does not feel that he has violated the privacy of any American, his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" McDonough said the president will discuss the need to ""find the right balance, especially in this new situation where we find ourselves with all of us reliant on Internet, on e-mail, on texting."" Shortly after the stories broke, Obama publicly defended the NSA programs as ""modest encroachments on privacy"" that help prevent terrorism.

"(CNN) -- Just days after admitting he had smoked crack cocaine, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford found himself trying to explain more bizarre behavior. A video obtained by the Toronto Star and released Thursday shows the embattled mayor staggering around and making violent threats about some unknown person. ""I'm going to kill that (expletive) guy. I'm telling you it's first-degree murder. ... He dies or I die, brother,"" Ford is heard saying in the video. Toronto mayor admits crack cocaine use, won't step down .

Ford responded to the video shortly after it was released, saying that he was drunk at the time. ""All I can do is reassure the people that I don't know what to say,"" Ford told reporters. ""It's extremely embarrassing. The whole world is going to see it. I don't have a problem with that."" He added, ""Obviously I was extremely, extremely inebriated. That's all I have to say."" He's not Teflon, but to 'Ford Nation,' Toronto mayor is still their man . The context surrounding the short video is not known. In it, the mayor makes reference to someone calling him and his brothers liars. Despite the controversy, Ford is clinging to office, confounding critics and delighting supporters who say he's done plenty of good for the city despite headlines around the world that have splashed a bit of mud on the image of the gleaming lakeside city that's arguably the cultural center of English-speaking Canada.

"(CNN) -- A complicated love triangle is playing out on television. This one isn't taking place on soap operas, but instead in commercials from AT&T and Verizon Wireless about Apple's iPhone. AT&T will begin running a new ad on national TV during prime time Friday night, a spokesman said. The commercial shows a businessman using an iPhone and touts the ability to be on a call and search the Web simultaneously. The company has posted the ad to YouTube, a video it's calling Answer. This comes in response to the upcoming release of Verizon's iPhone 4 on Thursday. Some analysts say the largest U.S. network partnering with Apple could lure many defectors from AT&T, which was previously the exclusive carrier for the iPhone. In interviews and on commercials, AT&T is defending the loss of iPhone exclusivity by boasting of competitive advantages, including talk-and-surf and international use. Apple and AT&T have previously run commercials focused on the former feature. Verizon Wireless has already begun running ad campaigns to promote the new phone. The company began accepting preorders from current customers Thursday, and those supplies have already been exhausted. The most recent ad features Verizon's glasses-wearing mascot answering an iPhone, saying, ""Yes, I can hear you now."" It's an overt play on criticisms of AT&T's network. Meanwhile, Apple, ever the cordial and promiscuous lover, is running a commercial called Waltz, which shows the two carriers' phones side by side doing the same tasks.

"(CNN) -- The body of a man found last weekend in a mangrove area near Miami is that of a 42-year-old passenger who fell two days earlier from a small plane, Florida authorities said Tuesday. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department identified the body as Gerardo Nales, of Key Biscayne. The body was discovered Saturday at 10:30 a.m., he said. Authorities had been looking for the Key Biscayne man since a pilot's mayday distress call sent them scrambling. ""I have a door ajar,"" said the pilot of the single-engine Piper PA-46 aircraft, ""and a passenger that fell down."" Nales, the only other person aboard, ""opened the back door and he just fell down the plane,"" the pilot said, according to a recording of his conversation with air traffic controllers. The pilot, whose name has not been released, said he was flying Thursday afternoon at an altitude of 1,800 feet about two miles from shore when the incident occurred. A police spokeswoman said Saturday after the body was found that it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped. Homicide detectives are involved, as they are in all death investigations, Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Sgt. Robin Pinkard said last week.

She was 53. ""Chrissy's light burns so very brightly,"" her husband, former Divinyls drummer Charley Drayton, said in a statement.

She said in an interview that her family made the diagnoses easier. ""It's unfair, but life is not fair -- even rock stars get breast cancer,"" she told the Sydney Morning Herald.

"(CNN) -- The rebel battalions and commanders battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime are signing a ""code of conduct"" pledging to refrain from torture and other human rights abuses, an opposition group said Wednesday. More than two dozen Free Syrian Army officials have signed the documents, just days after an uproar over reports that a unit called the Tawheed brigade claimed responsibility for executing pro-regime members of the Berri clan in Aleppo, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Rafif Jouejati, the LCC English-language spokeswoman, said some of the content in the code had been in development for months by human rights experts and the LCC and FSA. But the work was accelerated in the wake of the executions last week, she said. The al-Assad regime has been widely condemned for torture and other human rights abuses. But as the rebel army has evolved, reports have surfaced of mistreatment by rebel fighters as well, including CNN's own reporting on a rebel-run prison last week. The reported executions last week highlighted fears that rebels are intent on revenge killings and sectarian retribution. ""As the ranks of the Free Syrian Army expand and its brave fighters fight a national, multi-front battle, there has become a need for rules to govern their work. These rules must combine the spirit of the national duty they carry out today in facing the aggressor, Bashar Al-Assad and his regime, and moving towards the regime's ouster and the interests of justice and military discipline,"" the LCC said. Read more: Syria timeline -- From uprising to civil war . The code says the rebel army will use weapons ""to overthrow the criminal regime that has been imposed upon us,"" but at the same time, it pledges to ""refrain from any behavior or practice that would undermine the principles of our revolution: the principles of freedom, citizenship, and dignity. ""I will respect human rights in accordance with our legal principles, our tolerant religious principles, and the international laws governing human rights -- the very human rights for which we struggle today and which we intend to implement in the future Syria,"" the code said. The pledge calls for shunning ""any form of torture, rape, mutilation, or degradation,"" preserving prisoners' rights, rejecting ""physical torture or murder of prisoners or informants,"" and says army members should ""not participate in any public execution."" Also, fighters who take the pledge vowed not to issue ""any executive orders, particularly with regard to death or corporal punishment"" and promised to heed the legal system to determine guilt or innocence of people. ""Any person who takes up arms in the name of the regime, regardless of their rank, should be arrested and remain in the custody of the Free Syrian Army. In the event that an individual is arrested, and it is determined that the individual was working for the regime, voluntarily or for payment, to supply information about revolutionary activists, that individual shall be considered a prisoner and treated in accordance with laws governing prisoners of war,"" the code said. The code says people should use their arms only to defend people in the fight. They shouldn't use weapons against activists or civilians, no matter what their opinions are, and not use weaponry against any Syrian citizens. It calls for shunning ""theft or looting on the pretext"" of ""helping to finance the armed struggle"" and taking people hostage for ransom. It also calls ""for a pledge not to exercise reprisals on the basis of ethnicity, sect, religion, or any other basis, and to refrain from any abusive practices, in word or in deed, against any component of the Syrian people."" The fighters also have to pledge to surrender their weaponry to a ""Transitional Authority, which will manage the country's affairs during the transitional period after the fall of the regime."" People who violate the code also agree to submit to a fair trial ""under the supervision of the Free Syrian Army's leadership and monitored by an independent judiciary body."" The LCC said ""these ethics and principles represent the essence of our revolution and its moral and national foundation."" There are nearly 30 ""initial signatories,"" including Lt. Col.

"(CNN) -- Most people would struggle to place it on a map, but Socotra is one of the world's last unspoiled island chains -- an archipelago off the coast of Yemen that has wildlife so diverse it has been described as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean. Its isolation lends Socotra a bucolic serenity and has blessed it with an array of unique animals and plants. A third of Socotra's 825 plant species, 90% of its reptile species and 95% of its land snail species do not occur anywhere else in the world, according to UNESCO, which added the archipelago to its World Heritage List for its natural beauty. German photographer Claudius Schulze had been fascinated by Socotra since reading about it in a magazine, but he was led there by an old proverb. ""I had a project that didn't work out and we have a proverb in Germany about being 'ready for the island' if you are exhausted -- so I thought it was time to go to Socotra,"" he said. ""I started looking up flights and applying for a visa straight away."" When Schulze, 27, finally made it there he was captivated by both the scenery and the people he met. ""It blew my mind. It's incredibly amazing and other-wordly,"" he said. ""The landscape is bizarre, with mountains, valleys that cut 600 meters into the landscape, moon-like desert plains and huge sand-dunes and endemic plants that are completely different from anything I've seen."" The archipelago has four islands, of which one is uninhabited and two others have only 450 and 100 residents respectively. Schulze visited only the main island, also called Socotra, which covers an area of 3,625 square kilometers. He has published a book of photographs and the story of his travels, called ""Socotra, an island."" The tribal Bedouin people of Socotra live mostly from goat herding, date plantations and fishing. The population of the islands is estimated at 44,000, according to the Socotra Governance and Biodiversity Project (SGBP). However, Schulze said there appeared to be far fewer people, with official figures including many who now live elsewhere. Although the official language is Arabic, most people speak an unwritten Socotri language of pre-Islamic origin, according to the SGBP. Also on Inside the Middle East: Qatar's first female Olympians . Schulze received hospitality from the Bedouin people of Socotra, staying in their homes and eating with them, but said he was never quite able to bridge the cultural divide he felt. ""I discovered I was alien to the people and they were alien to me,"" he said. ""They were extremely hospitable, they welcomed me in their houses and I had tea with the village elders, but there was an invisible world of extreme cultural difference."" Schulze said he also witnessed the devastating impact of industrial fishing on the island's small boats. ""I was a guest of fishermen on the coast and there were days when they didn't catch anything so there was nothing to eat but yesterday's bread,"" he said. ""They are often victim of pirate European fishing trawlers illegally depleting their stocks, because neither Yemen nor (nearby) Somalia has effective coast guard to stop them. ""I realized for the first time what overfishing means. It's not about running out of tuna in 10 years' time, it means people will starve now because they don't get their daily fish."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Auctions celebrate art of the Islamic world . He visited Socotra three times over a year, each time for three weeks, in order to see it in different seasons. Schulze has been unable to return to Socotra with his finished book, and a lack of a postal system makes it impossible to send it there. However, he has presented the book to members of the Friends of Socotra, an international group composed mainly of scientists interested in the unique biodiversity and culture of the islands. In addition to its endemic plants, reptiles and snails, Socotra has 192 species of land and sea birds, including many threatened species, and diverse marine life, according to UNESCO. The SGBP says the local population has developed strong traditional rules to protect the island's natural resources because of its isolated position and history of self-sufficiency. Schulze's book is available through his website and at selected bookshops listed on the site.","Socotra, off the coast of Yemen, has been described as the Galapagos of the India Ocean .

"(CNN) -- It's easy to understand why comedians like Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, and Sacha Baron Cohen have flirted with adapting James Thurber's 1939 New Yorker story about a timid man with a vibrant fantasy life. Not only has CGI made it relatively simple to turn Walter Mitty's daydreams into Technicolor tapestries of digital eye candy, it's also the kind of emotionally textured role that can be a springboard out of the banana-peel slapstick ghetto. Ben Stiller's no stranger to such clown-crying-on-the-inside gambits (see: ""Permanent Midnight"" and ""Greenberg""). But his new film, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"" despite all of its visual razzle-dazzle, never locates the beating heart of its hero. Stiller, who also directed, plays Mitty as an absentminded, socially awkward nebbish who works in the photo department at LIFE magazine. The irony, of course, is that even though he works at a place called LIFE, he hasn't lived. Instead, he retreats into his head and imagines himself a dashing mountain climber or a hot-blooded Casanova. Stiller and screenwriter Steven Conrad have given Thurber's story a 21st-century twist by setting the film in our era of corporate downsizing. LIFE is about to cease publishing, and for its final cover the editors have chosen a shot from their globe-trotting photojournalist star, Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Then Mitty misplaces the negative. And with the encouragement of a co-worker he's sweet on (Kristen Wiig), he embarks on a quest to find O'Connell, leading him to Greenland and the Himalayas. As Stiller's Mitty crisscrosses the planet, he slowly transforms into the action hero he's always been in his fantasies. While stunning sequences show him skate-boarding away from an erupting volcano and fighting off a great white shark, the character never becomes more than a fuzzy conceit. At the risk of psycho-analyzing a film that's already too deep inside its own head, Stiller seems to lack the confidence as a dramatic actor to fully commit to the emotional potential of his story. Too often he aims at our funny bones when he should be targeting our heartstrings. In the end, Walter Mitty is a film about acting out our dreams. But Stiller never quite shows us the soul of his dreamer. B- . See the original story at EW.com . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- While an estimated 10,000 women are victims of human trafficking in Mexico's capital, there were only 40 investigations of the crime and three convictions in the city last year, according to a report issued this week. The discrepancy is an ""alarming figure"" that shows a need to improve laws and policies, according to a study on human trafficking and sexual exploitation from Mexico City's human rights commission, which calls the phenomenon a ""new form of slavery."" ""The authorities are not investigating, nor are they asking witnesses,"" said Eva Reyes, investigation coordinator at the Antonio de Montesinos Center for Social and Cultural Studies, one of the partners of the study. Cultural norms and social stigma prevent people from realizing that many prostitutes lingering in dark alleys of Mexico City are victims, officials said as they presented the report Wednesday. ""They are seen as people who are doing it freely. That is the first obstacle to justice,"" Reyes said. More on modern-day slavery: The CNN Freedom Project . Authorities in Mexico City announced Monday that they had rescued 62 victims of a forced-prostitution ring -- including a 13-year-old girl. Five men and two women who police say ran the ring were arrested after an investigation that started when a minor involved reported the suspects to authorities. One victim told investigators that she was forced into prostitution in Mexico City after meeting two men in Oaxaca, a city more than 460 kilometers (288 miles) away. ""After chatting with her, the victim told him that she was a domestic worker and the accused offered her a more comfortable life with well-paid work, and in a second encounter he convinced her to come live with him,"" the statement said. Such approaches are a common tactic for those involved in human trafficking, who frequently target women and girls in smaller cities outside the capital, Reyes said. In the southern border state of Chiapas, Central American women are frequently a target, Reyes said. But regardless of where victims are recruited, she said, they often pass through -- or end up -- in Mexico City, a sprawling metropolis of more than 21 million people. ""In one case, 107 trafficking victims, both Mexican and foreign citizens, were freed from a factory disguised as a drug rehabilitation center in Mexico City; many of them had been kidnapped, and all were subjected to forced labor,"" according to 2010 report on human trafficking from the U.S. State Department. The State Department report noted that authorities had conducted raids on brothels suspected in human trafficking and a special prosecutor for trafficking in Mexico City sentenced one offender to 10 years in prison last year, ""the first sentence under Mexico's federal anti-trafficking law and Mexico City's local anti-trafficking law."" But more needs to be done, this week's human rights commission report said. ""The high number of women who are victims of human trafficking are not achieving access to judicial resources and because of this, the large majority of these incidents remain in impunity. ... Their rights remain unprotected,"" it said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Mexico City's human rights commission calls it a ""new form of slavery""

"(CNN) -- There are all sorts of ways to celebrate a successful harvest. In U.S. of course, people commemorate the season's bounty by giving thanks, overdosing on roast turkey, and turning on the TV to watch an endless parade of cartoon characters float about the streets of New York. But today's Thanksgiving is not the only harvest festival on the cultural calendar. No matter the time of year, or place, a bounty of vegetables is often all it takes to get people singing, dancing, cow racing -- even parading around giant phalluses. To get in the spirit, we've reaped some of the world's most vibrant harvest festivals. Honen Matsuri, Japan . To some, a procession led by a 600-pound wooden penis may seem a strange way to welcome the Spring, but in the small town of Komaki, it's only natural. Honen Matsuri, or the fertility festival, is held every year on March 15, and while the plethora of phalluses on display have made the event a popular go-to for tittering tourists, it is actually a Shinto ritual meant to ensure a bountiful harvest in the coming months. Read more: The world's weirdest food festivals . The main phallus is carved from a single cedar tree in the winter and brought to the local Tagata Shrine for purification. During the festival, it is paraded by a troupe of Shinto priests. In the lead-up to the main event, stalls serve up unending cups of saki to the crowd, and vendors hawk penis-shaped candies. The celebration ends with priests throwing out handfuls of mochi, or rice cakes, to anyone gathered in the shrine's courtyard -- a practice meant to bring good luck for the following year. Costermonger's Harvest Festival, England . For 125 years, the London harvest festival has had a troupe of shimmering mascots. The Pearly Kings and Queens -- deemed Britain's ""second royal family"" -- are renown for their dark suits emblazoned with hundreds of mother-of-pearl buttons, a tradition started by Henry Croft, an orphan-turned-street sweeper. He first got the idea from costermongers, or street hawkers, who used to line the seams of their pants with pearl buttons found on the street. He took it a step further and coated his whole suit -- top hat and all. Naturally, it wasn't long before he was a popular London fixture; he used his notoriety to raise money for various charities. Each borough of London has its own Pearly Kind and Queen, and as a whole, the group functions mainly as a charitable organization. According to Doreen Golding, the Pearly Queen of Old Kent Road and Bow Bells, charity and harvest go hand-in-hand. Read more: Solstice? It's all about sex! ""It doesn't matter what faith you are. At the end of the year, when all the crops are gathered and have been given to people in the community, it's typical to then give them out to all the homeless people who haven't got any food,"" she says. Like Croft, the ""Pearlies"" use their fame to fund raise. Crop Over, Barbados . In 1780, Barbados was one of the biggest sugar producers in the world. Today, that honor goes to Brazil, but the Caribbean country still celebrates the sugar harvest with a month-long festival in July, known as Crop Over. Pic-O-De Crop -- a kind of ""American Idol"" for Calypso music -- is one of the festival's most popular events, where finalists are judged for their savvy lyrics, content, melody and diction. Like Brazil's Carnival, the costumes help make the event (that, and copious amounts of rum), and prizes are given out for the most outrageous concoctions at the festival's end. Blessing of the Sea, Greece and Cyprus . In Greek Orthodox communities, the prelude to the harvest coincides with a staple on the religious calendar -- Epiphany Day (January 6). To celebrate the baptism of Christ, and to curry blessing for the coming season, the local bishop leads a procession to the nearest body of water, where he tosses a crucifix into the sea. Volunteers (mainly young men) leap in after it and compete to be the first to catch it. Whoever rescues the cross from the sea will supposedly be granted good luck in the upcoming year. After the waters are blessed, some folks wash their produce in the harbor in hopes of a bountiful Autumn harvest. Read more: So you think you know Christmas? Rice Harvest, Indonesia . In West Sumatra, Minangkabau farmers have found a particularly daredevil means of celebrating the end of the rice season; they cow surf. Riding a wooden plank, and grasping the tails of two harnessed bulls, these farmer-turned-jockeys careen through the mud as part of the centuries-old sport of Pacu Jawi. The tradition is meant to show the strength of the bulls, many of which are later sold at auction.","In Komaki, Japan, Shinto priests try for a strong harvest by blessing a 600-pound wooden penis .

"Beirut (CNN) -- When all-American Jennifer Grout first stepped on stage to audition, nobody could have anticipated how this 23-year-old from Massachusetts would take the Middle East by storm. Now, she may very well win ""Arabs Got Talent,"" one of the biggest televised talent contests in the region. During her debut appearance, she looked so out of place that many thought she'd flop altogether. ""It was nerve-wracking,"" Grout said, ""because I came on stage and I didn't understand."" The show's judges were questioning her in Arabic, and Grout had great difficulty following, making for some very awkward moments. But then she started strumming her oud, a traditional Arabic musical instrument, and the mood began to shift. She belted out a classic Arabic song. That's when her life changed. The American novice had chosen to cover an Egyptian diva, legendary songstress Umm Kulthoum, so revered throughout the region that many Arabic singers would be too intimidated to make such an attempt. ""When I'm performing, I'm in a different element,"" Grout said. ""So at that point, I wasn't scared."" To everyone's surprise, her rendition of the classic ""Baeed Annak (Far From You)"" was a huge hit. ""When I finished, everyone was just shocked,"" explained Grout. ""Actually, when the judges were giving their comments after my performance, I didn't understand them, either."" She wasn't the only one confused. Fans of the show wondered how a young foreigner who barely spoke Arabic could sing it so well. 'Her voice just spoke to me' It was just three years ago when Grout, who'd spent most of her life studying classical music and opera, first encountered another grand dame of Arabic music. She was studying at McGill University in Montreal at the time. ""I came across an article online about the famous Lebanese singer Fairouz, and I was just really mesmerized by her singing,"" she remembers. ""It was like nothing I had heard before."" Once she discovered Umm Kulthoum, her attention turned eastward. ""Well, her music is the best, and her voice just spoke to me,"" Grout said admiringly. ""Her music is just so deep, and it touches my soul."" She began studying Arabic and learning how to play the oud. After college, she moved to Morocco, where she learned local Berber music and began performing in Marrakesh's Jemaa el Fnaa Square. Now, life is completely different. With her appearances on ""Arabs Got Talent,"" Grout's become very popular -- but she hasn't only made fans. Critics have slammed her, asking why an American should be allowed to compete on a reality show for Arabs. Her performance of Syrian singer Asmahan's ""Ya Toyour (Oh Birds)"" got her through to the finals. Famous Lebanese singer Najwa Karam, one of the show's judges and a supporter of Grout's, faced criticism when she voted for the American over an Arab group of contestants. Break with tradition . Some have even suggested Grout, the first non-Arab contestant to compete on the show, isn't even really American, latching on to her very distinct accent in an attempt to prove it. She laughs off such claims. ""Ever since I was younger, I've had a different way of speaking,"" she said. ""I remember when I was a kid growing up in Boston, my parents had a Vermont accent. I actually tried to pick up a Boston accent at one point because I thought it was cool. And then I came home, and my parents were like, 'why are you speaking like that?' "" Grout says she's taking it all in her stride. ""I like my accent. I like the fact that it's unique, and I think it's narrow-minded to believe that just because you're from a certain place, you have to speak a certain way. Because people learn and people change and people travel, and things about them change all the time. Why does that not include accents?"" Grout has become a sensation by singing the most unexpected of songs. It's not just that she chose traditional songs, it's also that she broke with tradition when doing so. At a time when more and more Middle Eastern musicians are borrowing Western sounds and styles, this American decided to cross musical cultures and defy cultural expectations. ""I'm really happy because this music is so special for me, but it doesn't really get much acknowledgment in the West,"" she said. ""And I feel like I'm bringing a new audience and almost giving the music the justice it deserves."" The finals take place Saturday night in Beirut, broadcast live by the MBC network. The winner will be announced on the same night -- could it be the singer from Massachusetts?","Jennifer Grout has won over many fans with her renditions of classic Arabic songs .

"(CNN) -- The loss of native tropical forests accounts for more than 10% of the carbon emissions responsible for the changing climate, receiving much-deserved attention at the recent U.N. climate change conference in Warsaw. When forests are cleared and burned, the carbon contained in the trees and other vegetation -- roughly half of their dry weight -- is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. Most of the carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activity come from fossil fuels. But native tropical forests average about 150 tons of carbon per hectare, and millions of hectares are cleared and burned every year. Over the past decade, governments and industry have responded to growing pressure to reverse deforestation, sometimes committing to reducing it to zero. But with few exceptions, we've lacked the tools to assess accountability. This changed when Science magazine published a groundbreaking analysis of annual deforestation on the entire planet between 2000 and 2012. With the help of Google Earth and using advanced computing techniques, University of Maryland professor Matthew Hansen and his colleagues analyzed unprecedented amounts of satellite imagery at a 30-meter scale. Their work allows anyone with a computer, tablet or smartphone and a decent Internet connection to see clearly where the world's forests are growing and where they are being destroyed. Go to Global Forest Change and click on different regions. Use the pulldown menu to see the state of forests all over the world from 2000 to 2012, using several measurements. Go to the damage locations like the swath of the Alabama tornado, Siberian forest fires, palm oil plantations in Borneo, and many more. Distant regions are close at hand, the range of forests becomes easy to grasp, and the speed at which many of the forests are vanishing grows far more difficult to ignore. More than 60 governments have signed on to the World Wildlife Fund's pledge to achieve ""zero net deforestation"" by 2020. The pledge specifically excludes offsetting native forest loss with tree plantations, although regrowing forests on abandoned lands can be subtracted from any ""gross"" deforestation. With the new digitized maps and data available online, civil society watchdogs can and should hold governments accountable for making progress toward their targets. Similar zero-deforestation pledges have been made by corporate leaders, including the board of the Consumer Goods Forum, a mammoth private sector consortium that includes hundreds of companies with combined revenues of more than $3 trillion annually. Most tropical deforestation is driven by growing global demand for agricultural commodities like beef, soya, palm oil and paper. Members of the consortium have promised to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains for those products. Ensuring the transparent flow of information from analyses like the one published in Science last week will be essential to keeping the private sector accountable. It is now possible to track what's happening in the remote regions of Brazil, Indonesia or Africa (PDF) or in the forests of the Russian Far East. For the past 25 years, we've had this kind of data only for the Brazilian Amazon. Every year when the Brazilian Space Agency releases its numbers, scrutiny ensues in Brazil and internationally. Few governments have possessed the combination of information and candor about their forests that the Brazilians have exhibited for the Amazon. And until 2012, as reported in Science, the trend had been looking good in Brazil. But on the same as this new report in Science was published, the Brazilian government announced dispiriting news from the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Warsaw: Deforestation in the Latin American nation had reached 5,843 square kilometers (2,256 square miles) between August 1, 2012, and July 31, 2013, up from 4,751 a year ago. Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira called this increase unacceptable and said the government would not tolerate any rise in illegal deforestation, calling it a crime. Already, the issue has become fodder for next year's presidential election. Teixeira and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff are accountable to their national climate change policy, passed by the Brazilian National Congress in 2009. That law included a target for reducing Amazon deforestation to 3,900 square kilometers by 2020, an 80% drop from the average rate of forest loss from 1996 to 2005. Many developing countries simply lack sufficient knowledge of their forests, and many use questionable accounting practices. In Indonesia, the Ministry of Forestry has insisted that no deforestation happens when plantations for pulp and paper production replace native forests. Following that logic, you could completely replace some of the most biodiverse, carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth with monoculture acacia farms and brand them as ""zero-deforestation."" When we say that knowledge is power, we mean that people with access to knowledge have power and those without it are powerless. Transparency is the democratization of that critical access. Without it, governments and corporations are unaccountable. Overall, Hansen and his colleagues report that the deforestation trend in the tropics is worsening. Brazil's success at reducing forest loss through 2012 was more than offset by increased losses in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola and elsewhere. These and other results and their interpretations will surely be scrutinized and may be improved upon, because they are freely accessible in digital form. While government and corporate leaders increasingly profess the virtues of transparency and accountability, the translation of their words into practice has often lagged. But with our new access to digital information, gaps between words and deeds can and should be quickly exposed, even in the most remote regions of the planet. This is good news for all of us concerned about the forests, the people who depend on them and global climate change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel J. Zarin.","Daniel Zarin: Loss of native tropical forests accounts for 10% of carbon emissions .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is sending a special envoy to South Sudan following an escalation of violence in the world's newest nation. Ambassador Donald Booth, the special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan, headed to the area Friday. ""Now is the time for South Sudan's leaders to rein in armed groups under their control, immediately cease attacks on civilians, and end the chain of retributive violence between different ethnic and political groups,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""The violence must stop, the dialogue must intensify."" Also on Friday, National Security Adviser Susan Rice recorded an audio message to the people to South Sudan. ""I ask each of you to make the choice for peace -- make the choice for a unified and cohesive South Sudan,"" she said. ""Make this choice for yourselves and your children."" Attackers killed two Indian army peacekeepers in South Sudan and wounded a third one in the chest, the United Nations said Friday. At least two of the 30 civilians who took refuge at the United Nations' Akobo base were killed in the attack Thursday, said Joseph Contreras, the U.N. spokesman for South Sudan. It could have been as many as 20 who died in that attack U.N. officials estimated. Their remains will be taken to the capital of Juba. Deadly clashes have raged South Sudan for days after a reported coup attempt in the capital over the weekend . President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting the violence. Casualties are in the hundreds, including soldiers, the government said. The government of neighboring Kenya will send troops into South Sudan to help evacuate 1,600 Kenyan citizens, presidential spokesman Manoah Esipisu said. An official from South Sudan's ruling party, who has just left the country, said the U.S. is not doing enough. ""There was a lot of presence of troops in the city. There was a lot of injured, displaced people. Gunshots heard every two minutes, a lot is at stake, a lot needs to be done,"" said Choul Laam, chief of staff for the secretary general of the ruling SPLM Party. ""President Barack Obama made a statement and is dispatching a special envoy to the area. I believe that's not enough. A lot of dialogue needs to be taking place. A lot of convincing needs to be taking place."" Obama sent 45 service members to South Sudan to support U.S. personnel and the American Embassy. ""In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people,"" Obama said in a prepared statement. ""In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history. ""Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past,"" the President said. Tensions have been high in South Sudan since Kiir dismissed his entire Cabinet, including Machar, in July. The move inflamed deep tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. U.N. officials have said they are worried the recent fighting is based on ethnic divisions, but the government has disputed that assertion. Eleven people have been arrested in connection with the foiled coup . CNN's Zain Verjee and Clare Hayes contributed to this report.","Kerry dispatches Special Envoy Donald Booth to South Sudan .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich recorded a comfortable 2-0 win against Borussia Monchengladbach at Borussia Park on Friday as the Bundesliga resumed after its annual winter break. After being soundly beaten 3-0 by Red Bull Salzburg in a friendly match last weekend, Pep Guardiola had called for his side put the passion back in their play, and they duly delivered against the league's third-place side. Any nerves traveling Bayern fans were feeling were quickly eased as Mario Gotze scored in the seventh minute, hitting a low first-time shot home from Thomas Muller's cut back. Despite dominating possession for the rest of the half, Bayern failed to find another opening but they soon had their noses further in front after the break. Granit Xhaka's blatant handball in the 52nd minute earned the visitors a spot kick with Thomas Muller stepping up to send Marc-Andre ter Stegen the wrong way and double their advantage. Gladbach immediately set about trying to repair the damage. Patrick Herrmann hit the post with an effort in the 63rd minute before being played in by Raffael two minutes later only scuff his shot. But it was Bayern who continued to dominate proceedings hogging two thirds of possession for the majority of the match. In the final ten minutes, Guardiola brought on Arjen Robben who returned to action following a six-week layoff after gashing his knee in December. The win takes Bayern to 47 points, ten points clear of second-place Leverkusen. Sami Hyypia's side travel to Freiburg on Saturday while fourth-place Borussia Dortmund will leapfrog Monchengladbach if they beat Augsburg at the Westfalenstadion.","Reigning German and European champions coast to 2-0 win at Monchengladbach .

"(CNN) -- Boeing has warned airlines to keep some 747-8 and 787 aircraft away from certain storms because of possible icing problems in engines. The aircraft manufacturer sent a message to ""customers who operate some GE-powered engines after instances of ice crystal icing that resulted in temporary diminished engine performance,"" spokesman Marc Birtel said in a statement. Boeing said pilots should keep the planes at least 50 nautical miles from storms that may contain ice crystals until General Electric can make improvements to the ""GEnx"" engines. Only a small number of the engines have had a problem with ice crystals, the statement said. Boeing began delivering its 787 Dreamliners in 2011. The model is billed as a super-efficient, high-technology airliner of the future, and it flew without major problems for a year. But a battery fire forced the diversion of an All Nippon Airways flight in January 2013. The entire fleet of 50 planes was grounded for four months while Boeing made repairs. Later, a United Airlines Dreamliner made an emergency landing in Houston with brake problems and a fire broke out on an unoccupied Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner in London. There also have been investigations into a faulty fuel pump indicator, an electric panel, a plane oven and emergency beacons.

"(CNN) -- The man who New York police say shot to death three Iranian musicians was kicked out of their indie rock band last year, surviving band members said Wednesday. Ali Akbar Mohammadi Rafie, 29, took his own life Monday after shooting his former band mates in the Brooklyn apartment where they lived and practiced, the New York Police Department said. The dead included guitarist Soroush Farazmand, 27, whose rock band the Yellow Dogs was featured in a 2009 CNN report about Iran's burgeoning underground rock scene. Farazmand's brother, Arash, 28, a drummer with the Free Keys who later joined the Yellow Dogs, was also shot and killed at the same location. A third man killed was Iranian musician Ali Eskandarian, 35. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters that the gunman used a .308-caliber assault rifle, apparently to settle a ""dispute ... over money"" between the bands. The gunman shot and killed one of the victims through a window before entering the building in the East Williamsburg neighborhood and shooting the others on the second and third floors, Kelly said. Rafie shot himself on the roof after scuffling with at least one of two other people. Rafie came to the United States soon after joining the group in Iran to replace a bass player who could not get a visa, members Siavash ""Obash"" Karampour and Koory Mirzeai said in a written statement sent to CNN on Wednesday. ""It became clear very quickly that he was not a natural fit within our group of friends, and his personal views conflicted with our approach to our art and to the world,"" they said. Rafie was booted from the band several months later ""and in the 14 months since then, we've had no contact with him at all,"" the statement said. The loss of their fellow musicians left ""a gaping hole in our hearts,"" they said. ""For now it's impossible to even imagine a future without our friends, and no explanation can make sense or begin to justify what has happened to our lives."" The survivors are ""in shock, awe, blinded with rage and paralyzed with grief,"" they said. ""Ali Eskandarian was nearly finished with his memoir, Arash had just received political asylum from Iran and Soroush was hard at work on new Yellow Dogs material,"" they said. ""Everything we had hoped and worked for was finally coming true. ... The future was so incredibly bright. The band will continue to make music, they said. ""We will not let this disgusting brutality define us or become our story, but instead respond by creating music more passionately and with more intensity than ever before, embracing the freedom that we all dreamed would one day be ours back in Iran and play to honor those who should be playing next to us."" They are planning a memorial service for the three, which will be announced later, they said. In the 2009 CNN report, members of Yellow Dogs described performing in an improvised, clandestine music studio to avoid the wrath of Islamic authorities. The band settled in East Williamsburg after attention generated by the group's contribution to the soundtrack of a film called ""No One Knows About Persian Cats,"" a movie about Iran's underground music scene that won an award at the Cannes Film Festival. ""The law has a problem with rock music so we can't play it,"" Karampour told CNN in 2009. Iranian authorities viewed the band members as ""anarchists,"" Karampour told CNN. ""They're like my brothers,"" Karampour said of the band members. ""They're more close than my brothers."" In the CNN story, Yellow Dog members described their brand of music as rock played with bad equipment and said it touched on subjects ranging from Iranian oppression to American greed.

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed Wednesday that his country will never develop nuclear weapons, telling NBC News that he is open to diplomatically resolving issues surrounding his country's controversial nuclear program. ""We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb and we are not going to do so,"" Rouhani said. Later, he added, ""We have time and again said that, under no circumstances, would we seek any weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. Nor will we ever."" In an interview with NBC's Ann Curry, Rouhani said that -- even with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a looming presence in Iranian society -- he has ""full power and has complete authority"" to make a deal with others on nuclear matters. ""The problem won't be from our side,"" the Iranian president said. ""We have sufficient political latitude to solve this problem."" Opposition to Iran's atomic program, coupled with what critics see as Tehran's intransigence in failing to cooperate with international officials, had led to harsh sanctions and stirred concerns that the dispute could devolve into a military conflict. Yet Rouhani appeared relatively optimistic Wednesday. He spoke about getting a letter from U.S. President Barack Obama after his recent election and inauguration, saying the U.S. president congratulated him and raised certain issues. Rouhani said he wrote back offering Iran's viewpoint, describing the tone of the exchange as ""positive and constructive."" ""It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,"" the Iranian president told NBC, according to video on the network's website. ""I believe the leaders in all countries could think in their national interests and that they should not be under the influence of (interest) groups."" Report: Iran takes key step in nuclear reactor construction . Even as it has resisted attempts to international regulators to assess its development, Iran has long insisted its nuclear program's aim is to produce power, not weapons. Last month, Rouhani said the United States and other nations ""need to recognize that our activities are totally peaceful and legal."" If they do and there are ""negotiations without threats,"" Rouhani added, then ""the way for interaction is open."" The 64-year-old cleric, who is considered moderate, won the June elections with reformist backing after a campaign in which he stressed ""hope and prudence."" A former nuclear negotiator himself, he vowed to reduce the high tension between Iran and the outside world.

"(CNN) -- Additional polio cases have been confirmed in two new areas in Syria: near the capital of Damascus and in northern Aleppo, near Turkey, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. In Syria's first outbreak of the disease since 1999, 10 cases of polio were initially confirmed among children last month. That number has now risen to 17, the WHO said. In addition to 15 cases confirmed in Deir Ezzor province, ""two additional cases have been confirmed, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, confirming widespread circulation of the virus,"" the WHO said in a statement. It said the risk of further spread of the disease was considered high given the fighting, large-scale movement of refugees and number of children who have not been fully immunized in the country. Last month, health officials launched a program to immunize 1.6 million Syrian children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella -- in government- and rebel-held areas. The response, which also includes neighboring countries, is expected to last at least six months, the WHO has said. ""A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended supplementary immunization activities with oral polio vaccine,"" the WHO said. About 22 million children under the age of 5 are being targeted in mass polio vaccination campaigns in the region, it said. According to UNICEF, 500,000 children in Syria have not been vaccinated against polio. The highly infectious viral disease, which spreads via fecal-oral transmission and contaminated food and water, primarily affects young children. Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis and death. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988. Public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources are diverted from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines. According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters.

"New York (CNN) -- The commuter train that jumped its tracks in the Bronx was barreling into a curve at nearly three times the posted speed when it derailed, killing four passengers, federal safety officials said Monday. Preliminary data from the event recorders aboard the train clocked it at 82 mph as it approached the 30-mph curve, where the Hudson and Harlem rivers converge, National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener told reporters. The data show the engineer cut the throttle and slammed on the brakes, but those moves came ""very late in the game,"" Weener said. ""This is raw data off the event recorders, so it tells us what happened. It doesn't tell us why it happened,"" Weener said. Investigators questioned the engineer, William Rockefeller, and the rest of the train crew on Monday. Rockefeller told investigators he applied the brakes, but the train didn't slow down, according to a law enforcement official who was at the scene and is familiar with the investigation. But while the cause of the derailment has not yet been determined, investigators have seen no indication of brake problems, Weener said. All seven coaches and the locomotive came off the tracks in the Sunday morning crash on New York's Metro-North Hudson line. In addition to the four dead, at least 67 more were hurt. Three remained in critical condition Monday night, and 16 others were still hospitalized, hospitals told CNN. The train's recorded speed is not only far faster than the rated speed for the curve where the derailment occurred, it's faster than the 70 mph posted for the section of track that led into the curve, Weener said. The force of the crash ripped apart the rails and a section of the track bed, leaving chunks of concrete strewn about the scene. David Schanoes, a former deputy chief of field operations for the Metro-North line, said the data is ""uncannily similar"" to a July rail crash in Spain that left 79 dead. ""I would have to see all the data from the event recorder,"" Schanoes told CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront. ""But clearly, from what has been captured, the train was overspeeding, and the request for emergency brake application comes too late for the train to be able to negotiate the curvature."" Weener said authorities will be looking at the engineer's recent work history and will examine his mobile phone, which is now in the hands of authorities. In the Spanish crash, a court found the engineer had been on the phone with railway staff when the train derailed. But a preliminary review has found no reason to believe Rockefeller was using his phone at the time of Sunday's derailment, a senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN. In a statement issued Monday evening, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the data ""makes clear that, as we suspected, extreme speed was a central cause of this crash."" ""The lives that were lost yesterday are a stark reminder that protecting the safety of all New Yorkers must be our top priority,"" Cuomo said. ""When the investigation concludes, we will make sure that any responsible parties are held accountable. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of the victims of yesterday's crash."" The Hudson Line carried 15.9 million people last year. About 150 were aboard when the train derailed, authorities said. U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said the speed report ""sort of takes your breath away."" ""For a train to be going 82 mph around that curve is just a frightening thought,"" said Schumer, D-New York, who appeared at a news conference with Weener. ""The fact that it was going 82 mph even in the 70-mph zones before the curve started raises so many questions and is scary."" Schumer said the tracks appear to have been in good shape, and the preliminary indication is that signals were working properly -- ""but it's premature to blame anyone or anything right now,"" he added. 'It was just smoke' The train was about 10 miles short of its destination, Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal, when it derailed on the approach to the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx. Despite the high speed, surviving passenger Amanda Swanson said she felt the wreck in slow motion. ""I was nodding off, and the thing that woke me up was my own equilibrium,"" Swanson told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360. ""I realized that my body was tilted very severely, and that woke me up -- and when I woke up and saw the entire cab of the train was tilted, I immediately woke up and realized that I was in the middle of a train crash."" The windows of the coaches broke out and then, ""gravel came flying up in our faces,"" said Swanson, 26, who was on her way to work at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant. She put her bag in front of her face to block the rubble as the car she was riding in flipped over and skidded to a stop with a thud. ""I couldn't see anything,"" she told CNN's New Day. ""It was just smoke."" Workers lifted the rail cars back onto the tracks on Monday, and police determined no other bodies were trapped in the wreckage. Beth Barret, who sent photos to CNN's iReport, called the scene ""very surreal and very scary."" ""It was a scene straight out of a sci-fi movie,"" Barret said. Cameras may have caught deadly derailment . It's not the first time a train jumped the tracks on that turn. A freight train derailed in the same curve in July, damaging about 1,500 feet of track, the Metropolitan Transit Authority reported at the time. Mary Schiavo, a former inspector-general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said investigators should take a close look at the sharp curve. ""It has been there forever, but the fact that we've had other accidents there means we have to look beyond just the fact that the train engineer said that brakes were not working,"" she said. ""We have to see if there's additional issues concerning that track."" Weener said the agency would look into whether there was any connection between the July derailment and Sunday's crash, but both he and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo discounted the possibility. ""The curve has been here for many, many years, right, and trains take the curve every day, 365 days a year ... We've always had this configuration. We didn't have accidents,"" Cuomo said Sunday. ""So there has to be another factor."" Authorities also are looking for video that may have captured the derailment, safety board spokesman Keith Holloway said. Railroad officials have said there were no video cameras aboard the train. Weener said security cameras from a nearby bridge captured the train's approach, but the image is small and obscured by a cloud of dust. Video technicians in Washington will try to recover some usable imagery from the recording, he told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" Metro-North Railroad inspects its tracks twice a week, spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said. The most recent inspection found the track was ""OK for normal operations."" She said the train wasn't equipped with positive train control -- a high-tech system designed to slow down or stop trains to prevent crashes caused by human error. Anders said the railroad conducted routine drug and alcohol tests on crew members but has not released the results. Rockefeller appeared coherent at the scene, and there was no indication he was intoxicated, said a high-ranking law enforcement official who is part of the investigation. Anthony Bottalico, general chairman of the union that represents Rockefeller and the train's conductors, said the crew members are also eager to find out what caused the crash and ""make sure it doesn't ever happen again."" ""Hopefully over the next day or two, there will be some kind of idea or closure,"" he said. The victims . The MTA identified those killed as Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh, New York; James G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring, New York; James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose, New York; and So Kisook Ahn, 35, of Queens, New York. Lovell did freelance audio and was headed into New York to work Sunday morning, said Dave Merandy, a town council member in the Hudson Valley community of Philipstown. ""He loved his family and did what was necessary to keep things afloat with his family. He was a great man,"" Merandy said. One of the survivors suffered a spinal cord injury that could leave him paralyzed from the neck down, said Dr. David Listman, director of the emergency department at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. The man is the father of a 14-year-old boy who was released from the hospital Sunday. ""It's hard to understand how they were sitting next to each other on the train, and the son walks away with minor bruises, and the father sustained such a severe injury,"" Listman said. While patients with severe fractures could be released from the hospital Monday, he said, they may require further treatment and mental health care after surviving the devastating accident. ""For a lot of these people, the train was their way of commuting to work. I think a lot of these people are going to have to contend with getting back to normal life,"" he said. ""I think that's going to be very difficult for them."" Train crash victim was 'pure goodness,' widow says . CNN's Alexandra Field reported from New York. CNN's Matt Smith, Holly Yan and Catherine E.

"Dubai, UAE (CNN) -- A year-long intense diplomatic push by British Prime Minister David Cameron to advance his country's business interests in the United Arab Emirates may not yet deliver the contracts he was hoping for. During his only international interview on his UAE visit ahead of the official opening of the Dubai Air Show on Sunday, Cameron told CNN the sale of up to 60 BAE Eurofighter Typhoon for $10 billion does not have to close this week. ""I'm very hopeful and we've made huge progress. And we're looking at, not just at one particular deal, we're looking at a proper strategic defense partnership between our countries. I'm very confident that is on track,"" the Prime Minister said. ""I'm hopeful for good announcements from Airbus, real progress in terms of BAE Systems, lots of British companies here and also big investments being made by the Emirates into Britain."" About 230,000 jobs, government officials suggest, are directly linked to aerospace. Before leaving, those officials said the Prime Minister held meetings with the Prime Minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Typhoon is built by Britain's BAE, Germany's EADS and Italy's Finmeccanica, but the U.K. is the lead contractor in negotiations. This is widely viewed as an all out effort to snatch it out of the grasp of French rival Dassault and its jet-fighter offering the Rafale. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy opened a naval air base in the UAE in 2009, and there was a widespread belief it was France's contract to lose, but there was on-going rumblings over pricing in the UAE capital over the past two years, which re-opened discussions for Britain. The British Prime Minister has not hid his desire to advance diplomatic and economic relations with the Gulf states of the Middle East to help secure contracts and therefore jobs back on British soil. British officials here talk of a ""domino effect"" if they can close the UAE deal, since others would likely fall into place, as well. On Thursday, Britain announced that the UAE would be one of four Gulf states to have its citizens enjoy the benefits of an electronic visa waiver scheme, which can be obtained 48 hours before traveling. Those two gestures follow a ringing endorsement by the British Prime Minister of Dubai as a candidate city for the 2020 Expo bid which will be decided this month. This past week, his ambassador to the UAE, Dominic Jermey, said Britain is often been seen as the ""eighth emirate."" The UAE is a federation of seven emirates, with Abu Dhabi and Dubai being the two largest, which was founded in 1971. While business development is being worked on, the so-called P5+1 talks are scheduled to resume with Iran on its nuclear program. Gulf states are skeptical that Iran will abide by any terms to limit development of that sector. Cameron said sanctions are what brought Iran to the negotiating table, and a deal should not happen prematurely when asked if sanctions could start to be lifted in the first quarter of next year. ""Britain led the way in Europe putting in place those oil sanctions which i think have brought us to this place. And my view is clear, there shouldn't be removal of sanctions unless there is a good deal."" This year and next are crucial when it comes to strategic business interests, and this extends far beyond what Britain is hoping to secure. The two largest commercial carriers, Dubai-based Emirates and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad are planning to unveil multibillion-dollar plane orders as they experience rapid growth serving as a transport hub between Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. Ahead of the official opening of the air show, Boeing released its Current Market Outlook report suggesting that the region will need 2610 new airplanes over the next two decades, with a book value of over a half trillion dollars. Outside the aerospace sector, the UAE has also accepted bids for tenders of its onshore oil and gas fields. For the first time in three-quarters of a century, production sharing agreements are expiring. While past energy production was dominated by Western-led international oil companies working with Abu Dhabi's national oil company ADNOC, the UAE has let it be known countries which are major importers of its crude will be given equal weighting during this bidding process. The UAE is looking to expand its daily out of crude from 2.9 million barrels a day to 3.5 million by 2017 and sits on roughly 9% of the world's proven oil reserves.","David Cameron says sale of BAE Eurofighter Typhoon does not have to close this week .

"(CNN) -- Here we go again. This week, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations will begin in Israel and the West Bank. Having participated in my own fair share of these kinds of negotiations over the years, I wouldn't presume to discount Secretary of State John Kerry's effort. But I also wouldn't get my hopes up. In 2001, Secretary of State Colin Powell assigned me to assist Gen. Anthony Zinni, who had just been given a mission impossible: Negotiate a cease-fire between Yasser Arafat and Ariel Sharon in the middle of the second intifada. I asked Zinni straight out why he wanted to risk ruining a brilliant career on a goal he couldn't possibly achieve. He replied that he loved hopeless causes. In that case, I told him, he'd come to the right place. Will these be the ""Star Trek"" negotiations and go where no man or woman has ever gone before? It's hard to say. But here are five signs that might offer clues as to whether there's life (or not) on planet Arab-Israeli negotiations. Opinion: Americans, stay open to both sides in Mideast talks . 1. Will the two sides maintain radio silence? So far, Kerry has done what no other U.S. official has ever accomplished: He's gotten the two sides who have a pathological history of leaking to essentially shut up. That's either because there's something meaningful to protect, or alternatively, there's nothing really there there, and that's worth hiding. I suspect it's the former. So watch the leaks from both sides. If the substance of what's being discussed is being backgrounded to embarrass, pressure or undermine the negotiators, the negotiations are in serious trouble. Because this process depends on things Kerry has heard from each side that they can't say publicly yet or won't say to one another, radio silence is critical -- for now. 2. Are folks writing things down? The famous Hollywood mogul Samuel Goldwyn was right: an oral agreement isn't worth the paper it's written on. Oral exchanges and verbal commitments can be starting points. But serious negotiation requires stuff on paper. More than this, every negotiation needs a way to organize the effort, and an agreement must be reduced to a text. Ideally, the United States would control that text -- as Jimmy Carter did at Camp David or as James Baker did with the terms of reference and invitations to the Madrid Peace Conference. But the key question is whether the negotiators are working on language that will actually fill in the agreement. And what kind of agreement are they working toward: Borders/security first or an accord on the basic principles on all the issues? If the parties aren't crystal clear on where they're heading, then any road will get them there -- and that's a recipe for drift and disaster. The same is true for showing maps. Borders of a Palestinian state are a key element in these negotiations. If you hear that one side or the other won't produce them, start looking for a new conflict to mediate. 3. What's happening away from the negotiating table? There was a time that we believed we could insulate the talks at the table from the environment outside. That was called Oslo, and the process failed. There must be some correlation. That's why Kerry has tried to get each side to stop doing negative things for a period of time -- six to nine months. Israelis are supposed to do a phased release of Palestinian prisoners and limit settlement activity. Palestinians are supposed to stand down from efforts to bring the issue of statehood to the United Nations or press their claims against Israel in international bodies, and stop incitement too. Already, both sides are unhappy with nonobservance of these actions. A certain amount of dysfunctional behavior from both sides is built into the reality that one is the occupier and one the occupied. But given how little the Israeli and Palestinian publics seem to have invested in these talks, everything possible must be done to demonstrate that life on the ground is changing too. And we're not off to a good start. 4. Watch what the tough guys say . Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are as much about domestic politics as anything else. And watching those in each camp react to what's going on in the negotiations is important. A certain amount of bluster from each side is expected. But one way to gauge the seriousness of what's happening is to look at how worried the opponents of the peace process are. The Palestinians public is deeply skeptical of these talks. And Hamas for sure will oppose them. So will members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party. More important will be the reaction of the two newbies in Israel in politics and in the coalition: Naftali Bennet and Yair Lapid. Pay careful attention to Bennet, whose right wing views count, and who will try mightily to make sure he knows what's being offered at the table. If he's relaxed and silent, you can bet the negotiations are remaining in pretty safe territory from Benjamin Netanyahu's perspective -- or he's being frozen out. Either way, watch out, signs of trouble may be brewing at home for the prime minister. 5. What's the U.S. doing? The odds against a conflict-ending accord that addresses all the issues are pretty long. It will require major moves from Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu and traveling to a place they've never been before. But it will also require the U.S. to be in the middle of the mix. Right now, Kerry describes the U.S. role as a facilitator, a term that has very little meaning. (It's the one we used to describe the American approach at the July 2000 Camp David summit). If this is going to work, both Kerry, and at the right time, Obama, will have to be all over these talks like a cheap suit. Middle East peace is hard. And if the US wants an agreement -- assuming the two sides do -- they'll have to push, shove and use ample amounts of vinegar and honey to get a deal, including developing formal proposals to bridge the gaps on tough issues such as Jerusalem. And those U.S. positions need to be fair and reflect the needs of both sides. Does the president want it that badly? If he does, a high-level, pretty high-risk leaders' summit is in his future. Stay tuned. We may just have a chance this year to find out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Israeli-Palestinian talks are set to begin this week .

"(CNN) -- Remember the Celtic Tiger? It was billed as a dream for Ireland; emigration slowed as tech giants like Apple, Dell and Intel set up manufacturing plants on the outskirts of Dublin. They were attracted by a young, well-educated English-speaking island in the heart of the euro zone. Other foreign firms set up call centers and back office operations, attracted by a corporate tax rate at 10% (now 12.5%). Dublin buzzed and property prices shot up. Banks were encouraged to loan money to the fast growing building sector and everyone was flipping houses as prices soared. Then it spread to the rest of the country as tax breaks led to housing estates being built in remote parts of the country, miles from services and jobs. These loans were then bundled up and used by the bankers and builders to invest in property overseas. Everyone seemed happy. We know what happened next. By November 2010 the government went cap-in-hand to Europe and the IMF for an 85 billion euro ($117 billion) bailout as the country took on all the debt of collapsing banks. With that came massive austerity; about 20% of the country's GDP has painfully been cut -- through budget cuts such as social welfare reductions, pension freezes, tax rises. Three years on. Where is Ireland now? The answer lies in Dublin. As the city led the bust, it's clear that the capital is leading the recovery on the back of social media. And I am promised it's different this time. Once empty buildings and warehouses in the Docklands are filling up with the next generation of young well-educated Irish graduates working at the next generation of American tech names -- Google, Facebook, Twitter, Trip Advisor, Ancestry. There are also Japanese, Chinese and German tech firms setting up here, attracted by the language skills they can't find at home. The cloud has come to Dublin and is enveloping the silicon docks. There certainly is an argument that some of these firms are attracted by more than a multilingual young employment pool. Even with a rock-bottom corporate tax rate, some of the firms use tax efficiencies to not even pay that on their European sales. But looking beyond that, having these firms growing in Dublin has led to a score of much smaller, indigenous start-ups riding on the back of the bigger boys who set the tone. And they can be right next store thanks to plenty of cheap office space -- space none could have affording five years ago. This simply did not happen when the likes of Dell was assembling PCs on the outskirts. Now, next to them are also the incubators, private equity firms, coffee shops and hip new hotels that all seem to be needed for this kind of area to thrive. So, where Greece and Spain have surely lost credibility in the eyes of the business community, Ireland has actually gained traction. It's benefited so much from the changes, that Forbes Magazine just named Ireland as the best place in the world to do business -- a first for Ireland. It may not sound ideal for employees, but Forbes pointed out that real wages fell 17% during the height of the crisis, and with unemployment near 13%, there is a large pool of well-educated young people looking for work. Add to that the controversial 12.5% corporate tax rate, and Forbes wrote ""Ireland still maintains an extremely pro-business environment."" What about the rest of the country? The recovery is far from reaching everywhere. Emigration from villages has soared as many small firms, built on the back of construction, collapsed. Others that may have focused on exports-led industries that suffered when Europe and the USA went through the economic crisis. Social welfare payments have been slashed, and contributions to charities have been slashed too, seen as a ""perfect storm"" for the poor as one charity told me. Of course the unemployment rate falls when people leave. Charities say the long-term unemployed aren't about to get these social media jobs, nor even the ancillary jobs in the bars and hotels. So, the government is using groups like ""Connect Ireland"" to tempt more companies to the areas outside Dublin and Cork. But many mortgages are under water, house prices are only now beginning to go higher, and the government will continue to slash budgets in 2014. Now it also has to attract investors to buy its bonds on the open market so the country can start to pay back that 85B euro loan. It has to achieve all this without a healthy bank sector and with unemployment still in double digits. Look around Dublin and you can see the change -- building cranes are popping up, shops and pubs are buzzing and traffic jams are back. It's unlikely to spread to the rest of the country anytime soon, if ever, and it's unlikely to ever be labeled the ""Celtic Tiger"" again. Shall we call it the Celtic Cloud?","In 2010, Ireland asked for an 85B euro bailout as it took on collapsed banks' debts .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. and European Union will begin talks later this year on a multi-trillion dollar free-trade pact to boost economic growth. President Barack Obama and EU leaders are hoping agreement to reduce trade barriers will support millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the EU and the U.S. would strive to open negotiations by the end of June. ""This undertaking won't be easy. Ideally, we'd like to complete this work in about two years from now,"" De Gucht said. Read more: EU leaders agree historic cut in long-term budget . If finalized, the deal -- dubbed the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership -- would be the biggest bilateral trade agreement ever negotiated. As two of the world's most important trade partners, business between the U.S. and the EU already exceeds $2 billion a day and $5 trillion annually. This accounts for one third of global trade flows, according to the EU and the U.S. chamber of commerce. Watch more: Deepening US, EU trade relations . The negotiations come as governments seek new ways to rekindle growth without adding to already inflated national debts while central banks have pumped trillions of dollars into the global economy. Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso described the pact as a ""game changer"" and said it ""is a boost to our economies that does not cost a cent of taxpayer money."" The EU estimates the partnership could increase the 27-nation bloc's annual economic output by 0.5%. US President Barack Obama announced the launch of talks in his State of the Union address yesterday. He said of the partnership: ""Trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs."" Obama added: ""It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class."" The U.S. and EU have been focusing on bilateral deals with trading partners as it became clear that talks at the World Trade Organization on a global deal -- the Doha round -- were making little progress. De Gucht said the deal would center on dismantling any remaining trade tariffs while tackling regulatory and certification barriers. The US Chamber of Commerce has calculated that the removal of all tariffs could add $180 billion to combined EU-U.S. gross domestic product over five years. Eliminating half the non-tariff barriers to trade could add a further 3% to GDP for both the EU and the U.S. Barroso added that tariffs must be cut wherever it makes sense and is possible. He said: """"For these negotiations to succeed, we need -- above all -- political will: a desire to make our rules and regulations compatible.""","The EU estimates the partnership could boost the bloc's annual economic output by 0.5% .

"(CNN) -- The 2022 World Cup in Qatar has an unlikely backer -- Zahir Belounis. Despite being stuck in Qatar for two years in an ordeal that he says left him contemplating a hunger strike and suicide, the freed footballer insists the Middle Eastern nation deserves to stage arguably the world's top sporting event. World governing body FIFA's decision to award the 2022 contest to Qatar three years ago has generated controversy both over what time of the year it will be held and the way migrant workers, largely responsible for the tournament's infrastructure, are treated. ""They deserve it,"" the French-Algerian told CNN on Friday. The ""people are working very hard for it. A lot of Qatari friends were sad at my situation. ""I enjoyed my time there. The people who tried to destroy my life, I will not forgive them, but I will forever cherish the people who helped me. My life in Qatar was great, but the last two years were a disaster."" A relieved and exhausted Belounis, who was embroiled in a pay dispute with club El Jaish, returned home to Paris on Thursday with his wife and two daughters after the 33-year-old was finally granted an exit visa. But instead of saying Qatar should be stripped of holding the World Cup because of its controversial employment laws -- especially the kafala system, which effectively means foreign employees can't leave the country without their employer's permission -- Belounis indeed backed the emirate's right to host the competition. An Amnesty International report released last week claimed the abuse of migrant workers in Qatar was an issue and even Sepp Blatter has described working conditions there as ""unacceptable"" -- although the FIFA president is adamant the World Cup in nine years won't be moved to another country. ""World Cup organizers were sad"" about his predicament, said Belounis. ""I can't say bad things against Qataris or Qatar, just against the club,"" he added in reference to his dispute with El Jaish. As well as endorsing Qatar as World Cup host, Belounis said there was little wrong with the employment laws in place -- as long as they were correctly followed. ""There are rules ... if people respect them, everything will be fine,"" he said. ""I believe Qatar will grow up in a very good way. I don't think I helped them to grow. Now we know that there are a lot of people that are abused. ""It's not the state of Qatar or the government. There is a company that brings the workers. The company has to respect the rules. I'm sad to see the workers abused, but it's not the organizers or the government."" Belounis, a striker, credited his wife for being ""stronger"" than him during his nightmare when he admitted to crying ""every day, like a baby."" As Belounis' fight to leave Qatar is over, so it also seems, is his playing career. ""I think it's finished for me,"" he said. ""I think a team, as a symbolic thing, they (might) want me to train for them. My psychology is very bad right now. ""I didn't take any medication but I will see if I have the power to train. The fight was so intense."" The last few months might have made Belounis a cause celebre, but he believes he won't be headline news for very much longer. ""In one or two weeks, everyone will forget about me,"" he said. ""I have to focus on my life, have a normal life, find a job, to restart my life and enjoy my family."" The Qatari Foreign Ministry and Qatari Football Association (QFA) didn't reply to CNN's queries earlier this week seeking comment. But in October, the QFA told CNN that ""as in any other football association in the world, there will unfortunately always be contractual disputes between clubs and players/coaches."" It added: ""It is also relevant to emphasize that up to now the player has not taken any action in front of the competent judicial bodies of FIFA."" The QFA said further that Belounis received full compensation in relation to a claim he made for compensation from another club, Al Markhiya. ""However, in the alleged case of El Jaish Club, Zahir Belounis did not contact QFA, although he had experienced the efficiency of doing so when his request was legitimate,"" it said.","Zahir Belounis says Qatar deserves to host the World Cup in 2022 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Even as China is softening its one-child policy, one if its most renowned film directors is finding himself in trouble for violating the nation's infamous family planning law. Zhang Yimou, an Oscar nominee, is in the eye of a controversy after admitting to having three children with his wife Chen Ting. He now faces stiff fine -- and harsh public criticisms -- for breaking China's family planning rules. China's stringent family planning rules limit most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two, with few exceptions. Ironically for Zhang, his troubles come as China announced in November the decision to loosen the policy by allowing couples to have two children even if just one of them is an only child. Last weekend, the standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, formally adopted the new rules. Even so, the new rules apparently will not help extricate Zhang, known for movies such as ""Red Sorghum,"" ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" and ""Hero,"" from his current troubles. He also directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Contrite, Zhang, 62, apologized in an open letter for his ""excessive children."" ""As a film director, it takes a lot of efforts and good movies for people to remember you, but having excessive children had ruined it all,"" he said, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. ""I sincerely apologize to everyone on my 'excessive children' case. I admit it's my mistake and I won't blame others for it."" ""I will learn my lessons, and I'm willing to cooperate with any investigation from family planning commission,"" Zhang said. Local officials decide the amount of the fine. In Jiangsu province, where Zhang's case is under investigation, couples who have two ""beyond-the-quota"" children may be fined five to eight times the annual income of the couples combined. If so, Zhang is potentially liable to pay a hefty fine. ""The case is still under investigation,"" a staff at Wuxi's Binhe Family Planning bureau told CNN. ""We will announce the result once we have all information ready."" Zhang's breach of the policy has set off a firestorm, especially among netizens who resent how the rich and famous in China flout rules and policies. JinqiuT wrote on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging service: ""Celebrities should abide laws and rules as common people."" But the filmmaker has defenders too. ""He will raise his children, which has nothing to do with other people,"" wrote another. ""He doesn't have to apologize. He didn't steal others' children. He can afford to raise children and at least his children won't endure hardships."" Zhang is no stranger to controversy. As one of the most inventive and admired filmmakers in China, Zhang has won numerous awards in China and overseas. Long before his directorial debut of his film, ""Red Sorghum"" in 1987, he was already widely admired for his stunning camera work. One of his earlier films, ""Raise the Red Lantern"" was nominated for a Oscar as the Best Foreign Film in 1992, but it failed to pass the censors in China and was initially banned from local cinemas. Censors sensitive to Zhang's subtle metaphors banned some of his films from local cinemas, if only briefly. Most of his films focused on the oppressiveness of conservatism. Opinion: China is not ending its human rights abuses . Like most of his contemporaries who grew up during the Cultural Revolution, Zhang spent three years in the countryside undergoing ""ideological remolding."" He later worked as a janitor in a textile factory. In the late 1970s, he taught himself photography and enrolled in the prestigious Beijing Film Academy. CNN's Feng Ke and Susan Wang contributed to this report.","Famous Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou apologizes for a breach of China's one-child policy .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Hosni Mubarak's fall from power a year ago stunned the world -- three decades of iron-clad rule ended in 17 days by an unexpected groundswell of popular protests. A banner headline in the Al-Ahram newspaper said: ""The people have toppled the regime."" But in the year that followed, Egyptians increasingly realized that what they ousted was one man, not the military that stood behind him. And they grew bitterly frustrated at what they perceive as the slow pace of change. Saturday brought another reminder of the powers that be in Egypt as America's top military officer was in Cairo to meet with his Egyptian counterparts. On the table for discussion was the fate of 16 Americans who are among 43 foreigners working for civil society institutions who are to be tried in Egypt for receiving illegal foreign funding. And possibly the fate of U.S. military aid, conditioned now on the progress of Egypt's transition to democracy. The United States viewed the legal proceedings against the foreigners as a crackdown, another sign that autocracy has hardly departed Egypt. Many Egyptians would probably agree. On the first anniversary of Mubarak's departure, the plan was to voice their frustration, though Saturday came and went without the ceremony that was anticipated on such a day. Activists kicked off a general strike, hoping for the kind of large protests that made Tahrir Square a familiar name. But the demonstrations were scattered and light. ""A year later, nothing has changed. We have been facing the same regime, if worse,"" prominent activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN on Saturday. Ibrahim said farmers, students and workers will help ""settle this revolution once and for all."" ""Many people ... don't know what actually toppled Mubarak was the last three days of those 17 days when large numbers of workers in different sectors went on strike,"" she said from Cairo. The Egypt Revolutionaries' Alliance, comprised of democratic and secular political groups, called for the immediate dismantling of the interim government and immediate presidential elections. It also demanded the dismissal of the prosecutor general, and a purge and overhaul of the Interior Ministry that came to be despised during last year's revolt and again last week as anger mounted over a deadly stampede at a soccer match. The alliance said a committee should be formed to to investigate any crimes by Egypt's new rulers while revolutionary tribunals should try former regime figures. Meanwhile Saturday, an American student was arrested with an Australian journalist and their female translator in the city of Mahalla, north of Cairo, for inciting people to join the general strike and handing them money for doing so, a spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Interior told CNN. Spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said they were transferred to a general prosecutor for an investigation. An official spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said it was in touch with the male student. The arrests came as Human Rights Watch decried what it called a disturbing assault on free expression. ""Violations of the right to freedom of expression have included military trials of protesters and bloggers, interrogations of journalists and activists for criticizing the military, the suspension of new satellite television licenses, and the closure of an outlet of Al Jazeera television,"" the global monitoring group said. It cited cases of notable people who have ""faced charges of insulting religion under vague and arbitrary laws dating from the Mubarak administration."" And another case in which a pro-democracy activist was sentenced to a year behind bars for handing out leaflets. ""Actions like these were hallmarks of Mubarak's 30-year rule, but they also have been used repeatedly in the year since the (Supreme Armed Forces Council) assumed control,"" Human Rights Watch said. The revolutionaries' alliance, however, was not deterred. The next step, said member Rami Shaath, will be civil disobedience. Don't pay taxes or government bills. The armed forces council came down hard on the strike, saying it ""serves those interests of parties aiming for the destruction of Egypt and is a tool brought to Egypt from abroad."" Council leaders Lt. Gen Sami Enan and Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, meanwhile, sat down for talks with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey. Dempsey's spokesman, Col. Dave Lapan, said they discussed a wide range of issues, including the investigation of nongovernmental organizations in the country and an announcement that 43 foreigners working for such groups, including 16 Americans, would face prosecution. Egyptian authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations, including the U.S.-based Freedom House, National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. Among those going to court is Sam LaHood, the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. The Egyptians said the pro-democracy organizations had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license. But some of the groups had been tacitly operating for some time in Egypt without permission, even under Mubarak. Washington threatened to cut off the $1.3 billion in military assistance it gives Egypt every year. In doing so, the United States escalated the crisis that is now testing its alliance with its Arab ally. Lapan gave no details of the meetings. Outside, unease reigned on the streets of Cairo and beyond. The Egyptians served as role models for their Libyan neighbors. They look now to a Syria in flames and flickers of discontent elsewhere and can take heart that they played a role in inspiring people to stand up for freedom. But a year since their own revolution was declared victorious, the euphoria has dimmed. The general strike is open ended. More may take to the streets Sunday, which unlike Saturday is a working day in the Muslim world. Organizers have not given up hope. They are optimistic that momentum will build as long as a military regime rules Egypt.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai's office contacted the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan about reports the ambassador warned against sending more U.S. troops to the country, a Karzai spokesman told CNN Thursday. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Ambassador Karl Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over Karzai's government. One official, who spoke on condition of not being identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables, said the two communications ""expressed concern and reservations about troop increases in Afghanistan"" until more is known about Karzai's government after his recent re-election. Separately, a senior U.S. official also confirmed the existence of two Eikenberry classified cables. The official said Eikenberry expressed reservations about troop increases because of lingering concerns about Karzai and uncertainties about the government he is going to put in place. The second official also asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables. In Kabul, Eikenberry's office would not confirm to Karzai's office the reports about the cables, Karzai spokesman Seyemic Herawi said. Herawi said Karzai will not comment on the reports without more information from the U.S. Embassy. Should more troops be sent to Afghanistan? Share your thoughts . Eikenberry previously expressed worry about corruption in Karzai's government and its ability to partner with the United States to fight the Taliban. A senior State Department official told CNN that President Obama's administration has questions about Karzai's behavior, suggesting it has been inconsistent. Asked for an official response on reports of the cables, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it does not comment on private messages, but did confirm that there had been correspondence between Eikenberry and the president. In Washington, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly declined to comment Thursday on Eikenberry's communications. ""We are not going to get into the details of this kind of advice,"" Kelly said. ""This is a privileged channel of communication. They have the right to receive this advice in a confidential way,"" Kelly said. ""Ambassador Eikenberry has been providing this kind of advice and analysis to the president and secretary since he arrived,"" he said. ""The president really deserves the right to be able to gather all of this information from all of the different principals, people involved in the shaping of this policy."" Earlier, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said, ""We won't discuss classified documents publicly, but, as we have said for months, success in Afghanistan depends on having a true partner in the Afghan government."" Initial reports of cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. The developments came as Obama told his war council Wednesday that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended, and then asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops, a senior administration official told CNN. The war council -- comprising top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- met with Obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops. The meeting lasted more than two hours, according to the senior administration official. ""The president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he's been presented,"" the senior official said. ""The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended. After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner."" In particular, Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government, the official said. Earlier, a senior administration official and a U.S. military official independently told CNN that one option presented to Obama calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country. The military official said the plan would send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade of about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops. The combat brigades would be brought in gradually, in three-month intervals, according to the military official. The troops would be spread across the country, mainly focusing in the south and southeast, where much of the fighting is, according to the military official. The option has been a favorite at the Pentagon in recent weeks, the official added. That is only one option, the senior administration official emphasized. Three other options, the official said, would be ""different mixes,"" or ""different components of it."" Despite reports to the contrary, Obama has not decided the number of U.S. troops he will send to Afghanistan, White House officials said. Such reports are ""absolutely false,"" Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. And anyone who suggests otherwise, ""doesn't have, in all honesty, the slightest idea what they're talking about."" Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee urged Obama in a letter sent Wednesday -- Veterans Day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by U.S. military leaders in Afghanistan. The letter, signed by 10 Republican committee members, said success in Afghanistan will require enabling local leaders to govern and secure their country without substantial international assistance. CNN 's Barbara Starr, Elise Labott, Suzanne Malveaux, Mike Mount, Chris Lawrence and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","State Department says what ambassador tells president is confidential .

"(CNN) -- Snow is no surprise in the Northeast and northern Plains states in winter. But a blizzard? That's something different -- and dangerous. That's especially a concern when it threatens New York City, with more than 8 million residents and legions of visitors perhaps still stumbling home from Times Square after the Big Apple dropped on New Year's Eve. As of Wednesday night, New York City was under a winter storm warning, just like many other densely populated communities in parts of eight states. A stone's throw away in neighboring Long Island -- including in Nassau County, which borders New York -- the National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning from 6 p.m. Thursday through 1 p.m. Friday because of a forecast marked by 8 to 10 inches of snow, wind chills dipping to 10-below zero and sustained winds up to 35 mph and gusting 10 mph stronger than that. ""Falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely,"" the Weather Service said. ""This will lead to whiteout conditions making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel."" Even if it doesn't officially get socked with a blizzard -- which meteorologists define as three hours or longer of 35 mph winds or more and considerable snow -- New York City should come close. Its forecast calls for about 9 inches of snow, subzero wind chills and winds regularly blowing between 21 and 26 mph, which could test newly inaugurated Mayor Bill de Blasio. By sheer numbers, other cities are predicted to have it worse. Albany, New York, could shudder at lows of 11 below and some 14 inches of snow. Boston's temperatures alone (not just the wind chill) should be minus 3 on Friday night, by which time the Hub should have 5 to 11 inches of flakes on the ground. Two days ahead of time, due to the storm, the city called off school for Friday. Citing likely ""near blizzard"" conditions Thursday night into late Friday morning, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency warned that 1 to 2 feet of fluffy, drifting snow could accumulate in some pockets and that there could be moderate coastal flooding. The combination of everything -- especially the extreme cold and strong winds -- has homeless shelters at the ready, knowing there may be more people needing their help. Crossroads Rhode Island, for example, expects a number of people will end up sleeping on its floors over the coming days. ""Our main emphasis is getting people inside where it is safer and warmer,"" said Jennifer Harris, a spokeswoman for the Pine Street Inn shelter system in Boston, where a snow emergency has been declared. ""... Pine Street Inn is making sure to have extra staff and food and water. We are geared up to provide to a greater number of people."" Already, wintry weather was hitting parts of the Midwest on Wednesday night in the form of snow in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois. The weather contributed to nearly 600 flight cancellations in and out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport -- more than half the total for all the United States, according to airline tracking website FlightAware -- and it should get worse, with 5 to 9 inches of snow forecast for Thursday. And parts of the northern United States should get even colder, somehow, as the week rolls along. Green Bay's beloved Packers will welcome the San Francisco 49ers to Wisconsin, where low temperatures could bottom out Sunday night around at minus 17. It will be relatively balmy Sunday in Cincinnati, Ohio, but potentially a lot wetter with snow and rain possible when the city's Bengals host the San Diego Chargers in another NFL playoff match-up. Of course, while the players might not have a choice, fans don't have to brave the cold for either game. The big worries are for those who travel in the coming days. Authorities in New York, for example, say they may shut down the Long Island Expressway if whiteout conditions make driving along the east-west highway too perilous. Kevin Willims isn't taking any chances, nor is he predicting a world-ending storm. The New Yorker said that he plans to sit tight and let Mother Nature do her thing. ""There's not much you can do,"" said Willims. ""When it's snowing and these streets lock up, there's really no where you can go, so it's best to just stay in."" CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","NEW: Boston declares a snow emergency because of coming snow .

"(CNN) -- Passengers on a Russian polar expedition ship off Antarctica are getting a whiter Christmas than they probably wanted. The MV Akademik Shokalskiy, with 74 people aboard, got trapped in ice and is waiting for other ships with ice-breaking capabilities to reach it, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said Wednesday. A British rescue coordination center received a satellite distress signal on Christmas morning from the Russian-flagged ship and contacted the Australian authority, which handles the Southern Ocean region where the vessel was stuck, an AMSA statement said. It pinpointed the trapped ship's location as 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. Three icebreakers were headed to help the Russian vessel, the AMSA statement said, adding that none were expected to reach it before Friday. Expeditions Online, a polar booking agent for the MV Akademik Shokalskiy, said on its website that the ship got stuck ""part way through her Australasian Antarctic Expedition towards Mawson's Hut at Cape Denison."" ""According to reports, nobody is in present danger and three nearby icebreakers are being sent to assist,"" the Expeditions Online website said. It described the ship as ""a fully ice-strengthened expedition vessel"" for working in polar regions. ""This class of vessel is world-renowned for polar exploration, because of its strength, maneuverability and small passenger numbers,"" the company's website said.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Security forces wielding clubs and firing weapons beat back hundreds of would-be demonstrators who had flocked to a square in the capital on Wednesday to continue protests against an election they have denounced as fraudulent, witnesses told CNN. Hard-line Iranian students mock British, U.S. and Israeli flags outside the British Embassy in Tehran on Tuesday. ""They were waiting for us,"" one source said. ""They all have guns and riot uniforms. It was like a mouse trap."" Another witness told CNN that hundreds of people were chased by security forces and clubbed about a mile from the square. They were among the more than half a dozen witnesses who told CNN that security forces outnumbering protesters used overwhelming force to crush a planned demonstration in Baharestan Square, in front of the parliament building. The witnesses said police charged against the demonstrators, striking them with batons, beating women and old men and firing weapons into the air in order to disperse them. The melee extended beyond the square, according to one woman, who told CNN that she was traveling toward Baharestan with her friends as evening approached ""to express our opposition to these killings these days and demanding freedom. ""But the black-clad police, they stopped everyone. They emptied buses that were taking people there and let the private cars go on ... and then, all of a sudden, some 500 people with clubs of wood, they came out of the Hedayat Mosque and they poured into the streets and they started beating everyone."" People were heard yelling ""Death to the Dictatorship, Death to Ahmadinejad, Death to Khamanei and Death to Basiji,"" she said. Government-run Press TV gave a starkly different account, saying only about 200 protesters had gathered in front of the parliament and 50 others in a nearby square -- all were dispersed by security forces. ""A heavy presence of police prevented violence in the area,"" Press TV said.  Watch an Ahmadinejad supporter describe the protests Â» . At the nearby Bank of Melli hospital, a person who answered the phone said no one had been admitted as a result of any clashes. The number of demonstrators who ventured into the streets of Tehran appeared to have fallen since Sunday, said CNN's Reza Sayah, who flew Wednesday to the United States from Tehran. He said exhaustion after eight consecutive days of massive protests may have combined with fear of government reprisals to limit the number of protesters. The key to what happens next, he said, depends on what role is assumed by Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose supporters say was robbed of a victory in the June 12 elections. Wednesday's protests came as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad met in Tehran with a delegation from Belarus in his first official meeting since the disputed June 12 election triggered widespread unrest. The official results of the election gave the incumbent president a landslide victory, but his challengers have declared it was rigged and are seeking a new vote. Ahmadinejad's claim of victory got renewed support from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, who endorsed the results and reiterated Wednesday that the government will not back down. Demonstrators must follow the law, he said. According to official figures, 17 people have been killed in clashes with government forces over the past 11 days. Anti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets in at least four cities outside Tehran. But CNN has received unconfirmed reports of as many as 150 deaths related to the popular uprising. The government's response to it appears to have hardened in recent days. CNN has received numerous accounts of night-time roundups by government forces of opposition activists and international journalists from their homes. Some Tehran residents said they were too afraid to talk about the political crisis over the phone to anyone in the United States or Europe. Many protesters debated whether to venture into the streets. ""I am not going outside my house at all,"" a 21-year-old college student from Tehran said. ""The streets are too dangerous, and just so very busy with police. Ahhhh, when will our lives get back to normal?"" Worried the government was monitoring their phone conversations, some residents said the Internet was the best way to transmit information. However, the spotty connection made it difficult to rely on the Web. ""It's beyond fear,"" said a woman who arrived at a U.S. airport from Iran, but still did not want her name used for fear for her safety. ""The situation is more like terror.""  Watch arrivals describe the situation Â» . Khamenei urged parliamentarians Wednesday to tolerate the voices of the opposition, government-run Press TV reported. Khamenei made the remarks to a group of lawmakers in Tehran, Press TV said. But Khamenei added that the Islamic establishment and people ""will never give in to coercive demands with regards to Iran's presidential elections,"" Press TV said. The newscast added that a spokesman for the Guardian Council, which oversees elections, had declared that ""no major irregularities took place"" in the elections. Though ""minor irregularities"" were found, they were not significant enough to change the results, the council spokesman said, according to Press TV. Iran's ambassador to Mexico defended his country's actions, saying Wednesday that the anti-government protesters represent but a small minority of the nation. ""The minority can't impose their opinion on the majority,"" Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""They can't impose a dictatorship saying that the majority is not going to govern."" There are acceptable ways of addressing electoral fraud, if any occurred, he said. ""But they go out on the street, they attack buses, they attack banks; that affects the security of the country."" Asked why the government has made it impossible for nearly all international journalists to report from Iran, he accused the media of not accurately reporting events. ""In Tehran, there were much bigger demonstrations in favor of the government that you didn't report about,"" he said. Asked about the shooting of 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan, whose death, captured on video, has become emblematic of the crackdown on protesters, he said, ""It is not clear who killed whom."" ""Terrorists"" were among the demonstrators, he said. ""Some armed people have attacked police. ... Naturally, we have to respond."" ""We do not beat up our people and we do not kill them,"" he said in a separate interview with CNN International. Iran said the Agha-Soltan might have been shot by ""mistake,"" the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday. The report said the investigation into the death of Agha-Soltan is continuing, ""but according to the evidence so far, it could be said that she was killed by mistake. The marksmen had mistaken her for the sister of one of the Monafeghin who had been executed in the Province of Mazandaran some time ago."" Monafeghin refers to the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, which promotes a Marxist government for Iran and has waged a campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic Tehran government -- including bombings that killed politicians, judges and cabinet members. Meanwhile, Iranian authorities said they have arrested several foreign nationals, some with British passports, in connection with the country's post-election unrest. Intelligence Minister Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ezhei told reporters that some people with links to the West and Israel had planned a series of bombings in Iran ahead of the June 12 election, the government-funded Press TV reported Wednesday. ""England is among the countries that fan the flames with their heavy propaganda, which is against all diplomatic norms,"" Mohseni-Ezhei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. ""And the BBC Farsi has also played a major role. Also, a number of people carrying British passports have played a role in the recent disturbances.""  Watch a report on Iran's history with the West Â» . The British Foreign Office said it was looking into the claims. Earlier Wednesday, Press TV said police raided a building in central Tehran used as a ""headquarters"" to foment post-election unrest. The television station, citing unnamed sources, said the building was used by campaign staffers of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi. And evidence indicated that ""foreign elements"" were behind the planning, Press TV said. The Iranian government has long blamed other countries, especially Britain, for ""meddling"" in its affairs but has offered no proof. Tehran said Wednesday it was temporarily recalling its ambassador from London, another move in escalating tit-for-tat gestures between the governments. On Tuesday, Britain expelled two Iranian diplomats. A day earlier, Iran told two British diplomats to leave. The difficulty in getting information has been compounded by a government clampdown on representatives of the international news media, who have been banned from covering protests. That has led some news outlets including CNN to rely on information from people who are disseminating information via social networking Web sites. According to Reporters Without Borders, 36 journalists have been arrested, 26 of them Iranian, since the election and ""many others"" are missing.","NEW: Khamenei: Islamic establishment ""will never give in to coercive demands""

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- As little Ella-Louise faded away, her tiny, frail body wracked with pain, her heartbroken mother was left to look on, feeling powerless. Linda van Roy says she could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby in the last hours of her life. ""In that period, they tell you it's best not to give any fluids, because babies survive on little drops of liquid,"" she said. ""So we stopped feeding her. In the end, it was bones and skin and no more baby left."" Ten-month-old Ella-Louise died two years ago with Krabbe disease, a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system. In the final days of Ella-Louise's life, when she was being given palliative sedation, van Roy, of Schilde, Belgium, says she could still see the agony on her daughter's face. ""She died on Tuesday; on Monday, we saw on her face that she was still in pain. And then you start to get angry, because you know that there is no medication left to give her to take away that pain."" She wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter's short life come more quickly. Unbearable suffering . Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in ""constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated."" Minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons. Now, the country's lawmakers are debating a bill which would extend the ""right to die"" to those under the age of 18 who are terminally ill and in intolerable physical pain. The bill cleared a senate committee vote on Wednesday; it must clear several other hurdles before becoming law. Since Ella-Louise was only a baby, her case would never have qualified for euthanasia. Under the current rules, the patient must be able to make a repeated request for euthanasia themselves while experiencing unbearable suffering of which there is no prospect for improvement. But van Roy believes that children, and parents of sick babies, should have more options, including the right to choose when to die. ""We want those children to be able to talk about euthanasia, and if they really want to say: 'Stop, this is it. I don't want it anymore,' we want people to have a choice,"" she said. Polls show the majority of Belgians agree with the principle of offering euthanasia to children. The current debate is less about whether or not to extend the legislation and more about what conditions to apply to the law: from what age euthanasia should be available and whether that should be with or without parental consent. Parental consent . This month, 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice. Gerlant van Berlaer from the Free University Brussels was one of them. ""Doctors do terminate the lives of children as well as adults, but today it's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it's illegal,"" he said. ""This means that there's a lot of room to do things the wrong way."" Van Berlaer stresses that only a tiny number of children would ever choose to end their lives this way: children with cancer, for example, who are still in charge of their cognitive faculties but in terrible pain. Kenneth Chambaere is a researcher at the Free University Brussels focusing on end-of-life care and euthanasia. He has compared end of life practice in Flanders before and after euthanasia was legalized in 2002, to gauge whether there has been a slippery slope. He says his research shows that although the number of euthanasia requests has gone up, from 1.1% before 2002 to 1.9% by 2008, the number of instances in which doctors have hastened the end of life without patient consent has gone down considerably. And he says minors are only a very small fraction of those deaths in any case. ""People dying underage mostly die of accidents or trauma, so very sudden deaths where no end-of-life decision making is possible,"" he said. ""And a euthanasia request is very rare in those patients."" Chambaere argues that the debate in Belgium is more one of principle than anything else; only very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them. Palliative care . Experiences in the Netherlands, where patients older than 12 are allowed to request euthanasia with their parents' consent, would seem to support this: Only five children have chosen to die by euthanasia since the law was introduced in 2002. But critics say children cannot reasonably decide whether to end their own lives. Palliative nurse Sonja Develter, who specializes in end-of-life care for children, says that among the 200 children she's nursed to their deaths, she's never met a child who asked for death to come early. ""The main concern for children is always for the family,"" she said. ""It's difficult for a child, because he feels he's slipping away, but he cannot tell his parents as that's not what they want to hear. ""Children say to me, 'It's not difficult to die, but please look after my parents.' "" Develter worries that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear, and that this would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers. One of Sonja's patients is Izabela Sacewicz, who has Huntington's disease, a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children. Eight years ago, she was a bubbling, active child -- top of her class, according to her mother, Iwona. Now, having just turned 18, she can't eat or walk without help. She finds it difficult to speak, but her mind is still her own. In a painful exchange, her mother explains to her what euthanasia is, using the simplest terms she can think of. ""Euthanasia means if you are unwell, you are so unhappy that you don't want to stay here, you want to leave, to go high up to God,"" she said. ""But if you leave, you leave forever."" Izabela listens, the strain showing on her face. ""Do you think it's good or not good?"" her mother asks. ""It's not good."" The words are barely audible. Euthanasia: Be glad you have a choice .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- After months of tough negotiations and intense political wrangling, Iraqi lawmakers Thursday approved the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement, a pact that allows the presence of American troops in Iraq for three more years. Iraqis in a coffee shop watch the Iraqi parliament on television on Thursday. The vote -- which now needs unanimous ratification from the country's three-member presidency council -- comes after a compromise on a reform package that Sunni Arab politicians demanded in return for their backing of the agreement. There were 198 lawmakers from the 275-member parliament present for the vote; 149 of them voted for the security pact, which is to replace a U.N. mandate that expires at the end of year. The proposal, reached after months of negotiations between Iraqi and U.S. representatives, sets June 30, 2009, as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns. The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq would be December 31, 2011. The agreement -- which stresses respect for Iraqi sovereignty -- ""requests the temporary assistance"" of U.S. forces, but severely restricts their role. It says that all military operations are to be carried out with the agreement of Iraq and must be ""fully coordinated"" with Iraqis. A Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee would oversee military operations. Iraq has the ""primary right to exercise jurisdiction"" over U.S. forces ""for grave premeditated felonies,"" the agreement says. Suspects would be held by U.S. forces but must be available to Iraqi authorities for investigation or trial. Iraq also would have the ""primary right to exercise jurisdiction"" over U.S. contractors and their employees. Also, it says, ""Iraqi land, sea and air shouldn't be used as a launching or transit point for attacks against other countries."" Parliament also passed another U.S.-Iraqi bilateral pact called the strategic framework agreement, along with the reform legislation. Lawmakers also OK'd a referendum on the progress of the security agreement to be held by the end of July. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan C. Crocker and Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. military official in Iraq, issued a statement welcoming the passage of the security pact and the strategic framework agreement -- which covers a wide range of bilateral cooperation efforts. The two congratulated the lawmakers and said they look forward to the security pact's ratification by the presidency council. ""Taken together, these two agreements formalize a strong and equal partnership between the United States and Iraq,"" their statement said. ""They provide the means to secure the significant security gains we have achieved together and to deter future aggression. ""They establish a framework for cooperation in the fields of defense, political relations, economics, trade, culture, education, the rule of law, health, the environment and science and technology."" Sunni Arabs were not against the historic security agreement, but they were concerned about Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki having too much power when the agreement goes into effect. They wanted legislation that would underscore their constitutional interests and rights. Although there apparently were enough votes to approve the security pact even without the compromise, al-Maliki's government, as well as Shiite and Kurdish leaders, wanted to work out the political reform deal with the Sunni Arabs so there could be national unity on the security pact. Asked why the political reform agreement was so important, Alaa Makki, a Sunni parliament member, said, ""It gave a message that there will be no dictatorship in Iraq in the coming period and the Iraqi people will say the final word."" The compromise virtually assures the security agreement's ratification by Iraq's presidency council, which consists of Kurdish President Jalal Talabani, Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi. Lawmakers loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and others had been staunch opponents of the security pact. But there was overwhelming support for the measure from other quarters. The Sadrists made loud protests against the agreement during the brief parliament session.

"(CNN) -- National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden spoke out against mass government surveillance in a televised address on Wednesday. ""Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying,"" Snowden said in Channel 4's annual Alternative Christmas Message to British viewers. It follows Queen Elizabeth II's traditional Christmas broadcast. Channel 4's alternative address tradition, begun in 1993, has included addresses from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, then the Iranian president; Ali G, a character played by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen; an injured Afghan war veteran; and a survivor of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In 2004, the cartoon character Marge from ""The Simpsons"" gave the greeting. Snowden, a former NSA contractor, is living in asylum in Russia after leaking U.S. surveillance secrets to the news media earlier this year. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges. In his brief message, Snowden asserted that the types of surveillance imagined in George Orwell's ""1984"" are ""nothing compared to what we have available today."" ""We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person,"" he said. ""A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all.""

"(CNN) -- Barcelona star Andres Iniesta unwrapped an early Christmas present Monday as he inked a new deal with the Spanish football club. The 29-year-old added an extension to his current deal that will see him stay with his boyhood club until the end of June 2018. ""Today is a magical day!"" Iniesta wrote on his Twitter page. ""My life and my club... Thank you for the love you have given me since I arrived at 12 years old."" Iniesta, regarded as one of the global game's most gifted and versatile players, was first spotted by Barcelona scouts in 1996. He soon left his home to train with the Barcelona youth academy and made his debut for the first team in 2002. Since then Iniesta has become one of Barcelona's stars as part of a side that has won six Spanish league titles, lifted Spain's Copa del Rey twice and won the European Champions League title three times. A key international player, he also scored the only goal in a tense 2010 World Cup final to give Spain a narrow victory over the Netherlands. The 29-year-old brought along his parents and daughter Valeria to help him celebrate the start of a new era with Barcelona as he signed the deal at the club's offices. Barcelona said in a statement on its website: ""Iniesta was due to end his contract in 2015. This extension until 2018 means the FC Barcelona midfielder will have spent more than half of his life on the club's books. ""From 2017/18, his contract will be automatically extended provided he has appeared in a certain number of matches over the course of the season just ended."" Switzerland future planning . The main protagonists in international football may be focused on next year's World Cup but Switzerland is already planning for life after Brazil. With coach Ottmar Hitzfeld bowing out after the World Cup, the world No. 8 team has named Lazio manager Vladimir Petkovic as his successor. The Swiss Football Association said in a statement that the 50-year-old would take over on 1 July 2014 but that if he guided Switzerland to the 2016 Euros his deal would continue until the end of the European championships. Petkovic, who describes himself as a Swiss Bosnian-Croat, began his career in the former state of Yugoslavia as an attacking midfielder before continuing his playing career in Switzerland, where he also turned to coaching. Many of Switzerland's squad also come from the country's Balkan migrant community. Petkovic, who has been in charge of Italian club Lazio since 2012, said of his new appointment: ""It has never been easy for anyone to follow Ottmar Hitzfeld. ""It will not be easy for me, but I am absolutely convinced of the potential of the players and the team. This quality will also help me. I firmly believe that we can succeed together.""","Andres Iniesta agrees a new deal with Spanish soccer club Barcelona until 2018 .

"(CNN) -- When Maria Sharapova underwent shoulder surgery five years ago, many thought her tennis career wouldn't last. But there is now a good chance the four-time grand slam winner will play into her 30s before fully turning her attention to her numerous business interests. ""I think she's going to play another four to five years and through the Rio Olympics (in 2016) if she stays healthy and hungry,"" her long-time agent and close friend Max Eisenbud told CNN's Open Court. Sharapova's motivation has never been an issue in the past, and the Russian -- who turned 26 last week -- is now fully fit. That, however, wasn't the case in 2008, when the shoulder injury ruled her out for nine months and cast doubt on Sharapova's professional career, which began on the day she turned 14. She had been experiencing discomfort in her right -- and serving -- shoulder, with initial tests leading doctors to believe inflammation was the cause. When the pain intensified after a win at a tournament in Montreal in July 2008, she underwent an MRI that revealed two small tears in the tendon of her shoulder. So began the long process of rehabilitation, surgery, another stint of rehab and dealing with another injury, a bone bruise. It was a difficult time for Sharapova. ""The shoulder, it's a huge part of the tennis game,"" she told Open Court. ""The serve is huge and my game is all about being aggressive and powerful strokes, so when you're out of the game nine months, when you don't have too many examples of athletes coming back after such an injury, of course you have doubters."" Sharapova never lost faith that she would recover, but she would have to wait another three years before reaching another grand slam final, losing at Wimbledon in 2011. Thankfully for Sharapova, no such serious injuries have reoccurred, although she was troubled by an ankle problem later that year. ""I had to work through a lot of things, and more mentally as well because I always thought that during those months that I was away, everyone was working and everyone was training and everyone was playing so it kind of felt like I was left behind a little bit,"" she said. Eisenbud's pronouncement about Sharapova's future comes as a boost to the women's tennis tour due to Sharapova's enormous star power and fan base, which increased when she won the French Open last June to cap her comeback and become just the 10th woman to capture all four majors. Forbes lists . Sharapova was last year named by Forbes as the world's 71st most powerful celebrity. She was the highest-ranked female athlete on the list, ahead of Serena Williams, despite the American now owning 11 more grand slam titles. Sharapova is, according to Forbes, the world's highest-paid female athlete, pulling in almost $28 million -- more than her career prize money -- over a 12-month period that ended last July. Sponsors including Samsung, Evian, Nike, Tiffany & Co., Head, Cole Haan and, most recently, Porsche help pad Sharapova's wallet. The Florida-based Russian has also launched Sugarpova, her own premium candy line, in the U.S. and plans on expanding to China, Japan, India and England. But Sharapova remains adamant that success on the court is her first priority. The rest will follow. ""Do I want my candy to sell? Do I want my partnership to continue for many years? Of course I do,"" Sharapova said. ""That's a no-brainer. But at the end of the day all the things that have come to me, that I've been able to be a part of, is because I'm a tennis player, not because I'm a model or because of acting. The core of what I have is my tennis."" Her results in 2013 confirm Sharapova's drive. Known as one of tennis' toughest competitors and hardest workers, she has showed no signs of slowing down. The power baseliner has reached at least the semifinals in all four of her tournaments and almost completed a rare double at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells and Miami's Sony Open. She won the title in California in March but was defeated by Williams in the finale in Florida two weeks later. Her poor record against Williams might add to her hunger. Williams beat Sharapova for the 11th straight time, although Sharapova won a set off the world No. 1 for the first time in five years. Missing gold . Sharapova lacks an Olympic gold medal, too, having been crushed by Williams in the gold medal match at London 2012 and missing 2008 in Beijing with the shoulder injury. ""I always feel like I can be better and when I do step on the court, I feel a certain power with what I'm doing,"" Sharapova said. ""I feel strong and I feel like I'm good at what I do. ""I want to keep working, and I want to keep getting better because you can't stand still. Everyone's working. I'm sure everyone's getting stronger and getting faster and hitting the ball harder. You have to do it as well."" Sharapova begins her clay-court swing as defending champion in Stuttgart this week before competing at the Madrid Open and Italian Open in Rome ahead of her title defense at Roland Garros, which starts May 26. Her titles in Stuttgart and Rome in 2012 served as the springboard to her success in Paris, where Sharapova downed Italian Sara Errani in the final. Having come back from the abyss that her career-threatening injury presented, Sharapova savored the success -- especially after being written off by many critics while she was rebuilding her career, suffering some morale-sapping defeats. ""Losing is never easy, especially when you've achieved so much great success and having lifted beautiful trophies,"" she said. ""And especially when you hear it from people that, you know, they sit there and comment on what you're doing and they don't comment on the work that you put in before something like that, before getting to the stage of a match in front of thousands of people. ""But it makes you so much stronger, and I've looked back and, you know, the people I felt had that connection with me, I've certainly spoken with them about it and especially had a few words with them after the French Open. ""But it's sport. It's normal. I think the world revolves around comments and opinions, and I have absolutely nothing against it.""","Having overcome a shoulder injury, Maria Sharapova plans on playing for 4-5 more years .

"(CNN) -- Piers Morgan likes to talk the talk but how did the CNN anchor fare when he had to walk the walk and face a cricket ball coming towards him at 150 kilometers an hour? Morgan, who likes to tweet from the lip, has been one of England's most outspoken critics over the past few weeks following the team's embarrassing capitulation against Australia in the fiercely contested Ashes series. And from the cosy surroundings of his U.S. home, Morgan took to Twitter to criticize England's wretched batting in the first three Ashes Tests -- matches in which Australia cruised to victory. But on Friday in Melbourne, where England are playing Australia in the fourth Test, Morgan got a taste of what the touring batsmen have had to contend with over the last few weeks, though none of them were dumped onto their backside -- unlike the CNN anchor. Facing former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee, a man who took 310 wickets in 76 Tests, Morgan was pummeled during a six-ball blast. With Lee not holding back, Morgan gave the appearance of a rabbit caught in the headlights as he backed away from nearly every delivery. Watch Morgan's ordeal on YouTube . On four occasions the Englishman was hit on the body, while he was also clean bowled by Lee much to the amusement of the watching crowd of 2,000, which included Australian cricketers Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle. ""He got hurt but he didn't get maimed, so that's a positive step,"" Lee told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""You have to give full credit to the guy -- he's going to be really sore tomorrow. ""But he kept on going, so you have to take your hat off to the guy. ""The biggest smile around the ground was from Mitchell Johnson I think. I looked over at Mitch and he gave me a wink, he was quite chuffed."" If the 48-year-old Morgan was bloodied, he remained unbowed after his bruising experience. ""It's made me reassess what you need out here on an Ashes tour and that is courage, fortitude and a Churchillian spirit of never giving in despite overwhelming odds,"" he said. CNN digital writer Chris Murphy plays amateur cricket with Morgan, so what was his analysis of his teammate's performance? ""Having played cricket with Piers on numerous occasions, it's well known he has two shots: a forward defense and a heave to the leg side,"" said Murphy. ""Sadly, he wasn't able to exhibit either. ""Charging down the wicket at someone bowling nearly 150 kph isn't brave, it's just plain stupid. But Piers deserves full marks for the guts he showed in the face of a relentless barrage from Brett Lee. ""The sight of any batsman backing away from his stumps is a sign he's troubled by the pace of the bowler, but in this case it was probably a wise idea to prevent his chin being shattered. ""A still head, straight bat and balance are the fundamentals of batting -- sadly for Piers, none of those elements were on show in Melbourne. Thankfully though, he is still alive to tell the tale."" The England players who were the subject of Morgan's Twitter angst did at least return to form Friday to take control of the fourth Test at the MCG. Their nemesis Johnson took five wickets to leave England 255 all out, but the visitors hit back to have the home side reeling on 167 for nine at stumps and facing the prospect of defeat after three earlier easy victories. In South Africa, fast bowler Dale Steyn put on a display that Lee at his best would be proud of, taking six wickets for 100 runs as India were all out for 334 in their first innings in Durban. Retiring legend Jacques Kallis became only the second man in Test history to take 200 catches during the course of the second day.","CNN anchor Piers Morgan went head to head with Australian bowler Brett Lee .

"(CNN) -- Seen the ball drop in New York's Times Square? Caught the fireworks over Sydney Harbour? There are plenty of other ways to ring in the New Year. Byron Bay, Australia . Among the first places in Australia to see the sun rise, Byron Bay in New South Wales hosts one of the country's largest parties on New Year's Eve. This year, for the first time, the three-day Falls Music & Arts Festival will take over the town from December 31 to January 3, which means tunes from MGMT, Grizzly Bear, The Roots and Vampire Weekend. Away from the North Byron Parklands, festivities will feature family friendly activities from 9 p.m., plus an early morning event on Main Beach on the first day of the New Year. If you don't have a ticket to Falls, aren't a local or don't have a hotel booked, you won't get in. The mayor is planning to ""lock"" everyone else out in order to ""curb alcohol-fueled violence and destruction of property in the town."" Good times apparently await those who have prepared in advance. The Falls Music & Arts Festival . Goa, India . Balmy weather, beaches, al fresco bars and restaurants -- India's smallest state is one of its biggest party centers. Goan celebrations kick off on December 27 with the three-day Sunburn music festival -- headliners include Pete Tong, Markus Schultz and Afrojak, among other DJs. Parties on New Year's Eve range from masquerade balls to beach raves. If you don't mind crowds, Anjuna Beach has dance performances, Goan folk music and plenty of feni (a local liquor), while the sunset party at Querim Beach's nightclub Kitty Su takes things outdoors with some of the country's top music acts on the sand. At the Hill Top event, near Vagator Beach, a globetrotting roster of trance musicians will entertain revelers well into New Year's Day. Sunburn Goa . Hill Top Festival Goa . Prague, Czech Republic . Prague locals love their fireworks, so much so that many contribute their own to the New Year's Eve festivities around town. The official show explodes over the Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square at midnight; the best vantage points are from the Charles Bridge, PetÅÃ­n Hill and near Prague Castle. Vltava River cruises are free from crowds and provide Czech beer and live jazz. January 1 is particularly poignant to Prague locals as it marks the day the Czech Republic was created after the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1993. A special fireworks display will be held at LetnÃ¡ Park on the day, kicking off at 6 p.m. to ensure that families with young children can attend. Harbin, China . New Year's Eve festivities don't get much cooler than those held in the northern Chinese city of Harbin. Not far from the Russian border, the city gets temperatures well below freezing in winter, perfect for the annual Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival. Celebrating 30 years, the festival sees larger-than-life ice sculptures crafted around town, lit either by lasers or with traditional lanterns. Visitors can walk on icy replicas of the Great Wall, check out St. Basil's Cathedral or stare at a replica Eiffel Tower before fireworks light up the night sky. Another icy tradition takes place when swimmers jump into the city's Songhua River. Harbin Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival . Niagara Falls, Canada . Billed as Canada's largest free New Year's Eve extravaganza, the December 31 concert at Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls is expected to draw more than 40,000 people. Kicking off at 7.30 p.m. and held against the epic backdrop of Niagara Falls, which straddles the American and Canadian border, this year's event features music from the Sam Roberts Band and Serena Ryder, with Demi Lovato headlining. The party includes food stalls, entertainers and two fireworks displays, at 8.45 p.m. and midnight. You can continue the noise on the first day of 2014 with a Journey Behind the Falls tour, allowing you to stand in the mist where the mighty Horseshoe Falls tumbles from a height of 13 stories, traveling at 65 kilometers per hour. Niagara Falls Festival . Reykjavik, Iceland . December 31 sees crowds converge on 10 bonfires lit around Iceland's capital before revelers make their way to Hallgrimskirkja church, a dramatic 73-meter-high building designed to resemble the country's lava flows. Perlan (The Pearl), a hemispherical building atop ÃskjuhlÃ­Ã° hill with a winter garden and dining areas, provides a more panoramic view of town. Fireworks are sold throughout the city, which means that explosions can be heard from the moment the sky darkens. The intensity builds toward midnight, when a spectacular choreographed display lights the city. The festival of lights can often continue on New Year's Day when tourists head off in search of the aurora borealis. Cruise ship, Various . If you can't decide on one destination, a cruise offers a roster of ports. All cruise lines ring in the New Year with pomp and ceremony, but a few go the extra mile. Crystal Cruises hosts a balloon drop in the atrium of its two ships, followed by a ship-wide countdown at midnight, with champagne. On New Year's Day, celebrations continue with a boozy brunch. On December 31, Crystal Symphony will be docked in Sydney Harbour, under the bridge, so you're guaranteed a dazzling introduction to 2014. Norwegian Cruise Line ships will have fireworks and a captain's countdown from the bridge. ""The Pride of America"" is scheduled to arrive next to Hawaii's volcanoes on the first day of 2014. Weather permitting, the Oceania Cruises' fleet will hold New Year's Eve soirees on their decks, as well as parties throughout the ships.

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- Walking down a street in Cambodia's capital city, Phymean Noun finished her lunch and tossed her chicken bones into the trash. Seconds later, she watched in horror as several children fought to reclaim her discarded food. Phymean Noun is helping give Cambodian children a chance at a better life. Noun stopped to talk with them. After hearing their stories of hardship, she knew she couldn't ignore their plight. ""I must do something to help these children get an education,"" she recalls thinking. ""Even though they don't have money and live on the sidewalk, they deserve to go to school."" Six years after that incident, Noun is helping many of Phnom Penh's poorest children do just that. Within weeks, she quit her job and started an organization to give underprivileged children an education. Noun spent $30,000 of her own money to get her first school off the ground. In 2004, her organization -- the People Improvement Organization (PIO) -- opened a school at Phnom Penh's largest municipal trash dump, where children are a large source of labor. Today, Noun provides 240 kids from the trash dump a free education, food, health services and an opportunity to be a child in a safe environment.  Watch Noun and some of the children who attend her school Â» . It is no easy task. Hundreds of them risk their lives every day working to support themselves and their families. ""I have seen a lot of kids killed by the garbage trucks,"" she recalls. Children as young as 7 scavenge hours at a time for recyclable materials. They make cents a day selling cans, metals and plastic bags. Noun recruits the children at the dump to attend her organization because, she says, ""I don't want them to continue picking trash and living in the dump. I want them to have an opportunity to learn.""  Watch Noun describe what life is like for children at the trash dump Â» . Growing up during the Pol Pot regime, Noun faced unimaginable challenges. ""There were no schools during Pol Pot's regime,"" she recalls. ""Everyone had to work in the fields. My mother was very smart. She told them that she didn't have an education. That was how she survived. If they knew she was educated, they would have killed her."" Noun's mother died of cancer when Phymean was 15. Phymean's sister fled to a refugee camp, leaving her young daughter in Phymean's care. ""When my mom passed away, my life was horrible, "" says Noun. ""It was very sad because there was only my niece who was 3 years old at that time."" Yet Noun was determined to finish high school.  Watch Noun describe the hardships of life during the Pol Pot regime Â» . That dedication paid off, and after graduating she spent the next decade working with various aid organizations. ""I tell the children my story and about the importance of education,"" she said. ""I'm their role model."" Some of the children who attend her school continue to work in the dump to support themselves and their families. Without an education, she said, these children would be vulnerable to traffickers or continue to be caught in the cycle of poverty. ""We are trying to provide them skills that they can use in the future,"" Noun said. ""Even though we are poor and struggling and don't have money, we can go to school. I tell them not to give up hope."" Noun has even bigger plans for them. ""These children are our next generation and our country depends on them. They are our future leaders.""","Children are large source of labor at Cambodian capital's largest trash dump .

"(CNN) -- Heavy rains doused most of a wildfire that had damaged more than 35 buildings near the Tennessee resort town of Pigeon Forge, allowing authorities Monday to take firefighters off the line. Only five acres were still burning Monday evening, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director James Bassham told CNN affiliate WATE. A small crew remained in the area to monitor hot spots, the station said. Earlier, authorities had evacuated more homes as high winds fanned the wildfire and caused problems for helicopters sent in to help fight the flames. Authorities were evacuating more residents as the fire threatened 15 to 20 homes in the Priscilla Heights area of Sevier County, Tennessee, Dean Flener of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said. About 150 people were evacuated Sunday and the American Red Cross opened a shelter at the Pigeon Forge Community Center. Hotels are also allowing residents to stay for free, Flener said. About 20 fire departments had been fighting the fire, which had burned 260 acres, authorities said. ""Propane tanks have been exploding,"" Pigeon Forge Fire Chief Tony Watson said Sunday. ""It's been real dangerous."" The blaze started as a house fire, he said. ""It looks like somebody just went through there and just dropped a bomb on the place,"" Shannon McCostlin told WATE. ""I feel bad for them people."" The area is home to rental cabins with some permanent residences. Pigeon Forge, in eastern Tennessee, is best known for singer Dolly Parton's theme park, Dollywood, which was not affected by the fire. Positioned on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains, the area also is popular with outdoors enthusiasts and has a wide variety of other attractions, including music theaters, outlet malls, go-kart tracks and miniature golf courses. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: Rain helps put out most of wildfire near resort town in eastern Tennessee .

"(CNN) -- For more than three decades, Concorde represented the pinnacle of business travel -- the ultimate status symbol for the jetset executive. Considered a marvel of aviation technology, the distinctive droop-nosed aircraft traveled at twice the speed of sound, flying from London to New York in about three and a half hours -- half the time of commercial airliners. But even before an Air France Concorde crashed in 2000, killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board, the luster was beginning to wane. Battling high operating costs and low passenger numbers, Air France and British Airways grounded their small, aging fleet a mere three years later. But the dream of supersonic flight has not disappeared. Aviation manufacturers such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Aerion are working on supersonic technology -- with the latter predicting it could have a supersonic business jet in service as early as 2020. Industry expert Joe Lissenden, the director of aerospace and defense consulting in the Americas for IHS Jane's, says it's likely that a next-generation supersonic commercial aircraft will emerge. High demand from passengers, historic profitability on the routes and significant technological improvements have combined to make supersonic flight all the more viable, he said. Read also: The air fare too good to be true . For Lissenden, the one challenge that remains is fuel cost. ""Faster flights consume fuel faster which makes the flight more expensive,"" he said. ""But this is a premium route, and premium prices will be charged."" Crucial to the efforts to restore supersonic aircraft to the skies is the work of national aerospace programs such as NASA and Japan's JAXA. Peter Coen is the supersonics research project manager for NASA's fundamental aeronautics program. While the agency is not working on a specific supersonic aircraft, he said, ""we are working on technologies we feel represent barriers to bringing back successful supersonic aircraft."" Those barriers include high atmosphere emissions, noise produced when taking off and landing, and the sonic boom -- the sound associated with the shockwaves created when objects travel faster than the speed of sound, which has prevented supersonic aircraft from flying overland routes. See also: Air Force's hypersonic test fails . Coen said his division was concentrated on addressing the sonic boom issue first, because ""if you don't have overland supersonic flight, there's never going to be a market for the supersonic aircraft."" NASA has been collaborating with Boeing and Lockheed Martin on systems-level design studies, with each manufacturer producing models that have been subjected to wind tunnel testing to gauge their effectiveness. Coen said phase one testing had successfully validated the basic design techniques. Reshaping the aircraft, the designs -- Boeing's two-jet configuration with engines mounted above the wing, and Lockheed Martin's tri-jet configuration, with two engines below the wing and a third mounted in the tail -- had been proven to significantly reduce the sonic boom to a ""thump,"" dropping the noise from Concorde levels to close to what is considered the level of acceptability. Coen said he expected to see a next-generation ""son of Concorde"" in the marketplace by around 2030, while a supersonic business jet ""could happen sooner."" ""The boom is the barrier and if we can get past that, I think we'll see people giving supersonic flight a lot more serious consideration,"" he said. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) also hopes to develop a supersonic passenger aircraft that is quiet, economical and environmentally friendly, and expects to achieved it some time this century. Spokesman Masahisa Honda said that while the agency currently had no aircraft in specific development, along current projections it predicted a supersonic business jet to enter the market some time after 2015. Read also: 'Hidden' airline charges -- dirty tricks or customer choice? One of the frontrunners to do so is the Aerion SBJ, an 8-12 passenger business jet. ""It will herald a return to supersonic civil flight without Concorde's environmental and economic drawbacks,"" said Aerion spokesman Adam Konowe. He said development of a joint venture with aircraft manufacturers to produce the SBJ had been slowed by the recession, but once a deal was struck he anticipated a six-year development program to bring the aircraft to market. ""We believe the SBJ will be certified, and enter service around the end of the decade -- 2020,"" he said. But not everyone is convinced that a return to supersonic passenger flight is just around the corner. Chris Seymour, head of market analysis with aviation experts Ascend, was skeptical that there would be much progress before at least 2030. ""I think there's so many issues to be considered that I certainly can't see it happening in the next 20 years,"" he said. Seymour believes that although technological barriers will likely be overcome, the key factor in whether it will become a reality is whether a market exists that is prepared to pay a premium for the ultimate status symbol in business travel -- particularly in an air-travel market that is focused on low prices. ""Will you have enough passengers willing to pay higher fares to fly more quickly?"" He said. ""If you look at Concorde, that wasn't the case. It came along at a time when the 747 also came in, which carried more people for lower fares. That's where the market was."" Peter Warth, director of Complete Aviation Solutions, also believes that a return to supersonic flight is further off than some are making out. ""There seems to be multiple technological and commercial obstacles that will need to be cleared,"" he said. But he conceded: ""I'm sure that when the original plans for Concorde, the A380 and the 787 Dreamliner were announced, the same questions about whether it could be achieved were asked. But they eventually delivered. I think time will tell.""","The quest continues for a next-generation supersonic aircraft .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- A large group of youths from an ethnic militia loyal to former South Sudanese Vice President Riek Machar is marching for the city of Bor, just days after it was retaken by the government amid heavy fighting, officials said. Col. Phillip Aguer, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army, estimated 20,000 ethnic Nuer from the so-called White Army were headed for the city, raising fears of more violence. The U.N. Mission in South Sudan said Sunday it is ""extremely concerned"" about the report, but it could not confirm the size or location of the marchers. ""South Sudan does not need another escalation of the crisis involving armed youth, pitching communities against communities,"" said Hilde F. Johnson, the U.N. special representative of the secretary-general. The U.N. mission warned that the involvement of armed youths ""would add a volatile and unpredictable ingredient into the precarious security situation currently prevailing in the country."" The youths -- known for the white powder they use to cover their skin as an insect repellant -- do not have formal military training and, if not under direct orders, can act without discipline. Information Minister Michael Makuei said Saturday that rebel leader Machar had gone to ethnic Nuer neighborhoods in Uror to mobilize the youths. Multiple media outlets reported Machar denied the youths are acting under his orders. CNN has not been able to contact Machar's representatives. The same group is believed responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians from the Murle ethnic group in 2011 and 2012. Machar is a longtime rival of President Salva Kiir. The men are from two different tribal clans. Kiir is from the Dinka tribe, Machar from the Neur. Kiir accused Machar of trying to stage a coup. Its' a claim Machar has denied. Fighting broke out between Kiir's government and supporters of Machar on December 15 in the capital city of Juba. It quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings lent credence by mass graves. Kiir's soldiers regained control of Bor last week in a bloody battle for the city. A growing chorus of international agencies is calling for an end to the hostilities. East African leaders on Friday gave the warring factions four days to lay down their arms. If they don't, the leaders of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development warned they'll ""take action"" to stop the conflict that the United Nations says has killed more than 1,000 and forced some 121,000 from their homes. The warning came the same day the United Nations said the first of 5,500 additional peacekeepers had arrived in the country. The humanitarian crisis here is worsening, with at least 122,000 displaced since the fighting began. Roughly 63,000 have sought refuge in U.N. bases in the country, according to the world body. Those on the U.N. base in Juba are scared to venture outside, even though many have homes within walking distance. James Gajaak, the de facto community leader at the Juba U.N. camp, told CNN's Arwa Damon that when he first arrived with his family, he went three days without food and water. ""So my brother went back to the house to collect water,"" he said, recalling how later he received a phone call. ""They tell me, 'Your brother is dead; come collect the dead body so that you can bury him.' "" Doctors from the relief group Doctors Without Borders are concerned over the increasing volume of people within the confined space of the camps. Christine Bimansha is one of many doctors providing medical care at two UNMISS sites for Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres). She said in an MSF field report Sunday that she is concerned about sanitation conditions and the potential spread of disease. ""Water and sanitation is the biggest problem the displaced people are facing -- they don't have access to water or to enough latrines. If the water and sanitation conditions at the UNMISS camp remain the same, the situation will get worse -- if people don't have water and we have an explosion of diseases like cholera, then that will be a big outbreak and a big problem. Measles is also a significant threat and an outbreak would be difficult to stop in such overcrowded conditions."" South Sudan's neighbors threaten to step in to end fighting .

"(Health.com) -- Recent headlines about contaminated foods, from peanut butter and salad to turkey and eggs, are enough to make even the most intrepid eater a little bit paranoid. But before you commit to a life of vitamins and astronaut ice cream, take comfort in the fact that you'll likely be OK eating as you always have: ""We have a very safe food system,"" says Shelley Feist, executive director of the Partnership for Food Safety Education. There are only three foods so risky that you should avoid them altogether. Here's the red-light list: . Raw milk . Fans of raw milk (meaning milk that hasn't been pasteurized or homogenized) credit it with having more beneficial bacteria and enzymes than its processed counterpart, but science hasn't proven any of these claims. And raw milk can become contaminated in a number of ways: by coming into contact with cow feces or bacteria living on the skin of cows, from an infection of the cow's udder, or from dirty equipment, among others. The special heating process we know as pasteurization is the only effective way of killing most, if not all, harmful bacteria -- which can include listeria, salmonella, and E. coli. Health.com: 10 types of food that can make you sick . According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there were 86 reported food poisoning outbreaks from raw milk between 1998 and 2008, resulting in 1,676 illnesses, 191 hospitalizations, and two deaths. Raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other foodborne disease outbreak, says Hannah Gould, Ph.D., senior epidemiologist with the CDC's Enteric Diseases Epidemiology Branch. It's no wonder selling raw milk to consumers is illegal in about half of U.S. states. ""We have two people, in California and Pennsylvania, who developed Guillain-BarrÃÂ© syndrome [which can cause paralysis and respiratory failure] after contracting a bacterial infection called campylobacteriosis from drinking raw milk,"" says John Sheehan, head of dairy safety at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ""These were healthy, active people who came down with debilitating, lifelong diseases."" Health.com: How to practice food safety in your home kitchen . Raw sprouts . When sprouts were identified as the culprit in the food poisoning outbreak that killed at least 50 people in Europe this past summer, you probably wondered: What could be so bad about innocent, vegan-friendly sprouts? But food-safety experts weren't surprised. According to the CDC, there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in the U.S. from raw or lightly cooked sprouts since 1996. All types of sprouts -- from the alfalfas you get on a sandwich to the mung bean sprouts garnishing your Thai food -- can be dangerous when not thoroughly cooked. This is largely because of how they're grown, explains Michelle Smith, Ph.D., senior policy analyst at the FDA: The warm, moist environment necessary for growing sprouts provides the perfect conditions for bacteria (such as salmonella or E. coli) to multiply. Health.com: How can you tell if food poisoning is harmless, or life-threatening? Ask for restaurant and take-out meals to be sprout-free, since you can't know how well they've been cooked. And if you just can't live without sprouts, try getting used to giving them a hot bath before you eat them: Research has shown that you can kill salmonella by immersing contaminated sprouts in boiling water for five seconds. Raw oysters from the Gulf of Mexico . Everyone knows that eating raw shellfish can be dicey (and in fact the CDC advises against it entirely), but bivalves from the Gulf of Mexico take it to a whole new level. Waters in the Gulf are warmer than those in the Pacific Northwest and other popular oystering spots, making it possible for a bacterium called Vibrio vulnificus to thrive. ""Oysters are filter feeders, which means they concentrate any contaminants in the water,"" explains William E. Keene, Ph.D., a senior epidemiologist at the Oregon Public Health Division. ""A number of toxins can get into an oyster, but none are remotely as bad as Vibrio vulnificus."" Health.com: 10 states where rare and exotic diseases lurk . Healthy people who ingest a V. vulnificus--ridden oyster might have vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but for anyone with a compromised immune system, the bug can infiltrate the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness called septicemia, which is fatal in one-third of cases. And while having a pre-existing medical condition puts you at particular risk, ""anyone at all can get horrifically sick,"" Keene says. The good news is that several big seafood purchasers, like Legal Sea Foods and Costco, require that Gulf oysters be pasteurized before being served, as does the state of California -- so in these places the risk is far lower. Pasteurized or not, ""the simplest tactic here is to avoid raw Gulf oysters altogether,"" says Sarah Klein, staff attorney at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. That can go a long way toward keeping you safer. Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Pasteurization is the only effective way of killing harmful bacteria in milk .

"(CNN) -- The latest in a series of beleaguered Carnival cruises made its way back to port early Sunday, capping a harrowing week for passengers aboard several troubled ships. The Carnival Legend arrived in Tampa, Florida, hours ahead of schedule Sunday morning after propulsion system problems hampered its sailing speed. The company had to cancel a scheduled stop on Grand Cayman because of the technical difficulty. But Carnival Cruise Lines said the Legend is still scheduled to head out for its next voyage on time Sunday afternoon while technicians continue working on the repairs. ""The ship is expected to operate its normal itinerary with the exception of one port -- Grand Cayman -- which is being replaced by Costa Maya,"" Carnival said in a statement. ""Any guests wishing not to proceed based on the change to one port of call have been given the option of canceling and receiving a full refund."" The company stressed that all safety systems, steering and hotel services were functioning normally. But dismayed vacationers from the Legend's previous voyage vented their frustration. ""Passengers are now really pissed off,"" passenger Rob Bonenfant said via e-mail before the ship's arrival. ""Mood on the ship is getting worse among passengers, captain is giving limited information."" Senator proposes cruise 'bill of rights' The Legend's malfunction is the latest in a growing list of woes for the travel company. In the past month, three other Carnival cruise ships have reported problems. One U.S. lawmaker said Sunday that the recent cruise incidents prompted him to propose a ""Cruise Ship Passenger Bill of Rights."" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said he was asking the cruise industry to voluntarily sign on to a list of guidelines, including the right to backup power if generators fail and the right to disembark a docked ship ""if basic provisions cannot adequately be provided on board."" He also called on the International Maritime Organization to investigate whether cruise lines are following existing guidelines, and whether existing standards are being enforced by countries where cruise ships that serve U.S. passengers are based. ""Cruise ships, in large part operating outside the bounds of United States enforcement, have become the wild west of the travel industry, and it's time to rein them in before anyone else gets hurt,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""This bill of rights, based on work we've done with the airline industry, will ensure that passengers aren't forced to live in third world conditions or put their lives at risk when they go on vacation."" Carnival Dream: Stuck in the Caribbean . The Carnival Dream lost power and some toilets stopped working temporarily last week, and for a while no one was allowed to get off the vessel docked at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean. Gregg Stark, who was traveling with his wife and two young children on the Dream, said conditions on the ship were deplorable. ""There's human waste all over the floor in some of the bathrooms and they're overflowing -- and in the state rooms,"" he said last week. ""The elevators have not been working."" Another passenger, Jonathan Evans, said passengers were kept on the ship ""despite the fact that we have no way to use the restrooms on board."" But Carnival told CNN that based on conversations with the ship's management, a look at service logs ""and extensive physical monitoring of all public areas, including restrooms, throughout the night, we can confirm that only one public restroom was taken offline for cleaning based on toilet overflow and there was a total of one request for cleaning of a guest cabin bathroom."" Carnival said the ship's emergency diesel generator failed, but the cruise line disputed notions of a widespread system failure. ""The ship's power plant, propulsion and hotel systems are fully operational. Aside from some periodic interruptions to restroom and elevator service for a few hours Tuesday night, at no time have any of the ship's systems and services not been functional,"" Carnival said in its statement. The company said it was flying the more than 4,000 passengers and will give them discounts. By late Saturday, most of the passengers had left St. Maarten by air. Once all passengers leave the ship, the Dream's crew will sail back to Port Canaveral on Sunday, the company said. The ship's next voyage has been canceled. Passenger David Howard said he thought conditions were fine aboard the Dream, but said he was frustrated with how his family and other passengers were treated and by the ""lack of communication."" Howard said he and his family weren't told until 1:45 a.m. Friday they had to get off the ship by 7:30 a.m., so they had to rush to pack in the middle of the night. A message from the captain . Dream passengers received a letter from the captain, according to a passenger who e-mailed a photo of the correspondence to CNN. Capt. Massimo Marino told passengers they would be booked on flights to Orlando or another destination. Passengers with cars at Port Canaveral would be bused from Orlando to the facility about an hour away. ""We sincerely apologize for the disappointment this unexpected change has caused and regret we were unable to provide you with the fun and memorable cruise vacation we had in store for you,"" he wrote. The letter also offers passengers a three-day refund and a half-price cruise in the future. Crisis communication expert Tom Donahue said Carnival may be making the right operational decisions. But the frequency and effectiveness of communications to passengers -- who have no other information source -- are what influences the passengers' perspective. Carnival Elation . Like the Carnival Legend, the Carnival Elation suffered problems with its Azipod, a crucial part for steering and propelling a vessel. A tug boat trailing the ship as it travels on the Mississippi River is ""purely a precautionary measure,"" the company said. Memories of the defeated Triumph . In the most publicized case, an engine room fire last month left the Carnival Triumph crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard. That scheduled four-day cruise stretched into eight days as tugs pulled the vessel into port in Alabama. Food was scarce, passengers sweltered in the heat with no air conditioning, toilets overflowed, and human waste ran down the walls in some parts of the ship, passengers reported. A class-action lawsuit against Carnival Corp. followed. The Triumph is still being repaired at a shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, Carnival spokeswoman Joyce Oliva said. Last week, Carnival announced it was conducting ""a comprehensive review"" of all 23 of its ships after the fire that crippled Triumph. Carnival President and CEO Gerry Cahill said the investigation will focus on the prevention, detection and suppression of fires, engine room redundancies and what additional hotel facilities might be provided and might run off the emergency generators. ""We are now focused on the lessons we can learn from the incident and also what additional operational redundancies might be available,"" Cahill said last week. Another ship, the Carnival Splendor, had a fire in 2010 due to ""a catastrophic failure of a diesel generator,"" he said. Not doomed . Despite all the recent problems, Donahue doesn't see any long-term negative effects for Carnival or its competitors. ""I don't necessarily see (last) week's events, or even combined with the Triumph event, as casting a pall on the cruise industry,"" he said, noting that several colleagues and friends who have recently gone on cruises, including on Carnival, enjoyed their vacations. ""People generally accept that complex pieces of equipment can encounter challenges. That's not the hurdle. I don't think anybody considering the cruise would be unforgiving of an unforeseen event, because those types of events occur with complex systems. People are far less forgiving (when) communications around the events seem to be lacking."" CNN's Mark Morgenstein, Dave Alsup, Chuck Johnston, Tina Burnside, Marlena Baldacci and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen. Charles Schumer proposes a cruise ship passenger ""bill of rights""

"(CNN) -- It was the 2013 Politifact ""Lie of the Year,"" our president's now infamous line: ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" Now all Americans are realizing what Catholics have known from the beginning: President Barack Obama is a master of deception. Lest people forget, passage of the Affordable Care Act happened in part because Obama struck a deal with a single Catholic holdout: Bart Stupak, D-Michigan. Stupak agreed to vote for the bill in exchange for an executive order protecting conscience rights and preserving the Hyde Amendment's ban on the use of federal funds for abortion. Stupak had insisted on an amendment. Instead, he took the President's word. The President turned around and stuck in the knife: He used the ACA to mandate that all employers, regardless of religious objection, pay for and provide what many of us in the anti-abortion movement consider abortion drugs in their health care plans. Now, those mandates go into effect for most religiously affiliated charities in just a few days, on January 1. Supreme Court to take up Obamacare contraception case . This came after the President assured Catholics in his commencement address at Notre Dame that he would ""honor the conscience of those that disagree with abortion and draft a sensible conscience clause"" and after assuring Congress that ""under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience protections will remain in place."" In speaking to America's pre-eminent Catholic university, it was as if the President was speaking to American Catholics everywhere. Yet it's now clear that the promised separate accounts for abortion coverage funded by separate abortion premiums billed directly to the insured were not what they appeared to be, and the President is facing one of the largest religious liberty lawsuits in American history. The lawsuit now boasts more than 200 plaintiffs, one recent addition of note being the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns that cares for the impoverished and dying elderly. Cases from the for-profit sector have already reached the Supreme Court, and in just a few days, the mandate goes into effect for religious charities. In the words of Stupak, ""I am perplexed and disappointed that, having negotiated the executive order with the President, not only does that HHS mandate violate the executive order, but it also violates statutory law. I think it is illegal."" Splice and dice it how you like. Some say Obamacare mandates and subsidizes abortion coverage with taxpayer dollars. Under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, abortion drugs such as RU-486, or Mifeprex, are not covered or mandated. However, drugs known as ""morning after"" or ""week after"" pills that delay ovulation Ã¢â¬â such as Plan B and ""ella""Ã¢â¬â are covered under Obamacare. Some of these forms of contraception -- in particular ""ella"" or ulipristal acetate -- carry FDA labels that include a warning that they can destroy embryos by rendering the endometrium inhospitable. It is these drugs that are in debate in the Hobby Lobby case and others before the Supreme Court, as objectors consider the destruction of an embryo to be an abortion. Some American Catholics feel that the President deceived the most high-ranking Catholic in America, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, then the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In a now infamous meeting at the White House, the President promised Dolan that he would respect the conscience rights of Catholics and their institutions and would not force them to cover things such as abortifacients -- a drug or substance that can induce an abortion -- and that the administration would change its policy with regard to religious institutions. Dolan has made it clear that he felt misled. What many American Catholics don't know is that the President told the same untruth to the previous Pope himself. According to a Vatican insider, the President assured Pope Benedict XVI in 2009 that constitutional religious liberty protections for American Catholics would remain strong in his first breath when visiting the Vatican. Since then, Dolan has become the face of Catholic opposition to the mandate. Under his bold shepherding, the entire conference of Catholic bishops has held firm in defending the conscience rights of religious employers. He has led the Catholic Church in America through one of the most appalling and puzzling periods of deception and legal harassment since the First Amendment became the law of the land. As Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville steps into his shoes, he has the daunting task of trying to negotiate religious liberty with a leader who excels in equivocation right as the mandate finally takes effect for scores of Catholic and other religious charities facing enormous fines for refusing to comply. So this New Year's Day, as Americans put away the glitter and the tinsel, perhaps people will finally realize what some Catholics have been saying all along: Our President threw quite a party, but it's over. And now the truth sets in. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ashley McGuire.","Ashley McGuire: Catholics knew Obama was deceptive; now rest of America knows .

"(CNN) -- No image is more central to the story of Christmas than that of baby Jesus in the arms of his mother, Mary. It was painted and sculpted over and over again, by such artists as Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael. It's a picture of tender mercy and boundless love between a mother and her son. But these first gentle moments (even experienced in the humble environs of a manger) are perhaps the easiest of any parent-child relationship. The story that would develop for Jesus and his mother, as presented in the gospels, was complicated, and not very unlike what happens in many families: a tale of enchantment, then disenchantment, of resistance and reconciliation. The first scene in the Gospels after the Nativity occurs when Jesus is 12, on the cusp of adolescence. The boy accompanies his family to Jerusalem for Passover week. After the celebrations, his family leaves -- failing to notice that Jesus has been left behind. Searching for three frantic days, at last they find him in Herod's great Temple, among a group of elders, who are amazed by his knowledge of the scriptures. When Mary questions him about his behavior, Jesus replies somewhat testily: ""Why did you come looking for me? Didn't you know I must be about my Father's business?"" Okay. He was smart, perhaps a bit sassy. As the only glimpse we get of Jesus before the age of 30, it's a telling instance, however. Flash forward 20 years or so, when Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee. His family, however, doesn't seem happy. He is, for a start, attracting large crowds. He goes about healing people, casting out demons. In Mark 3:21, it's clear the family wishes he would cease and desist. ""He is out of his mind,"" they cry. Soon after this, Jesus says dismissively: ""Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."" (Mark 3:34-35) At the marriage in Cana, where Jesus performs the first of his many ""signs and wonders,"" Mary accompanies him, complaining to her son that the hosts have run out of wine. He turns on her: ""Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come."" (John 2:4) This sounds harsh. But Jesus has a symbolic point, and he makes it, turning six stone pots of water into wine. It's a sign that he will not be bound by the laws of nature. One doesn't see Mary again until she stands in all her sorrow at the foot of the cross with a few other women who were close to her son. She was presumably a widow by this point, as Joseph is not mentioned. Jesus, as her oldest son, is responsible for her well-being. And here he is, dying before her eyes in this public and humiliating way. Intriguingly, he summons his most beloved disciple, probably John (though nobody knows for sure), asking him to look after Mary when he is gone. ""Here is your mother,"" he says. This was surely an act of love. Our last view of Mary in the Gospels is in the Upper Room in Jerusalem, where she meets with the 11 disciples after her son's death. They are planning to pick a 12th disciple at this point -- to replace Judas. This moment precedes the Pentecost -- the arrival of the Holy Spirit in tongues of flame. Obviously Mary has, by this time, begun to play a role in the early Christian movement, though the scriptures say little about this. Much that we think about Mary, in fact, is the stuff of legend -- things added to her story by later Christian writers and artists. The Gospels offer only a few glimpses of her, beginning in Bethlehem, by the manger, with a helpless child bringing light into a fallen world. In the course of his three decades, Jesus and Mary had a tender but complex relationship, with misunderstandings -- again, the stuff of family life writ large. Yet their relations ended on a note of deep accord, with Mary taking on her role as ""mother of God,"" becoming an important figure in the early church. And we think of her at Christmas, this woman ""full of grace,"" who, with Christ child in arms, was ""blessed among women."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","Jay Parini: The image of Jesus in arms of his mother, Mary, is central to Christmas story .

"(CNN) -- I'm in a room built for laughter and I'm fighting the urge to faint. Or vomit. Or at least dab at the beads of sweat forming on my upper lip. If you're not great with small spaces, then an anechoic chamber probably isn't an ideal place to conduct an interview. Barely large enough to fit two chairs, with every surface covered in foam wedges and a TV bolted to the wall, the sound-proof bunker has the unnerving appearance of an apocalyptic Big Brother Diary Room. It's the type of place where nobody could hear you scream -- and that's exactly the point. This echo-free room is where University College London scientist Sophie Scott has been recording laughter, in an effort to find out what makes us giggle and why. ""I don't like coming in here, it makes my head feel thick, like I've got a load of blankets dropped on me,"" said the 46-year-old professor of cognitive neuroscience, as we sit down to talk about her work. ""This is where we record a lot of our emotional stimuli. We try to make people laugh in here, which is something of a challenge. We've also made people cry in here, so that was a day in the park -- crying in an anechoic chamber, the perfect storm,"" says Scott before adding her own cheerful chuckle, her large cartoon moon earrings jangling in agreement. Laugh out loud . How do you send someone into stitches, in such an uncomfortable environment? YouTube clips help -- that's where the TV comes in. But the best trick is being with friends. In fact, we're 30 times more likely to laugh when we're with other people, according to Scott. As part of their experiments, Scott and her team recorded two types of laughter in the anechoic chamber -- real, uncontrollable whooping, and posed, deliberate, chuckling. They then played the recordings to over 1,000 people while scanning their brains with fMRI. ""When people heard the posed laughter, there was more activation in brain areas associated with 'mentalizing' tasks -- ie. trying to work out what someone else is thinking,"" said Scott. ""Real laughter was much less ambiguous than posed laughter -- if someone is really laughing hard, it's easy to understand what they are doing."" They also found men and women processed laughter in much the same way. ""We have a myth that women and men use communication very differently -- that men aren't emotional and women are somewhat too emotional,"" said Scott. ""It's not the case."" Standup scientist . Scott is a woman of infectious merriment. Her conversation is sprinkled with warm chortles, and even the message alert on her phone is a cackle. As a child growing up in Lancashire in the north west of England, she was surrounded by parents who were ""big laughers,"" and recalls them singing silly songs to the point of hysterics. Unsurprising then, that the mother-of-one calls herself a ""standup scientist,"" performing with the university's Bright Club -- a group of researchers using comedy to deliver their message on stage . ""It was one of the most terrifying things I've ever done, but I've completely got the bug for it now, because it's such an interesting way to approach your work,"" said Scott. Ada Lovelace . This week Scott will again be taking to the stage to help mark Ada Lovelace Day, in honor of the 19th century female mathematician, often credited as the world's first computer programmer. Scott will be one of many prominent female scientists, engineers, and technologists talking about their work at Imperial College London. ""It's still a case that on the whole, the stereotype of the scientist is the gray beard, white coat man in a laboratory -- and of course, that's not true,"" said Scott. ""One of the important things to remember about women in science is actually, there's loads of them. It's just that we lose them, we don't value them as much, we don't think they count in the same way."" Indeed, Yale researchers have found potential employers still view young male scientists more favorably than their female counterparts. Universal language . For Scott, laughter is more than displaying amusement -- it's a primal way of showing people that we like them and want them to like us. ""Laughter is the only positive emotion we found to be cross-culturally recognized. It doesn't matter where you are in the world, it's a sound that people recognize,"" she said. ""Interestingly enough, it's not constrained to humans. Chimpanzees laugh, orangutangs laugh, even rats laugh."" Scott pointed to studies done by U.S. scientist Jaak Panksepp, who found that rats made the same high-pitched ""laughing"" sound when they were playing, as when they were being tickled. Such is the bonding power of laughter that it can even help make or break a relationship, as Scott explains: ""Some of the things scientists are finding is couples who manage stressful situations with positive affect -- laughter -- are the people who stay together longer."" ""Comedian Victor Borge said 'laughter is the shortest distance between two people.' I think what Borge was getting at was the intimacy of laughter. It's an expression of closeness.""","Meet Sophie Scott, the ""standup scientist"" uncovering what makes us laugh .

"(CNN) -- Rubbished, reviled, rejected. Rafa. As he posed on the Amsterdam Arena pitch with the glistening Europa League trophy in his hand, Rafael Benitez might have wondered what all the fuss had been about. Branislav Ivanovic's dramatic late winner secured a 2-1 win victory over Benfica and left Chelsea's interim manager with every right to feel proud. When he replaced Champions League-winning coach Roberto Di Matteo last November, he was welcomed into a cauldron of hate by Chelsea supporters. Despised by those in blue following his time with Liverpool, the new interim manager was mercilessly mocked, abused and verbally attacked in the stands and on radio phone-in shows. Perhaps more respect should have been afforded to a man who had led Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005 and Valencia to La Liga success in 2002 and 2004. Instead, banners proclaimed ""We're just not interim"" were unfurled, and Benitez was left to fight an uphill battle against those who detested his very presence on the touchline at Stamford Bridge. But after securing Champions League football for next season and claiming the Europa League trophy, perhaps he will even be afforded a warm goodbye when he relinquishes his role after Sunday's game against Everton. Benitez's latest triumph comes just two months after his infamous rant at the club's supporters following his side's FA Cup victory at second division side Middlesbrough. His attack on those who had delighted in criticizing his tenure may have raised eyebrows and earned him a censure from the club's board, but it finally showed who was in charge. Popularity has never been important to the Spaniard. But Benitez helped Chelsea salvage a season which had threatened to fall apart after it became the first ever defending title holder to drop out of the Champions League at the group stage. The Blues became the first team to win Europe's top prize and then its secondary competition in successive seasons, though Porto managed the feat in reverse order before coach Jose Mourinho -- widely tipped to rejoin Chelsea -- moved to Stamford Bridge in 2004. A third-place finish and victory in the Europa League is more than respectable for Benitez, who was forced to swim against a tide of hate from the very start. He is just the second man after Giovanni Trapattoni to win the competition with two different clubs following his triumph with Valencia in 2004 when it was known as the UEFA Cup. All that, despite being faced with placards and posters calling for his head and being vilified at every opportunity. In the end, as he stood facing the Chelsea fans with the silverware in his hands, he could afford a little smile. If Jose Mourinho is the man to come in, then at least Benitez can be content with leaving his old adversary with a winning team. ""That was a great performance in the second half, against a very good team,"" Benitez told ITV following the victory. ""I'm really pleased for the players and everyone involved. ""We didn't have the legs in the first half, so we had to adapt. They players have worked so hard, all season. I am proud - it was not easy. I'm really pleased, really proud."" It could have been different had Chelsea's opponent, Benfica, managed to take some of the chances afforded to it on a night of drama. Benfica began the brighter of the two, its players producing some sumptuous one-touch football which left Chelsea chasing shadows. As in Munich 12 months ago, Chelsea spent much of the first half ensconced in its own half, desperately trying to prevent the Portuguese side from making the breakthrough it so badly craved. But for all the wonderful flowing football, Benfica's deficiencies in front of goal were all too evident as it failed to convert any of the chances which came its way. Instead, it was Chelsea in a rare foray into the Benfica half which almost took the lead seven minutes before the break when Frank Lampard's rasping effort was clawed away by Artur. That scare appeared to reinvigorate Benfica and the Portuguese side almost moved ahead just minutes after the restart. Nicolas Gaitan found space on the right and his exquisite cross was headed home by Oscar Cardozo -- only for his celebrations to be cut short by an offside flag. While the decision was the correct one, Cardozo was millimeters offside, it was the source of much frustration to a Benfica side which quickly found itself behind. There appeared little trouble when Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech threw the ball out towards Juan Mata and when he failed to take control, Fernando Torres nipped in to run at the Benfica defense and coolly slot the ball home. To its credit, Benfica refused to buckle and Jorge Jesus' side hit back within nine minutes to level when Cardozo fired home from the penalty spot following a handball by Cesar Azpilicueta. Buoyed by its equalizer, Benfica pushed forward in search of a winner and Cech produced a fine save to push Cardozo's fierce drive over the crossbar. But while the red shirts poured forward, Chelsea looked dangerous on the break and Frank Lampard came within inches of winning the tie after his rasping 20-yard effort smashed against the crossbar with two minutes remaining. The game appeared destined for extra time with the scores still level going into the final minute of stoppage time. But after Ramires won a corner on the Chelsea right, Ivanovic rose highest to meet Mata's corner and head a dramatic winner. ""It's a great feeling,"" Ivanovic told ITV. ""This team deserved this, because we have had a very difficult season and a lot of games. ""In the end, today was a very hard game and Benfica played very well. But we scored from set pieces and work very hard preparing that part of our game. We deserve that trophy."" It was fitting that Ivanovic should score the winner after he was forced to miss last year's Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich through suspension. Frank Lampard, who became the club's record goalscorer last weekend after taking his tally to 203, was quick to praise the Serbia defender and reveal he is close to signing a new contract. ""It's been an amazing time for all of us involved,"" he told ITV. ""Talk about ups and downs in the last two years! But this is a big up. We're a group, a team, and it was tight tonight after the long season we've had. ""No-one deserves this more than Ivanovic -- he has been fantastic. You make your own luck, and we stick together in this group. The club deserve it. ""I really, really hope to be around next year. With a game tonight and coming up we haven't sat down and signed anything, but I really hope so and things are looking good. The club have been brilliant."" For Torres, it means he is now a reigning World Cup winner, European Championship winner, Champions League winner and Europa League winner -- the first for any player. ""I am very happy,"" the Spain international told ITV. ""It was a very tough game, and Benfica were much better in the first half. The first half was not good enough at all. We really wanted to win this Europe League, and maybe this was going to be our only chance."" This defeat caps a miserable week for Benfica, which looks set to lose out on the Portuguese league title following a dramatic late defeat by rival Porto. Benfica has now lost its past seven major European Cup finals -- all of which have come since being hit by the infamous ""Bela Guttmann curse"". Guttmann, a Hungarian coach, led Benfica to glory in the European Cup, winning the competition in 1961 and 1962. But after his request for a pay rise was turned down by the newly elected president Antonio Carlos Cabral Fezas Vital, Guttmann placed a curse on the club and declared it would not win the European Cup for another 100 years. Not even the great Eusebio, one of Benfica's most famous sons, was able to help lift the curse when he visited Guttmann's grave before Benfica's defeat in the 1990 European Cup final. The curse appears to now include Europe's second trophy -- much to the dismay of the club's manager Jesus. ""The Benfica fans were better than the Chelsea fans,"" Jesus told a press conference. ""They deserved a Benfica victory for their passion and their feelings and the patriotism they showed. ""This defeat is difficult for me because of the Benfica fans. For most of the 93 minutes, Benfica was always better than Chelsea.""","Chelsea wins the Europa League following 2-1 win over Benfica .

"(CNN) -- The first Roman Catholic priest in the United States imprisoned for covering up the crimes of offending priests was ordered to be released Thursday after an appeals court reversed his conviction. Monsignor William Lynn has been in prison since he was convicted in July 2012. He was convicted of one count of child endangerment and sentenced to three to six years. Attorney Thomas Bergstrom said Lynn could be released as soon as Friday, depending on paperwork. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said his office likely will appeal the ruling. ""I am disappointed and strongly disagree with the court's decision,"" he said. Lynn's conviction was for not removing a defrocked priest, Edward Avery, from active ministry in the 1990s after learning Avery had molested a teen. According to philly.com, Lynn's attorneys convinced the three-judge Superior Court panel that the laws at the time only applied to people who directly supervised children. The founder of Opus Bono Sacerdotii, a Detroit organization that provides assistance to accused priests, told philly.com the ruling will make prosecutors ""reflect on who is really accountable for the damage that may have been done to victims of sexual abuse."" Marci Hamilton, a lawyer for alleged victims suing Lynn and the Philadelphia archdiocese, called the decision a ""very technical reading of the law,"" the website reported. Lynn, now 62, made no statement Thursday, but after he was convicted 18 months ago he said: ""I've tried to serve God as best I could. My best was not good enough."" The landmark trial marked the first time U.S. prosecutors had charged not just the priests who allegedly committed abuses, but also church leaders for failing to stop them. Days before the trial began in March 2012, Avery pleaded guilty to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and conspiracy to endanger the welfare of a child after admitting that he sexually assaulted the 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-99 school year.

"(CNN) -- As American and Iranian negotiators prepare to implement their historic interim nuclear deal, a handful of hawkish lawmakers are on the cusp of destroying the last remaining pathway to peace. This month, Sens. Robert Menendez, Charles Schumer and Mark Kirk introduced ill-timed legislation -- the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013 -- that would implement new Iran sanctions in clear violation of the recently brokered Geneva agreement. Calling such actions in Washington ""a major setback,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif used the opportunity to send a clear message to his Western audience: ""It shows a lack of understanding of how to proceed in order to resolve the nuclear issue. Some people are wedded to the idea that pressure will produce results. They are wrong. Pressure has produced 18,000 centrifuges in Iran. So if they want to continue that road -- it is open to them, but it doesn't produce any results."" Zarif has a point. The problem with new sanctions legislation goes beyond the fact that it will kill the diplomatic process. Perhaps more important, this destructive behavior does the opposite of what we really should be doing: empowering those in Iran who want to unclench their fist and meet the extended hand of the United States. Supporters of sanctions legislation in Congress say their actions do not violate the Geneva deal. Instead, they are needed to retain the infrastructure of sanctions, because it was the sanctions that created this opening for diplomacy in the first place. This is a deep misread of how we got here and a very effective way of making sure this opportunity is lost. In a new report, ""Extending Hands and Unclenching Fists"" (PDF) -- which relies on in-depth interviews with senior Iranian political officials, intellectuals and members of business community -- the National Iranian American Council shows that absent evidence, it is difficult to argue that Iran's shift to more moderate policies was a result of external sanctions. It is more plausible that this shift reflected the continued desire of the Iranian people to put an end to the mismanagement and failed policies that had endured under the Ahmadinejad government. The Iranian people had pushed for the same shift in 2009, before the imposition of ""crippling sanctions,"" but the hardliners resorted to fraud and repression to prevent their votes from being counted. In 2013, circumstances on the ground in Iran bubbled over: Seventy-three percent voter turnout propelled Hassan Rouhani to a landslide first-round presidential victory at the polls with 50.7% of the vote. Precisely because the wounds of 2009 were still open, divisions within the political elite remained unsettled, and the intense internal rifts suggested that the system simply could not survive the delegitimizing effects of another election scandal. These internal dynamics are a far more powerful -- and far less understood -- dynamic than any sanctions imposed from abroad. The same analysis that incorrectly predicted victory by hardliner and former chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili at the polls subsequently attributed Rouhani's victory to sanctions despite no concrete evidence in support of that assertion. On the contrary, a poll conducted by Tehran University and the University of Maryland (PDF) immediately after the election revealed that only 2% of Rouhani's supporters listed the lifting of sanctions as a reason for supporting him. Twice as many -- 4% -- voted for him because he was a clergyman. Seven percent cited his ability to fix the economy. The poll also revealed that a key factor behind Rouhani's election was strategic voting by supporters of his rival, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf. Since most voters expected the election to go to a runoff, many saw voting for their preferred candidate in the first round as a waste if they expected their top choice to be a shoo-in for the runoff. Thus, some voters cast their ballots for their second choice in the first round to secure a runoff between two of their most preferred candidates. According to the poll, 24% of Rouhani voters preferred Ghalibaf but were certain he would make it to the runoff and instead voted for Rouhani to ensure a runoff between these two candidates. Thanks in part to this miscalculation, Rouhani managed to reach just above the 50% threshold and evade a runoff. A more recent poll by Zogby Research Services (PDF) conducted 1,200 face-to-face interviews in Iran, and the results were equally telling. A whopping 96% said that maintaining the right to advance their nuclear program is worth the price being paid in economic sanctions and international isolation. In contrast, a paltry 7% prioritized resolving the standoff over Iran's nuclear program so that economic sanctions can be lifted. Perhaps more important, the Zogby poll makes clear what intellectually honest Iran observers have long asserted: All top-tier priorities listed by Iranian respondents were political or governmental reform issues, such as employment, advancing democracy, protecting personal and civil rights, increasing women's rights and ending corruption. Iranian voters know better than anyone that Rouhani's victory at the polls is fragile. Boxing in their hardliners is not the same as eliminating them. What the outside world -- particularly the West -- does or does not do can help determine whether the win-win approach of Rouhani and Zarif will define Iran or whether it will once again be relegated to the sidelines. Thanks to the elections, not sanctions, the win-win narrative of the Iranian moderates is now dominant. But it won't be for long if their corresponding policies do not prove successful. Simply put: Proponents of sanctions can deal with the flexibility of Rouhani's team now, or they can deal with the inflexibility of Iranian hardliners in six months. Knowing this, their choices in the days and weeks ahead will be telling. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reza Marashi and Trita Parsi.","Reza Marashi and Trita Parsi say the U.S. is misinterpreting the results of Iranian election .

"(CNN) -- As prosecutors outlined more evidence in their murder case against fallen NFL star Aaron Hernandez -- and asked the court for more time -- his former coach said Wednesday he felt ""personally hurt and disappointed"" by the case. ""I and other members of the organization were shocked and disappointed in what he had learned,"" New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick told reporters in his first public comments since Odin Lloyd's killing early on June 17 and Hernandez's arrest nine days later. ""Having someone in your organization that's involved in a murder investigation is a terrible thing."" Authorities have said Hernandez, 23, and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment shortly after midnight last month. Surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. Lloyd's body was found in the North Attleborough industrial park later that day. Authorities have accused Hernandez of orchestrating the shooting death of Lloyd, the 27-year-old boyfriend of Hernandez's fiancÃÂ©e's sister. The former standout NFL tight end has pleaded not guilty to murder. Legal woes mount for former Patriots tight end . As has long been his custom on football and other matters, Belichick was guarded in his comments Wednesday to the press, saying repeatedly that he could not comment on ""people involved in the judicial process."" The three-time Super Bowl-winning head coach did say that -- even though he was outside the United States when the story broke -- he, team owner Robert Kraft and other Patriot officials ""acted swiftly and decisively."" The NFL team released Hernandez, who had been one of its top offensive players, shortly after his arrest but before he was charged in court with murder. Belichick took pains to say that Hernandez's alleged actions, as outlined by prosecutors, do ""not in any way represent the way that the New England Patriots want to do things."" The team continually evaluates its players -- from their on-field performance to their maturity and personal history off the field -- the coach said, before adding, ""We'll work to do a better job of it as we go forward."" ""Personally, I'm challenged by decisions that affect the team on a daily basis, and I'm not perfect on that, either,"" Belichick said. ""But I always try to do what I think is best for the football team."" Hernandez jersey exchange draws 1,200 plus . The coach spoke the same day Hernandez appeared in Attleboro District Court, wearing a dark blazer, a white button-down shirt and handcuffs over his tattooed wrists. He stood on one corner of the courtroom, flanked by a bailiff, for what was supposed to be a probable cause hearing in his case. But Bristol County prosecutor William McCauley asked the judge to delay the hearing 30 days -- and keep Hernandez incarcerated in the meantime -- so that a grand jury could have more time to consider the case. The grand jury that was impaneled when the investigation began stopped its work at the end of June, McCauley explained. After a two-week break, a new grand jury is now convened to hear ""every case in Bristol County"" -- including that of Hernandez, having heard from ""approximately two dozen witnesses"" -- said the prosecutor. ""We have done everything in our power to present it as expeditiously as possible,"" McCauley said. ""Requesting a further date based on the inability to have enough time before the grand jury, I think, is warranted."" A judge had ordered Hernandez held without bail soon after he was charged with murder. Since then, the prosecutor said, more evidence has been gathered implicating the ex-NFL player. This includes boxes of ammunition found in an apartment of Hernandez, and with his fingerprints on them, that is ""consistent with the caliber that was recovered at the homicide scene,"" according to McCauley. Also, a magazine clip was found in one of Hernandez's vehicles for a Glock .45, the type of gun that authorities believe was used to kill Lloyd. The alleged murder weapon itself has not been recovered. ""There continues to be additional evidence,"" McCauley said. James Sultan, Hernandez's attorney, argued strongly Wednesday against delaying the probable cause hearing. Prosecutors ""made it sound like a slam-dunk case"" against Hernandez soon after he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in a southern Massachusetts jail, Sultan said. ""Now, four weeks later, the first assistant district attorney is not even ready to show this court that it can meet the probable cause standard to hold Mr. Hernandez,"" the defense attorney said. ""(The prosecution) is not entitled to proceed on whatever pace it might choose."" Judge Daniel O'Shea ended up siding with the prosecution, delaying Hernandez's probable cause hearing until 2 p.m. on August 22. ""I do recognize that four weeks is a long time for somebody being held in custody,"" the judge said. ""But the charge is, amongst others, a murder charge.""

One of them, Ernest Wallace, has been charged with accessory after the fact to murder and has pleaded not guilty. The other, Carlos Ortiz, has pleaded not guilty to a weapons charge.

"Chengdu, China (CNN) -- Miss Chen stares curiously at the iPad. Even though she works overtime in a factory in southwestern China that manufactures them, she's never seen the finished product. ""Wow, I want it,"" said Chen, brushing her finger across the glossy screen with curiosity and amazement. The 18-year-old student from a village outside of the southern megacity of Chongqing is one of more than one million factory workers at a Chinese company that helps manufacture products for Apple Inc.'s lucrative global empire, which raked in a record $46.3 billion in sales last quarter. At a factory about an hour west of Sichuan's capital Chengdu, Foxconn Technology Group, one of Apple's biggest manufacturing partners. Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands who work day or night shifts, eating and sleeping at company facilities, as they help build electronics products for Apple and many other global brand names, such as Amazon's Kindle and Microsoft's Xbox. Chen's name has been changed for this story. She told CNN that all her Foxconn colleagues have been instructed not to talk to any reporter or ""criminal liability shall be investigated according to law."" Rights groups like Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin and Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior say that Foxconn's stringent military-like culture is one of surveillance, obedience and not challenging authority. Workers are told obey or leave. It's an oppressive culture that labor groups say contributed to a slew of suicides in 2010 at the company's Shenzhen plant -- prompting Foxconn to install nets in an effort to prevent employees from jumping. As a poor college student with no work experience, looking for job in China's competitive market is an uphill battle. So when Chen was offered a one-month position at Foxconn during the Spring Festival -- with promises of great benefits and little overtime, she jumped at the chance. Her heart fell after arriving at the Foxconn factory, when she found out only senior employees get such benefits and sick leaves. Ms. Chen said she's also forced to work overtime on a regular basis. ""During my first day of work, an older worker said to me, 'why did you come to Foxconn? Don't ever think about it again and leave right now',"" said Chen, who plans to return to her studies at a Chongqing university soon. ""Foxconn employees have a saying, ""they use women as men and men as machines."" Foxconn is a part of Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. which supplies iPads and iPhones. Foxconn recently released a statement defending its corporate practices, stating its employees are entitled to numerous benefits including access to health care and opportunities for promotions and training. ""Foxconn takes our responsibility to our employees very seriously and we work hard to give our 1.2 million employees in China a safe and positive working environment and compensation and benefits that are competitive with all of our industry peers in that location,"" said Foxconn in an email statement to CNN. In response to questions from CNN, Apple released this statement: ""We care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain. We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made. Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple."" Apple officials also noted last month it became the first company admitted to the Fair Labor Association, ""a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to improving conditions for workers around the world."" In an email to Apple employees, CEO Tim Cook said the company cares about every worker and ""any accident is deeply troubling, and any issue with working conditions is cause for concern."" Despite widespread reports of poor working conditions, some experts say Foxconn factories still offer better benefits and surroundings than most factories in China -- providing air conditioning, heating and clean dorms for its employees. ""These companies are making huge profits but workers feel that they are not getting a fair share,"" said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labour Bulletin. ""But just because Apple is making a profit doesn't mean they are passing that onto Foxconn; the margins are slim."" Crothall said it's important to empower workers. But it's also a challenge for Apple to find a manufacturer that delivers the quality and speed Foxconn can with its vast resources, he added. After three weeks of applying more than 4,000 stickers a day onto iPad screens by hand and working 60 hours a week in an assembly line, Chen says she's ready to go back to school and study hard so she'll never have to return to Foxconn. ""It's so boring, I can't bear it anymore. Everyday is like: I get off from work and I go to bed. I get up in the morning, and I go to work. It is my daily routine and I almost feel like an animal,"" said Ms. Chen, who aspires to become a biologist. When asked why humans do machine-like work at Foxconn, she responds, ""Well, humans are cheaper.""","Rights groups accuse Foxconn, maker of Apple products, of a 'military like culture'

"Washington (CNN) -- Remember Rep. Paul Ryan? The 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate? He's still a member of Congress. He still represents Wisconsin's 1st Congressional district. And he still sits atop of the House Budget Committee. Ryan has fallen out of the national spotlight since the GOP election loss, and he has remained largely silent while Republicans and Democrats battle amid a federal shutdown over how to move forward on a government funding bill and raise the debt ceiling. Ryan's recent reticence is more noticeable because the prominent fiscal matters front and center now highlight his area of expertise. He is known in Congress as the budget wonk, the expert on federal government and spending. His colleagues look to him for guidance. In recent years, he unveiled controversial budget blueprints that dramatically cut spending and altered entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. His budgets, titled ""Path to Prosperity,"" became the defining documents for Republican fiscal policy. After stepping into the limelight of the presidential campaign last year, he became just as well known for his biceps as his budget, thanks to a Time magazine photo shoot. Silence shattered . While President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner remain at odds over the shutdown and the debt ceiling, and while House Republicans are involved in infighting, Ryan dipped his toe into the shark tank. He broke his months-long silence with an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, putting forward a new path -- how to break the crippling stalemate in Washington with ideas that even some Democrats support. He did not emerge unscathed. Op-ed doesn't mention Obamacare . Ryan took a measured tone in the op-ed. He placed blame on Obama for not being willing to negotiate but he implored both sides both sides to sit down at the negotiating table. Ryan responds to criticism over op-ed . His idea: his old idea. He proposed ""commonsense reforms of the country's entitlement programs."" 2016 ambitions? Ultimately, his timely emergence could be part of a larger plot. As a young politician with a bright future, speculation is rampant that he might be running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. That speculation grows louder especially as he plans trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the first presidential nominating states. He will keynote a birthday fundraiser for Iowa's Republican governor next month and he is to attend a fundraising breakfast for a congressional candidate in New Hampshire. While Ryan released the op-ed, he continues to play the cautious card, however. CNN has asked every congressional member if they would support a ""clean"" government funding or debt ceiling bill with no strings attached -- something many Republicans are demanding. Ryan's office has not commented. In new book, Paul Ryan asks 'where do we go from here?' Ears opened . If his strategy is to speak little but make a big impact, Ryan definitely made an impact. It might not have been the one he had hoped. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has broken with his party on various issues, championed Ryan's op-ed. Via Twitter, McCain said Ryan's proposal is a ""must read."" But not everyone was so enthusiastic. Conservatives jumped on Ryan's for omitting their central demand -- dismantling Obamacare - in the government shutdown and debt limit fight. A spokeswoman for the leader of that crusade, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, aptly noticed the omission. ""There is one big work missing from this op-ed. It's start with an O and ends with BAMACARE,"" she tweeted. Ryan was forced to go on defense instead of push his agenda. Appearing on conservative talk show ""Bill Bennett's Morning in America,"" Bennett asked Ryan if dismantling Obamacare was no longer a priority. Ryan insisted that it still was. ""Obamacare's an entitlement just like any other entitlement,"" Ryan said, according to Politico. ""If you look at the op-ed, I say we have to - ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation's health care laws."" Head of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, came to Ryan's defense. He echoed Ryan's defense and said his op-ed included ""OBAMACARE,"" even though it didn't specifically mention it. At a weekly meeting of House conservative lawmakers that Ryan regularly attends, he attempted to explain the position he laid out in the Wall Street Journal. But some conservatives still insist that Obamacare be tied to any deal. Ryan dodged reporters after the meeting. Opinion: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy . The dilemma . Twenty years ago, Ryan worked for the conservative organization Empower America, which later became FreedomWorks. While that organization successfully morphed from a group that promoted traditional fiscal conservatism and neoconservative foreign policies into a limited government tea party aligned group. Is Paul Ryan an Empower America Republican? Or a FreedomWorks Republican? There lies Ryan's dilemma. It's the same scenario that is plaguing the Republican Party and also dictating the current debate in Washington. Republican strategist and former Romney spokesman Ryan Williams his op-ed shows that he's ""the adult in the room."" ""He felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never-ending stalemate that we're witnessing in Washington,"" Williams added. But the conservatives intent on stopping the health care law at all political costs aren't interested in ending the stalemate if it doesn't end Obamacare. Lisa Miller, Founder of the Washington-based Tea Party WDC, said she hopes the government shutdown leads to the chipping away of the health care law. ""Paul Ryan is a numbers guy; I just don't like his numbers,"" Miller said. Williams insisted that Ryan has already proven his conservative credentials but his op-ed shows he's a ""realist"" given the miniscule probability that Republicans have in undoing the health care law. Given the push back Ryan has received, three years before the presidential election, Ryan might have to decide if he's going to be a ""realist"" or a modern day, tea party conservative if he aspires to higher political office. Supporters stand by representatives, and government shutdown .","Paul Ryan has fallen out of the national spotlight since last year's GOP loss in presidential election .

"(Mental Floss) -- Even in the midst of the Civil War, there was still one thing the North and South shared -- a serious addiction to caffeine. Confederate troops were less likely to get a cup of coffee. In that respect, the Union clearly had an advantage. Not only did the North have more than two-thirds of the population and control most of the heavy industry, railroads, and financial reserves in the country, it hoarded supplies of the highly addictive little bean, leaving the Confederacy to wage its own war against java deprivation. Coffee: It's what's for breakfast, lunch and dinner . Throughout the Civil War, coffee was as prevalent on the battlefields as it is in offices today. In fact, the Union army was fueled by the stuff to the point that, if there was no time to boil water, the Boys in Blue would chew on whole beans as they marched. And at night, Union campsites were dotted with tiny fires, each boiling a pot of coffee like a million miniature Starbucks. Beyond caffeine cravings, Union troops loved their coffee because it was, literally, the best thing on the menu. Before the advent of helpful (and tasty!) artificial preservatives, a marching soldier's rations were neither varied nor particularly appetizing. Typically, they consisted of salted meat, unleavened bread (accurately christened ""hardtack""), and a little sugar and salt. It didn't help that Union supply chains were riddled with corrupt food contractors who charged the government top dollar for rotten, stale, and insect-ridden foodstuffs. Coffee, however, was almost always fresh because it was delivered in whole-bean form -- making it difficult for even the most dishonest supplier to skimp on quality. Not that they didn't try, of course. In fact, officials began requesting coffee as whole beans after some crooked contractors tried to up their per-pound profits by slipping sand and dirt into packages of ground coffee. In 1861, hoping to cut down on the time soldiers spent roasting and grinding beans, the army switched to a concentrated proto-instant coffee. The new concoction, called ""essence of coffee,"" was made by boiling prepared coffee, milk, and sugar into a thick gloop, which soldiers then reconstituted by mixing it with water. The product reportedly tasted every bit as bad as you'd imagine, and thanks to the corrupt dairymen who sold the army spoiled milk, it also tended to cause diarrhea. Needless to say, the Union army was soon back on the bean. Southern discomfort . Noxious as essence of coffee was, Confederate soldiers would have gladly downed a cup or two. But, because of a Union naval blockade, coffee (along with weapons, machinery, medicine, and other vital materials) was in short supply in the South. Before the war, a pound of beans would have set you back around 20 cents in Yankee dough. Once pre-war stockpiles ran out, however, the same amount was running as high as $60 in Confederate money. (Despite the undervalued currency, that was still a lot.) There was some coffee that made it into the Confederacy -- usually carried by steam-powered blockade-runner ships. But, for the most part, Southerners had to rely on coffee substitutes, including various forms of roasted corn, rye, okra seeds, sweet potatoes, acorns, and peanuts. Unfortunately, all these imitations lacked potency, tasted awful, and upset the bowels. The only slightly better alternative was tea made from the leaves of the native yaupon shrub. The good news was that it contained caffeine; the bad news was that it was incredibly difficult to digest. Luckily, there was one surefire way for Southern folk to get their coffee -- by making peace with the Union. Soldiers on the front lines often called informal truces so Rebels could swap tobacco for Yankee coffee and then dash back to their camps before they were reported missing. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- While many people get their New Year's countdown clocks ready, Jahi McMath's family is scrambling as a darker deadline looms. A judge's ruling will allow a hospital to disconnect life support machines at 5 p.m. Monday from the 13-year-old girl, whom doctors declared brain dead after she suffered complications from tonsil surgery earlier this month. Jahi's family, who wants to transfer her somewhere else, told CNN affiliate KGO that they spent Sunday working the phones, trying to line up another option. The case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital that treated her should have provided better care. Medical ethicists, meanwhile, say the high-profile case fuels a misperception: that ""brain death"" is somehow not as final as cardiac death, even though, by definition, it is. The case is ""giving the impression that dead people can come back to life,"" Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CNN last week. But Jahi's family members maintain that they're hoping for a miracle and want to transfer the girl from Children's Hospital Oakland to another facility. A statement released by family members Saturday and provided to KGO says they are weighing several options. ""Our attorney is in discussions with two facilities that have expressed preliminary approval for accepting Jahi on a ventilator,"" the statement said. ""One is in Southern California, the other is in New York."" Doug Straus, an attorney representing Children's Hospital Oakland, said in a letter to the family's lawyer Sunday that officials are still awaiting specifics from the family. ""To date, there has been no communication from any facility named by you regarding a transfer or requirements for transfer with any of the medical professionals at Children's. The family has not identified any facility with which Children's can have this dialogue. Nor have we been provided with a transportation plan or coroner authorization,"" he wrote. ""As your email and your statements about the facility in the Los Angeles area acknowledge, discussion about performing medical procedures upon a dead body presents unusual and complicated questions. Until there is a definite commitment by a facility to accept Jahi's body upon specified terms, I don't think I can tackle those issues. Please let me know if the family is able to identify a facility."" When 'life support' is really 'death support' Jahi was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on December 12, three days after tonsil surgery. Family members and hospital officials fought over her future in court. Last week, a judge ruled she was brain dead and urged both sides to work together to resolves the situation. But the sparring showed no sign of slowing over the weekend, with family members sharply criticizing the hospital's handling of the matter. ""We wish to acknowledge that Jahi's case, and our stance regarding her right to life, and her mother's right to make decisions regarding her child, has stirred a vibrant, sometimes polarizing, national debate. This was never our intention,"" the family's statement said. ""We have our strong religious convictions and set of beliefs and we believe that, in this country, a parent has the right to make decisions concerning the existence of their child: not a doctor who looks only at lines on a paper, or reads the cold black and white words on a law that says 'brain dead' and definitely not a doctor who runs the facility that caused the brain death in the first place."" The hospital's statement Sunday said they were supporting Jahi's family. ""We continue to do so despite their lawyer's criticizing the very hospital that all along has been working hard to be accommodating to this grieving family,"" the hospital said.

"(CNN) -- Here's a New Year's resolution that's easy to keep, good for your health and beneficial for your relationships. And it won't cost you a penny. Sound too good to be true? Read on. In recent months, I've been working with a group of creative thinkers who are mining the meaning of a good life. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Bill Damon and Howard Gardner are renowned psychologists who've collaborated to create the Good Project, which explores the behaviors and mindsets that add up to good work, good play and good citizenship. Together, with Lynn Barendsen, we've developed a simple set of questions for the New Year. They're catalysts for reflection rather than formulas for imitation. Their purpose is to get us thinking about our purpose, in both private and community life. We originally developed these questions for young people, on the belief that the new generation doesn't get enough structured opportunities to explore meaning and values. But the truth is, it's not just millennials today who might lack purpose, feel uncertain about shared beliefs and goals or wish they could be part of something greater than themselves. It's people of all ages. We Americans rarely get to make a truly mindful assessment of who we are, what's shaped us and why we hope to change. If we did that first, we'd probably be more capable of making wise resolutions and keeping them. We'd become more conscious of the web of relationship and mutual obligation that holds us together and that makes our freedom truly worth cherishing. And we might just end up being better humans. So I invite you, whatever your stage of life, to explore these questions. Ask them of yourself. Talk with family and friends about them. Write and share your reflections. Feel free to adapt and revise the questions to suit your circumstances. And let us know on Twitter what the experience is like for you and those close to you. If you make it your first resolution to consider these questions well, your other resolutions will almost certainly end up being more honest, more meaningful to you and more useful to others. Enjoy reflecting, and may your new year be happy -- and deeply good. Who you are . 1. Think of something (an activity, a job) to which you're really committed and that takes up a lot of your time. Why do you do it? Do you consider it time well spent? Why or why not? What would make you stop being involved? 2. Who or what do you consider your community? What do you do for the community? What would you expect the community to do it for you? 3. To whom or what do you feel responsible? What does that entail? What happens when you don't meet that responsibility? 4.

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 2 million people have signed up so far for health coverage under Obamacare, officials said Tuesday in trying to put the best face forward before the controversial health care reforms fully kick in with the start of 2014. The enrollment figure represented a big increase after the botched launch of the system in October, but Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was unable to say how many of the 2.1 million who enrolled have paid their first premium to ensure their policies take effect on Wednesday. Sebelius and other officials also acknowledged the possibility of more potential problems, warning people to bring proof of coverage with them to their doctor or pharmacy, pay premiums when due and double-check with insurers that they are covered. CNNMoney: Starting the new year in Obamacare limbo . Under the reforms, Americans will be required to have health coverage or face a fine. Sebelius called the full implementation of reforms under the 2010 Affordable Care Act a new era in health insurance, noting they mean no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions or other discriminatory practices such as charging women more than men. ""Starting tomorrow, being a woman will no longer be a pre-existing condition,"" Sebelius said on a conference call with journalists. The Obamacare enrollment figure is below the target of 3 million originally set by the administration for the end of December, which is halfway through an initial six-month sign-up period under the law intended to help millions of previously uninsured Americans get coverage. Overall, the administration hopes to enroll 7 million people by March 31 while also expanding eligibilty for Medicaid, the government health care program for the impoverished. Sebelius said Tuesday that another 3.9 million people were eligible for coverage through expanded Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, but she was unable to specify how many have become new enrollees. The botched rollout of the new marketplaces on October 1, when the HealthCare.gov website set up to handle the enrollment failed to work properly, damaged the sign-up process until the system began working better in early December. Sebelius said the administration was ""doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period"" for people getting new coverage. Anticipating possible problems in the enrollment system, Sebelius also advised in her blog post that ""if you thought you enrolled in health coverage but aren't showing up in the system, call your insurance company directly."" She also said people could contact the Obamacare call center for assistance. Asked if the website woes in October and November could be due to attacks from outside by Obamacare opponents, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told reporters there were technological problems but no sign of hacking. The health care reforms championed by President Barack Obama have become the defining issue of his presidency, with Republicans led by tea party conservatives trying to dismantle them while some Democrats appearing leery of campaigning on them in the November congressional elections. While the Supreme Court ruled the mandate to obtain health coverage was constitutional, further legal challenges are being mounted. Also on Tuesday, a group of Catholic organizations, in an emergency appeal, asked the Supreme Court to delay the Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups provide contraception and ""abortion-inducing drug"" coverage to their workers. Catholic groups ask Supreme Court to delay Obamacare mandate . Archdioceses in Washington, D.C., Tennessee and Michigan -- along with affiliated groups that include Catholic University -- asked Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan to block enforcement of the related employer mandates set to take effect on Wednesday. The issue has been a major sticking sticking point with religious groups and private for-profit companies that have strong moral objections.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday agreed to move his scheduled special address to a joint session of Congress back one day -- from September 7 to September 8 -- after consultations with House Speaker John Boehner, the White House said Wednesday night. ""Today, the President asked to address the Congress about the need for urgent action on the economic situation facing the American people as soon as Congress returned from recess,"" the White House said in a statement Wednesday night. ""Both Houses will be back in session after their August recess on Wednesday, September 7th, so that was the date that was requested. We consulted with the Speaker about that date before the letter was released, but he determined Thursday would work better. The President is focused on the urgent need to create jobs and grow our economy, so he welcomes the opportunity to address a Joint Session of Congress on Thursday, September 8th and challenge our nation's leaders to start focusing 100% of their attention on doing whatever they can to help the American people."" A political showdown had erupted earlier Wednesday over Obama's sudden request. Boehner, in a letter to Obama, said the 8 p.m. speech would come less than two hours after the House is scheduled to complete legislative business, and the speaker recommended moving it back a day. Boehner's letter noted that security sweeps of the chamber usually take more than three hours. ""There are considerations about the congressional calendar that must be made prior to scheduling such an extraordinary event,"" Boehner wrote. ""With the significant amount of time -- typically more than three hours -- that is required to allow for a security sweep of the House chamber before receiving a president, it is my recommendation that your address be held on the following evening, when we can ensure there will be no parliamentary or logistical impediments that might detract from your remarks."" One senior GOP aide told CNN that ""arranging a joint session of Congress isn't as simple as snapping our fingers."" Obama's requested date conflicted with a Republican presidential debate to be held at the Reagan Library in California. When asked about that conflict, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney brushed it off. ""This is the right time to do it (and) the right day to do it,"" Carney said in reference to Obama's speech. If the Republicans want to ""adjust the timing of their debate ... that would be completely fine with us."" Numerous observers noted that the September speech will conflict with the opening game of the National Football League's regular season. The dispute had touched off accusations by people on each side -- all on condition of not identifying who made them -- of high-handed behavior by the other, as well as the White House. One Democratic source said the White House provided little advance notice of the speech request to congressional Democrats, while the GOP aide stressed that Republicans were not consulted at all. The aide added that Republicans were notified only 15 minutes before the public release of Obama's request. Events like the president's State of the Union address typically involve as much as four to six weeks of lead time and consultation, involving a series of meetings among police, Secret Service officials and others, the Republican aide noted. However, a White House official said Boehner's office was consulted and raised no objection. That prompted Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck to insist that ""no one in the speaker's office -- not the speaker, not any staff -- signed off on the date the White House announced today."" ""Unfortunately, we weren't even asked if that date worked for the House,"" Buck said. ""Shortly before it arrived this morning, we were simply informed that a letter was coming. It's unfortunate the White House ignored decades -- if not centuries -- of the protocol of working out a mutually agreeable date and time before making any public announcement."" A senior Democratic aide familiar with scheduling such events in previous administrations said ""the childish behavior coming out of the speaker's office today is truly historic."" ""It is unprecedented to reject the date that a president wants to address a joint session of the Congress,"" the senior Democratic aide said. ""People die and state funerals are held with less fuss, so the logistics excuse by the speaker's office is laughable. Yes, consultation always occurs, but the president always gets the date he wants."" Meanwhile, an aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Boehner didn't consult with House Democratic leaders about seeking a new date for Obama's speech. Obama's request for a Wednesday evening speech was accepted by the leadership of the Democratic-controlled Senate, according to a Democratic Senate leadership aide. The approval of leaders from both chambers of Congress, however, is required for such a presidential request to be accepted. Obama's speech is intended to provide a prime-time platform for the rollout of his highly anticipated job growth plan. ""Our nation faces unprecedented economic challenges, and millions of hard-working Americans continue to look for jobs,"" Obama said in a letter sent earlier Wednesday to Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""As I have traveled across our country this summer and spoken with our fellow Americans, I have heard a consistent message: Washington needs to put aside politics and start making decisions based on what is best for our country and not what is best for each of our parties in order to grow the economy and create jobs. We must answer this call."" The national unemployment rate currently stands at 9.1% -- a figure all but ensuring that the state of the fragile economy will remain the dominant issue of the 2012 presidential campaign.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia pledged $3 billion to the Lebanese Army to strengthen its capabilities, according to Lebanon's state-run news agency. Lebanon's President Gen. Michel Sleiman said the money will allow the army to buy weapons from France, and he expressed gratitude to Saudi Arabia, according to the statement. ""The Saudi aid to the Lebanese Army is the largest in the history of Lebanon,"" Sleiman said. The announcement comes as French President Francois Hollande is in Saudi Arabia for talks on the crisis in the Mideast and to strengthen economic ties. ""I think a majority of Lebanese would support it -- they want a stronger army -- but it will be divisive. It will create political and ideological tensions,"" says Rami Khouri, an analyst with The Daily Star, a Lebanese newspaper. Lebanon is also home to Hezbollah, which is better equipped than Lebanon's army and has been supporting government forces in neighboring Syria's civil war. ""This is the Saudi's way of thinking they can challenge or weaken Hezbollah or Iran or Syria. This is what they do. They give money,"" Khouri says. Tensions have been rising in Lebanon. On Friday a car bomb in Beirut killed former Lebanese finance minister Mohamad Chatah, an outspoken critic of Hezbollah and the Syrian regime. Sleiman said in the statement that strengthening Lebanon's army is now critical. ""Lebanon is threatened by sectarian conflict and extremism,"" he said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- It's as tall as some of L.A.'s highest skyscrapers, but the only residents here are rats and cockroaches. Welcome to the Puente Hills Landfill, the largest rubbish dump in America. Over 150 meters of garbage has risen from the ground since the area became a designated dumping site in 1957. Now, six days a week, an army of 1,500 trucks delivers a heaving 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste from the homes and offices of L.A. County's millions of inhabitants. ""This used to be a dairy farm; a valley filled with cows producing milk. And now it's a geological feature made out of trash,"" said Edward Humes, author of ""Garbology: Our Dirty Love Affair with Trash"" -- a book that charts the history of garbage in America. Humes says most of the waste arrives straight from the bins of local residents. ""If you're like most of us -- most Americans -- you're making seven pounds of trash a day. Across a lifetime that adds up to 102 tons of trash per person,"" he said. In 2010 alone, Americans accumulated 250 million tons of garbage, and although recycling in the U.S. has increased by 34% since 1960, Humes believes the country's attitude to waste is still not sustainable. ""It's very convenient to roll your trash to the curb every week and have it disappear, but it's a magic trick -- and really there's not very much magic,"" he said. ""We need to have less packaging; use less disposable items; (use) things that last longer; make purchasing decisions that are more studied and less wasteful."" The environmental impact of landfill sites varies depending on how well they're managed and resourced. However, typical problems include the contamination of soil and groundwater from toxic residues; the release of methane, a greenhouse gas produced during the decaying process that is more potent than carbon dioxide; and disease-carrying pests. Tom Freyberg, chief editor of industry publication Waste Management World agrees with Humes that we should all be trying to reduce waste and increase the amount we recycle. However, he says it's likely there will always be a need for landfill, and we should applaud those sites that are well managed. ""What's happening now compared to years ago is that the technology and practices around waste management have vastly improved. It might be hard to see it from the outside, but they (Puente Hills) have a state of the art landfill site,"" he said. Indeed, the layers of waste at Puente Hills are meticulously separated by plastic membranes, designed to contain the brew of noxious chemicals that would otherwise leak out into the groundwater. The ""leachate"" is then collected and filtered to make it safe. The slums of Mumbai: A model of urban sustainability? In addition, the methane produced by the natural decomposition of materials inside the tower of trash is collected through a network of pipes and burned to generate electricity. The emitted methane from Puente Hills alone produces about 50 megawatts of power -- enough energy for 70,000 homes, according to Los Angeles County authorities. At present, just over half of all U.S. garbage is buried in landfills, a third is recycled and the rest is incinerated to produce electricity, a process known as waste-to-energy. A recent study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded that incinerating a ton of trash emits at least 35% less greenhouse gas and yields 10 times more electricity than burying it and capturing the methane. So why does America still seem so in love with landfill? ""Quite simply, it's the most cost-effective option across most of the U.S.,"" said Peter Borkey, head of the OECD's waste division. ""Incineration plants require a large critical mass of waste to be financially worthwhile. This is easy to accomplish in densely populated areas, but the costs associated with processing and transporting garbage rise very quickly as the population density lowers."" Borkey believes that landfill reduction will prove difficult until producers of waste and the municipal authorities responsible for handling it are given the right incentives. He says that in Europe -- where an EU directive on waste management has decreed landfill a disposal method of last resort -- large rubbish dumps are dwindling. ""In places like Germany and Scandinavia, landfill now constitutes less than 5% of total waste management,"" he said. But some landfill is unavoidable: ""At present residual waste that can neither be burned nor recycled -- hazardous waste and incineration ash -- can only be confined in well-managed landfill."" In Freyberg's view, the public attitude surrounding the very idea of ""waste"" should be reformed. ""The term doesn't do the industry any favors. Most of what we call waste can be reused, turned into fuel or new products altogether. We should instead think of it as a great resource.""","L.A. is home to America's largest landfill site, towering as high as a skyscraper .
Americans accumulated 250 million tons of garbage in 2010, most ends up as landfill .
But there is complex science behind a rubbish dump ensuring it is safe and sustainable ."
"London (CNN) -- The ceiling collapse that injured dozens of people at a London theater involved ""no criminal act,"" police said Friday in an initial assessment. Police said the investigation into Thursday evening's collapse of the ceiling of London's historic Apollo Theatre, in the heart of the capital's buzzing theater district, will be continued by the Westminster City Council. Investigators combing through the wreckage want to know what caused part of the century-old structure's ornate plaster ceiling to tumble onto the crowd who packed the nearly sold-out show. Nine people were seriously hurt in the collapse, but there were no fatalities, the London Ambulance Service said Friday. ""It could have been a lot worse -- there were about 720 people in the auditorium at the time, and a large area of the ceiling came down,"" said London Fire Brigade's Kingsland Station Manager Nick Harding. Three injured people were trapped under debris and had to be rescued by firefighters, he said. Some of the ""walking wounded"" were treated in neighboring theaters, he added. London Ambulance Service said it helped 79 people, 56 of whom were taken to local hospitals. Some had head and back injuries, while others had breathing problems or cuts and scrapes. Images from inside the Apollo, which opened in 1901, showed planks, plaster and other debris strewn across the dusty, red plush seats. The drama unfolded shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday, about 40 minutes into the play, ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time."" ""One of the actors said, 'Watch out!' "" said one woman. ""We thought it was part of the play."" It wasn't. Instead, it was part of the plaster ceiling collapsing and dropping down five stories onto the theatergoers below. 'Somebody screamed' ""We heard a creak, somebody screamed, somebody from over there said, 'Look out!' and then the ceiling kind of creased in the middle and then just collapsed,"" said Hannah, who with her husband had snagged one of the last pairs of tickets to the performance in the 775-seat theater. Though she said she felt ""slight panic,"" she credited those around her for keeping calm. ""It wasn't every man for himself,"" she said, noting that several of her fellow theatergoers checked on those around them. ""Everyone was looking out for each other, and in a couple of minutes, everyone was out."" Martin Bostock, who was with his wife and two children, said he thought the cave-in was part of the show until something very hard hit him on the head and chaos and panic erupted. ""You couldn't see across the room because of the dust, which we were all breathing in,"" he told CNN. ""It was absolutely horrific and very terrifying. I was with my wife and two kids. Thank God, we got out."" Another theatergoer, Simon Usborne, said: ""My view of the stage was immediately obscured by this dust and debris -- some other people have said it was like an avalanche, and that's probably a better description."" No alarm sounded, but it was clear that something serious had happened, he said. ""Everybody knew that something was wrong and the fear was then that more might come down, so everybody immediately dashed for an exit -- people were screaming -- I was fortunately close to an exit,"" he said. Harding, who said the theater had been evacuated in a swift and orderly way, told reporters Friday it was too soon to speculate on the cause of the collapse. Some observers have speculated that heavy rain over London earlier Thursday evening might have played a part. The Apollo is on Shaftesbury Avenue near Piccadilly Circus, in London's Soho district, which is usually packed with tourists, shoppers and diners at theater time. The area around it was cordoned off after the collapse as bloodied and dust-covered theatergoers stumbled onto the street. The local London authority, Westminster City Council, said Friday morning that the Apollo Theatre's roof is now ""secure,"" but what led it to give way was not known. Historic theaters are required to undergo rigorous roof safety checks every three years, the council said. 'A freak, unusual accident' Many people with tickets for shows over the busy holiday period will want to know that they are not at risk of falling victim to a similar offstage drama. There are nearly 50 major theaters in the West End of London, of which 26 are at least 90 years old. The Society of London Theatre, which represents the theater industry in the capital, sought Friday to reassure those alarmed by the events. ""Our theatres entertain over 32,000 people in central London every night and all theatres take the safety of their audience, performers and staff very seriously,"" it said in a prepared statement. ""Every theatre undergoes rigorous safety checks and inspections by independent experts, and incidents like last night are extremely rare."" The society's president, Mark Rubinstein, told CNN on Friday there had been no warning of any problem with the Apollo's ceiling. ""It was a freak, unusual accident -- we have no idea what caused it,"" he said. ""Obviously our sympathies are with anyone who was injured or affected by it."" Rubinstein said he did not anticipate the incident would affect London's ""booming"" theater business. ""I don't expect it's going to change anything,"" he said. ""All of the other theaters are open tonight. We are expecting business as usual. It's the holiday season, it's a very busy time of year and we expect our theaters to be full."" London Mayor Boris Johnson had a similar message. ""Whilst this was a serious incident, London's world renowned theatreland is open for business, and thousands of theatregoers will rightly be out and about tonight and over the weekend,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" which was adapted for the stage from the 2003 mystery novel by British writer Mark Haddon, is about a 15-year-old boy's investigation into the death of a neighborhood dog. Haddon tweeted Thursday night of his relief that the situation was no worse. ""It's been horrifying sitting here watching what has been happening at the apollo this evening. I'm hugely relieved that no-one has died,"" he said. Performances of the play were canceled through Saturday, the Society of London Theatre said. It was not clear what would happen for future shows. Nimax Theatres, which owns the Apollo, is ""working closely with the relevant authorities to establish exactly what happened,"" the society said. CNN's Nic Robertson reported in London; Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London and Tom Watkins in Atlanta.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The health of Ariel Sharon -- a highly decorated if controversial Israeli military figure whose time as prime minister was ground to a halt by an incapacitating stroke -- has taken a turn for the worse, a hospital spokeswoman said Wednesday. The 85-year-old's life is in danger as he battles serious kidney problems, Israeli media -- including state radio -- reported, citing ""sources."" Sharon's medical condition has worsened ""in the last few days,"" according to Sheba Medical Center spokeswoman Amir Maron. Sharon has been in a coma since January 2006, when he suffered a major stroke that led doctors to put him under anesthesia and on a respirator. His family planned to meet at the Israeli hospital Saturday to mark the eighth anniversary of his hospitalization, reported Israel's Channel 10 TV, a CNN affiliate. Born in 1928 in Kfar Malal -- a community that would later become part of Israel -- Sharon began working with the Haganah, a militant group advocating for Israel's independence, after graduating from high school in 1945. After a year of studies at Hebrew University, he began his rise through the Israeli military ranks in 1953, including helping establish an elite commando unit and various promotions up to the army's major general. He held this rank during 1967's Six-Day War, which ended with Israel notably, if controversially, expanding its territory. Sharon went on to play major roles in subsequent Israeli military conflicts as well, including as head of the Army's Armored Reserve Division during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He then began segueing into government, including stints as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's military adviser, agriculture minister and defense minister from August 1981 to February 1983. His actions in this last post led many in the Arab world to label him the ""Butcher of Beirut."" Sharon orchestrated Israel's invasion of Lebanon, an effort aimed at Palestine Liberation Organization fighters that also left hundreds of Lebanese civilians dead. An official Israeli inquiry found Sharon indirectly responsible for the September 1982 killings of as many as 2,000 Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside of Beirut, Lebanon. The report -- which led to Sharon's prompt resignation -- determined the then-defense minister did nothing to stop Christian militiamen allied with Israel from entering the camps, despite fears they might seek to avenge the killing of their leader the previous day. Sharon did not stay out of the spotlight for long, with his adviser Ranaan Gissin saying ""he felt betrayed by his government."" He sued Time for a magazine article implying that he had foreknowledge and a greater role in this massacre, with a jury later finding the U.S.-based publisher guilty of defamation but not of malice. Sharon went on to hold a several other Cabinet posts from 1984 to 2001, when he won a special election to become prime minister. By then, as head of the Likud party, Sharon was considered a hawk. And early on, he took the offensive by sending tanks and troops into Palestinian territory and ordering the assassination of militant leaders. But Sharon also took steps toward peace, such as agreeing with PLO leader Yasser Arafat on a timeline to halt Israeli-Palestinian violence and resume peace talks -- only to have this effort undermined by his own party, which backed a resolution to never allow the creation of a Palestinian state. Sharon later participated in talks with regional and world powers to discuss a ""road map"" for Middle East peace. Immediately after he fell ill in early 2006, his power was transferred to Vice Premier Ehud Olmert. Surgeons removed 20 inches of his intestine the following month and, that April, Israel's Cabinet formally ended his run as prime minister after declaring him permanently incapacitated. The former prime minister's health has fluctuated during the time he has been in the coma. In January 2013, doctors said testing on Sharon indicated some brain activity when he was shown photos of his home and heard his son's voice.

"(CNN) -- Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador Monday to voice its anger at allegations that Australia tried to listen into the phone calls of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Greg Moriarty. Australia's ambassador to Indonesia, ""took careful note of the issues raised and will report back to the Australian Government,"" the Australian embassy in Jakarta said. Indonesia's objections stem from reports in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Guardian Australia that said Australian intelligence tracked Yudhoyono's mobile phone for 15 days in August 2009, monitoring the calls he made and received. The intelligence agency also tried to listen in on what was said on at least one occasion. But the call was less than a minute long and could not be successfully tapped, ABC reported. The two media outlets cited documents provided by Edward Snowden, the U.S. national security contractor turned leaker. ""The Australian Government urgently needs to clarify on this news, to avoid further damage,"" Indonesian presidential spokesman Teuku Faizasyah tweeted. ""The damage has been done and now trust must be rebuilt,"" he said in another tweet. Asked in parliament to comment on the reports, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, ""all governments gather information and all governments know that every other government gathers information.""

"(CNN) -- It lit up the world and showed us all our way. It served presidents, princes, and paupers with equal alacrity. It brought the writings of Yeats, Joyce, Rowling, and Trudeau to millions of bed-readers, and helped countless people around the world avoid stubbing their toes in the dark. And now, it is no more. Farewell, traditional light bulb. As the clock strikes midnight, the light dims on your reign as the mechanical illuminator of human existence. Rest in peace. This was no sudden death. The diagnosis came in years ago, in 2007, when President George W. Bush signed a law to replace standard incandescents with more efficient bulbs. Much more. Only about 10% of the energy these traditional bulbs use is for light, the Environmental Protection Agency says. Seventy-five- and 100-watt bulbs were already banned this year. The ban on production of 40 and 60-watt bulbs -- the most popular in the country -- kicks in as 2014 begins. ""There are 4 billion light bulb sockets in the U.S. and more than 3 billion of them still use the standard incandescent technology that hasn't changed much in 125 years,"" the EPA says. ""A standard incandescent is only 10% efficient -- the other 90% of the electricity it uses is lost as heat."" It's the dawn of a new day. Taking over the limelight now: halogen bulbs, compact fluorescent bulbs, LED bulbs and high efficiency incandescents. While CNNMoney has covered the business behind all this, as well as the battle over whether it's a sign of too much government meddling, on this New Year's Eve, we're left with the sad sense of saying goodbye to you, sweet standard -- but also the knowledge that your legacy will irradiate our world, brighter than ever. Born in 1803 or later, depending on how you measure it, you, in all your transformational beauty, were raised by more parents than we could name -- Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, William Sawyer, Albon Man, Joseph Swan, and, of course, Thomas Edison, the Energy Department notes. While, unlike President Barack Obama, you have no birth certificate, we will always treasure Edison's patent of you from January 27, 1880. And we find solace in knowing that he just might be glad to see you exit gracefully, making way for the next generation. ""Thomas Edison was a patriot, he was a futurist, and he was green. Edison's concern after the turn of the last century was with pollution and nonrenewable resources, not with freezing technological change at the level of 1879,"" David Edward Edison Sloane, Thomas Edison's great grandson, wrote for CNN.com under the headline, ""Edison would've loved new light bulb law."" Still, some aren't quite as ready to let go. And, in a way, they won't have to. As with all laws, there are some loopholes. Three-way standard incandescent light bulbs will still be made. Yes, we live in an era of space stations, blazing fast computers, and access to just about any piece of information we need. But no one can take away the glory of that click-click-click you give us in our hotel-room lamps. So, for those who just can't quit you yet, some enterprising shop owners have a plan. ""Any regular lamp, you can change it from an on-and-off to a three-way, and we do it for our customers here,"" Doug Satterfield, owner of Rollier's Hardware in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, told CNN affiliate KDKA. But in the not-so-long run, we know, your gleaming presence in our lives is fading. Today's children won't know you as previous generations did. At CNNMoney.com, a commenter calling himself Mudbone Willie posted his concern -- and received hundreds of ""upvotes"" for it. ""Great. I do all of my baking in a small oven that uses a light bulb at its heat source. Now what?"" Worry not, Mudbone Willie. The Easy-Bake oven has changed with the times. ""No more light bulbs needed!"" Hasbro says in its ad for the Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven. As greenbiz.com reported, Hasbro revised its classic in response to the new law. The new lights taking over our lives will surely bring joy and less wasted energy -- perhaps a beautiful new beginning. Still, on two of life's most pressing questions, we remain in the dark: . What will happen when a cartoon character gets a great idea? On this, Fortuna Lee offers some suggestions. And, finally, how many psychiatrists/lawyers/programmers/med students/economists/surrealists will it now take to change a light bulb? Oh, there are new ones that look the same? Problems solved. Here's to you, standard incandescent light bulb. May the fireworks that light up the skies this evening give you the blazing sendoff you deserve.","Standard incandescent light bulbs will no longer be manufactured .

"(CNN) -- James Avery was a prolific and versatile actor during his 68 years, but he's best known to several as Uncle Phil. A classically trained thespian, Avery filled the role of the tough but caring head of the Banks' household on the '90s sitcom ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" for six years. Along the way, he crafted a character that stands apart as one of the greatest fictional dads on TV. His costar Joseph Marcell, who portrayed the family butler Geoffrey, had it right when he said that Avery ""strove to present an Uncle Phil that everybody wishes was their uncle."" As a result, his death this week has left a lot of fans feeling as though they've lost a family member. Every ""Fresh Prince"" fan probably has his or her own reasons why Uncle Phil was at the heart of the memorable comedy. Here are our top five: . 1. He was there for you in a jam. In case you missed ""Fresh Prince"" during its run from 1990 to 1996, or somehow have escaped the endless repeats on basic cable in the years since, here's a recap of the premise: Now-famous blockbuster actor Will Smith portrayed a mischievous Philadelphia teen who was sent to live with his rich relatives in Bel-Air. Cue the culture clash as free-spirited Will had to adjust to his Uncle Phil's rigorous rules. Most of the humor came from that dynamic, but when Will -- and, often, Phil's son Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) -- really needed him, he didn't hesitate to help them out. That was established clearly with an episode in season one, when Phil came to Will's rescue at a pool hall after the kid lost money and a car to a hustler. 2. Underneath his grizzly exterior was a sensitive role model. Although Uncle Phil and Will had their fights, the lawyer and eventual judge became a father figure for Smith's character. This was shown in one heartbreaking season four episode, when Will's biological father re-enters the picture only to leave his son once again. A distraught Will turned to his uncle, who readily embraced him. No matter how many times we watch this, we always get misty. 3. He was not a man to be trifled with. Every so often we saw glimpses of Uncle Phil's soft side, but it was his stern parenting style that always left us in stitches. Take, for example, the way he handled one of Carlton and Will's failed schemes in season two: . Or how he completely shut down this guy's attempt to smoke in an elevator ... and then took his phone: . And how could we forget his confrontation at a police station in season one? 4. He had a go-to move for kicking people out of his house. Whenever you saw Will Smith's real-life friend and recording partner DJ Jazzy Jeff on-screen in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" you knew he wasn't going to be around for long. The running gag on the sitcom was that Jazzy Jeff's character, Jazz, was always getting thrown out of Uncle Phil's mansion. It happened so often it became a patented move. 5. He could bust a move when he wanted to. Uncle Phil was constantly getting ribbed by his family -- and especially Will -- about his weight, but the regal patriarch wasn't without a sense of humor. Will brought it out of him with this classic dance scene from season five.","James Avery played the beloved Uncle Phil on the '90s comedy ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air""

"(WIRED)  -- AT&T broadband users will soon face a cap on the amount of internet data they can download a month. Traditional DSL users will be capped at 150 GB per month, while subscribers to the fiber-backed UVerse system have a 250-GB limit. Usage over that will be charged at $10/month for 50 GB, the company says. The company says that currently only a small percentage of users -- around 2% -- use this much data a month. If that's the case, it's not clear why the company is bothering to install the caps. It is, however, the same rationale (and the same usage stat) that the company relied upon to explain why it would be capping iPhone data plans last summer, which had hitherto been ""unlimited."" WIRED: Congressman wants to ban download caps . DSL and UVerse connect fairly directly to a hub -- unlike cable connections where users share a local loop that can become congested. Bulk-bandwidth costs for an ISP are a tiny portion of its business costs, and those prices continue to fall even as users consume more and more data. So, how could a user end up hitting these caps? Streaming video such as HD movies from Netflix, using bittorrent to download movies and heavy gaming with services like Steam can easily eat up lots of data, especially in households with multiple heavy internet users. AT&T isn't the first large broadband provider to impose caps. Comcast imposed a 250-GB cap shortly after the company was caught throttling bittorrent downloads. Time Warner Cable tried going further with trials of a service that imposed very low limits for users, which led to a furor among users and lawmakers. There's little data to demonstrate whether large ISPs actually are experiencing real issues with congestion. Skeptics see the limits as ways to discourage cable video customers from ""cutting the cord"" and getting their video online, or as a way to pocket profits instead of re-investing in bulking up their infrastructure. Derek Turner, the research director for the net neutrality advocacy group Free Press says the limits will discourage online innovation, and that with the growth curve of internet usage, the limits will soon catch many internet user. ""When ISPs force their customers to watch the meter, experimentation, innovation and business will suffer,"" Turner said. ""AT&T's actions are another troubling symptom of a broadband market that lacks meaningful competition, and this move may be the start of a race to the bottom among other providers to see who can squeeze its customers the most. At worst, this is a plan designed to discourage cord-cutting and pad profits; at best, this is another example of an antiquated phone-company business model being forced onto an otherwise vibrant and limitless marketplace.""

"(CNN) -- A Cleveland man will spend the rest of his life in prison for the killings of two women in the 1990s, cases that were reinvestigated after the discovery of three women held captive nearby for years by Ariel Castro. Elias Acevedo Sr., 49, pleaded guilty Monday to 297 counts, including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping, said Timothy McGinty, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor. CNN affiliate WEWS reported the charges included the two slayings, the 1993 rape of his sister-in-law and the sexual assault of three children. Acevedo cried as victims gave statement and later said he wished he could ""change everything that happened,"" the station reported. ""I'm not a monster,"" he said. The plea recommendation was accepted by a Cuyahoga Common Pleas judge, a written statement from McGinty's office said. Acevedo received two consecutive sentences of 20 years to life and 405 years for the rape and other charges. In October, the FBI's Violent Crime Task Force -- which was looking into other suspected abductions in Cleveland after Castro was arrested -- linked Acevedo to the slaying of Christina Adkins, who disappeared in 1995 at age 18. Remains believed to be those of Adkins were found in October in a utility vault near the intersection of interstates 71, 90 and 490, authorities said. Acevedo was indicted earlier this year in the 1993 rape, which occurred near where Pamela Pemberton's body was found the next year. As part of Monday's plea, Acevedo admitted to strangling the 30-year-old woman on October, 24, 1994, and leaving her body in a vacant lot. Acevedo was arrested earlier this year in the same neighborhood where authorities found Amanda Berry, Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus and Michelle Knight in May at Castro's two-story home. Castro, who pleaded guilty to 937 counts, was found hanged with a bedsheet in his jail cell on September 3. CNN's Kevin Conlon and Chelsea J.

According to TorrentFreak's annual list, the first film in their trilogy was downloaded well over eight million times in 2013, making it the year's most pirated movie. It wasn't, however, a runaway victory. ""An Unexpected Journey"" was followed closely by ""Django Unchained,"" which has an estimated download count of 8.1 million â just 300,000 fewer than ""The Hobbit,"" even though ""The Hobbit's"" worldwide box office take was more than twice what Django made. Two blockbuster sequels â ""Fast and Furious 6"" and ""Iron Man 3"" â plus a surprisingly high-performing Oscar nominee (""Silver Linings Playbook"") round out the top 5. But as TorrentFreak notes, the list also holds a few surprises: Though one Jennifer Lawrence film made the list, another, much bigger one â ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" â didn't. (Maybe we can blame this on Catching Fire's November release date.) High grossers like ""Man of Steel"" and ""Gravity"" are absent as well, though ""Gangster Squad,"" with its modest worldwide gross of $105,200,903, somehow eked out the number 7 spot. Still not as weird as last year, when ""Project X"" somehow reigned as the list's top movie. See below for the full top 10. Note, though, that there's no way to draw data from online streaming and cyberlocker download sources â which means that total piracy numbers are probably significantly higher than these. 1.

"(CNN) -- A kung fu legend, a cha cha champion, a record-breaking filmmaker and a poet. Not one of the world's most random dinner party assemblies, but a single man who became an icon. Bruce Lee was all of those things and a new exhibition in Hong Kong, where Lee spent his childhood and became a martial arts film star, is being launched to celebrate the man and commemorate the 40th anniversary of his death. ""Bruce Lee: Kung Fu. Art. Life"" will open in the Hong Kong Heritage Museum on July 20, exactly 40 years after his death. It will run for five years. Lee died on July 20, 1973, at 32, after suffering a reaction to pain medication, according to the Bruce Lee Foundation. Martial arts actor Jim Kelly, best known for 'Enter the Dragon,' dies . The exhibition gathers more than 600 items related to Lee from collectors and various institutions, including more than 400 from the Bruce Lee Foundation -- the largest number of artifacts the foundation has ever lent out. Among the exhibits are his iconic yellow tracksuit, footage from Lee's eight classic films (including ""The Big Boss,"" ""Fists of Fury,"" ""The Way of the Dragon,"" ""Enter the Dragon"" and ""Game of Death""), the first American magazine cover featuring Lee and the notebook he kept featuring 108 different cha cha dance steps. Lee won Hong Kong's Cha Cha Championship in 1958. The exhibition will recreate scenes from Lee's movies, his gym and his study, and will also house a special collector series showcasing various items from around the world. The first collection features more than 100 items from U.S. collector Perry Lee, related to the TV series ""The Green Hornet,"" in which Lee starred as Kato. Silver Cheung, a local film art director, will be the art director for the exhibition. The Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers has produced a 75-minute documentary, ""The Brilliant Life of Bruce Lee,"" which will be screened in the museum. Sculptor Chu Tat-shing has created a new 3.5-meter side-kicking statue of Lee and animation artist Shannon Ma will present a 3D hologram animation of Lee's nunchaku moves and kicks. The exhibition will run alongside other Bruce Lee programs organized by the museum, the first of which is themed, ""The Bruce Lee that Hong Kong knew."" Shannon Lee, Bruce Lee's daughter, will start the program with a gallery talk. Reservations, online or at the door, are required.

"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic may have cost Paris Saint-Germain $30 million, but you can get your own chunk of the Swedish striker for just $41. A French restaurateur has unveiled ""Le Zlatan"", a monstrous 600 gram burger served up in homage to the moody PSG star. While the real life Ibrahimovic can boast eight league titles in four different countries, his meaty equivalent is a mixture of minced beef and onions, bacon and three types of cheeses. The stomach-busting meal is the brainchild of Jean-Philippe Grandin, manager of Doddy's Cafe in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris and an ardent PSG fan. ""We have a lot of homemade burgers on the menu, but I wanted to invent an extraordinary burger,"" Grandin told CNN. ""I am a supporter of Paris Saint-Germain and at the restaurant we show all of the PSG matches."" Coming inside a chunky custom-made bun, ""Le Zlatan"" stands head and shoulders above the regular burgers on the menu, weighing in at over one kilogram, including 250 grams of bread and 300 grams of cheese. Grandin says this reflects the supremacy of Sweden international Ibrahimovic, who has also played for Ajax, Inter Milan and Barcelona during a glittering career, over every player in Ligue 1. ""In our league we have an extraordinary player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic,"" added Grandin. ""Zlatan is an amazing player, he is the biggest player in the French league."" And an extraordinary player deserves an extraordinary burger, which is pitched as a meal for two diners or a culinary Everest for one hardy, and hungry, soul. With Ibrahimovic -- who scored 30 league goals during his first season with PSG -- extending his contract at the Parc des Princes until 2016, Grandin has no intention of immortalizing any other footballers in meat anytime soon. ""For the moment nobody can match him,"" he concluded. ""There is just one extraordinary player, so I cannot make another extraordinary burger.""","A Paris cafe manager has dedicated a burger to Zlatan Ibrahimovic .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid plans a first vote Tuesday morning toward renewing unemployment benefits for about 1.3 million Americans who lost them when they expired at the end of December. Democrats and President Barack Obama support the extension -- which had been scheduled for a vote Monday evening but Reid delayed the vote until Tuesday -- while Republicans generally oppose extending those benefits. And with Democrats in control of the Senate and Republicans having a majority in the House, the issue doesn't seem to be one that will be easy to resolve. 1. The check's not in the mail . Roughly 1.3 million long-term unemployed were affected when Congress failed to continue a 2008 recession-era federal law providing nearly a year of benefits, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. As Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union."" ""(Monday) is actually the day that 1.3 million Americans will go to the mailbox and find that check missing, the check that they rely on to put food on their table."" 2. New year, old fight . Expect a repeat performance of years past when Democrats and Republicans clashed in often dramatic showdowns rife with fiery rhetoric and lengthy filibusters. Democrats argue the program is needed to sustain economic recovery and offer a lifeline to those struggling to keep their head above water financially. Republicans counter the benefits are an economic drain and a disincentive to looking for work. The Congressional Budget Office estimates continuing them for another year will cost about $26 billion. Republican leaders say they would consider extending the benefits but insist that the $26 billion comes from making cuts elsewhere. Reid said Sunday that the government normally doesn't have to make ""offsets"" for emergency funding like these benefits and called the Republican demands ""foolishness."" Hillary Clinton encourages extending benefits for jobless . 3. Politics at play . The legislative fights will take place against the backdrop of a midterm election year. Democrats are refocusing on issues relating to economic inequality, which is important to their base. Many Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, have long insisted that the Great Recession-era extension of emergency federal benefits deter job-hunting and are unnecessary as the economy rebounds and unemployment declines. ""When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you're causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy,"" Paul said on Fox News last month. ""And it really -- while it seems good, it actually does a disservice to the people you're trying to help."" CNNMoney: Job search: One year and counting . 4. White House wades into the fray . The message from the White House on this issue: Bring it on! In his weekly address over the weekend, President Barack Obama blasted Republicans in Congress who ""went home for the holidays and let that lifeline expire."" ""That's my New Year's resolution -- to do everything I can, every single day, to help make 2014 a year in which more of our citizens can earn their own piece of the American Dream,"" Obama said in his address. 5. The honeymoon's over . The tone set by this first political showdown could foreshadow the tenor of future fights over funding the federal government, raising the debt ceiling, efforts to try and repeal or roll back portions of the President's signature health care law and the long-postponed fight over immigration reform. CNN's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.","Congress kicks off new year with fight over extending jobless benefits .

"(CNN) -- The Irish born actor Peter O'Toole, who has died aged 81, led a life that was rich in drama and eccentricity. He was nominated for an Oscar a record eight times and never won. The sheer bloodymindedness with which he then rejected an honorary Academy Award in 2003 was characteristic of a man who juggled triumph and disaster with panache. O'Toole wrote to the Academy: ""I am still in the game and might win the lovely bugger outright. Would the Academy please defer the honor until I am 80?"" He was persuaded to accept only when told that the likes of Paul Newman and Henry Fonda had subsequently won the real thing. When receiving the award from Meryl Streep at the ceremony he quipped: ""Always the bridesmaid, never a bride my foot!"" It was the same unconventional streak that led to his refusal of a knighthood in 1987 and lent him a dangerous edge, which was also rather glamorous. He was a fantastic showman whose versatility was phenomenal. Read more: 'Giant of film and theater' dies at 81 . O'Toole will always be remembered for his brilliant, many-faceted depiction of T.E. Lawrence in David Lean's classic 1962 film ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" where he portrayed one of the most extraordinary human beings of the 20th century with amazing skill. O'Toole's physical beauty in the role, with his memorably penetrating blue eyes, was remarkable and created an indelible image forever associated with the actor. This role was deeply complex as he conveyed Lawrence's courage, vision and genius as well as the more disturbing aspects of his personality, his blood lust, sadomasochism and flamboyance. His abilities here were also mirrored elsewhere in a career which reached dizzying heights, fell to desperate lows and which spanned over five decades. In uniform Lawrence was comically ill at ease, and it remains ironic that O'Toole's excellent performance as the ramrod stiff Guards officer in ""The Day They Robbed the Bank of England"" was pivotal in Lean's choice of him for the role. Robert Bolt's superlatively succinct dialogue in ""Lawrence"" also contained much humor. O'Toole excelled in humorous roles in star vehicles such as ""How to Steal a Million,"" or playing a veteran actor who lusts after a friend's young grandniece in ""Venus,"" his last Oscar-nominated film. His performance as the gentle, much-loved schoolteacher Mr Chipping opposite Petula Clark in the musical version of ""Goodbye Mr Chips"" was a revelation, and he also showed sensitivity as the kindly royal tutor in ""The Last Emperor."" 'Worst Shakespeare production of century' In ""Lawrence of Arabia"" the character of Lawrence suffers in an endless search for his identity and O'Toole used his expressive face in this and several other angst-ridden roles with varying effect. He was unfairly criticized for his portrayal of the eponymous hero in ""Lord Jim,"" hammed it up somewhat as a psychopathic German officer in ""Night of the Generals"" and, as the tormented Henry II opposite Richard Burton in ""Becket,"" he was extremely moving in a superbly-cast film that received critical acclaim. O'Toole also played Henry II in ""The Lion in Winter,"" the film adaptation of a lively play about the king's dysfunctional marital life, which allowed him to carry off a rip-roaring role with zest opposite Katharine Hepburn. Read more: Five of Peter O'Toole's best . The role of Henry II saw him become one of only five performers to be nominated for an Oscar twice for playing the same character. O'Toole also possessed a highly distinctive voice which could convey a great variety of moods with seemingly effortless skill. He could, however, overact badly. In ""The Ruling Class"" he played a mad aristocrat in a ridiculous role, though it too was Oscar nominated, and he was wasted as King Priam in the dreadful epic ""Troy."" Playing Tiberius in Bob Guccione's grotesque ""Caligula"" was no career highlight either. But he had no shortage of success. His Oscar-nominated roles in ""The Stunt Man"" -- where he admitted basing his portrayal of a martinet of a director on his experiences with David Lean making Lawrence -- and in ""My Favorite Year,"" where he played an alcoholic actor past his prime, were very highly regarded. Along with the others in the first night audience at the Old Vic I roared with shocked laughter at his ""Macbeth"" in 1980. The evening was a bizarre farce which was considered the worst Shakespeare production of the century. It was on the same stage years later that he triumphed with his wondrously comic portrayal of the loveable but alcohol-soaked Soho writer in ""Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell,"" which showed glorious comic timing. I particularly remember the roars of mirth when he carried off the celebrated ""egg trick."" Undoubtedly a hellraiser . O'Toole had a highly distinguished theatrical career that included a controversial uncut ""Hamlet"" directed by Olivier to launch the National Theatre Company in 1963 and a much praised Professor Higgins in ""Pygmalion"" in 1984. He was also undoubtedly a hell-raiser in the same mold as Richard Burton and Richard Harris and stories about his heavy drinking were legendary. Debonair in appearance -- with his trademark cigarette holder -- O'Toole had a zest for life that would have been difficult to surpass, a considerable fondness for women, and was also a fine raconteur, as I discovered on meeting him. Despite advancing age, the standard of most of his performances remained high but undoubtedly had he chosen a more conventional lifestyle his achievements would have been even more substantial. But it was in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" that O'Toole was at his greatest. The film, regarded by many critics as one of the finest ever made, captured the essence of a legend and it was the highlight of the career of Peter O'Toole, a truly wayward genius. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Fitzwilliams.","Irish-born screen and stage actor Peter O'Toole died Sunday at the age of 81 .

"(CNN) -- Ole Gunnar Solskjaer rescued Manchester United in 1999 to help the club win the Champions League, and he has now been charged with the task of saving Cardiff City from relegation into English football's second tier. The 40-year-old Norwegian famously came off the substitutes' bench for United in Barcelona to score the winner in stoppage time, giving them a 2-1 victory against Bayern Munich -- a win that wrapped up the Treble for Alex Ferguson's men. Cardiff's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan will be hoping Solskjaer, who has been given a 12-month rolling contract, can work similar magic for the struggling Welsh side after appointing the former Molde boss as Malky Mackay's successor on Thursday. Cardiff, who lost 2-0 to Arsenal on Wednesday, currently sit one point and one place above the English Premier League relegation zone. Solskjaer, who attended the match at the Emirates Stadium alongside Tan, promised the Cardiff fans a positive brand of football. ""I'm really looking forward to the challenge ahead. I'm going to bring my energy and enthusiasm to the club,"" he told reporters. ""I'm a very positive manager. I want to play a good style of football and yesterday [against Arsenal] we showed what a threat we can be."" Solskjaer added: ""It's a fantastic challenge for me. Cardiff are ready to take the next step up, I hope I can help them. I've always dreamed of being a manager in the Premier League and I'm delighted to get the opportunity."" Although he has no prior managerial experience in England, having only previously taken charge of Molde, Solskjaer did have a spell coaching United's reserves shortly after hanging up his boots. The 40-year-old is set to make a return to Old Trafford -- where he spent 11 years as a player -- when Cardiff face United on January 28. Solskjaer's side also face a trip to Manchester City 10 days before that, while his first game in charge sees Cardiff visit Newcastle on Saturday in the FA Cup third round. The FA Cup is England's second major competition. ""We've got some of the toughest trips in world football coming up this month. They're games we'll relish and look forward to,"" Solskjaer said. ""We want to push this club forward and up the Premier League. The quality of the staff and players is high here."" Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman was given the task of recruiting a new manager after Tan decided to sack Mackay last month. ""There was only one name in my head from the very beginning. We're delighted to welcome Ole to Cardiff,"" Dalman told reporters. ""I've seen Ole play for many, many years. I like his style of football and his ideas on the game. He is an extremely good communicator. Common sense, pragmatic discussions and trust were the key in bringing Ole here.""","Cardiff appoints Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as its new manager .

"Sao Paulo (CNN) -- Paulo Henrique Machado shares pictures of some of his most cherished memories: the first time he saw the beach, a Formula One race and a party from his childhood when all his friends dressed as clowns. And yet he has lived the last 43 years -- almost his entire life -- in Brazil's biggest hospital. As an infant, he contracted polio and was left paralyzed from the waist down. He breathes with the help of a respirator. It was the 1970s, before vaccines eradicated polio in Brazil, and Machado was sent to live in the polio ward with eight other children. ""It was a wonderful time. I'll never forget it,"" he said during a recent interview from his hospital bed. ""Even though most of our friends are no longer with us, I never stopped dreaming about them."" His mother died two days after he was born and the rest of Machado's family soon stopped visiting. He points to a black and white picture of a boy in a pointy hat and clown makeup curled up in a wheelchair. ""That's Pedro,"" he says. ""Back then, it was him and me, we were very close. He was my friend."" Over the years many of the children died, including Pedro. ""It was December 26, the day after Christmas,"" he says. ""Everything that I planned with my friend, life didn't have the same meaning. But it made me stronger."" The children were given little chance of surviving past the age of 10, but two people did: Machado and his lifelong friend and roommate Eliana Zagui. They still live together in a room tucked inside the Intensive Care Unit of Sao Paulo's Clinicas Hospital. ""We're like brother and sister and we look after each other,"" Machado says. Zagui suffered paralysis caused by polio when she was a baby. She has lived in the hospital for 38 years. ""I've been here since I was 1 year and 9 months old,"" she tells us. ""I learned to write, to paint, to use a cell phone, a computer, things I like."" They were both encouraged to push beyond their physical limitations. More polio cases confirmed in Syria, WHO says . Zagui recently wrote a book about her experience growing up in the hospital. She also discovered painting, patiently dabbing at the canvas with a brush taped to a tongue depressor. The wear and tear on her teeth meant she had to limit herself but she hasn't stopped. Machado trained as a computer animator and wrote a screenplay for an animated series. With the help of crowd-funding and a group of animators, the series is coming to life. ""They're inspirational,"" says Dr. Nuno Da Silva, a physician who has worked in the ICU since 1988. He says that when they have patients who have been paralyzed in car accidents they take them to spend some time with Machado and Zagui. ""They're examples to show it isn't the end of the world,"" he says. Still, they both wish they could visit, or even live, in the outside world. ""When I turned 10, the hospital tried to convince my relatives to take me in,"" says Machado. ""But that's not what happened. So we stayed here."" Machado's biggest passions are movies and videogames, opportunities to escape his own world. ""I like to live outside my reality,"" he says. ""To get out of reality I play games, because in the games I can go where I want without suffering any pain."" There was a decade of freedom when Machado used an electric wheelchair to come and go with relative ease. But then post-polio syndrome set in, causing gradual weakening in muscles that were affected by the original infection. It became impossible for him to straighten his legs enough to sit in a wheelchair -- so travel is now only done lying down in hospital beds. But that hasn't stopped him. On one of our visits he invites us to join him on an outing to a big videogame convention. Moving around is complicated -- he travels in an ambulance with medical technicians paid for by donations. Another complication: the respirator. Machado doesn't need it 24 hours, but he feels more secure,having it just in case. But once inside the videogame convention, we enter Machado's world. He laughs with excitement as a group of medical technicians and friends roll him around on a mobile hospital bed. Then he tries his hand at a few games. ""You don't pay attention to anything else around you,"" he says. ""It's great, you just want to discover more."" For a day, at least, the tubes, the respirator, the hospital bed, they all fade into the background, and Machado becomes invincible.","Paulo Henrique Machado has lived most his 43 years in a Sao Paulo hospital bed .

"(CNN) -- After days of intense backlash from users over changes to its terms of service and privacy policy, photo-sharing service Instagram has backtracked. On Thursday, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom said the company was switching one section of its updated terms of service back to its original text. ""Because of the feedback we have heard from you, we are reverting this advertising section to the original version that has been in effect since we launched the service in October 2010,"" said Systrom in a post announcing the change. On Monday, the Facebook-owned app updated its terms of service to say companies could pay Instagram to use members' images in ads without compensating the photographers. Instagram claimed the update was to allow the company to experiment with possible future advertising options, and was not part of any current plan to sell images. ""Going forward, rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed, we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work,"" Systrom said in Thursday's post. Opinion: Instagram users should wise up . It is not a complete reversal. Many of the other changes to the terms of service and privacy policy remain. The company still needs to work on ways to integrate ads into its free service, but for now it will tinker behind the scenes instead of prematurely sending users into a panic over the possibility that their likeness could show up in advertisements on the network. The old advertising section that has been reinstated still says the company can place ads on the service and that ""the manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you,"" leaving the company with some wiggle room for future changes. This announcement comes two days after another mea culpa post by Systrom, in which he apologized for the confusion and reassured Instagram users that they still owned their images and that the company was hearing the feedback loud and clear. The severity of users' reactions to the change seemed to catch Instagram off guard, though the cycle of a policy change announcement followed by user backlash and then an apology is familiar territory for its parent company, Facebook.","Instagram has reverted part of its terms of service in response to user backlash .

"(CNN) -- A worker operating a machine in a family workshop in China accidentally cut off his hand -- which doctors were able to save by grafting it onto his lower calf. The worker, Xie Wei, said he was initially unsure if his right hand could be saved, but he thought it was worth a try. The hand went without a blood supply for many hours while Xie searched for a hospital that could perform such a surgery. Xie said that he went to local hospitals near the factory first, but he said they told him they ""did not have the skills to help."" Eventually he found a hospital about two hours away where doctors believed they could do it. Xie kept his hand in a plastic bag at first, then stored it in a cooler of ice. In total, it took about seven hours to get to a doctor who could help. The doctor, Dr. Tang Juyu, is a specialist in difficult tissue and wound repair cases. Before Xie went into the operation, Tang told him he was optimistic and predicted he would regain the use of his hand, according to Xie. Tang decided the best way to save the hand was to attach it to Xie's calf where there was a good blood supply. The hand would need to stay there until Xie's arm could fully heal. Tang believes there have been about 20 such cases in all of China and all of them have been successful. There is no data, as only case studies have been performed. Tang said in a similar operation in 2004, he grafted a hand onto a patient's belly. That operation was a success. When Xie woke up from the operation he said he was surprised to find his hand on his calf. He says his first reaction at the time was to think it was ""unbelievable"" and ""weird."" The hand itself felt warm, he said, but it was numb since no nerves were connected and only blood vessels were attached. His leg felt no different, he said, but was ""heavier than usual."" After about a month his arm was better healed, and he had another surgery where his hand was reattached. Tang says this second stage of the operation is actually more challenging, but everything went smoothly. Xie has recovered without complications and has been discharged. He is currently resting at home. He said he can twist his wrist to a certain degree, but doesn't have full movement with his fingers, at least not yet. Doctors told him a full recovery for the nerves in his hand should take about six months. Xie said he isn't sure what his future may bring. Today he is concentrating on recovering fully. The factory did pay for his operation, which cost about 300,000 Chinese yuan, or about $49,400. Most of all, Xie said, he is thankful to doctors for ""living up to their promise"" that they would be able to reattach his hand and make it functional again. CNN's April Ma and Susan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.","Man cut off hand at work and searched for a surgeon for 7 hours .

"(CNN) -- Former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky has applied for a Swiss visa, less than a week after his pardon and release from a Russian prison, authorities said Wednesday. Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan von Below confirmed to CNN that Khodorkovsky -- who had been jailed since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud -- submitted a request for a three-month Schengen visa at the Swiss Embassy in Berlin on Christmas Eve. Von Below said Khodorkovsky's application most likely would be processed in the next couple of days. Schengen visas entitle citizens of the European Union the right to travel, work and live in any EU country without special formalities and enable their holders to move through participating countries without being subjected to border checks. Pavel Khodorkovsky said his father applied for a regular visa and there was no discussion of asylum for now. A spokesman for Khodorkovsky, Christian Hanne, told CNN the former oil tycoon's application for a Swiss visa did not mean he has made long-term plans to settle in Switzerland. Hanne said Khodorkovsky's twin sons attend school in Switzerland and their father hoped to see where they go to school. Russian courts will take a second look at cases against Khodorkovsky, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. The Supreme Court ordered the review Wednesday, citing the European Court of Human Rights criticism of the tax evasion and fraud case in July. It was not immediately clear what this meant legally for Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man. The latest developments in the Khodorkovsky case, which observers said harmed foreign investment because it smacked of political repression, come less than two months before the world focuses on Russia for the Sochi Olympics. At a time when Russia's international image has suffered from an anti-gay law that led to threats of protests and boycotts at the Olympics, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been dispensing ""get out of jail free"" cards. Observers said the moves are part of a public relations offensive by Putin, who has solidified his political dominance in Russia and now seeks to improve the country's image ahead of the Olympic Games, which begin February 7 in the Black Sea city of Sochi. On Monday, Putin introduced a new amnesty law allowing two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot to leave prison, two months before the end of their two-year sentences for a performance critical of the president. In addition, 30 Greenpeace demonstrators are to go free under the amnesty law passed by Russian lawmakers last week that could affect 25,000 prisoners. Greenpeace International reported on its website Wednesday that the 30 activists known as the Arctic 30 were scheduled to meet with the Russian government body prosecuting them and that the ""case against them is being dropped en masse."" ""They will then have one more hurdle -- securing exit visas in their passports -- before the non-Russians are free to leave the country and be reunited with their families,"" Greenpeace said on its website. ""A meeting with the Federal Migration Service is scheduled for later today. The Arctic 30 are expected to leave Russia in the coming days."" RIA Novosti reported Wednesday that the government had begun dropping cases against the Greenpeace activists who were arrested for a September protest at a Russian Arctic oil rig. In St. Petersburg, officials had formally dismissed charges against at least 16 of the activists. All 30 were expected to be cleared by the end of the day. ""Amnesty signed. Moonwalked out of the office of the Head of Investigative Committee,"" Greenpeace activist and Dutch citizen Faiza Oulahsen tweeted after receiving her pardon. ""Had to show off the dance moves I practiced in prison."" The so-called Arctic 30, charged initially with piracy but later with hooliganism, were released on bail in November after spending more than two months behind bars for protesting oil drilling in the environmentally sensitive Arctic region, RIA Novosti reported. But Russia's treatment of Khodorkovsky drew worldwide attention and criticism, with countries like the United States accusing it of ""selective prosecution"" and abuse of the legal system. He became both a political and economic threat to Putin by wanting to create a commercial oil pipeline that would break the government monopoly on the industry and by funding opposition politicians, according to observers. Khodorkovsky, who was due for release next year, wrote Putin a letter from prison that asked for early release because his mother was ailing. He insisted the letter contained no admission of guilt, and Putin said the pardon was on humanitarian grounds. Upon his release, Khodorkovsky left the country. He has said he won't continue his political activities against the Russian government.","NEW: Russian supreme court reportedly orders review of his past cases .

"(CNN) -- Singapore businessman Peter Lim has offered to purchase debt-ridden La Liga side Valencia, according to the club's president, Amadeo Salvo. Speaking at a specially convened press conference before Sunday's match with Real Madrid, Salvo said: ""Mr Lim has made an official offer to Bankia to buy the club. It is one of the two or three biggest transactions ever in the world of football."" The La Liga club revealed in August that its debts to Bankia, Spain's fourth largest bank, stood at $376 million. Salvo said Mr Lim has proposed that the purchase be completed by the middle of next month to allow the club time to spend money on players before the transfer window closes on January 31. The original plan was to close the deal in a week, Salvo suggested, but Bankia has requested a time frame of four to six weeks to consider more offers.

Mr Lim could not be contacted at time of publication. Lim, who made an unsuccessful bid to buy English Premier League club Liverpool in 2010, is worth more than $2 billion, according to Forbes.com. Exactly a decade ago, Valencia were at the halfway point of a season which saw them win both the La Liga title and the UEFA Cup. But the club has been mired in financial difficulties following Spain's economic crisis and currently lie 11th in La Liga with interim manager Nico Estevez in charge following the sacking of Miroslav Djukic earlier this month. Construction on the new 75,000-seat Mestalla Stadium was halted in 2009 and a host of star players, including David Villa, David Silva and Juan Mata, have been sold in recent seasons to help service huge debts. If 60-year-old Lim's bid is successful then he will join a growing list of foreign investors in La Liga and across other European leagues. Fellow La Liga outfit Malaga were bought for a reported $80 million by Qatar's Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Thani in 2010 with the Qatar Investment Authority buying a 70% share of Ligue 1's Paris St Germain in 2011.

"(CNN) -- As the stock market opened Friday with a ring of the bell by Mark Zuckerberg, all eyes were on Facebook -- the social media Megalodon he nursed from a dorm-room project to one of Wall Street's hottest prospects ever. Facebook, or ""FB"" as it's now known to investors, may have made amateur analysts on the Web go wild. But on the Nasdaq, it was a less exciting ride -- ending the day at a price pretty much exactly where it began. Friends may be priceless. But 'friending' both started and ended the day at just over $38 a share. Facebook's was the biggest opening ever for a tech company and the third-largest IPO in U.S. history, behind only Visa and General Motors. On the Web, reactions ran the gamut from deliriously hopeful to harshly negative for the social-media giant's Wall Street potential. ""A $104 billion market capitalization puts Facebook at more than 100 times its trailing earnings,"" wrote John Constine and Kim-Mai Cutler for technology blog TechCrunch. ""That's a big multiple to live up to, and it will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation."" And it wasn't just the pros weighing in. In fact, it seemed like everyone on the Internet had an opinion. Business Insider posted a poll (obviously not scientific) asking readers where they thought the $38 stock would be by the end of the day Friday. Early Friday, a pessimistic 15% said under $35. But the biggest cluster of respondents had guessed somewhere between $40 and 55. (15% said $40 to 45, another 13% said $45 to 50 and, yes, yet another 12% said $50-55). A hopeful 10% predicted the stock would skyrocket at otherworldly levels, winding up over $90 a share. Facebook's new billionaires . Results were similar on another site that sprung up, Facebook IPO Day Closing Price. Its graph showed the biggest number of predictions clustering around what ultimately would be an overly optimistic $50 mark. On rival network Twitter, many observers seemed to be rooting against Facebook and its early investors, finding a measure of glee in the fact that the price didn't skyrocket as some had predicted. ""Facebook stock has already started to tank,"" wrote user Jen Misty (yes, with a healthy dose of hyperbole). ""In my best Nelson voice from Simpsons -- ""HA! HA!"" There was this swipe at youthful startup culture from tweeter Ross Heart: ""Harder? Keeping $FB over 38 or trying to get hired at Facebook being over 38?"" And then there was this sports metaphor, which referenced a certain polarizing NBA star. ""Rooting against Facebook stock price > [is greater than] rooting against LeBron,"" wrote a user named Jay Kang. More sober-minded watchers, however, noted that on Wall Street, when an opening stock sticks close to where it started, it means it was probably priced correctly to begin with. ""Few hours into trading and Facebook's stocks maintain a $40 value,"" wrote Giuseppe D'Antonio. ""No drop, no frenzy behaviour, no wild fluctuations. Serious matter!"" While opinions in the business and tech communities have differed on whether the massive social network is a good investment, analysts have largely been bullish on the stock. There's been heavy demand, leading Facebook on Wednesday to announce it will sell about 25% more shares than it had originally planned, bringing its total to 421 million shares.

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan's army battled rebel forces Thursday, a military spokesman said, as negotiators from the warring sides prepared to meet for talks aimed at ending the violence that has pushed the world's newest country toward civil war. Having sent delegations to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, the government and rebels are under mounting pressure from African and Western powers to reach a deal to stop clashes that have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced more than 190,000. But there is no sign of an end of hostilities just yet. Military spokesman Col. Philip Aguer told CNN that military forces fought with rebels south of the flashpoint town of Bor, the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in the nearly three weeks of violence. He said the Sudan People's Liberation Army was trying to stop the rebels from advancing on the capital, Juba, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) away. South Sudan's government tweeted late Wednesday: ""Our forces did a partial withdrawal from Bor but are still fighting in the suburbs #SouthSudan."" President Salva Kiir on Wednesday declared a state of emergency for Unity state and for Jonglei state, of which Bor is the capital. The two delegations sent by Kiir and the rebels' leader, former Vice President Riek Machar, are already in Addis Ababa. Talks were expected to begin Thursday but, as of early evening local time, had not. Not all parties have yet arrived in Addis Ababa, according to a representative of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African trade bloc which has been mediating in the conflict. However, it is expected all parties will arrive by Friday and formal talks should get under way, the representative, Tigist Hailu, told CNN. South Sudan's neighbors, Western governments and the United Nations have been scrambling to stem the latest violence in the country, which seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war. Hilde Johnson, who heads the U.N. mission to South Sudan, said she wanted to see both parties ""take a decisive step to cease all hostilities."" ""We want to make this day the day that the violence stops,"" she said at a news conference in Juba on Wednesday. Humanitarian crisis . Kiir and Machar agreed Tuesday to send delegations to Addis Ababa, home of the African Union, for talks after violence in the oil-rich country that began on December 15. A cessation of hostilities between their forces is expected to top the agenda. South Sudan's government said Thursday via Twitter: ""We are participating in talks because we want peace for our people even though the rebel groups have not accepted a cessation of hostilities."" Johnson said Wednesday it was too early to say if the planned talks were a breakthrough, ""but it is a step in the right direction."" The spiraling violence has sparked a humanitarian crisis. An estimated 194,000 people have been displaced, with about 57,500 people sheltering in U.N. bases across the country, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Peacekeepers are working to protect the camps, but more resources are needed, Johnson said. She appealed for $166 million in aid to help provide families with food and other emergency relief. The U.N. Mission in South Sudan has voiced concern about what it said was mounting evidence of ethnic-based atrocities across the country. ""There has been killing and brutality; we have seen killing on ethnic grounds. We need to do everything to prevent the cycle of violence,"" Johnson said, adding that the African Union had set up a a group to investigate human rights abuses. ""I condemn elements on both sides,"" she said. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African trade bloc that has been helping to mediate between the battling parties, has said an independent body is needed to monitor any cease-fire, Johnson said. Leaders of the bloc warned Friday that they would ""take action"" to stop the conflict if South Sudan's warring factions didn't lay down their arms. Ethnic targeting . The fighting began in Juba but quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings soon emerging. Kiir, from South Sudan's Dinka ethnic group, accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup. The two men have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July. Kiir told CNN on Monday that African nations should have acted quickly to help quell the rebel forces. U.N. forces are patrolling the streets of Juba in order to protect civilians, Johnson said.

"Budapest, Hungary (CNN) -- One of the world's most wanted Nazi war suspects, Sandor Kepiro, 97, went on trial Thursday in Hungary charged with the slayings of 36 Jews and Serbs in Novi Sad, Serbia, in 1942. Kepiro, a former officer in the Hungarian gendarmerie, protested his innocence in the Budapest municipal court saying, ""I am not guilty, and I have always lived a decent life."" He denied having killed anyone during a raid on Novi Sad, instead claiming to have saved the lives of five people. And he said he did not know Jews or Serbs were the targets of the raid, saying that as far as he knew it was against anti-Nazi ""partisans."" Hungary sided with the Nazis early in World War II and in January 1942, its troops killed about 3,000 Jews and Serbs in Novi Sad, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia. Hungary had annexed the territory at the time. Kepiro said he never participated in or saw any deportation of Jews. Ten minutes before the trial, he said he did not expect so many people to come, that the charges are lies, and that he is innocent. When the trial began Kepiro said he could not hear and hardly sees anything, but as proceedings continued he appeared to be able to follow them. Kepiro's daughter held a sign accusing the court of being ""killers"" for persecuting an ""old man."" But Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff was dubious. ""This is a show, Sandor,"" he shouted at the defendant when Kepiro arrived in court, suggesting that he was acting more frail than he was. Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel, tracked down Kepiro in Budapest in 2006 and he said this could be one of the last Holocaust-era trials. ""Time does not diminish the guilt of the killers and old age should not protect those who committed such heinous crimes,"" he said. Kepiro sued Zuroff for libel for calling him a war criminal. A Budapest court acquitted Zuroff this week. Kepiro's lawyer, Zsolt Zetenyi, said before trial that Jews should look for other ways to find justice. The court ""is clearly not the venue"" and Kepiro is innocent, Zetenyi said. Hungary's pro-Nazi government resisted deporting its own Jews to death camps, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia. Germany occupied Hungary in 1944.","Sandor Kepiro, 97, is accused of killing Jews and Serbs in a raid in 1942 .

"(CNN) -- Getting arrested for stealing cars after his 16th birthday may be the best thing that ever happened to Terrence Barkley. Serving time in Missouri's juvenile justice system set Terrence Barkley on the path to college. It got him out of gangs and headed to college. While in one of Missouri's juvenile facilities, Barkley became editor of its student newspaper, captain of the football team and made the honor roll. ""I wanted something different for myself or I'd end up in Kansas City doing nothing. I knew I could do something,"" said Barkley, who is the first in his family to go to college. Now he's a sophomore studying criminal justice at the University of Central Missouri. Barkley wasn't scared straight. He wasn't packed away in a crowded facility with steel bars and razor wire. He wasn't under the constant guard of uniformed officers with billy clubs or locked down with hundreds of other juveniles. Instead, he was sent to Waverly Regional Youth Center, one of Missouri's 32 residential facilities where he wore his jeans and T-shirts. He slept in his own bunk bed in a room that looks more like a dorm than a jail cell. He received counseling and schooling. While America's juvenile system is often criticized for corruption and abuse, Missouri state officials say its juvenile justice solution has saved billions of dollars and reduced the number of repeat offenders. In the last four decades, the state has transformed its juvenile system into one that defies the traditional prison model. Known as the Missouri model, the program focuses on therapy, comfortable living conditions and an emphasis on job training and education. Missouri's facilities are serving thousands of young offenders, and they are receiving national acclaim. Each offender is placed in a small group of 10 to 15, assigned a case worker and sent to school during the day. Offenders also put on Shakespeare stage productions and play sports. They learn about teamwork through camping and rock climbing. ""Young people are really turning their lives around and becoming productive citizens,"" said Tim Decker, director of Missouri Division of Youth Services. ""We've redefined what's possible in the juvenile justice system."" Several states including New Mexico, Louisiana, California and Virginia are trying to emulate the Missouri model. Washington's troubled juvenile detention center, Oak Hill Youth Center, which once housed some of the most serious teen offenders, was shut down in 2009 and rebuilt to copy the Missouri model. Missouri has changed, too. The state once relied on a punitive system that warehoused offenders in harsh conditions. For nearly a century, the Missouri Training School for Boys in Boonville was a dark place known for beatings, rapes and even deaths. At one point, it was crammed with 650 offenders. Even judges hesitated sending children to Boonville. It was closed in 1983 and transformed into an adult prison. ""We had a dysfunctional system and we had to change our mindset on how to best work with these kids,"" said Mark Steward, who helped pilot the Missouri model in the 1970s. Steward heads the Missouri Youth Services Institute, a consulting agency that helps other states implement the Missouri model. Under the Missouri model, juveniles who commit minor crimes such as skipping school or trespassing are placed in low-security, renovated houses or cottages with 10 other kids. The small group size allows staffers to work more effectively with individual offenders. Delinquents who commit violent crimes are placed in gated facilities that hold a maximum of 50 offenders but offer the same small group atmosphere and focus on rehabilitation. These offenders are broken into smaller groups and also receive counseling and go to school on site. Most juveniles work on community service projects during their stay. Instead of serving sentences of weeks, months or years, a juvenile in Missouri can win release through good behavior and demonstrated progress. Missouri officials say the small group size may be the reason why there hasn't been a suicide in their residences in 25 years. The federal government has reported hundreds of suicide incidents involving juveniles in confinement. Critics argue the Missouri model's residential centers are too soft on juvenile delinquents and that some youths may never become law abiding citizens. ""There are victims who certainly feel more is needed to help the child fully understand the consequences of their actions,"" said Julie Lawson, executive director of Crime Victim Advocacy Center in St. Louis, Missouri. Lawson said some adult criminals may take advantage of a juvenile system that doesn't appear to be as punitive as the traditional juvenile model. Adult gang members may ask juveniles to take the blame if they know that the punishment won't be that harsh, she said. Missouri's Youth Services Division staff admits that a small percentage of juveniles will continue breaking the law despite going through the program. But some research on the Missouri Model has shown promising results. A recent analysis by the Annie E. Casey Foundation found that about 9 percent of juveniles in Missouri get in trouble with the law again within three years of their release. By contrast, about 28 percent of Arizona's juvenile offenders were back in trouble within three years. The program has survived scrutiny from tough-on-crime conservative leaders such as former Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft, who later served as attorney general in the Bush administration. The Missouri model has saved the state billions of dollars, said George Lombardi, who heads the adult Department of Corrections. He credits the Missouri model's low recidivism rate with slowing prison population growth. As a result, the state didn't have to build three prisons. More than 370 of the juveniles who went through the Division of Youth Services graduated from high school this year compared to just 40 children when the program began in earnest in 1983, according to state officials. ""I had wanted to go to college"" said Kaitlyn Bullard, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Missouri. Bullard, a teen who abused alcohol was sent to a facility for girls in 2005 for behavioral problems.""But I just never thought it would actually happen."" Today, she is planning to apply to law school.","The Missouri model uses small, therapeutic groups to treat juvenile offenders .

"(CNN) -- A judge Thursday preliminarily seized Aaron Hernandez's Massachusetts home while a wrongful death lawsuit against the former NFL star is pending. Bristol Superior Court Judge Richard Moses made the ruling during a hearing on Hernandez's finances in connection with a lawsuit filed by the family of Odin Lloyd, whom the ex-New England Patriot tight end is accused of killing, according to court documents. Charles Rankin, Hernandez's attorney, did not object but asked the court to reconsider the matter. At the hearing, lawyers for the Patriots said the team would not pay Hernandez the $3.25 million that the NFL Players Association has said the player is owed. An attorney for the Patriots said that it could take several months for the matter of payment to be settled. Hernandez had an NFL contract worth nearly $40 million, but it was terminated when he was charged with the slaying and firearm offenses. Source: Aaron Hernandez investigation turns to gun trafficking . The wrongful death lawsuit, filed Monday, claims Hernandez ""maliciously, willfully, wantonly, recklessly or by gross negligence"" caused the death of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of his friend Lloyd, 27, a Boston-area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend. CNN's calls to Hernandez's attorney were not immediately returned. Prosecutors told CNN that Hernandez allegedly planned and carried out the slaying: Lloyd was shot five times with a semi-automatic .45-caliber handgun. A grand jury investigating allegations of gun trafficking against Hernandez is the same one that handed up the murder charge, a source told CNN in October. Who was Odin Lloyd? A witness whom sources have described as Hernandez's ""muscle man"" said he was with the ex-Patriot the night of a 2012 double homicide in Boston. Police have said that the homicide may be linked to Hernandez, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. That witness, Alexander Bradley, has filed a civil lawsuit accusing Hernandez of shooting him in the face during an argument after they left a Florida strip club in February. Bradley lost sight in one eye because of the shooting, according to the lawsuit. Attorneys for the Patriots and the Lloyd family did not return CNN's calls.

"Berlin (CNN) -- Bomb squads in Germany successfully defused on Sunday two bombs and disposed of an additional air-dropped military device that had caused an evacuation of historic proportions in a city in the country's west. The 45,000 evacuated residents of the city of Koblenz, situated on the Rhine and Moselle Rivers, were allowed to return home. Workers rendered inert the two bombs, one 4,000-pound ""air mine"" and a smaller high-density explosive bomb. Then they destroyed a third non-explosive device by way of a controlled detonation, according to the Koblenz fire department. The fire brigade had pre-warned the population about the controlled detonation to allay possible fears that one of the powerful bombs may have exploded. Life had come to a standstill in the western German city of Koblenz, where 45,000 people -- nearly half of the cityÃÂ´s population -- had been evacuated after the discovery of several dangerous World War II bombs. ""It's the largest German evacuation since the end of the war,"" fire brigade spokesman Ronald Eppelsheim said Sunday. For 65 years, the Rhine River hid two bombs and an fog-producing device that were dropped by American and British warplanes in the last years of the war. When water levels dropped to record lows last week, the bombs were finally found. The function of the fog-producing device was to block the vision of anti-aircraft personnel on the ground during WW II to make it harder for them to fire upon the allied planes carrying out the bombing mission. ""While time passed by, and Koblenz was rebuild(ing), the bombs got even more dangerous,"" bomb-disposal squad member Jurgen Wagner said Sunday. The largest of the explosives is a 1.8 metric ton British air bomb that has the potential to destroy the cityÃÂ´s center, according to the fire brigade. But the focus of attention wasn't on the largest bomb -- it was on the much smaller, 125-kilogram (275-pound) American high-explosive bomb. It was ""transformed on impact of the earth"" making it more difficult to deactivate the detonator, Wagner said. Last week, hundreds of volunteers started evacuating two hospitals and seven homes for senior citizens. A prison and numerous hotels are also affected by the shutdown. By mid-Sunday morning, authorities declared the center of Koblenz a ""forbidden area."" About 1,000 authorities were searching the town to make sure any left behind leave. The fire brigade built a wall of more than 2,500 sandbags since the bombs were found in the river. Water pumps draining part of the river help ensure the two four-men teams can defuse the bombs precisely. Eppelsheim said he is optimistic the operation will be successful. ""People in Koblenz are used to bomb findings,"" he said. Despite the inconvenience for those evacuated, the situation could have been much worse. ""If we had found an even larger bomb, we would have been forced to evacuate all 100,000 citizens of Koblenz,"" Eppelsheim said. The deactivation of bombs is a common practice in Germany. Last year, a bomb exploded in the German town Gottingen -- killing three members of a bomb-disposal squad. During World War II, an estimated 257 British air bombs were dropped on Koblenz alone, according to the local fire brigade. It is not known how many of them did not explode and have been forgotten. Bomb-disposal squads have only managed to deactivate three of them until now.","NEW: Teams successfully defused two bombs and a fog-screen device from World War II .

"(CNN) -- A body has been discovered in the charred remains of a three-story apartment building in Minneapolis where an explosion and fire injured at least 14 people, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters discovered the body, which has not been publicly identified, while removing debris from Wednesday's fire, officials said. The body was turned over to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, they said. ""The cause of the fire is still under investigation. While a gas leak could be one potential cause, it could be weeks until a cause is determined and may ultimately be undetermined,"" according to a statement released by the Minneapolis Fire Department. Most of the injuries suffered were burns or came from falls or jumps from windows, Robert Ball, a spokesman for Hennepin County Emergency Medical Services, said Wednesday. Officials don't know whether people jumped out, fell or were pushed out by the explosion. The explosion was reported about 8:15 a.m., and the building was soon engulfed in flames, officials said.

"(CNN) -- Retail stores across Colorado sold nonmedical marijuana to adults for the first time Wednesday. As someone who has worked on reforming marijuana laws for nearly three years, I decided to take part as a customer and get in line. Advocates, industry members and media stayed away from partying New Year's Eve to get up early to commemorate the historic day. We began at 3D cannabis dispensary at 7 a.m. with a press conference. We joined city and state representatives at Medicine Man dispensary later in the morning. The atmosphere was reminiscent of a concert or sporting event. People who braved the cold stood in line and made small talk. A lot of people, particularly those over 50, said ""It's about time,"" and told stories about arrests spanning decades for using marijuana. It was like a wedding or Election Night, with lots of picture-taking, hugs and congratulatory wishes -- except it was 7 a.m. and coffee and cocoa took the place of beer and wine. I waited alongside three fairly young men who drove nine hours from Nebraska to take part. Behind them was a couple from Chicago who insisted their decision to go to Denver was not solely based on buying state-regulated marijuana -- but it played a significant role. Many others were local marijuana users looking forward to experiencing what only medical marijuana patients had been accustomed to in Colorado. Once in earshot of the ""budtenders,"" the conversation was fairly surreal. I asked for a strain perfect for after work, something to make me relax and help me sleep -- a Marijuana Merlot. I was told two Indica strains are solid sellers for this purpose: Tahoe Triangle and Ogre. Tahoe Triangle had a light pine smell; Ogre was more musty and pungent like you might imagine a hairy monster would be. I went with the Ogre with thoughts of Shrek in my mind. The stores are fully backed by the state and local governments, and have been given a cautious green light by the federal government to proceed as planned. Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which legalized pot for recreational use, because they believe marijuana prohibition is more harmful than good and wastes resources. Colorado's previous efforts to decriminalize the plant -- remove criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana while it still remained technically illegal -- have already proven cost effective, practical and safe. According to the Colorado Center on Law and Policy, the amendment's decriminalization alone would save the state $12 million in 2012. In the last decade, the state has averaged more than 10,000 arrests and citations per year for minor marijuana possession. The number of arrests has dropped over the last year to below 4,500, but this number represents high increases in arrests for public consumption. Public consumption is a primary issue ahead of us. Using marijuana in public is still illegal in Colorado, and the Denver City Council has been engaging in a long back and forth to define ""open and public use."" The current definition isn't specific enough for the post- Amendment 64 era. The proposed law in Denver would allow for open and public use as long as it's on private property with permission of the owner or lessee. Smoking is not allowed on city sidewalks, parks or the downtown mall. Law enforcement rarely arrested anyone for public use before Amendment 64, when possession charges were the primary prohibition. We expect this number to stabilize and decline as law enforcement, decision-makers and users establish a culture of responsible use. Fortunately, use and consumption laws will soon be a civil issue in Denver, not a criminal one. On the way back to the car after making my first fully legal and regulated marijuana purchase, I saw the guys from Nebraska again. I handed them educational brochures created by local reform advocates that provide various resources, address the effects and caution for consuming potent edibles, and generally explain the law. The young men thanked me, jumped in their Jeep with Nebraska license plates and Denver Bronco covers and took off. The state is addressing potential harms of using marijuana with public education, safety and health outreach efforts. It felt good to put this new reality in action with cautionary discussions with the Nebraskans and others throughout the day. Colorado is leading the nation in a new way to control marijuana, focusing scarce law enforcement resources away from arresting responsible users. It is satisfying to be part of that process, and it feels incredible to be in a position to promote safety and positive experiences for adults who are now law-abiding. They are pioneering an end to prohibition just by being regular people, standing in line, and behaving with friendly cheer and good spirits on the first day of 2014. The sky didn't fall in the Mile High City. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Art Way.","Art Way bought marijuana at a store in Colorado on first day of legal pot for adults .

"(CNN) -- Kim Yuna is one of South Korea's biggest stars and the ice skater who won the country's first figure skating gold medal at a Winter Olympic Games last year in Vancouver. Known as ""Queen Yuna"" to her legions of fans, the 20-year old is far from the haughty ice maiden that moniker might suggest. She fronts sellout ice dancing shows and has a plethora of advertising deals that cash in on her wholesome image. She is also the host of TV show ""Kiss and Cry"" -- a South Korean version of ""Dancing with the Stars"" on ice -- that she hopes will popularize the sport in South Korea. ""When I see those participants enjoying themselves, it is a great joy to me,"" she said. ""Although some of them get hurt once in a while, they enjoy it a lot and I hope the show makes the viewers want to give it a try."" Named by TIME magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2010, she has trained as an ice skater since she was 5, moving to Toronto at the age of 16 in order to pursue her Olympic ambitions. Her work paid off at the Vancouver Olympics last year, where she scored a record 228.56 points to win gold in women's figure skating. The highest score since the International Skating Union (ISU) judging system began, she beat her own world record and eclipsed her closest rival, Mao Asada of Japan, by a massive 23.06 points. Now having won every ""grand slam"" title figure skating has to offer, including the World Grand Prix Final, Four Continents Championships and World Championships, she is one of the highest paid athletes in the world, according to Forbes magazine. As well as continuing to skate competitively she's an ambassador for South Korea's bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. It's a responsibility that makes her more nervous than performing at the Olympics. ""I thought my heart would pop out during the presentation (in Lausanne, Switzerland). The nervousness was nothing compared to the performances,"" she said. ""Until then, I had only taken care of my own business. But with this being the wish of many Koreans, the thought of having that expectation of the whole country on my shoulders, even along with other people, worried and unnerved me.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government pleaded Saturday for North Korean authorities to release 85-year-old Merrill Newman, with a spokeswoman saying officials are ""deeply concerned"" about him and another American being held in the isolated East Asian nation. ""Given Mr. Newman's advanced age and health conditions, we urge (North Korea) to release Mr. Newman so he may return home and reunite with his family,"" said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Washington's plea came on the day North Korean state media released print stories and video showing what they called Newman's ""apology."" University of California, Berkeley professor Steven Weber characterized it as ""highly scripted political theater."" So how did an elderly retired financial consultant and Korean War veteran become the central figure in an international dispute? Why is there such animosity still tied to a conflict, the Korean War, that ended six decades ago? And why is this all unfolding now? Weber, a former consultant to the U.S. Commission on National Security, has a theory: ""They are trying to get the Western media to pay attention."" With the notable exception of its longtime ally China, North Korea is in many ways a pariah state bogged down by what many view as decades of repressive leadership. At the same time, the communist nation has had difficulties getting enough energy to power their country and food for their people. Largely shut off from the rest of the world, its leaders and state media often use saber-rattling rhetoric to unite citizens against what Weber described as ""nasty outsiders"" -- which, not coincidentally, are chiefly South Korea and the United States, just as during the Korean War. The discord in recent years has centered mostly on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, with the international community taking punitive measures such as economic sanctions to hold Pyongyang in check. North Korea hasn't been alone. Iran, too, has long been an international target because of its nuclear program, though that landscape has changed with the recent diplomatic accord. That fact may not be lost on Pyongyang, said Weber, who surmised North Korea may be particularly eager to get the world's focus and, ideally, concessions in the process. Added Weber: ""If the Iran thing gets settled peacefully, then guess who's left?"" Wife, son beg for his release . Elderly man not only American detained . Newman is not the only American being detained in North Korea. In her statement, Hayden also asked for the release of Kenneth Bae, who was arrested in November 2012 in North Korea. Last May, Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's government found him guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. ""We are thankful that the White House has advocated for the release of both Mr. Newman and my brother, Kenneth Bae,"" said Terri Chung, Bae's sister. ""It has been a devastating experience for my brother and my family, so we pray every day for his release. Now we're including Mr. Newman in our prayers. We cannot forget about these two men. For every action that the US government takes toward his release, we are thankful."" Chung has said Bae suffers from chronic health conditions that require doctors' care, including hypertension, diabetes and an enlarged heart. On Monday, Chung said ailments her brother suffered before his detainment -- back problems and radiating leg pain -- worsened while he was forced to work long hours daily in a labor camp. He has lost 50 pounds since he was detained, she added. The Bae family has been in ""sheer pain and agony"" since his detainment, Chung said. Other detained Americans . Unique case . Newman's age, and the circumstances surrounding his detention, are unique. According to his family, the Palo Alto, California, resident had gone on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea in October. From phone calls and postcards he sent, the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem, son Jeff Newman said. The day before he was to leave, ""one or two Korean authorities"" met with Newman and his tour guide, the son added. They talked about Newman's service record, which left ""my dad ... a bit bothered,"" according to Jeff Newman. Then, just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang in late October, he was taken off the aircraft by North Korean authorities. Newman's weeks-long detention is complicated by the fact that, according to his son Jeff, he suffers from a heart condition. Sweden's ambassador to North Korea visited Newman on Saturday where he is being held at Pyongyang's Yanggakdo Hotel and delivered his medication, his family said. ""As a result of the visit, we know that Merrill is in good health,"" the family added. ""Merrill reports that he is being well treated and that the food is good."" The Newmans went on to thank the ambassador and ""express appreciation for the cooperation of the DPRK government in allowing the visit to take place."" ""We are asking that the DPRK authorities take into account his health and his age and, as an act of humanitarian compassion, allow him to depart immediately for home,"" the family said. ""All of us want this ordeal to end and for the 85-year-old head of our extended family to be with us once more."" Reported apology: 'I have been guilty of big crimes' Until Saturday, the North Korean government hadn't said why it held Newman. American accused of spying issues 'apology' The explanation came in the form of a published apology from Newman, as well as accompanying images of him thumbprinting his handwritten note and talking about his experiences. Atop the first of the four pages is the word ""apology,"" according to video released by North Korea. The end of the last page is dated November 9 -- indicating Newman made his reported admission more than 20 days ago. Why might Pyongyang have waited 21 days, then, to make the admission public? That's another one of the mysteries surrounding this case. In the note, Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol Unit, part of the ""intelligence bureau"" fighting against Pyongyang in the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect ""information"" and wage various deadly attacks. ""After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman said, according to the ""apology"" reported by KCNA. The reported message also touches on his return 60 years later to North Korea, admitting that he ""shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers."" ""I have been guilty of big crimes against the DPRK government and the Korean people again,"" Newman adds in the ""apology."" His statement ends: ""If I go back to (the) USA, I will tell the true features of the DPRK and the life the Korean people are leading."" In addition to this statement, KCNA ran a story alleging Newman came to North Korea with a tourist group in October and afterward ""perpetrated acts of infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and slandering its socialist system."" This story claimed that Newman tried to ""look for spies and terrorists who conducted espionage and subversive activities against the DPRK."" Investigators determined that, as a member of the U.S. military, he ""masterminded espionage and subversive activities ... and, in this course, he was involved in the killings of service personnel of the Korean People's Army and innocent civilians."" ""The investigation clearly proved Newman's hostile acts against the DPRK, and they were backed by evidence,"" the KCNA story added. ""He admitted all his crimes."" Is American man a bargaining chip? Newman's fate, North Korea's thinking unclear . Just five days ago, his wife, Lee, said she hoped he would be home for Thanksgiving. ""We need to have Merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays,"" Lee Newman told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""And we ask -- respectfully -- for them to release him and let him come home."" One day before Thanksgiving, Rep. Charlie Rangel -- who himself was wounded fighting in the Korean War -- released a letter urging North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""to release him immediately."" Noting Newman's medical issues, the New York Democrat implored Kim to ""have the heart to reunite him with his loved ones and those who can provide proper care."" Rangel also reflected on the 1950s war, as well as the current state of affairs between the key players. ""I believe that Mr. Newman, like myself and others who have fought during the Korean War six decades ago, wants to see a united Korea in our lifetime,"" wrote the congressman. ""While progress has been slow on the political front, I am confident it can be advanced on humanitarian grounds."" So will there be fresh movement in Newman's case? Will his reported apology pave the way for his release or will it be followed, like Bae, with a lengthy prison sentence? As of Saturday, nobody -- at least nobody outside of North Korea -- seems to know. As Weber, the Berkeley professor said: ""When it comes to North Korea, nobody knows very much."" CNN's Chelsea J.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- U.S. safety officials have recalled about 4.2 million Chinese-made Aqua Dots bead toys that contain a chemical that has caused some children to vomit and become comatose after swallowing them. Bindeez, which were named Australia's toy of the year, contain a chemical that converts into a ""date rape"" drug. Scientists have found the popular toy's coating contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic ""date rape"" drug GHB, or gamma-hydroxy butyrate, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman Scott Wolfson told CNN. ""GHB is this drug that in low doses actually causes euphoria,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. ""In higher doses, it can cause people to go into a coma. It can cause seizures. It can cause something known as hypotonia, where all your muscles just become very flaccid. ""And it can cause people to become amnestic, ...  which is why it became a date-rape drug,"" Gupta said. ""So this is nasty stuff, and it appears that the chemical is actually converting into it in the body."" The arts and craft beads, aimed at children 4 years and older, have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores as ""Aqua Dots"" and in Australia under the name ""Bindeez Beads."" CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said anyone with Aqua Dots at home should immediately take the toy away from children and contact distributor Spin Master Ltd. to return for free replacement beads or a toy of equal value. For additional information, contact Spin Master at 1-800-622-8339 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. The toy was named toy of the year in Australia and recently  made Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed Aqua Dots on its Web site as ""out of stock online"" and had removed them from its top toy list. Toronto-based Spin Master stopped shipping Aqua Dots and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they had sold for $17 to $30.  Watch what's known about the beads Â» . Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. recalled Bindeez Beads on Tuesday after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. ""I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it,"" Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was sickened by the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old ""swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state."" The toddler was hospitalized and has since fully recovered, the commission added. In the second incident, a child vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. The recall is the latest to target Chinese-made toys.  See if your child has any recalled toys Â» .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Sixteen people have been killed in violence in China's volatile western region of Xinjiang, state media reported Monday. Two police officers chasing suspects came under attack late Sunday from people with machetes and explosive devices in Shufu county, near the city of Kashgar, said Tianshan, a news website run by the Xinjiang government. In the clash that ensued, two police officers died and 14 ""gang members"" were shot and killed, Tianshan reported. Deadly unrest frequently breaks out in Xinjiang, a large, resource-rich region that is home to the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. Chinese authorities have cracked down heavily on violence involving Uyghurs, deepening resentment. The details of violent clashes in Xinjiang often remain murky. Uyghur diaspora groups, like the World Uyghur Congress, have criticized the Chinese government for the lack of transparency over such events. Police have detained six suspects, Tianshan reported in an update late Monday. It described the violence as ""an organized and premeditated terrorist attack"" carried out by a gang of 20 people, led by a person it named as Hesen Ismail, a Uyghur-sounding name. The group ""advocated extremist religious thoughts, produced explosive devices and guns, and tested explosives several times in a bid to plot terrorist attacks,"" the report said. But the World Uyghur Congress disputed the government's account. It cited unidentified ""sources on the ground"" who told it that the 14 people shot and killed were Uyghur ""demonstrators."" Two of them were teenagers who were killed by ""indiscriminate shooting by the security forces,"" the organization alleged. Luo Fuyong, a spokesman for the Xinjiang government, contested the World Uyghur Congress's version of events. He said that no teenagers were killed in the violence and that those involved weren't demonstrators, noting that the clash took place at 11 p.m. He said he believed that all 14 people who were killed by police were Uyghurs. CNN wasn't able to independently verify the different claims about what happened. Chinese authorities have blamed Uyghurs for a vehicle attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October that killed five people -- including the three in the vehicle -- and wounded 40 others. Xinjiang's worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting in the capital, Urumqi, between Uyghurs and Han Chinese killed some 200 people and injured 1,700. That unrest was followed by a crackdown by security forces. Several deadly clashes have been reported this year. Xinjiang is now home to more than 8 million Han Chinese, up from 220,000 in 1949, and 10 million Uyghurs. The newcomers take most of the new jobs, and unemployment among Uyghurs is high. They complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. Beijing accuses some Uyghur groups of trying to establish an independent state.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China is a country where the rule of law is selective and often unjust. One source of injustice is the 50-year-old system known as ""laodong jiaoyang,"" or re-education through labor. Under this system, tens of thousands of offenders are imprisoned in China without trial. A United Nations Human Rights Council report estimates that some 190,000 Chinese were locked up in 320 re-education -- or ""laojiao"" -- centers in 2009. That is in addition to an estimated 1.6 million Chinese convicted in regular courts and held in the formal prison system. The ""re-education through labor"" system dates back to the 1950s when the newly established communist regime swept up ""counter-revolutionaries"" and ""class enemies"" to maintain order. Today it empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing. Though the practice is supposedly meant for only minor offenders, critics of the system say it is often used as a tool to persecute government critics, including intellectuals, human rights activists and followers of banned spiritual groups like the Falun Gong, and is a major source of human rights violations. Professor Yu Jianrong, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank, acknowledged that the system ""has played a certain role in maintaining social order and in preventing and reducing crime."" However, he added, ""as a compulsory re-education administrative measure, it is against the concept of law, lacks legal basis and is contrary to the principles of fairness and justice. It will cause political consequences if this system is not abolished."" Beijing officials say some rethinking is underway. In a press conference last week, Jiang Wei, a senior official of a government taskforce on judicial reform, said the government was preparing to revamp but not abolish the system. Chinese society, Jiang said, has ""reached a consensus on the need to reform the re-education through labor system."" Opinion on Chinese social media confirms that. On the Sina Weibo micro-blogging site, an informal poll last week showed 97% of the nearly 13,000 respondents voted that ""the laojiao system must be rescinded."" Only 3% opined that it is ""very good, very practical and must not be rescinded."" Public criticism of the practice resurfaced last August after Tang Hui, a woman in Hunan province, was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp after she agitated for justice for her 11-year-old daughter who was allegedly abducted, raped and forced into prostitution by seven men. Tang's plight earned support among lawyers, intellectuals, bloggers and even the mainstream media. Ten lawyers wrote an open letter to government agencies, arguing that the system was neither transparent nor well-supervised. ""Current regulations do not require the laojiao management committees to release a written verdict to explain how their decisions were made, so it's difficult to know if a decision was fair,"" complained co-signatory Li Fangping, a Beijing lawyer. Within a week, Tang Hui was released. Wang Xixin, a Peking University law professor, supports the reassessment of the laojiao system. ""The way it's implemented, looking at the deprivation and restriction of the citizens' personal freedom and the lack of openness, fairness and impartiality and procedural safeguards, the system itself needs to be reformed."" Chinese ex-convicts who have survived years in laojiao camps have bitter memories. ""It was physically exhausting and psychologically tough because isolation and starvation are always part of daily life,"" recalled a government functionary who was jailed for four years. In the camp, he said he was assigned to work in a vehicle-repair workshop. Does the system work in re-educating convicts? ""It's hard to say,"" he said. ""Different people take different lessons from their experiences, but most people leave the camp still hating the system or the government. ""Reform is always a good idea, but you cannot do it without changing the whole legal system."" Reformers propose the abolition of the laojiao system, but hardly anyone expects that to happen soon. The Chinese leadership remains divided about law reform and other aspects of political reform. Faced with growing social unrest and political instability, China's leaders have increasingly relied on criminal and administrative punishment to contain rising demands for social justice, clean government, political transparency and accountability, especially among those left behind and marginalized. Some legal experts agree that the system will take some time to change. ""The laojiao system should not be completely abolished,"" said Jiang Ming'an, professor at Peking University. ""Instead it should be adapted and reconstituted. We need to take into account the protection of social order and maintenance of social stability."" A microblogger named Sanxiasheng agreed and tweeted: ""If re-education through labor is abolished, you will see more gangsters around the neighborhoods."" Ma Huaide, a professor at China University of Political Science and Law, likened the laojiao system to an ax. ""The ax may serve as a weapon, but we need not destroy all the axes,"" Ma said. ""The key is to supervise the hand that holds it."" But Yu Jianrong, the researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, unequivocally rejects the laojiao system. ""It goes against the legal system, undermines the law and harms social justice,"" he posted on social media. ""It serves as the local authorities' tool of reprisal in the name of maintaining stability. It has to be abolished immediately."" China-watcher Anthony Saich said the planned reform of the system was ""long overdue"" but would proceed gradually. ""As with most reforms in China, the policy thrust is to be cautious and experiment first both for people to get used to the change and then to assess whether it has been successful,"" Saich, a professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, explained. ""I would imagine it will lead over time to its abolition.""","China has hinted it's rethinking its system of ""re-education through labor""

"(CNN) -- Another Carnival cruise ship is having problems. This time the Carnival Legend is having technical difficulties that are affecting its sailing speed, the travel company said Thursday. The Legend is on the last leg of a seven-day Caribbean cruise that departed Tampa on Sunday, March 10, according to a statement from the cruise company. The news comes after the Carnival Dream became a nightmare for some passengers Wednesday when power went off, some toilets stopped working and no one was allowed to get off the vessel -- despite the fact that the ship was docked at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean. Last month, an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard. That scheduled four-day cruise stretched into eight days as tugs pulled the vessel into port in Alabama. Food was scarce and passengers sweltered in the heat with no air conditioning. People aboard also reported overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship. Because of the problems on the Legend, Carnival said it had canceled a scheduled stop in Grand Cayman and the ship will make its trek back to it's scheduled ending destination in Tampa, Florida. Passenger Rob Bonenfant said the mood had soured on the cruise ship. ""Passengers are now really pissed off,"" Bonenfant said via e-mail. ""Mood on the ship is getting worse among passengers, captain is giving limited information."" Carnival has promised to refund $100 to passengers.","Carnival Legend is having technical difficulties .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed legislation that requires the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states while such marriages were legal in California. California will recognize same-sex marriages from a period of time before Proposition 8 was enacted. Same-sex marriages performed elsewhere between June 16, 2008, and November 5, 2008, are to be legally recognized, as are in-state marriages performed during that time. The end date represents when a ballot initiative, Proposition 8, added a ban on same-sex marriage to the state constitution. Proposition 8 bars the state from recognizing any marriage performed outside the state outside those dates. The state Supreme Court ruled after the proposition passed that marriages performed before the ban would remain on the books. But Senate Bill 54 splits a legal hair and requires the state to recognize such marriages as ""unions,"" providing ""the same legal protections that would otherwise be available to couples that enter into civil unions or domestic partnerships out-of-state,"" the governor said. ""In short, this measure honors the will of the people in enacting Proposition 8 while providing important protections to those unions legally entered into in other states,"" Schwarzenegger said in a signing statement accompanying his signature. He signed the bill Sunday. Proponents of Proposition 8 lambasted the governor. ""The governor's signing of SB 54 illustrates his disregard for the sovereign authority of California's voting citizens,"" said Everett Rice, a spokesman for the California Family Council. ""In 2000 and 2008, the voters expressed their desire at the ballot box to protect traditional marriage. They emphatically affirmed that marriage should retain its historical definition and identity. However, today the governor has joined with other elected representatives by choosing to place the demands of special interest groups over more than 7 million California voters.""","Bill requires California to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states .

"(Mumbai, India) (CNN) -- In Mumbai, the spiritual home of Bollywood stars and starlets, a sparkling new icon is on the rise. Stretching fully 442 meters (1,450 feet) above the Indian city's busy financial district and playing host to some 300 high-class apartments, the World One tower will become one of the world's tallest residential buildings anywhere when completed in 2014. According to Abhinandan Lodha, deputy managing director of the Lodha Group (the real estate company behind the project) the giant structure is a symbol of the rapid development that has transformed Mumbai into a vibrant, modern destination in recent years. See also: China's crazy property bubble . ""When you go to Dubai you see the Burj. New York, (the) Empire State and so on. But Mumbai didn't have a similar landmark like that which identified the city as being the next financial center of a global nation,"" Lodha said. ""World One is our way to contribute in a different way, to say that we are globally on the map as India, globally on the map as Mumbai,"" he added. Mumbai's new foundations . Lodha and his organization represent a new breed of high-class property developers reshaping the very foundations of Mumbai. The company has 40 projects currently in the works across the fast changing metropolis where luxury flats are trading for as high as $8,000 per square meter and luxury villas at $12,000 per square meter. These costly sums put Mumbai in the same league as some of the most expensive cities in the developed world and equate to ""about 70% of residential prices compared to midtown Manhattan,"" explained Anuj Puri, chairman of real estate specialists Jones Lang LaSalle India. ""Compared to St Johns Wood in London it is about 80% and to Happy Valley in Hong Kong it is about 90%,"" he added. But while rising luxury property prices equals good news for those with the means to snap-up an early deal, the investing class represents just a tiny fraction of the 20 million Indians that call Mumbai home. The vast majority live in far more modestly priced housing or travel from far outside to work in the city. With real estate and rents booming in downtown areas, however, many of Mumbai's factories and employers are relocating to sites on the city's outskirts. See also: UK moves to cool property market . This is a trend recognized by Sarath Chandran from the Committee for the Right to Housing who mourns the fact that an increasing number of the city's inhabitants are now being forced to travel for hours to reach their places of work. ""All the companies in Mumbai are there but the only thing is they have shifted their manufacturing from inner Mumbai to outer Mumbai,"" she said. Cities in the suburbs . Out of this altering landscape, however, some see the opportunity to reshape Mumbai even further. The Lodha Group is behind plans to develop entire new towns from scratch on the outskirts of Mumbai to meet the changing needs and demography of the city. One such development is Palava, a 16 square kilometer city that will offer schools, hospitals, its own police force and fire stations for 80,000 people. ""There is a real case for saying that someone needs to come together and say we are going to house industry in the way that it creates long term benefits for both the people living in it and for the city,"" said Lodha. ""(This) can only happen if you look at it from a 20 year perspective which can happen only towards the suburban areas of Mumbai."" See also: Is property boom about to bust? Eager property investors such as Lionel Lobo agree. He bought four units in Palava for himself and his family in 2010 at a cost of $300 per square meter. Today the same space sells for $750 per square meter, a doubling of his initial investment in just three years. But for a new generation of Indian home-buyers like, Lobo it's not all about the value of the returns. ""They have found this place is a nice place for the next generation and their wives and elders,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Some of the world's oldest and rarest Bibles and biblical texts were placed online Tuesday in newly digitized form by two of the world's most venerable libraries. The project, which aims to make 1.5 million pages of ancient texts freely available in virtual form over the next three years, is a joint effort by the Bodleian Libraries at Oxford University and the Vatican Library. The project is focused on three main areas: ancient Greek manuscripts, Hebrew manuscripts and 15th-century printed books, known as incunabula. They will include secular and religious texts. For its online launch, however, the organizers have highlighted a smaller group of Bibles and biblical commentaries, each of which has been chosen for its particular historical importance. They include a copy of a Gutenberg Bible, the first major book printed with moveable metal type in the Western world, and the beautiful woodcuts of a Bible printed in 1478-1479 in Cologne, known as Stamp. Ross. 283. The four-year project, which began in 2012, is funded by a 2 million pound (nearly $3.3 million) award from the Polonsky Foundation, a charity that supports higher education and research. Dr. Leonard Polonsky, in a video clip posted on the project's website, said that it would ensure that fragile texts that ""should be part of the inheritance of mankind"" were safeguarded for future generations. ""It's too dangerous to have unique exemplars of anything in one place,"" he said. ""Digitizing enables us to secure all of this material and of course make it broadly available. It's an opportunity you can't resist."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said, ""Where you can see these actual texts there is just a lifting of the spirit, something that inspires worship."" The project is of ""huge international significance,"" he said, because a far wider range of scholars than before will now be able to see the texts. Conservation staff at the Bodleian and Vatican libraries have worked together to ensure the ancient documents are not exposed to any harm in the digitization process, a news release from the Bodleian Libraries said. Scholars will be able to zoom in on texts and images to study them more closely. ""I envision how useful it will be to scholars and many other interested people,"" Monsignor Cesare Pasini, the prefect of the Vatican Library, is quoted as saying. ""Moreover, I see the common fruit of our labor as a very positive sign of collaboration and sharing that is a trademark of the world of culture.""

"(CNN) -- The next Winter Olympics in Russia will feature six new events, meaning that more women will be able to compete at Sochi in 2014. The men's and women's ski half-pipe, women's ski jumping, biathlon mixed relay, team figure skating and luge team relay will be added, the International Olympic Committee announced on Wednesday. Another decision will soon be made about whether to add five other competitions: men's and women's ski slopestyle and snowboard slopestyle, plus Alpine team parallel. The IOC said it had looked at ways of increasing universality, gender equity and youth appeal and overall value to the four-yearly Games. ""The inclusion of these events on the Olympic Winter Games program is sure to be appreciated by athletes and sports fans alike,"" IOC president Jacques Rogge said. ""These are exciting, entertaining events that perfectly complement the existing events on the sports program, bring added appeal and increase the number of women participating at the Games."" Meanwhile, the IOC is preparing rules aimed at preventing a repeat of the Caster Semenya gender controversy. The South African runner's 800-meters victory as an 18-year-old at the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin sparked a furore that saw her miss a year of competition while tests were undertaken to determine her true sex. Semenya has since been allowed to return to running as a woman by the International Association of Athletics Federations, but the IOC is hoping to avoid such embarrassment at the 2012 London Olympics. The IOC's executive board is meeting in the British capital this week and has agreed on the rules in principle, the UK Press Association reported on Tuesday. ""My opinion is that there will not be many such cases,"" IOC medical commission chairman Professor Arne Ljungqvist told PA. ""My experience in the last several years is that there has been a handful of cases over the last 10 years. I feel to start with it would be advisable for sport to have a panel of experts who can gain more experience of these cases so that they can be dealt with in a consistent way. ""I would probably personally recommend the identification of a number of experts to gain the necessary expertise in the near future.""","The IOC announces that six events will be added to 2014 Winter Olympics .
