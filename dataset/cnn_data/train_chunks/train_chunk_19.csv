"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) --  Violence echoed across a volatile Pakistani province and an adjacent tribal region on Saturday, with dozens reported killed in the latest military push, a drone strike, and a car bombing targeting a school bus. A Pakistani girl displaced by the military's offensive against the Taliban rests at a camp Saturday north of the capital. Pakistan's artillery and airstrikes against Taliban militants in North West Frontier Province left 47 suspected militants dead in operations over the last 24 hours, the military said. ""Security forces are closing in from different directions and have been able to inflict more casualties,"" the military said in the daily roundup of its offensive in the Swat district and adjoining regions. The troops have been fighting to oust militants from districts across Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. Forty-five people were killed in various areas of Dir, where four militants were arrested. The military conducted search-and-destroy operations in Shangla district, where they targeted terrorist hideouts and reported the arrest of one militant leader and the death of another. In Swat, the military said it killed a militant commander and were getting closer to the city of Mingora, where they isolated and blocked ""the movement of fleeing terrorists,"" amid the sound of intense exchanges of fire.  Watch Pakistani troops pound Taliban positions » . In the adjacent tribal region, a missile believed fired by a drone overnight struck a madrassa, a religious school, a Pakistani intelligence official said. More than 20 people were killed, according to local and Taliban sources. The strike was near the village of Mir Ali in North Waziristan, one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal regions. The official asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. According to a count by CNN, this is the 16th suspected missile strike in Pakistan this year. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are American airstrikes on its territory. The U.S. military in Afghanistan has not commented on the strikes, which typically target Taliban fighters in the border region. But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled drones. In Peshawar, at least nine people were killed and 33 hurt Saturday when a car bomb exploded while a school bus passed on a road, local authorities said. The school bus was carrying handicapped children. It is not clear if any of them were killed, but as many as seven were injured. Peshawar is the capital of North West Frontier Province. More than a million people have been displaced in northwestern Pakistan as a result of the two-week-old military offensive with the Taliban, the U.N. refugee agency said Saturday. Antonio Guterres, high commissioner for refugees, said 1,171,682 people have been registered as internally displaced people. These are in addition to the 553,916 displaced people who've fled eruptions of fighting in the tribal areas and North West Frontier Province since August. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Pakistan military says it killed 47 militants in 24 hours in North West Frontier Province .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appeared set for a second term as his Congress party and its allies scored a decisive lead over their opponents on Saturday in a vote count after the country's monthlong general elections. Congress supporters in Banglaore Saturday celebrate the party's lead in election results. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance surged ahead in more than 255 of the 543 federal parliamentary boroughs, outpacing the main opposition composed of a grouping led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). BJP leader Arun Jaitley conceded defeat, stating that the ruling party will win the election. ""We respect this mandate and accept it,"" Jaitley said. India's communists, who last year parted ways with the federal government for its civilian nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States, also suffered a massive blow in their stronghold state of West Bengal as they trailed their rivals in more than half of its boroughs. Singh drove down to the home of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born head of the Congress party, after trends gave out a clear mandate in favor of the ruling coalition. Standing beside Gandhi, who once again endorsed the choice of Singh for her party's top job, he thanked voters for their support. He vowed to maintain a stable government that he said would remain committed to secular values. Singh also remarked that he would like Rahul Gandhi, son of his party chief, to become a member of his new Cabinet. Deepak Sandhu, the prime minister's spokeswoman, told CNN that Singh is expected to hold a meeting of his current Cabinet on Monday. The prime minister, whose coalition may need some extra backing to be able to reclaim power with a majority of 272 lawmakers on its side, threw up an invitation to all secular parties to come and support his government. The fifth and final phase of India's marathon general election to choose a federal government ended Wednesday. Most of the results of the will be out by the end of the day, election officials said. India is home to about 714 million voters. About 100 million voters registered for Wednesday's polling.","NEW: Victory looks certain for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's second term .

"(CNN) -- Richard Deitsch struggled through several days of denial before facing the fact that he was thousands of miles from home and he had no idea where his passport was. It's most important to make copies of your passport, say experts. Web sites offer easy-access digital storage. The Sports Illustrated reporter was covering the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, where he should have been having the time of his life. But his emotions were all over the place -- and none of them were good. His passport, he assumed, had fallen out of his backpack. ""When I realized it was missing, I went through a number of stages -- panic, fear, anger, and finally, acceptance,"" he wrote while enjoying a recent vacation in Russia. ""I looked for three days in every possible spot before I finally admitted to myself it was gone."" Deitsch's bureaucratic nightmare reached a low point when he found himself inside a police station telling his story to five police officials who spoke no English. ""I was a wreck,"" he wrote later in a Sports Illustrated piece. He had brought his own translator, an SI China reporter whom Deitsch credited with negotiating through the red tape and eventually saving his entire assignment. Fortunately for Deitsch, he had prepared well for such an emergency. The best thing Deitsch did, said travel experts, was to make several copies of his passport and work visa before departing for China. As a result, he had a replacement passport in his hands within a few days after he reported it missing. Experts seem to come from two schools of thought on how to protect a passport. Some prefer to lock the document away once they arrive in a destination, while others say keeping the passport with you is the best way to safeguard it. Whatever option you choose, the bottom line is, if you lose your passport you must be able to prove your identity and citizenship to the U.S. government. The best way to do it is to have a copy of your passport handy. Deitsch's experience has prompted him to become ""hyper-vigilant"" about his passport, he wrote. He usually chooses to lock the document in a safe during his travels, rarely carrying his passport on him. ""And when I do, I find myself grabbing the front of my pants-pocket every couple of minutes to make sure that it remains where it should,"" he wrote. Once it's clear your passport is lost, bring your passport copy and any other traveling or ID-related paperwork to the nearest embassy or consulate during business hours. Be prepared to spend at least four hours waiting in line, filling out forms and answering questions from officials. If you didn't bring extra ID photos with you on your trip, have some taken before heading to the embassy or consulate. Make sure the photos are cropped to the correct size for your country's passport. If you have no paperwork, take someone in your traveling party with you. They will have to vouch for you. U.S. citizens who are traveling alone and have no other way to prove their identification will be allowed to call ""family, friends or associates"" in the United States to confirm their identity, according to the U.S. State Department Web site. Laura Kidder, editorial director of Fodor's travel guides, suggested making color copies of the passport's data page and sticking them inside your luggage; you can scan them into a computer and e-mail them to yourself; or you can use an online document storage company. ""There's one [online company] that is particularly geared for passport and travel documents,"" Kidder said. She recommends the Australian Web site www.passportsupport.com, which costs about $15 Australian per year. ""This is the safest way to do it, which is more secure than you e-mailing it to yourself,"" said Kidder. Storing your passport data on a server offers higher security, she said, because the data is encrypted. In addition to passport documents, such services also will safely store data for tickets, drivers licenses, medical papers and lists of critical contacts. Passportsupport.com users are asked to scan their documents in jpg files. Users can then upload these files to the passportsupport.com server with the Web site's interface. Kidder said she keeps copies of her documents in her luggage when traveling, and her passport secure in the hotel -- either in a self-service safe in the hotel room or a safe operated by the front desk. Rather than safes, Robert Siciliano, CEO of IDTheftSecurity.com, said he prefers to hold his passport himself. Siciliano said he always carries his passport (and other valuables) on him, even when he heads down to a beach to relax with his laptop. He says if you plan to go in the water, know that someone is waiting to steal your stuff. Invest in portable alarms and don't lose sight of your possessions. Siciliano said locking passports in a room safe leaves you open to the possibility of a forgotten combination. In those cases, a hotel will send someone to the room who can unlock the safe. Devices that unlock room safes can easily be bought online, Siciliano said. It's a good example of how many people can access your room and safe if they want to go through your stuff. ""There are people out there that are focusing on you not paying attention, on you being trusting, you being naive,"" he says. ""You're putting your faith and trust in someone who might have problems. People are flawed."" The best way to protect yourself is to buy a passport holder for $10-$20 and always keep it on you, Siciliano said. Wear it under a shirt and pull it out only if needed. Never put it in a backpack or a purse. Experts said preparation is most important; you need to do your research and have multiple copies of everything. ""I always have backup for my backup,"" Siciliano said.","American who lost passport in China: 'I was a wreck""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Nearly two out of three Americans approve of the job Barack Obama is doing as president, according to an average of the most recent national polls. President Obama is still being evaluated on how he does his job, CNN's polling director says. In a CNN Poll of Polls compiled Thursday, 64 percent of those questioned in various surveys say they approve of how Obama is handling his duties as president. Twenty-eight percent disapprove. The president's approval rating also stood at 64 percent in a CNN Poll of Polls compiled in January, just after his inauguration. ""Most polls have shown Obama getting fairly high marks on most of the issues he has handled so far,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""One exception has been the way he has handled government assistance to failing banks and automakers. His numbers on the federal deficit are also low in comparison to his approval ratings on the economy and foreign policy."" So how does Obama compare to his predecessors in the White House around the 100-day mark? George W. Bush stood at 62 percent in a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll in April 2001, Bill Clinton was at 55 percent in a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll in April 1993, George H.W. Bush stood at 58 percent in a Gallup poll from April 1989, and Ronald Reagan was at 67 percent in a Gallup poll taken in April 1981.  Learn more about previous presidents' approval ratings » . ""The hundred-day mark tends to fall during a period when Americans are still evaluating a new president. The danger period for most presidents comes later in their first year in office,"" Holland explained. ""Bill Clinton, for example, still had good marks after his first 100 days, but his approval rating had tanked by June of 1993. Ronald Reagan's approval rating stayed over 50 percent until November of his first year in office, but once it slipped below that mark, it stayed under 50 percent for two years. So Obama's current rating certainly does not indicate that he is out of the woods yet."" The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of three national surveys taken over the past week: Gallup Tracking, Pew and AP/GfK.","64 percent of Americans in various polls approve of Obama's work so far .

"(CNN) -- Internet giant Google has been stopped from gathering images in Greek cities for its Street View service until it provides further guarantees about privacy. One of Google's Street View camera cars capturing images in central London. Launched in the U.S. two years ago, Street View provides users with access to 3-D ""pedestrian's-eye"" views of urban areas by zooming into the lowest level on its Google Maps and Google Earth applications. It has since been rolled out in more than 100 cities in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, Britain and the Netherlands. The images are obtained from cars specially-fitted with cameras that drive around towns and cities taking panoramic 360 degree shots of everything from pedestrians in the street, to customers sitting in street cafes. Despite pledging to recognize local privacy laws, Google has come under fire from privacy campaigners who fear the application could be abused by criminals or even snooping government agencies. Do you agree? Share your thoughts below . In April, a group of villagers in a picturesque English village chased away one of the search engine's camera cars as it attempted to photograph their homes. Fearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the Web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets, villagers in Broughton, north of London, summoned the police after blocking the car. A month earlier, the BBC reported that Google was forced to pull a number of images from Street View after receiving complaints about pictures that included a man entering a London sex shop, and a drunken reveler being sick at a bus stop. The search giant has now run into trouble in Greece after being blocked by the country's privacy watchdog from expanding its service there. The Hellenic Data Protection Authority wants further clarification from Google about how long it will store images for and the measures in place to make people aware of privacy rights. In a statement, a Google spokesperson told CNN: ""Street View has not been banned in Greece. We have received a request for further information from the Greek DPA and we are happy to continue discussing these issues with them and provide information they request. ""Google takes privacy very seriously, and that's why we have put in place a number of features, including the blurring of faces and license plates, to ensure that Street View will respect local norms when it launches in Greece. ""We believe that launching Street View in Greece will offer enormous benefits to both Greek users and the people elsewhere who are interested in taking a virtual tour of some of its many tourist attractions.""","Greek watchdog wants more information from Google about privacy measures .

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities have declared several coastal areas near Brisbane disaster zones after a massive oil spill earlier this week, according to the Queensland government. Large stretches of Queensland's coastline are being affected by the oil. ""This is a very serious situation,"" Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said, according to a news release on Friday. ""It appears the volume of oil involved is much greater than originally reported by the Pacific Adventurer. And the effect of the oil spill is more widespread."" The Pacific Adventurer sustained damage early Wednesday when Cyclone Hamish struck the waters of eastern Australia with more than 125 kph (77 mph) winds. The cargo ship lost 30 of its 50 containers of ammonium nitrate about 13 kilometers (8 miles) off the coast of Cape Moreton. Those containers are still missing. The damaged ship also spilled a large amount of oil that is covering at least 60 kilometers (37 miles) of beach in and around Brisbane, according to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).  Watch sludge washing up on shorelines » . The ship's owner, Swire Shipping, initially said no more than 42,000 liters (11,100 U.S. gallons) of oil escaped from the ship, but now says that ""substantially more oil was spilled,"" ABC reported Friday. The ship is currently in the custody of Australia's Maritime Safety Authority in Brisbane, as the investigation into the spill continues. A massive clean-up effort is also under way. So far, 13 oil-covered birds have been recovered, according to the Queensland government.","Pacific Adventurer sustained damage when Cyclone Hamish struck .

"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (CNN) -- Doug Ward drives through a subdivision made up of rows of trailers. You can hear the sadness in his voice as he says, ""This just doesn't feel like home."" He longs for the life he lived before devastating floods destroyed his Cedar Rapids neighborhood. The A&W Drive-In in Cedar Rapids was Doug Ward's life for 30 years. ""I want to come back. I miss (my friends) very much,"" Ward said as he escorted CNN on a tour of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, nearly a year after the floods. Ward, 64, is an institution in the historic Time Check neighborhood just across the Cedar River from downtown. He owns the A&W Drive-In on Ellis Boulevard, a fixture on this street since 1948. Historian Mark Stoffer Hunter calls the drive-in Cedar Rapids' ""Eiffel Tower."" ""It's been there for us over the decades,"" Hunter said. ""It's one of those landmarks that tells you you're in Cedar Rapids."" When floodwaters ravaged Cedar Rapids last June, Ward's drive-in drowned in almost 10 feet of water. Now, the drive-in sits in ruins. A&W root beer mugs covered in dried mud sit on the restaurant floor. The stench of floodwater lingers in the air. Putting together the pieces of Ward's life hit a snag in the fall of 2008 when an economic storm swept across the country. In a matter of months, the financial support Ward needed to rebuild dried up. ""Life's got to go on. If you sit and worry about it too much, you'd probably be at my funeral today,"" Ward said.  Watch as Ward talks about the devastation in Cedar Rapids » . Ward estimates that it will cost close to $1 million to rebuild the A&W Drive-In at its current location. He's been able to line up $350,000 in loans, but that's far short of what he needs. ""The idea that he might not be able to rebuild the business here, it hurts,"" said Stoffer, the Cedar Rapids historian. ""It's happening not just in this neighborhood, but in all the neighborhoods that were affected by the floods."" So now Ward spends a lot of time driving around Cedar Rapids scouting new locations. He wants to stay on Ellis Boulevard, but the surrounding neighborhood sits mostly empty. If people don't move back, then there are no customers to feed. ""If the neighborhood were normal again, we'd be up and running. But it's not,"" Ward said. Ward not only lost his business, but the house he and his wife lived in for 28 years was destroyed, too. The house today sits gutted. The flood weakened the foundation. Three estimates show it will cost $85,000 to make the needed repairs. FEMA gave the Wards $28,000 toward the costs of rebuilding their home or buying a new one. But without home insurance, it's another cost in Ward's mounting pile of financial troubles. Ward said if he can't get his business up and running soon, he'll have to find another job. He's tapped into retirement savings extensively, and he's received some financial support (he won't specify how much) from other sources. Ward is soft spoken, yet tough. He's faced difficult struggles all his life. His father died when he was 5. He dropped out of school after eighth grade to earn money for his family. At 13, he worked in a dry milk factory and spent 10 years working as a Coca-Cola delivery man. Owning the A&W Drive-In was a dream that produced a comfortable living. Now he misses the days serving his friends icy-cold root beers. But you won't hear him complain about the battle he's facing. ""I've been knocked around, but we'll get up and get going,"" he said.","The A&W in Cedar Rapids was Doug Ward's life for 30 years until last year's flood .

"(CNN) -- Police say they believe they know who killed a 31-year-old Southern Illinois woman and her two young sons, but are waiting for prosecutors to build a strong forensic case against the suspect before disclosing his identity. Chris and Sheri Coleman are shown with their two boys, Garret and Gavin. ""We don't have a warrant for his arrest at this time, so we don't feel it would be prudent to give his name out until the state's attorney determines whether or not there's enough to charge him,"" said Maj. Jeff Connor of the Major Case Squad. Connor heads the squad that is part of the St. Louis, Missouri, homicide task force. He made the comments during an appearance on HLN's Nancy Grace. Police found the bodies of Sheri Coleman and the children, Garret, 11, and Gavin, 9, in the bedrooms of their two-floor home in the St. Louis suburb of Columbia, Illinois, on the morning of May 7. Indications were they had been strangled. The killings shocked the suburb of about 10,000 residents.

""Shortly thereafter he started calling his house, realized that nobody was answering and on his way back at around 6:50 is when he made the phone call to the Columbia Police Department,"" Connor said.

"Editor's note: The Rev. Donald Cozzens is writer in residence and adjunct professor of theology at John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio. A priest of the Diocese of Cleveland with a doctoral degree, he is the author of several books on the Catholic Church, including ""Sacred Silence: Denial and the Crisis in the Church"" and ""Freeing Celibacy,"" both published by Liturgical Press. For another view on this topic, read here. The Rev. Donald Cozzens says the debate over celibacy for priests will be around for decades. (CNN) -- It's an issue that simply won't go away. In spite of signals from the Vatican discouraging even discussions of obligatory celibacy for Catholic priests, the almost 1,000-year-old rule is under the microscope. And it will be for decades to come. Here's why. In the Catholic tradition, even though sex is cast as sinful unless expressed in the conjugal embrace of husband and wife, it is held as fundamentally good, a part of God's creation. The church even holds that marriage (including spousal lovemaking) is a sacrament -- something sacred that contributes to the sanctity of husbands and wives. In light of this official teaching, it is dawning on many Catholics that mandatory celibacy for priests, a canonically imposed discipline of the church, is precisely that -- a discipline. They are asking, ""How is it that a discipline of the church has been allowed to trump a sacrament of the church?"" In effect, the church is saying that should God call a man to the priesthood, God will not, at the same time, call that individual to the sacrament of marriage. It's right to ask, how does the church know this? Public opinion surveys indicate that most Catholics, priests included, believe the discipline of celibacy needs a serious review. Recently the retired archbishop of New York, Cardinal Edward Egan, observed that obligatory celibacy is open for discussion. It is not, Egan noted, a matter of dogma. For decades now, bishops from Asia, Europe and the Americas have asked Vatican officials to consider optional celibacy for priests. The church's official response is consistent and succinct: As a precious gift from God, the discipline of celibacy for priests will remain in place. This, in spite of the inherent paradox lying just below the claim that the gift of celibacy is a precious gift of God to the priesthood and the church: How can a gift be legislated? The church answers that if a man is called to the priesthood, God will grant him the gift of celibacy. Many priests today wonder how church leaders know this. Reading the mind of God in this matter --  in any matter of church discipline -- is risky business. More and more Catholics today are coming to understand that celibacy as a universal law for priests had its origins in the 12th century and that during the church's first millennium, priests and bishops --  and at least thirty-nine popes -- were married. Still, most well-read cradle Catholics are surprised to learn that St. Anastasius, pope from 399 to 401, was succeeded by his son, Pope St. Innocent I, and that a century later Pope St. Hormisdas' son, St. Silverius, also was elected to the papacy. Even in our secular world, it's common to speak of church-based ministry as a calling, a vocation. Isn't it possible that God would call an individual to the priesthood and to the sacrament of marriage? God apparently did so for more than half the church's history. How do we know that God isn't doing so today? For some years now I've been teaching in the religious studies department at John Carroll University in Cleveland. I've asked dozens of serious, healthy young students if they have given any thought to being a priest. They seem flattered by the question. With only one exception, each has answered, ""Yes, I've thought about being a priest, but I want a family."" There are, of course, other factors, urgent and pressing, that will keep the celibacy issue alive. The Catholic priesthood is aging. The average age of active priests hovers at 60, and if retired priests are factored in, it is considerably higher. Moreover, Catholic seminaries are lucky to be half full. Parish staffing challenges alone will press for a review of the celibacy rule. Catholic bishops simply do not have enough priests to meet the pastoral and sacramental needs of the Catholic faithful. Closing and merging parishes may offer some temporary relief for overworked priests, but the shortfall of priests will continue to challenge the vitality of Catholic parishes and the health of Catholic clergy for decades to come. But the most human, existential factor that should keep the celibacy issue on the table is the spiritual and emotional health of priests. Celibacy really isn't the issue -- mandatory or obligatory celibacy is. There are many priests who do possess the gift of celibacy -- it is their ""truth"" so to speak -- and their humanity, warmth and pastoral effectiveness give abundant evidence of their authentic celibate lives. But there remain other priests who believe deep down they are called to the priesthood but not to celibacy. And for these men, the burden of mandated celibacy threatens their spiritual and emotional well-being. The priesthood may be their ""truth,"" but mandated celibacy wraps them in a cloak of loneliness and struggle. I don't know Father Alberto Cutie. He appears to have touched the lives of many and preached the gospel with power and conviction. I suspect he feels called by God to be a priest, but not a celibate priest. Surely he knows that Easter Rite Catholic priests are allowed to marry and that the church welcomes into the priesthood married convert ministers from other Christian denominations. Surely he knows that in many parts of the Catholic world, clerical celibacy is openly flouted, and church authorities choose not to notice. I wonder if church officials understand the burden they place on the shoulders of a man who believes he is called to priestly ministry but not to celibacy. Certainly, a married priesthood will have burdens of its own and, sadly, scandals of its own -- infidelity and abuse among others. But it should be left to the individual priest and seminarian to determine whether or not he is blessed with the gift of celibacy. A mandated ""gift,"" after all, is really no gift at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the Rev. Donald Cozzens.","The Rev. Donald Cozzens: Celibacy is 1,000 years old but not intrinsic to the church .
Many popes were married in the first millennium of the church, Cozzens says .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Pope Benedict XVI completed his eight-day tour of the Holy Land on Friday with an exhortation to both Israelis and Palestinians to work through their decades-old conflict. Pope Benedict XVI prays in Jerusalem on Friday at what's believed to be the burial site of Jesus. ""No more bloodshed! No more fighting! No more terrorism! No more war! Instead let us break the vicious circle of violence. Let there be lasting peace based on justice, let there be genuine reconciliation and healing,"" the pontiff said. Benedict made the comments at a farewell ceremony at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv before Israeli President Shimon Peres and other religious and secular leaders. In his concluding remarks, Benedict called his visit to Israel's Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem and his conversations with survivors a ""deeply moving encounter."" He seemed to address some criticism he received within the country for not speaking in stronger terms about anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. Referring to the Holocaust, Benedict spoke of the victims who ""were brutally exterminated under a godless regime that propagated an ideology of anti-Semitism and hatred."" After Benedict's Monday speech at Yad Vashem, the memorial's chairman, Holocaust survivor Rabbi Yisrael Lau, criticized the pope, saying the pontiff did not ""participate in the pain of the Jewish people"" and ""used the term 'killed' when talking about Holocaust victims and not the word 'murdered' as his predecessor did."" Benedict drew the ire of Jews and German Catholics earlier this year by rehabilitating an excommunicated bishop who had disputed the number of Jews killed in concentration camps during World War II. The bishop's excommunication was unrelated to his Holocaust denial. Friday, Benedict repeated his call for Palestinians to enjoy a ""sovereign independent homeland"" and ""to live in dignity and to travel freely."" He remarked that ""one of the saddest sights for me during my visit to these lands was the wall"" -- a reference to the 20-foot concrete barrier he saw in Bethlehem during his visit to a Palestinian refugee camp. Israel says the structure, which it calls a security fence, was built to prevent terrorist attacks; Palestinians consider it an illegal land grab. Benedict began the day with a busy morning in Jerusalem's Old City, including meeting the patriarchs of the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches. Between sessions with the patriarchs, Benedict toured and prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, believed to be located on the site where Jesus was crucified and buried. On his Middle East visit, the pope has navigated the region's treacherous political landscape, which often pits Jew against Muslim and Muslim against Christian. Benedict has repeatedly called for reconciliation between the peoples of the region during his visit, urging Israelis and Palestinian to put aside their grievances and divisions. ""Just and peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the Middle East can only be achieved through a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, in which the rights and dignity of all are acknowledged and upheld,"" the pope said. Celebrating Mass on Thursday, Benedict covered similar territory in his message to over 30,000 parishioners gathered at the Mount of the Transfiguration, outside Nazareth.  Watch the reaction of one visitor who attended Mass » . ""Christians readily join Jews, Muslims, Druze and people of other religions in wishing to safeguard children from fanaticism and violence, while preparing them to be builders of a better world,"" he said. Benedict's trip marks the first papal visit to some of Christianity's most holy places since Pope John Paul II made the pilgrimage in 2000.","NEW: Benedict XVI winds up Mideast trip with call for ""peace based on justice""

""So much of what we saw [during Monday night's program] was fundamentally indefensible. And if anyone in the game today is ignoring the importance of that message, then frankly they will need to find another career."" The allegations of group sex involved NRL personality Matthew Johns, who played for Cronulla at the time of the alleged incident in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Watch more on the scandal » . Johns was suspended indefinitely by the Nine Network on Wednesday. ""The fact is, whatever the arguments about the details of the New Zealand incident involving Cronulla players in 2002, the conduct and its aftermath was simply unacceptable, full stop,"" David Gyngell, Nine's chief executive officer, said in a statement on the network's Web site. ""I fully endorse David Gallop's comments concerning the indefensible conduct of some players and the lack of respect for women -- and the critical focus on all stakeholders to help eradicate it from our game."" ""I join with him in extending my apologies and sympathy to the young woman involved in the incident, who clearly is still distressed as a consequence,"" Gyngell said. In the ABC report, the then-19-year-old woman said she met Johns and his Cronulla teammate Brett Firman when she was working as a waitress. She said she went back to their hotel room, where she alleges six Cronulla players and staff had sex with her, while a half-dozen others watched. ""They were massive, like big rugby players. I felt that I just had no idea what to do. There was always hands on me,"" she said. ""I thought I was worthless, and I thought I was nothing. I think I was in shock. I didn't scream. They used a lot of mental power over me and belittled me."" Less than a week after the incident, the woman made a complaint to police and about 40 Cronulla players and staff were questioned, ABC reported. Those involved said the sex was consensual and no charges were filed. The woman told ABC she's speaking out now because she wants the wives and girlfriends of the players to know what they did. ""If I had a gun, I'd shoot them right now,"" she said. ""I hate them. They're disgusting."" Before the ABC report, Johns addressed the allegations last week on the Nine Network. ""It was an incident that was investigated by police. It caused all parties enormous pain and embarrassment,"" Johns said. ""For me personally, it's put my family through enormous anguish and embarrassment, and has once again. And for that, I just, I can't say sorry enough."" In his statement, Gallop pointed to NRL initiatives put in place since 2002 to promote positive attitudes toward women, including programs developed with the help of a rape crisis center. ""Rugby League means an enormous amount to millions of people and, in many ways, the football we see today and the strength of the competition is better than it has ever been,"" he said. ""No amount of on-field success, though, can take away from the need to face up to these issues.""","Allegations of group sex involved NRL personality Matthew Johns .

"(CNN)  -- At least 10 people were killed, and an unknown number remained missing Wednesday, after a boat authorities believe was used for human smuggling capsized off the coast of Florida. The Coast Guard said it rescued 26 people from a capsized boat off the coast of Florida. Almost all of the victims are believed to be from Haiti and the Bahamas, according to the U.S. Coast Guard -- which said a dangerous number of people was packed onto a small pleasure cruiser. The Coast Guard said it rescued 26 people from the boat, and searchers didn't know how many more people had been on the boat. ""You don't put 26 people on a small boat. It was way overloaded, completely unsafe,"" said Capt. Jim Fitton, the Coast Guard's sector commander in Miami, Florida. ""With smugglers, you have the potential for this because smugglers aren't interested in people's welfare. They're interested in making money."" The boat capsized about 15 miles east of Boynton Beach, Florida, some time around 2 a.m. Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. The agency was notified more than nine hours later by someone who saw the boat. There were women and children on the boat, Fitton said. A pregnant woman was taken to a hospital, while most of the victims remained onboard a Coast Guard cutter that was being used in the continuing rescue efforts, he said. Only eight of the people rescued by Wednesday afternoon were wearing life jackets. The Rev. Luke Harrigan, a Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, pastor to members of the Haitian community who is working with the Coast Guard, said he is contacting family members of the victims who were killed. ""Most of them now didn't even know they were coming to the United States,"" he said. ""Sometimes the person organizing the trip doesn't even tell them where they are going."" He said it's not uncommon for smugglers to charge people from the impoverished island nation as much as $4,000 for passage into the United States. Coast Guard rescuers were continuing to search the area of the crash Wednesday evening.","Coast Guard rescues 26; searchers unsure how many others missing .

"(CNN) -- The European Commission handed down its ruling in a landmark anti-trust case against Intel Wednesday, fining the computer chip giant a record  $1.45 billion for abusing its dominant position in the computer processing unit (CPU) market. On Wednesday the European Commission fined Intel a record $1.45 billion for violating anti-trust laws. The ruling, which Intel plans to appeal, may have future implications for American companies accused of ""jurisdiction shopping"" to avoid anti-trust verdicts against them, says CNN's Jim Boulden, who explains the basics of the Intel case. The commission has hit Intel with the biggest fine ever -- what were its reasons? The European Commission says Intel has been abusing its dominant market position in semiconductors for years. The EC says Intel has systematically given PC makers and stores rebates to keep computers with AMD chips off the shelves. AMD (another American company and Intel's only competitor) first raised the red flag in 2000. Why does the commission have the power to impose such fines? EU law does not regard market dominance as illegal, but it is allowed to fine a company that abuses its position as the biggest in any given market. It has a guideline of fining a company based on a percentage of profits. EU law is set up to ""protect consumers,"" and the anti-trust office says consumers were hurt. Yet as Intel likes to point out, consumers did not launch this case -- AMD, a competitor, launched this in Europe (and in Japan and South Korea) as the U.S. antitrust officials under George W. Bush were unlikely to pursue a case on these merits. The EU could fine Intel (or any company) based on 10% of global annual revenues, but chose to fine it on a smaller percentage made in the EU. Can Intel afford to pay this fine? What state is the company in at the moment? Intel reported first quarter revenue of $7 billion. It can easily afford this. Interestingly, it lost 4 percent of its market share to AMD so far this year. The company says it will appeal -- when is that likely to be heard? Another appeal will take months. Intel already appealed a preliminary part of this ruling last year and lost. Meanwhile, the EC can argue that Intel is still abusing its position and increase the fine during the appeals process, as it did to Microsoft. Intel is not the first tech company to be hit by the European Commission. What about Microsoft? The anti-trust unit has launched another round of investigations against Microsoft. It has already paid its fine and the EU continues to watch the company's behavior on the previous matters. What kind of precedent does the Intel case set? The EU has fined all kinds of cartels and market abusers, but rarely does it fine big American companies based on complaints from American competitors -- so the case catches the eye, especially with critics who accuse American companies of ""jurisdiction shopping"" to get a favorable outcome.","European Commission fines Intel a record $1.45 billion for anti-trust violation .

King: Movie of the week? Spelling: Right. Movie of the weeks. King: When did you know she had cancer? Spelling: I found out about a year -- when I first heard, I don't know if it was a year or two years ago when we first heard, and I contacted her. I hadn't talked to her in a while. She said, ""I'm going to be all right, Candy. Everything is going to be all right."" King: Why do you think, Candy, she did the documentary? Spelling: I think that she wanted to give other people courage that, you know, are fighting this kind of thing. I know how, you know, devastating the press, you know, was with Aaron when he had cancer. And it's just so difficult. And I mean, you know, it's hard to have a private life at that point. King: Why do the tabloids get so tough on someone in such pain? Spelling: It's news. It's kind of a sad thing. I'm always so sorry to see it.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The contentious debate over so-called enhanced interrogation techniques took center stage Wednesday on Capitol Hill as a former FBI agent involved in the questioning of terror suspects testified that such tactics -- including waterboarding -- are ineffective. From left: Sens. Lindsey Graham, Sheldon Whitehouse, . Patrick Leahy and Dianne Feinstein listen Wednesday. Ali Soufan, an FBI special agent from 1997 to 2005, told members of a key Senate Judiciary subcommittee that such ""techniques, from an operational perspective, are ineffective, slow and unreliable and harmful to our efforts to defeat al Qaeda."" Soufan's remarks followed heated exchanges between committee members with sharply differing views on both the value of the techniques and the purpose of the hearing. Soufan, who was involved in the interrogation of CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah, took issue with former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has said that enhanced interrogation techniques helped the government acquire intelligence necessary to prevent further attacks after September 11, 2001. The techniques, which the Bush administration approved, are considered torture by many critics.  Watch analysts discuss harsh interrogations and torture » . ""From my experience -- and I speak as someone who has personally interrogated many terrorists and elicited important actionable intelligence -- I strongly believe that it is a mistake to use what has become known as the 'enhanced interrogation techniques,' "" Soufan noted in his written statement. Such a position is ""shared by many professional operatives, including the CIA officers who were present at the initial phases of the Abu Zubaydah interrogation."" Soufan told the committee that within the first hour of his interrogation of Zubaydah, the suspected terrorist provided actionable intelligence. But once the CIA contractors took over and used harsh methods, Zubaydah stopped talking, Soufan said. When Soufan was asked to resume questioning, Zubaydah cooperated. After another round of more coercive techniques used by the contractors, however, Soufan said it was difficult for him to re-engage Zubaydah. One of four recently released Bush administration memos showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on Zubaydah and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the suspected planner of the September 11 attacks. ""People were given misinformation, half-truths and false claims of successes; and reluctant intelligence officers were given instructions and assurances from higher authorities,"" Soufan testified. ""I wish to do my part to ensure that we never again use these ... techniques instead of the tried, tested and successful ones -- the ones that are also in sync with our values and moral character. Only by doing this will we defeat the terrorists as effectively and quickly as possible.""  Watch as Soufan makes his case before the panel » . Soufan was hidden behind a protective screen during his testimony before the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Staffers for the committee cited ""documented threats"" against him, noting his previous interaction with al Qaeda terrorists as well as his undercover work against Islamic extremists. Philip Zelikow, who was a top aide to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, repeated an accusation during the hearing that Bush officials ordered his memo arguing against waterboarding to be destroyed. The order, ""passed along informally, did not seem proper, and I ignored it,"" Zelikow said. He said that his memo has been in State Department files and is being reviewed for possible declassification. Zelikow slammed the ""collective failure"" behind the government's adoption of ""an unprecedented program of coolly calculated dehumanizing abuse and physical torment to extract information. This was a mistake, perhaps a disastrous one."" He added that some ""may believe that recent history, even since 2005, shows that America needs an elaborate program of indefinite secret detention and physical coercion in order to protect the nation. ... If they are right, our laws must change and our country must change. I think they are wrong.""  Watch Zelikow tell CNN's Kiran Chetry how U.S. leaders came to the wrong conclusions on interrogation policy » . Committee Republicans warned that the hearing ultimately could contribute to diminished national security. ""As we harshly judge those who had to make decisions we don't have to make, please remember this: that what we do in looking back may determine how we move forward,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. ""And let's not unnecessarily impede the ability of this country to defend itself against an enemy who, as I speak, is thinking and plotting their way back into America."" A top intelligence source familiar with the Bush administration's interrogation program was dismissive of Soufan's credibility as a witness. ""It's puzzling that someone who questioned a single high-value detainee for just a few months claims to be able to talk about the value of a program that lasted nearly seven years after he was part of it,"" the source said. ""Suffice it to say, there are varying accounts of the facts and circumstances surrounding the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah."" Soufan wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in April arguing that there ""was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn't, or couldn't have been, gained from regular tactics."" He said that ""using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions. ... The short-sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process."" While at the FBI, Soufan was involved with investigations of sensitive international terrorism cases, including the East Africa bombings, the 2000 attack on the USS Cole and the September 11 attacks. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, opened the hearing by accusing Bush administration officials of lying about the use of techniques that had damaged the country's standing in the world.  Watch Whitehouse and Graham at the hearing » . ""The truth of our country's descent into torture is not precious. It is noxious. It is sordid,"" Whitehouse said. ""It has also been attended by a bodyguard of lies. ... President Bush told us America does not torture while authorizing conduct that America has prosecuted. ... Vice President Cheney agreed in an interview that waterboarding was like a dunk in the water, when it was used as a torture technique by tyrannical regimes from the Spanish Inquisition to Cambodia's killing fields.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- So much for Southern hospitality. The attack took place on April 27 at Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. When Pearl Jam -- the Seattle, Washington-based grunge rock band -- was in the Atlanta area late last month, bass guitar player Jeff Ament and a band employee were mugged outside a recording studio, a police report shows. According to the DeKalb County Police Department, Ament and Mark Anthony Smith were attacked shortly before noon on April 27 when they arrived at Southern Tracks Recording. Southern Tracks is the home base of producer Brendan O'Brien, with whom the band has worked before. According to Rolling Stone, the band is recording a new album with the producer. Three men reportedly emerged from a nearby wooded area wearing masks and brandishing knives. They smashed windows of the rented Jeep Commander, snatched a BlackBerry phone and other belongings, and demanded money, the police report shows. The suspects allegedly got away with more than $7,300 in goods and cash. Ament jumped from the passenger side of the vehicle and started to run, but he was chased by a suspect and knocked to the ground, said Mekka Parish, a public information officer with the police department.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- As Ryan O'Neal walked the red carpet at the premiere of ""Farrah's Story,"" he stopped every few feet to answer reporters' questions about Farrah Fawcett's battle with cancer. Farrah Fawcett was diagnosed with cancer three years ago. 'Farrah's Story,' a documentary on her battle, will air Friday. CNN's Douglas Hyde was at the end of the line and the last to interview the actor, who was almost in tears after a string of intense explanations about his longtime companion's condition. ""She was OK in the first interview, but now I'm worried,"" O'Neal said, visibly drained after focusing on Fawcett's battle. The documentary, which airs Friday night on NBC, is not a celebration of Fawcett's career, but an intimate look at her life since being diagnosed with anal cancer three years ago. ""Basically, it's a gonzo trip,"" O'Neal said. It was shot by Fawcett's close friend, Alana Stewart. ""It shows you every detail, how she found out and how she dealt with it,"" O'Neal said. Early in 2007, Fawcett said she was told her cancer had gone into remission. Her official Web site has posts from February 2007 celebrating the news. But the cancer returned later that year. Anal cancer affects more women than men, and the illness is usually found in people who are in their early 60s. The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,000 new cases of anal cancer are diagnosed each year and about 680 people die from it annually. While cancer keeps Farrah in her bed, a legal fight has begun over the documentary. Producer Craig Nevius filed a lawsuit this week against O'Neal and Stewart, claiming they stole creative control of the film from him. Nevius told CNN he was kicked off the project more than two months ago. ""I have been banned from talking to or seeing Farrah for about ten weeks, which is highly unusual, considering that healthy or sick, I spoke to this woman at least twice a day from the time of her diagnosis on,"" Nevius said. Nevius said his goal was to do the film ""based on Farrah's artistic visions that are a reflection of her and while at the same time maintaining and protecting her privacy to the extent that she wants it maintained and protected."" ""I take no joy in this,"" Nevius said. ""I tried to avoid this, but I am doing it for Farrah."" A spokesman for O'Neal called it ""horrific"" that Nevius would file the lawsuit. ""We hope and we pray that Farrah Fawcett does not find out about this lawsuit, because we know it would impact her health even more so,"" said O'Neal spokesman Paul Bloch. CNN's Douglas Hyde and Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.","Documentary ""Farrah's Story"" is a ""gonzo trip,"" Ryan O'Neal says .

"LONDON, (England) CNN -- Natalia Vodianova is best known as the supermodel who has graced the cover of Vogue, walked the catwalk for the likes of Chanel and Versace. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova's charity plans to build hundreds of play parks for children in her native Russia. But Vodianova has a dream that couldn't be further from the glitzy world of fashion -- to build 500 play parks in her native Russia. Vodianova, born and raised in Russia, was in the country during the 2004 Beslan school siege, in which at least 339 hostages, around half of them children, were killed. Deeply affected by the tragedy she returned to New York, where she was living at the time, determined to do something to help the surviving children. Vodianova organized a fundraising event that generated $350,000 to build the children a playground and she founded her charity, the ""Naked Heart Foundation."" With an ethos that play is not only therapeutic for children, but a necessity, the foundation aims to provide playgrounds for Russia's urban youth. So far the charity has built 23 playgrounds around the country, starting in her home town of Nizhnii Novgorod, and there are 15 more in the pipeline. ""For me, since I started my charity, it has been a very different way of life,"" Vodianova told CNN.  Watch Vodianova take CNN around Moscow » . ""Giving back just feels so great. I always try to open each play park with myself present for the children, because it makes it more special for them. I go to very remote parts of Russia are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love."" For Vodianova, this is just the start. She told CNN that her dream is to build 500 play parks in Russia. The charity's play parks can cost anywhere between $27,000 and $400,000, depending on their size and range of play equipment. Vodianova admits, ""It's a big dream -- an expensive one!"" When it comes to fundraising, Vodianova's secret weapon is her connections in the fashion world. Last year she organized a ""Love Ball"" in Moscow -- a Valentine's Day fundraiser that counted among the guests the likes of designer Valentino, actress Lucy Liu, singer Natalie Imbruglia, and supermodel Eva Herzigova.  See photos of ""The Love Ball."" » . The event was held in a former royal residence, Moscow's 16th century Tsaritsino Estate. It featured an ice palace made from 220 tons of ice and music provided by British band Razorlight, among others. The highlight was a Valentine's-themed auction, with lots including a private performance from rock star Bryan Adams, bought for $120,000, and a painting by British artist Damien Hirst called ""Love is All Around,"" which sold for $1.6 million. The auction alone raised $6.7 million for the charity. Vodianova admits that the global economic crisis is making it harder to get sponsorship for this year's event and says it will be more low-key than last year. ""We are not going to make it a very extravagant event; it's very disrespectful of what's going on in the world right now, with the recession and a lot of people losing their jobs. ""We're not gong to spend a lot of money on it, but it's important to keep going,"" she told CNN. With a husband and three young children, Vodianova says it can be hard to divide her time between family, career and her charity. She describes her charity work as a 24-hour job. ""I feel a huge sense of responsibility for my foundation because it's really very important to me. Somehow it became my most difficult baby to raise,"" she says. But she has no doubt about the value of her work, both for Russia's children and herself. ""The biggest thing I can do for my soul is to hear that laughter and to see all these children that come and play on the play parks that my foundation built.""

"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) -- The body of accused triple killer and University of Georgia professor George Zinkhan was claimed by a relative Friday, nearly a week after Zinkhan was found dead, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. A studio proof shows professor George Zinkhan and his wife, Marie Bruce. A mortuary shipping service in Atlanta picked up Zinkhan's body at the request of a son from a previous marriage, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said. Details on plans for the body weren't immediately available. Earlier Friday, Bankhead had said Zinkhan's body -- found Saturday in a self-dug shallow grave -- could be headed to a pauper's grave if the family didn't claim the body from the Athens-Clarke County coroner's office by Saturday morning. Such a grave is typically reserved for unidentified bodies, unclaimed bodies or people without family members. Bankhead said the situation was rare and that it was unclear why the family had taken that long to claim the body of the professor, described by colleagues and acquaintances as aloof and eccentric. Neighbor Bob Covington remembers a lot of ""forced moments"" with Zinkhan. The last such interaction came the afternoon of April 24, the day before witnesses said Zinkhan, 57, killed his wife and two others outside a community theater in Athens. Covington was walking down the driveway of his Bogart home to check the mail. Zinkhan had just done the same and was walking back to his house. Covington said hello and told Zinkhan that his son, a UGA student who used to mow the Zinkhans' lawn, had recently seen Zinkhan on campus. ""He said, 'Yeah, that's where I hang out,' and turned and walked into the house,"" said Covington, who lived next door to Zinkhan for eight years.""That's mostly what it was with George, forced moments."" It was odd for Zinkhan to say more than five or 10 words before disengaging, while his wife, Marie Bruce, was the ""polar opposite,"" Covington said, describing the 47-year-old thespian as engaging and vivacious. Despite the contrasts in personalities, Covington never saw evidence that there were problems between the two, he said. ""He never raised his voice at his kids. I never heard that. I never heard him raise his voice at Marie,"" he said. Neighbors, students and fellow faculty members all concur that Zinkhan was standoffish, but their accounts also paint a contradictory image of the marketing professor who would occasionally walk the halls of UGA's business college barefoot. Some faculty members were quick to defend Zinkhan, but reluctant to do so on record. One said he felt it was a university matter. Another was reluctant to be on record defending an accused mass killer. ""He's being painted as an ogre, which doesn't fit,"" said the former. Two faculty members said Zinkhan was introverted but friendly. He was close to some colleagues. He remembered their birthdays and was generous with gifts at Christmas. His quirky behavior was generally overlooked because of his brilliance, a colleague said. One fellow professor went so far as to call him a genius, and not just with marketing, either. Zinkhan apparently was well-versed in a wide range of topics -- art, opera, architecture -- and he loved sports. Faculty members recalled that the strapping 6-foot-2 Zinkhan played on the intramural softball team with some of his graduate students, and he liked to boast of his home runs. He also loved his son, 8, and daughter, 10, and regularly brought them to work. Neighbors said they saw him outside playing soccer with the kids on a miniature goal that still sat in the yard this week. A basketball goal with a rim a foot or two below regulation stood over the Zinkhans' driveway, and a miniature yellow house sat dormant in his wooded backyard. A neighbor who asked not to be named said the cedar front door on the house Tuesday was new. A SWAT team had burst through the old front door shortly after Zinkhan allegedly shot Bruce; attorney Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63. Bruce was the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, a theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater's deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater. Covington saw Zinkhan shortly after the April 25 slayings. He was grilling bratwursts for lunch when Zinkhan rang the doorbell. ""He asked if I'd mind watching the kids because there'd been an emergency,"" Covington said. Covington agreed. He thought it was strange when Zinkhan immediately sprinted out of the garage, but didn't pay it much attention because Zinkhan said he had an emergency. The children, Covington said, seemed oblivious that their mother had just been slain. It was less than an hour later, when Covington's wife noticed two police officers with shotguns behind the hedges in a nearby yard, that Covington learned his neighbor was accused of a triple killing. The police told Covington they were looking for Zinkhan in connection with the shootings. ""I was incredulous,"" he said. Covington's daughter, who had baby-sat for the Zinkhans, drew a floor plan of the Zinkhan home for police and told them where the spare key was hidden. Covington allowed police to use his home in their stakeout and summoned Zinkhan's daughter to see whether she knew anything about what had happened. It was clear the girl hadn't seen the slayings, but one of her remarks was chilling, Covington said. Asked what her father's emergency involved, she replied, ""Something about a firecracker."" Though many expressed astonishment that Zinkhan was linked to the slayings, some UGA faculty members said they suspected Zinkhan was having problems at home before police confirmed it this week. He lost an estimated 50 pounds in the two months before the shootings, they said. To others, the signs of problems were more obvious. Professor Barbara Carroll, who had once worked under Zinkhan, wrote an e-mail to her colleagues at the business school saying she went into protective custody after police found a map to her house in Zinkhan's vehicle. In the e-mail, she said she had told previous department heads, deans and provosts ""that George Zinkhan was dangerous."" ""Many people in this college and this department have known about Zinkhan's 'troubled past' and did nothing about it. Those people also bear responsibility here,"" she wrote. Carroll did not return phone messages or open her door for reporters Tuesday. However, one of Zinkhan's former students said he and his classmates also thought Zinkhan was more than just odd. David Sackin, 43, was a graduate student and took classes with Zinkhan in 1996 and 1997. Zinkhan's lectures were delivered in monotone, his teaching style was dry and he didn't seem to care what was happening in the classroom, Sackin said. When students convened outside the classroom, they surmised that something darker than a lack of enthusiasm drove Zinkhan's behavior, he said. ""If anyone asked any of my classmates if there was one professor who'd go on a rampage, who would it be? They'd unanimously say Zinkhan,"" Sackin said.""He was strange, definitely."" In her e-mail, Carroll told colleagues they may never know the whole story. Indeed, police have said only that one of the victims, Tanner, ""appeared to be a specific target in the shootings and was shot first."" The prospect of learning specifics about what could have propelled a painfully private introvert to homicide probably died in a shallow grave behind a Bogart elementary school.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida state investigation has determined that 31 crosses on the grounds of a former reform school mark graves of teens and employees who died in a fire and an influenza outbreak. Crosses mark graves of reform school students killed in a fire and flu outbreak in the early 1900s, investigators say. One grave even contains the body of a student who was slain by another student, the investigation found. The five-month investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement rules out claims by a group of reform school survivors that students who were beaten by guards are buried there. The former students, now in their 60s, call themselves the ""white house boys,"" after a concrete-block building where boys were taken for punishment. They said that they witnessed murders, and that students suddenly disappeared after they suffered severe beatings at the school, in Marianna, Florida, in the 1950s and '60s. The men believed the graves, marked only by white steel crosses that are rusting with time, were those of the teens who were beaten and killed by reform school workers and administrators. But authorities found documents that pointed to the fire and the flu outbreak. They said they plan no exhumations. ""This is our conclusion, based on what we know today,"" said Mark Perez, the chief of investigations for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. ""Enough information has been corroborated on who is buried there. We went and identified all of the individuals who perished while in custody,"" he said. The FDLE released its results in an 18-page investigative report. It says that no information confirms that any of the administrators or workers at the facility contributed to the deaths of any of the students. Their investigation into the charges of physical abuse, made by the former reform school students, continues. However, the investigators concluded that claims by the former students of slayings and disappearances of boys could not be corroborated. ""None of the former students were able to provide any first-hand information which would have identified any of these alleged victims, or the persons responsible for their purported demise,"" the report states . Roger Kiser is one of the former students who pushed for the investigation. He's written a book on the alleged abuse at the school and says that the FDLE has yet to contact him, despite, he says, witnessing two deaths at the school. ""My personal feeling is that the State of Florida does not want to know the truth. It is just too horrible a tragedy for the general public to learn about,"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Florida's governor, Charlie Crist, had ordered an investigation to determine who is buried in the 31 unnamed graves. The graves are in a secluded area on the property of what was the Florida School for Boys in Marianna, a town near the Georgia border. The FDLE says that records have determined that the cemetery was known to everyone back in the early 1900s, and the details got lost in time. ""There was enough information available to establish their identities and the cause of death,"" said Mark Perez of the FDLE. However, the FDLE has not been able to determine why the graves are not marked with headstones or any other identifiers. ""That's the million-dollar question. We can't find any records why they weren't marked,"" he said. But records have determined that the remains are those of boys who died in a fire at the reform school in 1914. Many of these victims were orphans and indigents whose families could not afford to have the bodies shipped home. And so, the FDLE said, they were buried at the school. Others died in a flu epidemic, in about 1918. According to the FDLE, among the remains are those of one reform school boy who was slain by another student. Other graves are those of pets. The deaths were reported extensively in local news coverage, and even in a newsletter that was published, at the reform school, called ""The Yellow Jacket.""","NEW: Investigation continues into whether staff abused boys in 1960s .

"(CNN) -- The body of their 2-year-old granddaughter, Caylee Anthony, was found in Florida in December. And their daughter, Casey Anthony, is charged in her death. She could be executed if convicted. It's a case that has gripped America. George and Cindy Anthony, parents of murder suspect Casey Anthony, on ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday. George and Cindy Anthony answered their critics in an exclusive interview on ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday night. Appearing with their lawyer, Brad Conway, they talked about whether they still support their daughter completely and what their lives have been like under the media glare. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: We are amazed because we've received -- get this -- thousands of blog responses to your appearance here tonight. And, honestly, most of them are critical. Why do you think people are angry at you? Cindy Anthony: Because they don't understand. They've never been in our shoes. So a lot of people, especially bloggers, ... like to pick things apart. And, you know, we're a target. King: But what are they picking apart? Cindy Anthony: They're picking apart the fact that we're standing behind our daughter. They're picking apart the fact that we are trying to make something out of Caylee's tragedy. King: Do you talk to Casey a lot? Cindy Anthony: I haven't spoken to Casey in person since October the 14th. We write. King: Why not? Cindy Anthony: Because every time we go to the jail to see her, it's videotaped and then it's all over ""Nancy Grace"" and, you know, the six o'clock news. King: How do you explain the body being found so close to home? Cindy Anthony: I can't explain it. I don't know if anybody can right now.  Watch how Anthonys cope with granddaughter's death, daughter's incarceration » . King: But you have thoughts, don't you, George? George Anthony: Well, I mean there's so many things I really would like to know, but there's a lot of things I just don't know. King: But you've got to ask. George Anthony: I wish I had an opportunity to talk to my daughter. But, again, we don't have that chance. King: But logically, if she's not involved, what could be said that could harm her? Cindy Anthony: You know, people pick everything apart. If Casey cries, she's not crying enough. If she smiles at us like she did in court the first time she saw us, then she's smiling for the wrong reasons. King: [Caylee's] body is stuffed in a laundry bag. The skull is wrapped in duct tape. Could you imagine your daughter would do that? Cindy Anthony: No. Attorney Brad Conway: The duct tape probably was not wrapped around the skull. We know that there was no flesh and no hair attached to the duct tape, yet that's what goes out in the media and that's what people assume to be true. And that's the unfair part: This young lady has not had her opportunity in court, yet people have drawn conclusions from discovery that's out there. King: Cindy, the meter reader who found the body alerted the authorities as far back as August about a suspicious bag. This tip wasn't acted on. Do you think there would be any difference if the body were found earlier? Cindy Anthony: I'm sure there would be, if she was really there back in August. I'm not convinced of that yet. King: Are you trying to find a murderer? I mean do you have a private detective? Cindy Anthony: We have a private investigator who's still investigating Caylee's disappearance. The defense has private investigators. And we're leaving them to their job. King: Brad, is this a rock and a hard place [for George and Cindy Anthony]? Conway: It is. What the Anthonys are trying to do is deal with the grief of the loss of their granddaughter while trying to help other people out. And, unfortunately, there are going to be a lot of people that go through what they go through. The only way to take a negative thing and make a positive is share their grief publicly and let people know that it's OK to do this. King: The Anthonys have written a Web exclusive [for CNN] responding to their critics. You won't see it anywhere else. See the Anthonys' blog and comments from readers . King: Did you ever try to harm yourself? Cindy Anthony: I wrote suicide notes, but I never acted on it. King: Because? Cindy Anthony: You know, when you are away from someone and something is ripped out of your life so suddenly ... Imagine a child -- not having that child around. And, weeks into it, not knowing where she was and what had happened to her was devastating. It was hard to get up in the morning and, you know, go on with your day. King: What stopped you? Cindy Anthony: My faith. You know, I knew that's not the right thing to do. King: Do you completely believe she didn't do it? Cindy Anthony: Yes, I do. King: Completely? Cindy Anthony: Yes. I see the love in Casey's eyes. Every single picture that you see of Caylee and Casey together, you can see the love in their eyes. King: Cindy, you were the first to call authorities last July to say you hadn't seen Caylee for a month and that your daughter's car smelled like it had a dead body in it. Didn't you worry that that would be kind of presumptive from the state to make a case out this? Cindy Anthony: You know, Larry, on July 15th, all I wanted was the police department out to my house out to help me look for Caylee. King: Did you smell the smell? Cindy Anthony: I smelled a smell in the car. I smelled it in my refrigerator with sour food. King: Do you have any idea why [Casey] didn't call police all the time her daughter was missing? Cindy Anthony: I can't answer that. Casey was probably grieving as best as she could. It doesn't make her guilty. King: No, but weird. Cindy Anthony: It doesn't make her guilty. Yes, but a lot of people do weird things under stress, under tragedy. So it doesn't make you guilty. King: Would you favor that whoever did this crime should face the death penalty? Cindy Anthony: You know, I'm not a fan of the death penalty for anybody. King: George? George Anthony: I'm opposed to it. King: Let's take a call. Caller: I have a question for the Anthonys. What will they do if their daughter is found guilty? Will they still support her or will they cut all ties? Cindy Anthony: I can't cut tie from my own flesh and blood, so no. King: Do you expect to testify, George? George Anthony: I'm sure we'll be in court when everything comes, probably sometime next year. King: Do you think they'll be called, Brad, both? Conway: Yes, sir, they will. Another caller: Where do you find the strength to support your daughter when everyone seems to be against her? Cindy Anthony: You know, my faith has gotten stronger and stronger every day through these last nine months.","George and Cindy Anthony say media attention prevents them from visiting Casey .

"Editors' Note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's new autobiography ""My Remarkable Journey"" published by Weinstein Books. Larry King anchors ""Larry King Live at 9 p.m. ET on CNN. In 1959, Bobby Darin, left, was Larry's first major guest on his WKAT radio program. Larry Zeiger left Brooklyn, New York, for Miami Beach, Florida, at the age of 23 to try to find a job in radio. This is how he got his new name: . I went to stay with my Uncle Jack in Miami Beach. I was so excited that I started knocking on doors the next day. I stopped at a small station on First Street, WAHR. The guy in charge liked my voice. ""We get a lot of people coming and going,"" he told me. ""If you hang around, you'll get the first opening."" I sat and watched in fascination for a few weeks. It was a tiny operation, but the sight of the UPI and AP machines furiously clicking out news made me feel like I was on the brink of something big. Miami Beach was like a dream. The palm trees. The ocean. I remember walking past Joe's Stone Crab. Joe's is more than a restaurant, it's a landmark. It was full when I arrived in 1957, and I guarantee you, people will be waiting in line tomorrow night. I stopped outside the front window with only a few dollars in my pocket, unable to afford a meal, looking at the happy faces, wondering what it would take to get into a place like that. Then came my big break. There was a morning deejay named Tom Baer. He was making sixty dollars a week and his alimony was sixty-five. He claimed to be living off the coconuts falling from trees. He quit on a Friday, and the general manager told me I could start on Monday. I must have rehearsed the entire weekend. I don't even think I slept. On Monday morning I showed up at WAHR with the record that would play my theme song, ""Swingin' Down the Lane."" The general manager called me into his office to wish me good luck. ""By the way,"" he said, ""what name are you going to use?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""You can't use Larry Zeiger,"" he said. ""It's too ethnic. People won't be able to spell it or remember it. You need a better name."" There was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say. I was going on the air in five minutes. The Miami Herald was spread out on his desk. Face-up was a full-page ad for King's Wholesale Liquors. The general manager looked down and said, ""King! How about Larry King?"" ""OK,"" I said. This was the opportunity of a lifetime. I wasn't going to blow it. ""Fine. You'll host The Larry King Show."" Nine o'clock was approaching. That's when the news came on. A few minutes later, The Larry King Show would make its debut. I went through the control-room door, sat down, and set up my record. The news ended. I started my theme song, then faded down the music so I could introduce myself. I opened my mouth. It was as dry as cotton. For the first time in my life, I couldn't speak. So I brought ""Swingin' Down the Lane"" up again and faded it once more. Again, not a single word came out of my mouth. I could only wonder if listeners were hearing the pounding of my heart. I'd waited for this moment my whole life. How could I be blowing it? Once more, I cranked up ""Swingin' Down the Lane"" -- but not a word came out of me. The next thing I knew, the general manager was kicking open the door to the control room. ""This is a communications business!"" he roared in a way that only a general manager can. Then he turned, walked out, and slammed the door behind him. Shaken, I leaned in to the microphone and said, ""Good morning. This is my first day ever on the radio. I've always wanted to be on the air. I've been practicing all weekend. A few minutes ago, they gave me my new name. I've had a theme song ready to play, but my mouth is dry. I'm nervous. And the general manager just kicked open the door and said, 'This is a communications business!'"" That's how my career started on May 1, 1957. Years later, Arthur Godfrey would tell me, ""The only secret in this business is...there is no secret."" He was right. I learned a great lesson on my first day. There's no trick to being yourself. I don't think I've ever been nervous on the air since then.","Larry Zeiger moved from Brooklyn to Miami in 1957 in pursuit of a radio hosting gig .

"(CNN) -- European intelligence agencies are on alert for new al Qaeda terrorist plots following the arrest of two men at an Italian port and investigations into the activities of an alleged al Qaeda network based in Brussels. Bassam Ayachi officiated at the wedding of Malika el Aroud (pictured), who became an al Qaeda ""icon."" The two are closely tied to a Brussels-based al Qaeda recruiting network, Belgian counter-terrorism officials have told CNN. They are Bassam Ayachi, 62, and Raphael Gendron, 33 -- and they were detained in the port of Bari on November 11 last year after allegedly trying to smuggle three Palestinians and two Syrians into Italy in the false bottom of a camper van they were driving. Now they face much more serious allegations following a counter-terrorism investigation by Italian, French and Belgian police. Italian authorities have officially charged them with being leaders of a logistical support team for al Qaeda. A bug planted by Italian police in the suspects' detention facility picked up snatches of conversation about an alleged scheme to attack Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. A partial transcript of one of their alleged conversations has now been released. ""I'll hit de Gaulle,"" Gendron tells Ayachi. ""We'll hit it there,"" Ayachi replies. ""At night when there will be a lot of people."" Later in the conversation they appear to discuss buying grenades off contacts in the Middle East. French authorities have said that they were never aware of a concrete plot to attack the airport. Italy suspects well known to Belgian Security Services . Ayachi and Gendron were detained after Italian authorities allegedly found Jihadist propaganda in their possession when they arrived on a ferry from Greece. Belgian police say they alerted Italian authorities that the pair were known extremists. Ayachi is a naturalized French cleric of Syrian descent, and in the early 1990s had founded the Centre Islamique Belge (CIB), an organization Belgian authorities say espoused hard-line Salafist and pro al Qaeda views. Gendron, described by Italian police as a computer expert, was the main administrator of the CIB's Web site in Belgium. In 2006 Gendron and Ayachi's son Abdel Rahman Ayachi were convicted in Belgium for posting threatening anti-Semitic messages on the site. Their prison sentences were later reduced to a fine by an Appeals court. A Belgian counter-terrorism source tells CNN that the CIB has clandestinely continued its operations in Belgium. When CNN reporters visited its headquarters on the Rue Memling in Brussels in February, Islamists appeared to still occupy the premises. In previous interviews with Belgian journalists, Avachi said his organization concentrated on pastoral care for Muslims in Brussels and did not promote pro-al Qaeda views. In April 1999 Ayachi officiated at the wedding of two protégés at CIB, Abdessattar Dahmane and Malika el Aroud. The couple would later become ""icons"" of the al Qaeda movement, according to Belgian counter-terrorism officials. Two days before 9/11, Dahmane assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the head of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, in a suicide bombing operation in Afghanistan. After his death Malika el Aroud, a Belgian citizen of Moroccan descent who had accompanied him to Afghanistan, returned to Europe and founded Minbar.SOS -- a Web site promoting Bin Laden's Jihad. She also remarried. In a CNN interview in 2006 el Aroud demonstrated how she and her new husband Moez Garsallaoui ran the site, which contained postings of attacks on coalition troops in Iraq and translations of the speeches of al Qaeda leaders. Alleged recruitment for training in Pakistan . According to Belgian police el Aroud and Garsallaoui moved to Brussels in 2007 and worked in tandem to recruit operatives to train in the tribal areas of Pakistan. El Aroud, it is alleged, inspired young men to volunteer for Jihad through her incendiary Web postings. Garsallaoui, the police say, went out to the streets to recruit people. El Aroud was arrested last December in Brussels and charged along with five others with participation in a terrorist group. She denies the charge. El Aroud and Garsallaoui allegedly recruited six individuals in all, four from Belgium and two from France, according to legal documents obtained by CNN. Those documents include the interrogation report of one of the French recruits who traveled to Pakistan and was arrested when he returned to Europe. The recruit, who can only be named by his initials W.O., told French authorities that several members of their traveling group including Garsallaoui, were given explosives training by al Qaeda trainers in Pakistan's Federally Administered tribal areas early in 2008. During the two-week course, according to the legal documents, W.O. alleged that Egyptian and Syrian instructors taught them how to assemble weapons, fire rocket launchers, and how to handle explosives. One trainer even set off a small charge of TNT in demonstration, telling them that the explosive was used to attack U.S. convoys in Afghanistan and in suicide vests. Belgian security services went on high alert after members of the group started to return from the tribal areas in late 2008, concerned they might have been tasked to launch attacks in Europe. According to [Belgian] counter-terrorism sources, the trigger for the Brussels arrests was an intercepted e-mail sent by one of the alleged recruits, Hicham Beyayo, in early December shortly after he returned to Belgium. The e-mail allegedly suggested that Beyayo had been given the green light to launch an attack in Belgium. However no explosives were recovered by Belgian police, and some terrorism analysts are skeptical that an attack was imminent. Beyayo's lawyer Christophe Marchand told CNN the email was merely ""tough talk"" to impress an ex-girlfriend. Belgian authorities continue to insist that the alleged cell was a potential national security threat. The alleged role of Ayachi and Gendron . A senior Belgian intelligence source told CNN that Ayachi and Gendron -- the two men detained in Italy -- were known to provide ideological support for members of the alleged Brussels terrorism network, but at this time were not suspected of having played a direct role in recruiting young European Muslims for training in Pakistan. Questions on their role, however, have been raised by a new revelation by Italian investigators, who allege that when they were arrested, Ayachi and Gendron were carrying the last will and testament of Beyayo, whose e-mail had caused such alarm. In the alleged will Beyayo made clear he was ready for martyrdom. ""When you hear of my death...don't wear black and most importantly don't display my photo,"" Beyayo purportedly wrote. ""I will emigrate to the field of Jihad to triumph for the religion of God, to defend the Muslim countries and to protect the sacred lands of the Muslims. And I will be a great help to the Mujahedeen brothers."" Marchand told CNN that such a document in no way indicated that his client was preparing an attack in Europe. [He said Beyayo had traveled to the tribal areas of Pakistan to fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan, not to become an al Qaeda operative]. ""Writing a will was hardly unusual behavior for somebody whose aim was to go and fight jihad in Afghanistan,"" Marchand said. According to Belgian counter-terrorism officials, Ayachi's CIB and Malika el Aroud's Web site served as focal points for many of those linked to the alleged Brussels network. The officials say that, Ayachi, Gendron, el Aroud, Garsallaoui and Beyayo belonged to a tight-knit 20-30 strong community of militants in Brussels. CNN, through its own investigation and through Belgian legal and police sources, has identified the user names under which several of these individuals, including Gendron, Garsallaoui and Beyayo posted messages on El Aroud's site Minbar SOS. Continued security concerns . According to Belgian counter-terrorism officials, three of the seven individuals who traveled to the Afghan-Pakistan border region in 2008 for training are still at large in the area. Some European counter-terrorism officials believe this is a significant security concern, given the Brussels network's track record In smuggling people into Europe. In an interview with CNN, Alain Winants, the director of Belgian Intelligence said: ""Every secret service will tell you that individuals who are already radicalized and who are in addition are being specialized in some fighting techniques or techniques of propaganda are representing a big risk when they come back."" Those still at large, Belgian counter-terrorism sources say, include Moez Garsallaoui, (Malika el Aroud's husband) who they believe has developed close ties with the top leadership of al Qaeda in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Belgian counter-terrorism officials told CNN that Garsallaoui was in regular email contact from the region with his wife before her arrest last December. According to a lawyer briefed on the legal dossier in the Belgian case, in June 2008 Garsallaoui allegedly sent el Aroud an e-mail claiming to have killed five Americans in Afghanistan. His wife congratulated him, according to the legal source. Garsallaoui also purportedly posted messages on el Aroud's radical Web site from the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan, including a message posted last September urging militants in Europe to launch attacks. ""The solution my brothers and sisters is not fatwas but boooooooms,"" the posting stated. The posting was discovered by CNN under Garsallaoui's purported user name on the Minbar SOS Web site. Earlier this week Garsallaoui purportedly posted a new statement on Minbar.SOS. In the message which was entitled ""We Need You"" he said he had joined up with Taliban forces who were making raids against American troops in Afghanistan from the tribal areas of Pakistan. ""The Jihad is going well and the Taliban are stronger than ever, they are gaining territory every day and more important than that they are winning the trust of the local population,"" he claimed. But Garsallaoui purportedly also had this sobering message for Belgian authorities: . ""If you thought that you could pressure me to slow down through the arrest of my wife you were wrong. It won't stop me fulfilling my objectives...those who laugh last, laugh more.""","Italy arrests of two men spurs European terror alert .

"(CNN) -- He's the man who helped make ""Slumdog Millionaire"" an international hit, scoring the soundtrack of the Oscar winning film. Despite his performance at the Oscars ceremony and being caught up in all the glitz and adulation, Rahman is a reluctant star. Feeling like a millionaire: AR Rahman picked up two Oscar's for best original song and best score. He's worked on films since he was a teenager, taking over the role of family breadwinner after his father died and followed in his footsteps as a composer. While he had stints writing advertising jingles in India, composing for films has been his life's work so far, yet from his studio in Chennai he admitted to CNN he didn't want to score films. ""I kept saying next year I'll quit, next year I'll quit. And finally because I was sucked into it more and more, now I have the Oscars"" he said. His Oscar performance and acceptance speech was one of the most memorable at this year's awards. ""I thought if I get it I'll be quiet, if I don't get it I'll be quiet, so I was training my mind not to get over-emotional. So when I first got it I didn't feel it at all, it was like a rehearsal for me. When I finished my performance then I felt at ease and then I became very philosophical as you know, and I chose love over hate and all this stuff,"" he told CNN. Feted by many in media, his hit ""Jai ho"" was covered by the Pussy Cat Dolls, but the softly spoken Rahman doesn't find it hard to remain grounded. Rahman runs a music school in Chennai, the KM Music Conservatory that keeps him motivated and reminds him that music has a potency that can transform lives. ""Music can do so many things. I have my foundation, I have my music school. I have people teaching, kids are learning, so I take this as an advantage, the popularity and taking that and putting it into good things, which motivated me to work harder,"" he said. As well as working on more Hindi films, Hollywood beckons, if only for a new experience. There have also been rumors he may score the next James Bond film. ""I have a couple of offers from Hollywood. Pure American movies which I thought for the heck of it let's do it and a couple of other surprises that you'll know very soon if it works out. Big surprises I think,"" he said.","Oscar-winning composer scored the soundtrack for 'Slumdog Millionaire'

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the Bush administration's controversial system of military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees. President Obama says the commissions are OK, ""provided that they are properly structured and administered."" On the heels of Obama's shift this week to block the release of photos showing prisoners allegedly being abused by U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military commissions announcement further infuriated the president's most ardent supporters while winning cautionary praise from some of his political foes. Obama said he supports the idea of the military commissions but opposes the version of the law that had been governing such trials in recent years: the Military Commissions Act put in place under the Bush administration in 2006, but subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The president said military commissions ""are appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war, provided that they are properly structured and administered."" But, he said, the 2006 act ""failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined our capability to ensure swift and certain justice against those detainees."" He said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor. Statements that have been obtained from detainees through interrogation and cruel treatment, such as waterboarding, will no longer be admitted as evidence before the commissions, Obama said, and hearsay evidence will be limited. The revised system also will give detainees greater latitude in selecting legal representation and afford basic protections to those who refuse to testify. Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts. ""These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law,"" Obama said. He said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, applauded his former opponent. ""Today's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at Guantanamo and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security,"" McCain said in a written statement. But Obama's announcement infuriated some of his core supporters -- with the revisions hardly calming the concerns of groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU chided the military commission decision as ""a striking blow to due process and the rule of law."" ""These military commissions are inherently illegitimate, unconstitutional and incapable of delivering outcomes we can trust,"" said Anthony D. Romero, the group's executive director. ""Tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide 'more due process' is absurd; there is no such thing as 'due process light.' "" he said. ""If the administration's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements, there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system. If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy."" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States. ""First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,"" Gibbs told reporters. Obama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process. The review deadline is next week. Gibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil. Nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions. Three Guantanamo detainees' cases have gone through the commission so far. The Bush administration established the military trial system after the U.S. military began capturing detainees in Afghanistan in late 2001. The next year, it opened the Guantanamo facility, saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system. But legal organizations and human rights agencies have repeatedly challenged the system on grounds that detainees were mistreated. One lawyer representing a client at Guantanamo said closing the detention facility, which Obama is advocating, is a ""meaningless gesture"" if the military commissions continue. ""The military commissions are fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed,"" said Army Maj. Jon S. Jackson, a lawyer for Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of five 9/11 defendants charged in the military commission process. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, is the most high-profile of those defendants.","Obama revives Bush system that was suspended in January .

"(CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom should leave office during the investigation into whether he was connected to three recent slayings, his 2007 presidential opponent said Thursday. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom has said he has no intention of giving up power over the slayings inquiry. Retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina, who lost to Colom in a runoff, said Guatemala is suffering its worst crisis since the democratic process began in 1985 after years of civil war. Demonstrations will continue and anger will mount unless Colom temporarily steps out of the way to allow an unblemished probe, he said. ""We want an impartial investigation, a transparent investigation,"" Perez told CNN. ""The president must leave his post."" The crisis started Monday with the surfacing of a video in which Guatemalan attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg said Colom, the president's wife and a top aide would be responsible if something happened to the lawyer. Rosenberg was gunned down Sunday while riding his bike in Guatemala City. He had recorded the video last week. Rosenberg was being threatened with death, he said, because he had blamed Colom and his associates for the April slayings of a prominent businessman and his daughter. Rosenberg had represented the businessman. They were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted. ""It's the time-honored tradition in Guatemala that if someone gets in your way, there's likely to be a violent outcome,"" said Donald J. Planty, the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala from 1996 to 1999. Colom took to the airwaves Monday night to vehemently deny that he, his wife or the aide had any connection to the slayings. He promised a full investigation and said he would accept international help, asking the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to become involved. A Guatemalan newspaper reported Thursday that an FBI agent had arrived in the country in connection with the investigation. But Rosenberg supporters say they don't believe the Guatemalan government can carry out an impartial and thorough investigation and want Colom out. Perez said Vice President Jose Rafael Espada could take over until the investigation is complete. ""We are only asking that the state be strengthened,"" Perez said. ""If he doesn't do this, we believe the situation will get worse."" Colom said in an interview Tuesday night with CNN en Español that he has no intention of resigning or otherwise giving up power. He blamed the deaths on unnamed people who want to bring down his government. ""It is evident that [Rosenberg's video statement] was written by someone who has been in on this plan to destabilize the government and for reasons that I don't know, because I don't know why Mr. Rosenberg mentions us in that video,"" Colom said. For Perez and other critics, that's not good enough. ""The president has not wanted to confront this and has given evasive answers,"" Perez said. ""Until the president confronts this, indignation will increase."" Some analysts say Colom needs to get the nation under control immediately. ""It's a very worrisome situation,"" said Planty, the former U.S. ambassador. ""The country is in very serious trouble."" There were rumors two to three weeks ago that the military might stage a coup, Planty said. ""The security situation is out of control,"" he added. Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, calls it ""a major political scandal."" Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute, agrees with that assessment. ""It's very damning for the president. Very damning,"" he said. Fernando Carrera Castro, a fiscal analyst and executive director of the Instituto Centroamericano de Estudios Fiscales, said the upheaval could further tear apart a poverty-ridden nation trying to heal from a deadly civil war. The three recently slain Guatemalans -- Rosenberg, businessman Khalil Musa and his daughter -- came from the upper economic class. As a result, Carrera said, many wealthy Guatemalans are being ""radicalized"" against the government. Likewise, he said, many poor and disenfranchised Guatemalans also are becoming radicalized and are rallying behind Colom and the government. ""I fear that this crisis will lead to violence and destabilization of the government,"" Carrera said from Guatemala City. ""We all want justice. That is clear."" Juan Tornoe, a Guatemalan who has lived in the United States for seven years, rejects what he says are efforts to forge a class divide. ""The powers that be are trying to make it a social issue -- the wealthy against the poor,"" he said. ""This is not a social issue. This is Guatemalans are fed up."" Tornoe has personal connections with some of the key actors in the crisis. Rosenberg was his wife's law professor at La Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Tornoe said. And he said he went to high school with Gustavo Alejos, the presidential aide Rosenberg mentioned in the video. In his conversations with friends in Guatemala, Tornoe said, he sensed ""a sense of desperation, of hopelessness."" He believes people are fed up. ""They're saying, 'OK. Let's do something. Let's not let this happen again and again and again,' "" he said. Carrera, the fiscal analyst, holds out hope. The investigation, he said, will be handled by an independent attorney general who does not report to the president. And the probe will be conducted under the watchful eye of a U.N.-Guatemalan commission set up to investigate corruption and political violence. ""That gives me more confidence,"" he said. But Perez and others note that the attorney general, Jose Amilcar Velasquez Zarate, met privately with Colom on Tuesday morning, the day after the scandal broke. The meeting was not disclosed until reporters uncovered it and questioned Velasquez on his way out. Colom's critics accuse the president of already meddling in the investigation. Colom and Velasquez said the meeting had been planned days ahead of time. ""There is no interference in the investigation,"" Velasquez told reporters afterward. Guatemala has ""a culture of corruption,"" said Planty, the former U.S. envoy. A just investigation is necessary, he said. ""Until they fix it, they will limp along -- and that's the good scenario,"" he said. ""They are in serious danger of becoming a failed state, if they're not already. There is complete impunity. Nobody is punished for anything."" Rosenberg said the same thing in the video, bemoaning the ""narcos, assassins and thieves"" who have taken over the country. ""Those thieves are sinking all of Guatemala,"" he said. ""They kill people like dogs."" The lawyer's niece, Mariela Rosenberg, said her uncle learned to accept his fate. ""He had many threats,"" she told CNN en Español, ""and when he saw it was inevitable, he taped a video."" Radio journalist Mario David Garcia told CNN en Español that Rosenberg was supposed to detail his allegations Monday afternoon on Garcia's program, ""Hablando Claro"" (Speaking Clearly). Instead, his funeral was held that day.","Lawyer who blamed Guatemala's president for two slayings was killed Sunday .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Two attacks on Christian families in the city of Kirkuk on Sunday evening left three people dead and two others wounded, police said. Due to persecution, Christians in Iraq have had to rely on Iraqi security forces, as shown here on Easter Sunday. The first occurred in a neighborhood in southern Kirkuk when a Christian woman and her daughter-in-law were murdered in their home late night Sunday. Police told CNN the attackers slit the women's throats. In a neighborhood close by, gunmen attacked a Christian family in their home, shooting a father and his three sons, police said. One of the sons died instantly and the other son and the father were wounded. Many of Iraq's estimated 1 million Christians have fled the country after targeted attacks by extremists. In October, more than a thousand Iraqi families fled the northern city of Mosul after they were reportedly frightened by a series of killings and threats by Muslim extremists, who apparently ordered them to convert to Islam or face possible death. At least 14 Christians were killed in Mosul in the first two weeks of October. Kirkuk is 150 miles (240 km) north of Baghdad.","Christian woman and her daughter-in-law's throats slit in their home late Sunday .

"MANAMA, Bahrain (CNN) -- Suryavathi Rao entered her 40th year in what can be called no man's land. A protestor locked in a suitcase reading ""Stop Human Trafficking"" in Germany last year. A domestic worker from India, she arrived at a shelter in the Gulf state of Bahrain one morning with only a nightgown, slippers, and a prayer for a better life. ""I had to leave because it was getting too difficult for me,"" she said. ""I have not brought any clothes, I have not brought personal belongings, all I brought with me is a Bible."" Rao says her employer -- a family with eight children who sponsored her journey here -- did not pay her the monthly salary of just over $100 for six months. Having fled her employer's home, she is now considered an illegal resident on the island. Marietta Dias, who runs the Migrant Workers Society, says the mind-set regarding immigrant workers here has got to change. Some employers treat their help as ""not a person but a machine (that) starts in the morning: Put on a switch (and) work consistently right through the day. Take care of the children, washing, cleaning, cooking, right down to cleaning (the) car."" The exploitation of workers is a huge business worldwide. People forced to work without pay collectively lose more than $20 billion a year in earnings, according to a report from the United Nations International Labour Organization released Tuesday. Global profits from human trafficking and forced labor have reached $36 billion, according to the United Nations, and that sum is climbing. ""Forced labor is the antithesis of decent work,"" ILO Director-General Juan Somavia said in a statement as the report became public. ""It causes untold human suffering and steals from its victims."" ""It is the vulnerable who suffer the most"" in times of economic crisis like the present, the report says. It took years for governments to acknowledge the problem. Now the biggest challenges, officials say, are the implementation and enforcement of laws. ""Eighty percent of forced labor is in the private economy, but this is very, very rarely been prosecuted, if at all in most countries,"" said Roger Plant, one of the authors of the ILO report. Part of the problem is that the law is often hazy. ""There's a whole lot of gray areas where intermediate agents, sub-brokers, are taking advantage of loopholes in the law in order to extract large amounts of money from vulnerable people, uninformed (people) who are going off to work in a country where they don't speak the language,"" Plant said. But for him, the bottom line is clear. ""There is some absolutely flagrant forced labor where the offenders must be put behind bars. Forced labor is a serious criminal offense and must be treated as such,"" he said. Labor markets need a regulatory overhaul like the one financial markets are now facing, he argued. ""Because labor markets are too deregulated there are too many options for people to act in an unethical way,"" he said. ""After the havoc in the financial markets, people are realizing they need some monitoring, licensing, regulation. You've got to do the same on the labor markets,"" he said. The ILO tried to set standards for private agencies that place workers, he said. ""But we're finding is that there is a number of totally unknown, unlicensed and unregulated labor workers at the bottom end of the market, and there is broker after broker, intermediate after intermediate getting cash -- getting some money from the worker,"" he said. ""Usually it is in the very much down the bottom in the informal sector, in the developing countries, but we are finding that sometimes this is pervading even larger recruitment agencies."" Bahrain, where Suryavathi Rao fled her employer, is considered a reformer on labor issues. The Gulf state has introduced the Labour Market Regulatory Authority to register and track workers of all types. ""People were not familiar with the definition of human trafficking and most of the time they weren't accepting that is phenomena is actually here in our region,"" Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa of the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. A top priority is to reduce the role of middlemen who take sizable fees -- sometimes a year's salary plus interest, he said. But worldwide, prosecutions are comparatively rare, said Antonio Maria Costa, under secretary-general of the United Nations. ""Only a few thousand people were criminalized in the underworld in the past 2-3 years -- a fraction of the criminals who actually prey upon victims."" The average, according to labor officials, is one prosecution for every 800 cases -- a rate that keeps workers like Suryavathi Rao, and millions more, vulnerable to exploitation.","Global profits from human trafficking, forced labor reach $36 billion, U.N. says .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Five new cases of the H1N1 virus in New York City schools will force three schools to close for a week, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference Thursday evening. The city is temporarily closing the schools to ""slow transmission"" of the virus, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. The two intermediate schools and one primary school are in Queens, and all three will be closed for at least five days, the mayor said. ""We are closing the schools to slow transmission"" of sickness, he said. Bloomberg, flanked by New York Gov. David Paterson and New York City School Chancellor Joel Klein, said four students at one of the intermediate schools have the virus and an administrator was critically ill Thursday with H1N1. Bloomberg indicated the school administrator had a pre-existing medical condition. Fifty students at that school have been sent home with flu-like symptoms since May 6. At the two other schools, the primary school had an overflowing nurse's office Thursday, reporting 29 students suffering from flu-like symptoms. The other intermediate school had 241 students absent with illness Thursday. The New York City Department of Health and the Department of Education have been in nearly constant contact, said Jason Post, a spokesman from Bloomberg's office. When there's a spike in students absent from classes, the Department of Health is alerted. ""There's always good communication, flu or no flu,"" Post said. ""But our senses have been sharp for a while now."" The Health Department has seen a general increase in flu activity in Queens, officials said in a news release. While the symptoms of H1N1 flu seem to resemble those of seasonal flu, the H1N1 virus appears to spread more extensively, at least in schools, warranting closures to slow transmission in the community, the release said. Dr. Isaac Weisfuse, the deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Hygiene and Mental Health, said although concern is legitimate, there's no solid evidence that suggests the H1N1 flu -- also known as swine flu -- is more dangerous than the flu in general. ""The bottom line is if you're sick, stay home,"" Weisfuse said. ""And don't go back to school until you're better for one whole day."" In late April, St. Francis Prep, a high school in Queens, was closed because of a flu outbreak. Since then, the school reopened and the stricken students have recovered, according to the mayor's office. ""As we have said from the outset of the appearance of H1N1 in our city last month, we will share with New Yorkers what we know and not speculate on what we don't know,"" said Bloomberg in a statement. According to the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Thursday night 7,412 cases of H1N1 flu have been confirmed worldwide. The organizations said 63 deaths attributed to the virus have been confirmed worldwide. The CDC said 4,298 cases of the virus and three fatalities have been confirmed in the United States as of Thursday night. New York had 224 confirmed cases of H1N1, the CDC said. It was not clear whether the five cases cited by Bloomberg and the other New York officials were included in the latest CDC total.","Officials cite five new cases of H1N1 virus in New York City schools .

"The father of missing child Haleigh Cummings' married his 17-year-old-girlfriend, who was the last one known to have seen the child alive, the girl's grandmother told Nancy Grace producers. Ronald Cummings proposes to Misty Croslin Sunday at a local Chili's restaurant. On Sunday Ronald Cummings asked his teenage girlfriend, Misty Croslin, for her hand in marriage at a local Chili's restaurant. While he was with several family members, Cummings got down on one knee, asked Croslin to marry him and gave her Haleigh's grandmother's diamond ring. Because Croslin is only 17 years old, her mother filled out the paperwork so the two could be married. On Thursday, the pair tied the knot, after the three-day waiting period required by Florida law. Croslin, who was beaming earlier in the week after the engagement, told CNN affiliate WJXT-TV that while she knows there will be critics of the marriage and the timing, ""everything is still about Haleigh."" Croslin said she wanted to be together as a family, just as Haleigh would have wanted. ""Everybody is probably going to take this marriage thing the wrong way,"" Croslin told WJXT. ""This is what Haleigh wanted. She has always talked about it, and even if she's not with us, she is still with us."" Croslin told police she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. February 9 in their Satsuma, Florida, home. She said she went to sleep herself about 10 p.m. but woke at 3 a.m. to find Haleigh missing and a back door propped open by bricks. Police are still actively searching for the girl, with a new search happening this week, and investigators Wednesday took the back door that was found propped open. In the middle of the search for the girl, the newlyweds will fly to New York Thursday night for their honeymoon and an exclusive appearance on the Today show. Haleigh's grandmother, Teresa Neves, also acknowledged the timing might seem ""unusual."" ""Well, it is unusual for some onlookers, but those people didn't live with my two grandchildren,"" she told Nancy Grace. ""My grandchildren, both Haleigh and Junior, have very often said that they would love for their daddy to marry Misty and that they wanted Misty to be their mommy. And so I feel like they are just trying to fulfill a wish for Haleigh so that when she comes home she will have that extra happiness to come home to."" Before the wedding, Neves told CNN affiliate WKMG-TV the wedding would be difficult without Haleigh. ""It's an event that Haleigh really should be at, but when she comes home, we'll have a great big wedding so she can be the flower girl and see it all again,"" Neves said.","Ronald Cummings, Misty Croslin, 17, wed after getting engaged at Chili's Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Your husband, an avid gamer and techie, dies of a heart attack, leaving his vast online life ­-- one you don't know much about ­-- in limbo. Eternal Space lets loved ones create customized online gravesites and memorial pages. His accounts, to which you don't know the passwords, go idle. His e-mails go unanswered, his online multiplayer games go on without him and bidders on his eBay items don't know why they can't get an answer from the seller. Web site domains that he has purchased, some of which are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars,­ will expire, and you may never know. It's a scenario that's becoming more likely as we spend more of our lives online. And it's raising more questions about what happens to our online lives after we log off for the final time. The answer, until recently, was nothing. But now, as online usage increases and social-media sites soar in popularity, more companies are popping up to try and fill that void created in your digital life after death. Jeremy Toeman, founder of the site Legacy Locker, recognized that when he was on a plane and wondered what would happen to his online life if it crashed. While his will leaves everything to his wife, including all of his digital assets, Toeman realized how difficult it would be for her to access his accounts. ""My GoDaddy account would belong to her, but it doesn't solve the practical reality of how she would get access to it,"" he said. He experienced a similar scenario after his grandmother died, and he tried to get the password for her e-mail account -- only to give up because of the hassle. So Toeman built his company to change all that. Legacy Locker allows users to set up a kind of online will, with beneficiaries that would receive the customer's account information and passwords after they die. ""We know it's a hard thing to think about -- to get people to face mortality. We know it's kind of morbid, but for those who live their entire lives online, it's also very real."" A Legacy Locker account costs $29.99 a year. Users can set up their accounts at www.legacylocker.com to specify who gets access to their posthumous online information, along with ""legacy letters,"" or messages, that can be sent to loved ones. If someone contacts Legacy Locker to report a client's death, the service will send the customer four e-mails in 48 hours. If there's no response, Legacy Locker will then contact the people the client listed as verifiers in the event of his or her death. Even then, the service would not release digital assets without examining a copy of the customer's death certificate, Toeman said. Eddie Lopez is the kind of tech-savvy guy for which a service such as Legacy Locker was made. The St. Paul, Minnesota, man has three online banking accounts, a PayPal account, domain names, Web-hosting accounts, multiple e-mail addresses and many social-networking accounts. ""I do think this is something people should be really considering these days,"" Lopez told CNN when asked about services such as Legacy Locker. He wants to hire a service to handle his digital assets but is concerned about privacy. ""Although I'm glad there's people breaking ground in this area, I don't think I would jump at the first opportunity to sign up,"" Lopez said. ""My concerns are turning over such an exhaustive list of user names and passwords to a single business. That's one-stop shopping for any hacker to get access to just about every detail of my life."" Lopez would prefer to entrust half of his digital-security information to a service such as Legacy Locker and the other half to family members, so that each side's information would be useless without the other's. ""I hope Legacy Locker and similar services can address these privacy-security concerns with some real-world solutions,"" he said. ""I just don't feel comfortable turning over my digital life -- built over 15 years -- to a kind promise."" Legacy Locker isn't the only new company helping techies plan for death in the digital age. AssetLock (formerly YouDeparted.com) offers a ""secure safe deposit box"" for digital copies of documents, wishes, letters and e-mails. Deathswitch and Slightly Morbid also offer similar services in a variety of prices and packages, depending on how many accounts are involved. Not all of these services deal with online assets. There's also a growing trend towards giving all aspects of death --­ the grieving process, the funeral, the memorial and even the grave site --­ a digital makeover. FindaGrave.com claims to have cemetery records for 32 million people in its searchable database, while EternalSpace.com offers a new spin on the traditional grave site by offering virtual memorial pages ­full of videos, pictures and tributes. On Eternal Space, loved ones can choose from different headstones and bucolic landscape backgrounds -- the mountain lake is a popular option -- to create a customized online grave site. Loved ones can add ""tribute gifts"" such as roses, candles, stuffed animals and other items, while mourners can access photos and videos in a ""Memory Book"" and leave remembrances of their own. Jay Goss, president of Eternal Space president, is trying to bring the funeral experience to anyone who can access the Web. In that way, he hopes to provide a gathering place, and a voice, for mourners who may not be able to attend the real-life memorial service. ""It'd be the equivalent of a funeral where everyone can attend and everyone can spend 30 minutes behind the podium,"" Goss said. ""It gives everyone a chance to put a 360-degree wrapper on the life the person lived and celebrate that life from how every person knew them."" Eternal Space's virtual memorial sites are currently only being offered through select funeral homes, cemeteries and crematoriums. Goss' hope is that the site will help allow the deceased's memory to be ""eternally"" passed on. ""All of these stories and videos are being left, in essence, to this Eternal Space Web site so that everyone can share, not just that day, not the days after, but the weeks after and years after,"" he said. Some funeral-industry professionals believe these online memorials and virtual grave sites provide a valuable service. ""Assuming the site is handled with respect, virtual memorials respond to a basic human need to remember our deceased family, friends and colleagues,"" said Robert M. Fells, general counsel for the International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association. ""Based on our members' feedback, I'd have to say that virtual memorial sites are gaining popularity with the public as a very practical alternative to being present at the grave site,"" he added. ""There's nothing 'weird' about them as far as we have seen."" ""There are funeral homes out there that will help families create virtual memorials, but ... we've also seen Facebook and MySpace profiles of deceased persons being turned into memorials,"" agreed Jessica Koth, spokesperson for the National Funeral Directors Association. ""Consumers have become increasingly comfortable with expressing their grief online."" ""While not a replacement for a funeral, online memorialization can help people work through their grief after the funeral,"" she added. ""We've all become accustomed to communicating and expressing ourselves electronically -- via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter. Expressing one's grief online is an outgrowth of what's happening in other areas of our lives.""

"(CNN) -- The Marine accused of killing Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, who was more than eight months pregnant, was not the father of her unborn child, a law enforcement source close to the murder investigation said Saturday. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, who is being held on a murder charge, is scheduled for arraignment in June. The source, who has seen a report completed earlier this month by the Defense Department's Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, said Cpl. Cesar Laurean's DNA does not match that of the unborn child, who also died. Laurean and Lauterbach were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. An autopsy showed that Lauterbach, 20, died of blunt force trauma to the head. Police unearthed her charred body from beneath a barbecue pit in Laurean's backyard in January 2008. She disappeared the month before. Laurean was 22 when he was arrested in Mexico in April 2008. At the time, a Mexican reporter asked Laurean whether he had killed Lauterbach. The Marine replied, ""I loved her."" Laurean has been indicted on charges that include first-degree murder, financial card transaction fraud and obtaining property by false pretenses. North Carolina prosecutors allege he killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico. He holds dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico. The law enforcement source familiar with the case said a DNA swab was taken by court order from Laurean after he was extradited from Mexico in March to face charges in North Carolina. Mexican authorities agreed to the extradition, in part because prosecutors took the death penalty off the table. Mexico does not have a death penalty. Before her death, Lauterbach told the Marines that Laurean raped her. The month before she disappeared, Lauterbach's mother says Maria told a military investigator that she no longer believed Laurean was the father of her unborn child. However, Lauterbach's mother, Mary, says her daughter remained adamant that Laurean raped her. Laurean denied it. A few weeks before a scheduled rape hearing at Camp Lejeune, Lauterbach disappeared. Dewey Hudson, district attorney for Onslow County, said Laurean is scheduled for arraignment in early June, and is expected to enter a plea. ""I cannot comment on any of the tests,"" Hudson said. He would not say how the DNA results might affect his case against Laurean. Through her attorney, Mary Lauterbach said the DNA test results don't answer bigger questions she has about whether the Marines did enough to protect her daughter or moved quickly enough to investigate her claims. ""We do not believe that the result will have any effect on the continuing investigation or the trial,"" said Lauterbach's attorney Merle Wilberding.","DNA taken from suspect Cpl.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Six life insurance companies have qualified to receive billions of dollars in bailout money under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Allstate is one of six life insurance companies who are qualified to receive TARP money. Treasury Department spokesman Andrew Williams said Allstate, Ameriprise Financial, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Lincoln National Corp., Principal Financial and Prudential Financial Inc. have qualified for TARP money. ""These life insurers met the requirements for the Capital Purchase Program because of their bank holding company status and each applied for CPP capital investments by the deadline of November 14, 2008,"" Williams said. Williams also said other financial institutions in the Capital Purchase Program ""will be reviewed and funded as appropriate on a rolling basis."" In April, about $135 billion remained from the original $700 billion allocated for the bailout last October. No current figures were immediately available. No funding amounts were announced by the Treasury Department, but Hartford said it had been preliminarily approved for $3.4 billion. ""We are pleased that we received preliminary approval to participate in (the) Treasury's Capital Purchase Program,"" said Ramani Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer of Hartford. ""These funds would further fortify our capital resources and provide us with additional financial flexibility during one of the most volatile market climates in our nation's history."" Investors have been increasingly worried about the health of life insurers, which have been hit hard by worries about capital requirements and growing losses. A number of insurers that are also bank holding companies or thrifts have been eligible for funds from TARP since last fall. Last year, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved applications from Hartford and Lincoln to become bank holding companies, because of their planned bank purchases. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Lincoln is buying Newton County Loan & Savings FSB in Goodland, Indiana. Hartford, based in Hartford, Connecticut, is buying Federal Trust Bank in Sanford, Florida.","Six life insurance companies to receive TARP money, U.S. Treasury says .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Pope Benedict XVI completed his eight-day tour of the Holy Land on Friday with an exhortation to both Israelis and Palestinians to work through their decades-old conflict. Pope Benedict XVI prays in Jerusalem on Friday at what's believed to be the burial site of Jesus. ""No more bloodshed! No more fighting! No more terrorism! No more war! Instead let us break the vicious circle of violence. Let there be lasting peace based on justice, let there be genuine reconciliation and healing,"" the pontiff said. Benedict made the comments at a farewell ceremony at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv before Israeli President Shimon Peres and other religious and secular leaders. In his concluding remarks, Benedict called his visit to Israel's Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem and his conversations with survivors a ""deeply moving encounter."" He seemed to address some criticism he received within the country for not speaking in stronger terms about anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. Referring to the Holocaust, Benedict spoke of the victims who ""were brutally exterminated under a godless regime that propagated an ideology of anti-Semitism and hatred."" After Benedict's Monday speech at Yad Vashem, the memorial's chairman, Holocaust survivor Rabbi Yisrael Lau, criticized the pope, saying the pontiff did not ""participate in the pain of the Jewish people"" and ""used the term 'killed' when talking about Holocaust victims and not the word 'murdered' as his predecessor did."" Benedict drew the ire of Jews and German Catholics earlier this year by rehabilitating an excommunicated bishop who had disputed the number of Jews killed in concentration camps during World War II. The bishop's excommunication was unrelated to his Holocaust denial. Friday, Benedict repeated his call for Palestinians to enjoy a ""sovereign independent homeland"" and ""to live in dignity and to travel freely."" He remarked that ""one of the saddest sights for me during my visit to these lands was the wall"" -- a reference to the 20-foot concrete barrier he saw in Bethlehem during his visit to a Palestinian refugee camp. Israel says the structure, which it calls a security fence, was built to prevent terrorist attacks; Palestinians consider it an illegal land grab. Benedict began the day with a busy morning in Jerusalem's Old City, including meeting the patriarchs of the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches. Between sessions with the patriarchs, Benedict toured and prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, believed to be located on the site where Jesus was crucified and buried. On his Middle East visit, the pope has navigated the region's treacherous political landscape, which often pits Jew against Muslim and Muslim against Christian. Benedict has repeatedly called for reconciliation between the peoples of the region during his visit, urging Israelis and Palestinian to put aside their grievances and divisions. ""Just and peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the Middle East can only be achieved through a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, in which the rights and dignity of all are acknowledged and upheld,"" the pope said. Celebrating Mass on Thursday, Benedict covered similar territory in his message to over 30,000 parishioners gathered at the Mount of the Transfiguration, outside Nazareth.  Watch the reaction of one visitor who attended Mass » . ""Christians readily join Jews, Muslims, Druze and people of other religions in wishing to safeguard children from fanaticism and violence, while preparing them to be builders of a better world,"" he said. Benedict's trip marks the first papal visit to some of Christianity's most holy places since Pope John Paul II made the pilgrimage in 2000.","NEW: Benedict XVI winds up Mideast trip with call for ""peace based on justice""

"(CNN) -- Humanitarian aid agencies scrambled Monday to offer help to the tens of thousands of people in need after Tamil separatists declared an end to their quarter-century struggle in Sri Lanka. A Tamil refugee holds her child at a tented site in Vavuniya. The United Nations said Monday that over the past few days some 65,000 people had fled what had been the fighting zone in northeast Sri Lanka, bringing to 265,000 the number of internally displaced people, which it refers to as IDPs. ""This latest massive influx of people, who have endured extreme conditions, will put an even greater strain on the transit and IDP sites that are already buckling under the pressure of the existing IDP population,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a written statement. The agency pledged to erect an additional 10,000 shelters to accommodate people streaming from the combat zone. It reiterated its request for the Sri Lankan government to set aside land for the construction of emergency shelters, water and sanitation facilities and public buildings in Vavuniya, Jaffna, Mannar and Kilinochchi. And it called on the government to improve conditions at 42 sites already hosting the displaced people, and to ensure adequate care and maintenance for them. But the United Nations said its access to the sites in Vavuniya had been curtailed in recent days ""and this affects our ability to monitor and distribute aid to the displaced. We hope this ends quickly."" Suresh Bartlett, aid agency World Vision's national director, said, ""The conventional war may be over but the real challenge now is to foster an environment where fractured and displaced Tamil communities can heal and have a real chance at creating a future for themselves and their children."" Among the pressing issues, he said, is getting people back to their land and homes as quickly as possible, which in some cases will require that land be demined and buildings be repaired. About 80,000 of the displaced -- a third of the people in camps -- are children, who need emotional, psychosocial and educational support in addition to physical aid. ""It is important to get people home as quickly as possible so they can feel a sense of ownership over their own lives, recover their dignity and livelihoods and create an environment where their children feel safe,"" he said. In a telephone interview from Colombo, Sri Lanka's most populous city, Bartlett said that the displacement camps are overcrowded, with two and three families staying in shelters intended for a single family. ""A lot more needs to be done,"" he said. ""More land needs to be cleared, more shelters set up"" and safe drinking-water supplies assured. ""It's not easy and it's not straightforward."" He said many of the people still streaming into the camps are malnourished. Though the end of the conflict marks a great opportunity, ""we can do with all the international support that we can get at this time,"" he said. Estimates put the number of civilians killed in the conflict at 70,000 to 80,000, but Bartlett acknowledged that the true number may never be known. Medecins Sans Frontieres, the aid group also known as Doctors Without Borders, was trying to scale up on Monday, a spokeswoman said. The group's head of mission, Hugues Robert, said the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization is staffing three hospitals in the region, where it was screening people seeking help to determine their needs, stabilize them, then treat them. With fighting apparently ended, Robert predicted that the organization's team of 343 national staff and approximately 50 international staff will focus many of their efforts on providing post-operative care. ""We have a lot of wounded people,"" he said. One area of need that remains largely unaddressed, he said, is mental health. Amnesty International called for steps to be taken to ensure civilians and captured fighters are protected. ""The Sri Lankan government must ensure that its forces fully respect international law, including all provisions relating to protecting civilians from the effect of hostilities,"" said Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific director, Sam Zarifi. Amnesty International called on the Sri Lankan government to give humanitarian agencies full access; to allow independent observers to monitor the situation to guard against human-rights violations; and to register displaced people as a safeguard against enforced disappearances. Zarifi called on the international community to deploy monitors. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly called the end of fighting ""an opportunity for Sri Lanka to turn the page on its past and build a Sri Lanka rooted in democracy, tolerance, and respect for human rights."" He said it is ""vital for the government to provide for the needs of the civilians now living in relief camps. Providing food, water, shelter, basic health care, and sanitation as well as expediting their return to their homes should be a top priority for the government.""","U.N.: 65,000 people flee fighting zone in northeast Sri Lanka in past days .

"CANNES, France (CNN) -- As award-winning Iranian film-maker Bahman Ghobadi walked down the Cannes red carpet for the premiere of his new feature Thursday, the real star of the show was conspicuously absent. Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi, director of ""No One Knows About Persian Cats,"" which was co-written by Roxana Saberi. American-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi, credited as co-writer and executive producer of the faux-documentary ""No One Knows about Persian Cats,"" was still in Iran, having been released from jail only days earlier. The woman Ghobadi describes as his fiancée was freed from prison last Monday after being jailed on espionage charges following a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She had served three and a half months, not all time served, of her eight year sentence and at one point was on hunger strike. ""For four months, she was in prison. For me, four months is like four years,"" Ghobadi told CNN. ""In there, what did they do with her? How did she live in there?"" ""I couldn't understand why the government sent her to prison,"" he continued. ""She is like an angel. She is really so clean. I believe her. For example, if you ask me about my mum and her, I believe her first."" After much to-ing and fro-ing by the Iranian authorities, Ghobadi says he couldn't believe it when he found out Saberi had finally been freed, before the end of her sentence. ""When [I found out] she was free ... I couldn't understand,"" the 40 year-old director told CNN. He said it felt as if the the authorities were playing games with himself and other supporters of Saberi as they gave different timescales for her release -- ""two weeks, four years, eight years."" But just after the pair were reunited Ghobadi -- who won Cannes' first-time film-maker award the Camera d'Or in 2000 with ""A Time For Drunken Horses"" -- had to leave for the French film festival. ""Persian Cats,"" which chronicles the hardships facing young rock musicians as they seek to evade censorship from the authorities, had been selected to play in the Un Certain Regard slot. Although Saberi was unable to be with Ghobadi on the red carpet, Ghobadi says she have kept in close telephone contact since her release, checking on how the film has been received. Ghobadi himself has already suffered at the hands of the Iranian authorities. His 2008 film ""Half Moon"" was banned and says he was left feeling depressed and suicidal after spending three years unsuccessfully trying to get permission from the Iranian authorities for another previous film. He thought about leaving Iran because he felt unable to work and cites Saberi as the inspiration behind ""Persian Cats,"" which was filmed in Tehran. Shot illegally in just 17 days using a small, cheap digital camera -- the state owns all 35mm equipment in Iran, according to film industry trade magazine, Screen International -- the faux-documentary chronicles the hardships facing two young musicians who are trying to put together a band. The story which combines comedy and tragedy to great dramatic effect showcases music and performances from real musicians who are part of the Tehran underground music scene. It is estimated that there are 2,000 illegal bands in Tehran, all practising and performing in a hidden world of hand-built recording studios in basements and rooftops around the city. Ghobadi says that he feels some responsibility for Saberi's time in prison because she stayed in Iran to help him with ""Persian Cats:"" ""She wanted to go back to the U.S. [She] just stay for me and for my film and help for this film and give me the idea for the music."" Ghobadi wrote an open letter in April this year calling for Saberi's release when she was jailed after initially being arrested buying a bottle of wine, describing her as being caught in a ""game of politics."" ""My Iranian girl with Japanese eyes and an American ID, is in jail. Shame on me! Shame on us!"" he wrote of Saberi, who has a Japanese mother, in the letter. Saberi was jailed on January 31 this year, tried on April 13 and sentenced on April 18 to eight years. Her appeal was on May 10 and she was freed the next day. Now, Ghobadi says, he is planning to go to New York this week to be with Saberi, who is currently staying in Vienna with her family. They both plan to write books and then, maybe, do another film together. Ghobadi says he wants to start a family and get married to Saberi as soon as they can. But first they will take a few weeks to process everything that has happened: ""We need the time,"" he says.","Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi talks about his film's co-writer Roxana Saberi .

"(CNN) -- When ""La Bamba"" hit movie screens in 1987, audiences flocked to see the true story of singer Ritchie Valens, who died as a teen in an airplane crash almost three decades earlier. ""La Bamba"" starred Lou Diamond Phillips as singer Ritchie Valens. It's one of 40 films featured in the festival. But it was memorable for another reason. The film was the first box office hit directed by a Latino filmmaker and starring mostly Latino actors, said Chon Noriega, a professor of cinema and media studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""La Bamba"" is part of the Latino Images in Film festival, which begins Tuesday and runs through May on Turner Classic Movies. The event features 40 films that show how Latinos have been depicted on the big screen and is part of the network's ""Race and Hollywood"" series. (Turner Classic Movies, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) Noriega, who chose the films and also co-hosts the festival, talked with CNN.com about what he hopes viewers will take away from the movie line-up.  Watch clips from some of the classic films » . The following is a edited version of that interview. CNN: What was your selection process? Chon Noriega: I decided I was going to focus specifically on Hollywood films that look substantively at either Latino characters or the Latino community. I came up with a master list of films, and it's only about 70. There really haven't been that many that have dealt explicitly with the Latino population. And then, from there, we looked at what was available. CNN: When you talk about Latino images, who do you include in that description? Noriega: It's a kind of pan-ethnic, multiracial category. But basically in terms of the series, what it reflects is Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. There really haven't been, as far as I can tell, many Hollywood films that go beyond those three major groups. CNN: What do you hope to accomplish with this movie lineup? Noriega: By and large, these are films that really haven't been seen since their original release. We really don't have an idea of what the history has been in terms of how Hollywood has dealt with or represented what is now a pretty sizeable part of our population. We have an idea of what the stereotypes have been in terms of the kind of expendable characters that emerge within Westerns or action films, background characters like maids. CNN: What do you mean by expendable characters? Noriega: If I'm watching a science-fiction film and there happens to be a Latino character, I know that that character is going to be the first one to die. (laughs) It is almost inevitable. Or in a Western. They're really not there as characters; they're there as foils for the largely white characters that are defining the film and the story. To my mind, it's valuable just to go back and just see that these are the films that at different points represent how not just Hollywood but our society was trying to figure out where Latinos fit within the national culture. CNN: As people watch these movies, from very early Hollywood to the 1990s, what is the progression of Latino characters? Noriega: I don't know that we see a single trajectory of going from either one thing to another or from bad to better. You see certain recurring figures or types. You see different versions of the gangster kind of morphing into the gang member. But it's more or less an urban outlaw type, and that persists. I think you see little shifts in terms of when they're being made and who is making them. You have some of the same characters in ""My Family/Mi Familia,"" but it's being made by a Chicano filmmaker as part of an attempt to show a very diverse view of what a family can be. CNN: What's your take on white actors playing Latino characters? Noriega: Actually, [co-host] Robert Osborne and I kind of went back and forth on that throughout the series because I think there are two views. One is: Actors are actors, and they play make-believe, and they pretend to be different types of characters, and in an ideal world, actors should be able to play anything they are able to do effectively. But when you look at it sociologically, you see it's only working one way, and that's where I think there's a problem. In the history of Hollywood, we're maybe able to identify 70 films that really focus on Latino characters, family or community, and a third of those have white actors playing the Latinos. And Latino actors are not really getting the same opportunity to play other types. CNN: How did the industry try to ""transform"" actors into Latino characters? Noriega: The Latino population -- and it's part of the irony of this -- it's not a racial group. It's a multiracial, multi-ethnic group. We talk about that in terms of ""West Side Story,"" where everybody's identified how Natalie Wood was in brownface playing a Puerto Rican. But in 1980, there was a revival of it on Broadway, and they actually cast a Puerto Rican actress. In the makeup room, they started putting brownface on her, [because] she wasn't dark enough to meet the expectations of what a Latina character would look like on stage. I've done focus groups with Latino actors in the Screen Actors Guild, and they continually talk about that there are these expectations of what a Latino character is going to look like and more often than not, Latino actors don't look like that. (laughs) CNN: What do you think about how Latinos are portrayed in film today? Noriega: We have a somewhat broader cohort of actors who are known, who are included in films, not always starring, but they get secondary roles in films and so there's in some sense more of a presence. When you look at the statistics in terms of the overall presence of Latinos in film and television, the numbers really haven't changed that much. So it's a kind of a subtle shift.","Turner Classic Movies begins month-long Latino Images in Film festival .

"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) -- The body of accused triple killer and University of Georgia professor George Zinkhan was claimed by a relative Friday, nearly a week after Zinkhan was found dead, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. A studio proof shows professor George Zinkhan and his wife, Marie Bruce. A mortuary shipping service in Atlanta picked up Zinkhan's body at the request of a son from a previous marriage, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said. Details on plans for the body weren't immediately available. Earlier Friday, Bankhead had said Zinkhan's body -- found Saturday in a self-dug shallow grave -- could be headed to a pauper's grave if the family didn't claim the body from the Athens-Clarke County coroner's office by Saturday morning. Such a grave is typically reserved for unidentified bodies, unclaimed bodies or people without family members. Bankhead said the situation was rare and that it was unclear why the family had taken that long to claim the body of the professor, described by colleagues and acquaintances as aloof and eccentric. Neighbor Bob Covington remembers a lot of ""forced moments"" with Zinkhan. The last such interaction came the afternoon of April 24, the day before witnesses said Zinkhan, 57, killed his wife and two others outside a community theater in Athens. Covington was walking down the driveway of his Bogart home to check the mail. Zinkhan had just done the same and was walking back to his house. Covington said hello and told Zinkhan that his son, a UGA student who used to mow the Zinkhans' lawn, had recently seen Zinkhan on campus. ""He said, 'Yeah, that's where I hang out,' and turned and walked into the house,"" said Covington, who lived next door to Zinkhan for eight years.""That's mostly what it was with George, forced moments."" It was odd for Zinkhan to say more than five or 10 words before disengaging, while his wife, Marie Bruce, was the ""polar opposite,"" Covington said, describing the 47-year-old thespian as engaging and vivacious. Despite the contrasts in personalities, Covington never saw evidence that there were problems between the two, he said. ""He never raised his voice at his kids. I never heard that. I never heard him raise his voice at Marie,"" he said. Neighbors, students and fellow faculty members all concur that Zinkhan was standoffish, but their accounts also paint a contradictory image of the marketing professor who would occasionally walk the halls of UGA's business college barefoot. Some faculty members were quick to defend Zinkhan, but reluctant to do so on record. One said he felt it was a university matter. Another was reluctant to be on record defending an accused mass killer. ""He's being painted as an ogre, which doesn't fit,"" said the former. Two faculty members said Zinkhan was introverted but friendly. He was close to some colleagues. He remembered their birthdays and was generous with gifts at Christmas. His quirky behavior was generally overlooked because of his brilliance, a colleague said. One fellow professor went so far as to call him a genius, and not just with marketing, either. Zinkhan apparently was well-versed in a wide range of topics -- art, opera, architecture -- and he loved sports. Faculty members recalled that the strapping 6-foot-2 Zinkhan played on the intramural softball team with some of his graduate students, and he liked to boast of his home runs. He also loved his son, 8, and daughter, 10, and regularly brought them to work. Neighbors said they saw him outside playing soccer with the kids on a miniature goal that still sat in the yard this week. A basketball goal with a rim a foot or two below regulation stood over the Zinkhans' driveway, and a miniature yellow house sat dormant in his wooded backyard. A neighbor who asked not to be named said the cedar front door on the house Tuesday was new. A SWAT team had burst through the old front door shortly after Zinkhan allegedly shot Bruce; attorney Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63. Bruce was the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, a theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater's deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater. Covington saw Zinkhan shortly after the April 25 slayings. He was grilling bratwursts for lunch when Zinkhan rang the doorbell. ""He asked if I'd mind watching the kids because there'd been an emergency,"" Covington said. Covington agreed. He thought it was strange when Zinkhan immediately sprinted out of the garage, but didn't pay it much attention because Zinkhan said he had an emergency. The children, Covington said, seemed oblivious that their mother had just been slain. It was less than an hour later, when Covington's wife noticed two police officers with shotguns behind the hedges in a nearby yard, that Covington learned his neighbor was accused of a triple killing. The police told Covington they were looking for Zinkhan in connection with the shootings. ""I was incredulous,"" he said. Covington's daughter, who had baby-sat for the Zinkhans, drew a floor plan of the Zinkhan home for police and told them where the spare key was hidden. Covington allowed police to use his home in their stakeout and summoned Zinkhan's daughter to see whether she knew anything about what had happened. It was clear the girl hadn't seen the slayings, but one of her remarks was chilling, Covington said. Asked what her father's emergency involved, she replied, ""Something about a firecracker."" Though many expressed astonishment that Zinkhan was linked to the slayings, some UGA faculty members said they suspected Zinkhan was having problems at home before police confirmed it this week. He lost an estimated 50 pounds in the two months before the shootings, they said. To others, the signs of problems were more obvious. Professor Barbara Carroll, who had once worked under Zinkhan, wrote an e-mail to her colleagues at the business school saying she went into protective custody after police found a map to her house in Zinkhan's vehicle. In the e-mail, she said she had told previous department heads, deans and provosts ""that George Zinkhan was dangerous."" ""Many people in this college and this department have known about Zinkhan's 'troubled past' and did nothing about it. Those people also bear responsibility here,"" she wrote. Carroll did not return phone messages or open her door for reporters Tuesday. However, one of Zinkhan's former students said he and his classmates also thought Zinkhan was more than just odd. David Sackin, 43, was a graduate student and took classes with Zinkhan in 1996 and 1997. Zinkhan's lectures were delivered in monotone, his teaching style was dry and he didn't seem to care what was happening in the classroom, Sackin said. When students convened outside the classroom, they surmised that something darker than a lack of enthusiasm drove Zinkhan's behavior, he said. ""If anyone asked any of my classmates if there was one professor who'd go on a rampage, who would it be? They'd unanimously say Zinkhan,"" Sackin said.""He was strange, definitely."" In her e-mail, Carroll told colleagues they may never know the whole story. Indeed, police have said only that one of the victims, Tanner, ""appeared to be a specific target in the shootings and was shot first."" The prospect of learning specifics about what could have propelled a painfully private introvert to homicide probably died in a shallow grave behind a Bogart elementary school. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Son from previous marriage claims University of Georgia professor's body .

"(CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom should leave office during the investigation into whether he was connected to three recent slayings, his 2007 presidential opponent said Thursday. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom has said he has no intention of giving up power over the slayings inquiry. Retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina, who lost to Colom in a runoff, said Guatemala is suffering its worst crisis since the democratic process began in 1985 after years of civil war. Demonstrations will continue and anger will mount unless Colom temporarily steps out of the way to allow an unblemished probe, he said. ""We want an impartial investigation, a transparent investigation,"" Perez told CNN. ""The president must leave his post."" The crisis started Monday with the surfacing of a video in which Guatemalan attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg said Colom, the president's wife and a top aide would be responsible if something happened to the lawyer. Rosenberg was gunned down Sunday while riding his bike in Guatemala City. He had recorded the video last week. Rosenberg was being threatened with death, he said, because he had blamed Colom and his associates for the April slayings of a prominent businessman and his daughter. Rosenberg had represented the businessman. They were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted. ""It's the time-honored tradition in Guatemala that if someone gets in your way, there's likely to be a violent outcome,"" said Donald J. Planty, the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala from 1996 to 1999. Colom took to the airwaves Monday night to vehemently deny that he, his wife or the aide had any connection to the slayings. He promised a full investigation and said he would accept international help, asking the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to become involved. A Guatemalan newspaper reported Thursday that an FBI agent had arrived in the country in connection with the investigation. But Rosenberg supporters say they don't believe the Guatemalan government can carry out an impartial and thorough investigation and want Colom out. Perez said Vice President Jose Rafael Espada could take over until the investigation is complete. ""We are only asking that the state be strengthened,"" Perez said. ""If he doesn't do this, we believe the situation will get worse."" Colom said in an interview Tuesday night with CNN en Español that he has no intention of resigning or otherwise giving up power. He blamed the deaths on unnamed people who want to bring down his government. ""It is evident that [Rosenberg's video statement] was written by someone who has been in on this plan to destabilize the government and for reasons that I don't know, because I don't know why Mr. Rosenberg mentions us in that video,"" Colom said. For Perez and other critics, that's not good enough. ""The president has not wanted to confront this and has given evasive answers,"" Perez said. ""Until the president confronts this, indignation will increase."" Some analysts say Colom needs to get the nation under control immediately. ""It's a very worrisome situation,"" said Planty, the former U.S. ambassador. ""The country is in very serious trouble."" There were rumors two to three weeks ago that the military might stage a coup, Planty said. ""The security situation is out of control,"" he added. Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, calls it ""a major political scandal."" Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute, agrees with that assessment. ""It's very damning for the president. Very damning,"" he said. Fernando Carrera Castro, a fiscal analyst and executive director of the Instituto Centroamericano de Estudios Fiscales, said the upheaval could further tear apart a poverty-ridden nation trying to heal from a deadly civil war. The three recently slain Guatemalans -- Rosenberg, businessman Khalil Musa and his daughter -- came from the upper economic class. As a result, Carrera said, many wealthy Guatemalans are being ""radicalized"" against the government. Likewise, he said, many poor and disenfranchised Guatemalans also are becoming radicalized and are rallying behind Colom and the government. ""I fear that this crisis will lead to violence and destabilization of the government,"" Carrera said from Guatemala City. ""We all want justice. That is clear."" Juan Tornoe, a Guatemalan who has lived in the United States for seven years, rejects what he says are efforts to forge a class divide. ""The powers that be are trying to make it a social issue -- the wealthy against the poor,"" he said. ""This is not a social issue. This is Guatemalans are fed up."" Tornoe has personal connections with some of the key actors in the crisis. Rosenberg was his wife's law professor at La Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Tornoe said. And he said he went to high school with Gustavo Alejos, the presidential aide Rosenberg mentioned in the video. In his conversations with friends in Guatemala, Tornoe said, he sensed ""a sense of desperation, of hopelessness."" He believes people are fed up. ""They're saying, 'OK. Let's do something. Let's not let this happen again and again and again,' "" he said. Carrera, the fiscal analyst, holds out hope. The investigation, he said, will be handled by an independent attorney general who does not report to the president. And the probe will be conducted under the watchful eye of a U.N.-Guatemalan commission set up to investigate corruption and political violence. ""That gives me more confidence,"" he said. But Perez and others note that the attorney general, Jose Amilcar Velasquez Zarate, met privately with Colom on Tuesday morning, the day after the scandal broke. The meeting was not disclosed until reporters uncovered it and questioned Velasquez on his way out. Colom's critics accuse the president of already meddling in the investigation. Colom and Velasquez said the meeting had been planned days ahead of time. ""There is no interference in the investigation,"" Velasquez told reporters afterward. Guatemala has ""a culture of corruption,"" said Planty, the former U.S. envoy. A just investigation is necessary, he said. ""Until they fix it, they will limp along -- and that's the good scenario,"" he said. ""They are in serious danger of becoming a failed state, if they're not already. There is complete impunity. Nobody is punished for anything."" Rosenberg said the same thing in the video, bemoaning the ""narcos, assassins and thieves"" who have taken over the country. ""Those thieves are sinking all of Guatemala,"" he said. ""They kill people like dogs."" The lawyer's niece, Mariela Rosenberg, said her uncle learned to accept his fate. ""He had many threats,"" she told CNN en Español, ""and when he saw it was inevitable, he taped a video."" Radio journalist Mario David Garcia told CNN en Español that Rosenberg was supposed to detail his allegations Monday afternoon on Garcia's program, ""Hablando Claro"" (Speaking Clearly). Instead, his funeral was held that day.","Lawyer who blamed Guatemala's president for two slayings was killed Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Army Maj. Steven Hutchison fought battles in the jungles of Vietnam. Then he fought an epic battle on the home front. And at age 60, he still wasn't done fighting for his country. Maj. Steven Hutchison served 22 years in his first Army stint, then returned at age 57. He died Sunday. The battle ended for Hutchison on Sunday. He died in Basra, Iraq, of wounds from a roadside bomb in Al Farr. He is the oldest U.S. service member to die in Iraq or Afghanistan. Hutchison joined the Army in 1966 and served two one-year tours in Vietnam, according to a news release from Fort Riley, Kansas, home of Hutchison's 1st Infantry Division, the famous ""Big Red One."" Over the next 22 years, he was a platoon leader in Germany and commander of a basic training company at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Along the way, he earned a doctorate in psychology from the University of Delaware and became an assistant professor of military science at Claremont College in California. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal, among others. Hutchison retired from the military in 1988 and took up the quiet life of a college professor. He taught at several small colleges in California and became a researcher for a health care company in Scottsdale, Arizona, said his brother, Richard Hutchison. But Hutchison felt compelled to return to military service after the terrorist attacks of September 11. His wife, Kandy, vetoed that idea, however. That decision proved fateful, as Hutchison was able to stand by his wife's side through her battle with breast cancer. She died of the disease in January 2006. The always-athletic Hutchison channeled his grief by whipping himself into shape and returning to active duty at age 57 the following year, his brother said. Military rules say retirees may be recalled up to age 64 for general officers, 62 for warrant officers and 60 for all others. Hutchison served a tour in Afghanistan and then was sent to Iraq, where he was part of a team training Iraqi forces to secure their own country. ""He's been a soldier his whole life,"" Richard Hutchison, of Mesa, Arizona, told CNN affiliate KNXV-TV.  Watch a report on Hutchison's life » . ""He was a great guy,"" he said. ""We hung around together; we went to the movies together, went out to dinner together. He loved to shoot pool; we used to shoot pool all the time, either at my house or at his house. He was just a great friend and a great brother."" The soldier-psychology professor, who is also survived by two daughters and two half-siblings, had a mischievous side, too. ""He liked to tease me about him being younger than me, even though he was five years older than me,"" Richard Hutchison said with a soft chuckle. ""He would tell everyone he was the youngest one. And they would believe him. Made me feel real good."" Richard Hutchison plans to fly to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware over the weekend to claim his brother's body and return it to Scottsdale for burial. The last communication the brothers had was a routine e-mail Steven Hutchison sent from Iraq about two weeks ago. He rarely wrote about his experiences in Iraq, Richard Hutchison said. However, there was one matter on the ground that the soldier involved his brother in. ""When he was in Iraq, they found a dog and were taking care of it. He sent me an e-mail asking me to send some dog food and dog supplies,"" Hutchison said. The Army made Hutchison's team give up the dog, but they left it in good hands, his brother said. ""He had a big heart."" CNN's Adam Levine, Larry Shaughnessy, Barbara Starr and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Army Maj. Steven Hutchison, 60, becomes oldest American killed in Iraq .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the Bush administration's controversial system of military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees. President Obama says the commissions are OK, ""provided that they are properly structured and administered."" On the heels of Obama's shift this week to block the release of photos showing prisoners allegedly being abused by U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military commissions announcement further infuriated the president's most ardent supporters while winning cautionary praise from some of his political foes. Obama said he supports the idea of the military commissions but opposes the version of the law that had been governing such trials in recent years: the Military Commissions Act put in place under the Bush administration in 2006, but subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The president said military commissions ""are appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war, provided that they are properly structured and administered."" But, he said, the 2006 act ""failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined our capability to ensure swift and certain justice against those detainees."" He said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor. Statements that have been obtained from detainees through interrogation and cruel treatment, such as waterboarding, will no longer be admitted as evidence before the commissions, Obama said, and hearsay evidence will be limited. The revised system also will give detainees greater latitude in selecting legal representation and afford basic protections to those who refuse to testify. Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts. ""These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law,"" Obama said. He said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, applauded his former opponent. ""Today's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at Guantanamo and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security,"" McCain said in a written statement. But Obama's announcement infuriated some of his core supporters -- with the revisions hardly calming the concerns of groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU chided the military commission decision as ""a striking blow to due process and the rule of law."" ""These military commissions are inherently illegitimate, unconstitutional and incapable of delivering outcomes we can trust,"" said Anthony D. Romero, the group's executive director. ""Tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide 'more due process' is absurd; there is no such thing as 'due process light.' "" he said. ""If the administration's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements, there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system. If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy."" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States. ""First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,"" Gibbs told reporters. Obama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process. The review deadline is next week. Gibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil. Nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions. Three Guantanamo detainees' cases have gone through the commission so far. The Bush administration established the military trial system after the U.S. military began capturing detainees in Afghanistan in late 2001. The next year, it opened the Guantanamo facility, saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system. But legal organizations and human rights agencies have repeatedly challenged the system on grounds that detainees were mistreated. One lawyer representing a client at Guantanamo said closing the detention facility, which Obama is advocating, is a ""meaningless gesture"" if the military commissions continue. ""The military commissions are fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed,"" said Army Maj. Jon S. Jackson, a lawyer for Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of five 9/11 defendants charged in the military commission process. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, is the most high-profile of those defendants.","Obama revives Bush system that was suspended in January .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Many Americans are finding ways to trim their holiday budgets this year, but reports are showing that buying video games is one place consumers are not cutting back. Through November, video game sales are up 22 percent over 2007. According to market researcher NPD Group, U.S. retail sales of video games totaled $2.91 billion in November, a 10 percent jump from a year ago. Overall sales this year through November are more than $16 billion, up 22 percent from 2007. Anita Frazier, an analyst from NPD, cites the industry's wide content variety on newer generation consoles such as Nintendo's Wii, Sony's Playstation 3 and Microsoft's XBOX 360 as a reason for the strong performance. Frazier also says that video games are a relatively cheap form of entertainment, considering the hours of value they provide. Matt Helgeson, senior editor at Game Informer magazine, agrees. ""Video games can take between 10 and 40 hours, sometimes 50 hours, to complete"" depending on the title, Helgeson said. ""Gamers can often get two to three months out of one game."" Furthermore, during these recessionary times, Helgeson explains that video games ""provide the ultimate escapism."" According to NPD, some of the top-selling game titles in November include ""Gears of War 2,"" which sold 1.6 million copies, and ""Call Of Duty: World At War,"" which sold 1.4 million. Nintendo's ""Wii Play"" and ""Wii Fit"" put up impressive numbers, as well. With those kinds of sales, video games have potential to be one of the most popular stocking stuffers for kids this holiday season. Helgeson says that these days, games are a core part of being a kid, and it's no longer a question of ""do you play video games?"" Instead the question is ""what games are you playing?"" ""Ages, races, social groups -- video games cut across all platforms,"" Helgeson said. Whether you're shopping for a hardcore gamer or something for the family, ""there is something for everybody.""","Video game sales were $2.91 billion in November, a 10 percent jump from last year .

"(CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs on a second sexual assault charge in connection with a probe of his Texas compound, prosecutors said Wednesday. The charge against Warren Jeffs stems from a probe into his sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch near Eldorado, Texas. The Schleicher County, Texas, grand jury charged Jeffs, who already could be sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of a different charge in Utah, with a first-degree felony count of aggravated sexual assault. The indictment is Jeffs' second in Schleicher County. In July, he was charged with sexually assaulting a child under 17. Grand jurors have also indicted three more members of Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, prosecutors said Wednesday. One member faces a count of conducting the unlawful marriage of a minor, another faces three counts of bigamy and a third faces three counts of bigamy and one count of tampering with evidence. The Texas charges stem from a state and federal investigation into the sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch outside Eldorado, about 190 miles northwest of San Antonio. In April, child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the compound, citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse. After a court battle, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned in June, saying the state had no right to remove them and there was no evidence to show the children faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch. To date, 12 people associated with the compound have been indicted as part of the investigation, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said. Jeffs, 52, is the leader and ""prophet"" of the estimated 10,000-member FLDS, an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. The FLDS openly practices polygamy at the YFZ Ranch, as well as in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. In Utah, Jeffs was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old. He is awaiting trial in Arizona, where he faces similar charges. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison for the Utah conviction, and he also could face another life term if convicted of the Texas charges. His attorney in Arizona, Michael Piccarreta, has questioned the motives of Texas authorities, telling CNN in a July interview that the state's investigation into Jeffs and his followers is an effort ""to cover themselves up on the botched attack on the ranch in Texas.""","Warren Jeffs indicted on second Texas sexual assault charge in four months .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Remains found last week in a wooded area have been identified as belonging to missing Florida toddler Caylee Anthony, authorities said Friday. Caylee Anthony, 2, had been missing since June in a case that has received national attention. The cause of the child's death will be listed as homicide by undetermined means, said Jan Garavaglia, medical examiner for Orange County, Florida. She said she does not expect enough additional evidence to surface for that finding to be revised. The remains were identified through DNA testing, comparing a sample from the remains to a sample known to be from Caylee. Some of the remains had been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for testing. The skull was found December 11 a half-mile from the home of Caylee's grandparents, where the girl and her mother, Casey Anthony, 22, lived before the girl disappeared. She was last seen in June. Casey Anthony faces charges including first-degree murder in the case.  Watch a Nancy Grace video tribute to Caylee Anthony » . Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Angelo Nieves said Thursday that searchers at the site had found ""significant skeletal remains"" since the discovery of the skull. A ""large percentage"" of Caylee's skeleton has been recovered, Garavaglia said Friday. The bones showed no sign of trauma before death. A child's skeleton has many more bones than an adult's, she said, and not all are fully developed. Some of the bones recovered are no larger than a pebble, she said.  Watch the medical examiner discuss her findings » . Garavaglia said the manner of Caylee's death -- an opinion based on factors including an examination of the body and circumstantial evidence -- was determined to be homicide. Caylee's grandmother Cindy Anthony was notified of the test results by the medical examiner's office, Garavaglia said. Officials at the Orange County Corrections Department said Casey Anthony was notified of the results by a chaplain about 1:45 p.m., per jail policy. One of Casey Anthony's defense attorneys, Jose Garcia, entered the jail earlier, corrections officials said in a written statement. ""Due to happenstance, not policy, attorney Garcia was not in the presence of the inmate when the notification was made,"" the statement said. ""We will not be commenting on the demeanor of inmate Anthony or her reaction to the news."" The Anthony family's pastor, Thomas Shane Stutzman of Eastside Baptist Church, arrived at the jail about 2 p.m. but left 19 minutes later because Casey Anthony had refused his visit, as she was meeting with Garcia at the time, jail officials said. Casey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors said this month that they will not seek the death penalty against her. Garavaglia would not disclose specific information regarding the remains other than to say they were completely ""skeletonized."" Toxicology tests on the remains are pending, she said. ""Our number one priority from day one was to locate little Caylee Anthony,"" Orange County Sheriff Kevin Beary said. ""We have stayed the course, and we will continue to do so until we have thoroughly completed our investigation into this tragedy."" The sheriff grew emotional while responding to a reporter's question about the effect of the case on him personally. ""Having a kid ... I've raised two girls, goodness gracious,"" Beary said, his voice breaking. ""The bottom line is, no child should have to go through this."" The case has left an ""open wound"" in the community, he said, but he thinks closure will not come until after trial. George and Cindy Anthony, Casey Anthony's parents, did not give up hope that Caylee was still alive until they were notified of the test results, their attorney, Brad Conway, said Friday. He took no questions but read from a statement. ""They now know that their precious granddaughter is safe and hope that she will serve as the angel that protects thousands of missing children and their families,"" he said, adding that the Anthonys want ""the same answers as everyone who has been assigned to investigate and prosecute this case"" and will be available to authorities. ""As you can imagine, the Anthonys are grieving deeply over this loss,"" he said. ""Please respect their privacy and understand they will stand together as a family in order to get through this. ... This is a tragic moment in the lives of good and honorable people. Please treat them respectfully so they can grieve with dignity over the loss of this precious child, Caylee Marie Anthony."" On Thursday, the sheriff's office said that the utility worker who found the skull December 11 had called police three times -- August 11, 12 and 13 -- regarding the site where the remains were found. That utility worker, Roy Kronk, came forward Friday. Reading from a statement, he said that ""back in August of this year, I previously reported to Crimeline and to the sheriff's communications center that I had spotted something suspicious, a bag in the same area."" ""I have been and will continue to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the sheriff's office and the FBI,"" Kronk said. He refused to provide details of what he saw at the site where the remains were found.  Watch Kronk talk about his calls to police » . His attorney, David Evans, said Kronk ""has no connection whatsoever to this case, has no connection whatsoever to the Anthony family or any of the proceedings that have gone on before. He is here as a concerned citizen and no more. Those who have specified to the contrary could not be more wrong."" Evans said Kronk was asking for privacy for his co-workers, who have been the subject of ""intrusive news-gathering activities."" Some of those colleagues, he said, ""protected his privacy and sacrificed their own in doing so."" Kronk will not be granting interviews at this time, Evans said. Police said Thursday that in his first call August 11, the worker reported seeing a gray bag on the side of the road. A deputy responded, Nieves said, but the worker was no longer at the scene, and the deputy did not see the bag. On August 12, the worker called a police crime line. The call was sent to a detective, who told the meter reader that the area had been searched and cleared by cadaver dogs, police said. On August 13, the worker reported finding a bag in a swampy area, and a deputy was dispatched. The deputy looked at the area but found nothing, thinking the ""bag"" may have just been trash, Nieves said. The meter reader revisited the site last week, apparently while working in the area, authorities said, and found the skull. The site was searched earlier, Beary said, but was flooded at the time. Nieves said Thursday that police were conducting a thorough review of the tips and their response but emphasized that the meter reader has been cooperative and is not a suspect. Beary acknowledged Friday that there were questions surrounding those tips but said the only way to find the answers was to conduct an investigation.

"(CNN) -- The jury that convicted O.J. Simpson of robbery and other charges relied mostly on audio and video evidence -- and very little on testimony from prosecution witnesses -- jury members said Sunday. O.J. Simpson, convicted of robbery and kidnapping last week, could be sentenced to life in prison on December 5. ""We honestly felt we could not rely on that witness testimony,"" said Michelle R. Lyons, one of seven jurors who spoke to reporters in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sunday. ""There was not one decision we made that was based only on witness testimony."" Jury foreman Paul Connelly said some of the prosecution's witnesses didn't seem trustworthy. At least three former Simpson co-defendants who cut deals to testify in the case had criminal records. Asked whether the jury trusted the witnesses, Connelly answered: ""Not entirely, no.""  Watch jurors explain their verdict » . Prosecutors produced an audiotape of the confrontation in which authorities said Simpson and five men burst into a Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel on September 13, 2007. The men allegedly made off with pillowcases containing Simpson sports memorabilia. Several jurors said audiotapes of the incident and conversations between Simpson and others that were recorded surreptitiously before, during and after the heist made the prosecution's case. ""It would have been a weak case"" without the tapes, juror Dora Pettit said. The jury of nine women and three men found Simpson and co-defendant Clarence ""C.J."" Stewart guilty Friday of 12 charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime, robbery, assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon. Simpson, 61, could get life in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for December 5 in Las Vegas. Prosecutors alleged that Simpson, a former football star, led a group of men who used threats, guns and force to take the memorabilia and other items from memorabilia dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley. Four men who had been charged with Simpson cut deals with the prosecution and testified against him. One testified that Simpson instructed him to bring a gun to the hotel encounter. ""Everything was based on the recordings,"" juror Dora Pettit said of the panel's decisions. Simpson, who did not testify during the trial, told police he didn't know the people with him were armed. He also claimed the items had been stolen from him, and the hotel encounter was just about him retrieving his items. Simpson's lawyer has indicated he plans to appeal the conviction, partly because some of the jurors had indicated during jury selection that they disagreed with a 1995 verdict in which he was acquitted of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.  Watch Fred Goldman hail the verdict » . Teresa Owens, one of the jurors in the Simpson robbery case, said any suggestion that the jury found Simpson guilty because of the verdict 13 years ago is ""terrible."" ""There's reports right now that we've had some kind of vendetta against Mr. Simpson for ... 13 years ago,"" she said. ""That in no way had anything to do with this case whatsoever."" Connelly said the murder trial ""never came up."" ""I don't think it was on anybody's minds. For that, I can say I'm proud of the jury,"" he said. Before the robbery and kidnapping trial, the jurors promised they could disregard Simpson's past and solely consider the evidence against him and Stewart, 54. Owens also said it would be ""preposterous"" for anyone suggest that the makeup of the jury -- 11 jurors were white, and one said she was Hispanic, while Simpson is black -- hurt the defense's chances. ""They chose us. Five hundred people ... filled out these questionnaires,"" Owens said. ""They had the [opportunity] to pass us."" Pettit said the jury has been painted by some ""as an all-white jury that hates O.J."" ""That's just not true,"" she said. ""It couldn't be further from the truth."" Asked whether they felt the crime was bad enough to warrant life sentences, Connelly said that was up for the court to decide. Pettit said that ""if he walked out tomorrow, I'd be fine with that."" However, she said Simpson had to be found guilty and that his argument about just wanting to recover his own things didn't work. ""Under Nevada law ... even if you're recovering your own stuff, you can't do it in the manner that they all went in and did it,"" Pettit said.","Some witnesses didn't seem trustworthy, jury foreman says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A third baby has died and at least 6,200 children have fallen ill after drinking formula tainted with the same chemical involved in a massive pet food recall last year, Chinese officials said Wednesday. China's largest producer of milk, Mengniu Dairy Group, announced the recall of three batches of formula made in January after tests showed they were contaminated with melamine, said Li Changjiang, China's director of quarantine and inspection. Though it should not be added to food ingredients, suppliers in China sometimes put it in food to make a product appear to be protein rich. Melamine has nitrogen, and standard tests for protein in bulk food ingredients measure levels of nitrogen. More than 1,300 infants are hospitalized with illnesses including malnutrition, kidney stones and acute renal failure. On Monday two brothers were arrested who Chinese officials say supplied three tons of milk each day to the Sanlu Group, which makes baby formula.  Watch crowds of moms get their babies tested » . They could face death if convicted, according to state-run newspaper China Daily. The siblings' raw milk had been watered down and a chemical added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said. Watch who has been arrested » . Sanlu Group, one of China's leading dairy producers, has recalled more than 8,200 tons of the tainted formula following reports of sickened babies, news agency Xinhua reported. The manufactured also sealed off more than 2,100 tons of contaminated product, and another 700 tons still need to be recalled, according to Xinhua. Watch angry parents demand answers at Sanlu » . Investigators said the brothers confessed to watering down the raw milk and mixing in tripolycyanamide, also known as melamine. The paper reported the siblings did it to recover losses suffered when the factory rejected earlier milk shipments, and that 19 other people have been detained for questioning. Recalls of the products by the Yashili and Suokang companies have been made, and of China's 175 baby milk powder production companies, 66 have already stopped production, Li said. Investigators are testing samples at the remaining factories.  Learn more about the chemical melamine » . China's Xinhua news agency reported that worried parents started lining up at 5 a.m. Wednesday to see doctors at Renmin Hospital in Shijiazhuang, the capital of the northern Hebei Province. Wang Lifang said she went to the hospital after medics at her local hospital 28 miles (45 kilometers) away in Xingtang County found problems with her two-month-old daughter. ""The county hospital found my daughter has kidney stones that are smaller than 4mm [less than a fifth of an inch],"" the farmer in her 30s told Xinhua. ""My daughter is so young that the doctors worry the stones might not be washed out themselves so they told me to go to the provincial hospital."" The report said the girl had drunk a little water. ""Doctors said I better not feed her powdered milk,"" Xinhua quoted a ""tearful"" Wang as saying. ""In the past few days, I fed her fresh milk bought from a neighbor who raises a cow but once I left home I did not know what to do."" Other parents told Xinhua they wanted their children scanned for kidney stones as a precaution. Peng Jing, a mother in her 20s, said her 2-month-old son had drunk about two small bags of Sanlu powdered milk. ""He seems OK, but we want to be 100 percent sure he is healthy so we came to have the tests,"" she told Xinhua at Renmin Hospital. The food safety scandal prompted China agricultural officials to start a nationwide inspection of its dairy industry. Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. The chemical is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Chinese investigators have found melamine in nearly 70 milk products from more than 20 companies, Li said Wednesday. Products made by Sanlu had the highest concentration of the chemical. It is not the first time Sanlu has been connected to a scandal involving tainted milk powder, according to China Daily. In 2004, at least 13 infants in the eastern Anhui province died of malnutrition after drinking milk powder that had little to no nutrition. The illegally manufactured milk was falsely labeled with the Sanlu brand, according to the paper. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said no Chinese baby formula has been allowed on the market in the United States. In a statement on its Web site, the FDA said it had reached out to all five companies making formula in the United States and none has used formula or source materials from China.

"(CNN) --   CNN correspondent Sean Callebs has just finished a long assignment: living on food stamps during all of February. He tracked his experiences on the American Morning blog. CNN's Sean Callebs with a meal he prepared living on a food-stamp budget. This meant no eating out, no food on the run while covering stories and no enjoying king cake and other New Orleans specialties during Mardi Gras. The food stamp program, newly named the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is run by the Department of Agriculture and provides food to those in need. The latest numbers show 31 million Americans are relying on supplemental food assistance to get by every month. Callebs is based in New Orleans, so he worked through the Louisiana Department of Social Services.  The agency gave him a gift card worth $176, the maximum amount of assistance for which he was eligible,  instead of an actual EBT card or food stamps. This week, he reflected on what he learned in an interview with House Call. House Call: Did living on a limited food budget have an impact on your health? Callebs: I wouldn't say it had a big impact on my health. I think that towards the end, I wondered if having fewer calories than I normally eat and also not having as much meat and fish -- I wondered if that affected my energy levels. I was running maybe 4 to 5 miles and toward the end of this diet when I got to three miles I just got kind of winded. I don't know why that happened.  Watch Sean Callebs talk about his experience » . HC: Were there also some benefits? Callebs: I think I lost weight. I wouldn't say noticeable. It's not like I came out of this 30 days later and people were like ""Wow, what happened to you?"" but all my clothes are looser. I don't have a scale, but I can tell you my pants are much looser. HC: You write in your blog about your love of diet soda and how you had to drop it. Callebs: (Laughing) It's funny, because for the first 10 days it was really on my mind a lot. It was probably more than anything else I missed -- probably a sad commentary on my lifestyle. Then toward the end, I didn't even think about it and my photographer, as a joke the last day, he brought over two 20 ounce bottles of diet soda and said, ""At midnight tonight you can have these,"" and I didn't drink them. I don't miss it as much and, I can't guarantee this is what caused it, but I've always had a problem with acid reflux and once I got started eating on the food stamp diet, it seemed to go away. I can't conclusively say that that was the cause, but I sleep better and I feel better. HC: How does your $176 compare with the average food stamp allotment? Callebs: I think it's difficult to say that there's an average food stamp allotment because it really breaks down to how many people you have in the family and to what degree you live at or below the poverty level. I went to the state, and I said, ""I want to pretend I have no income so how much can I get?"" and they said this is the maximum you can get: $176. I did get a lot of e-mails, A LOT of e-mails, from people who have lived with government assistance and they said, ""Look, $176 is a ton of money to live on. So you think it's hard?

"(CNN) -- ""Slumdog Millionaire"" took home eight Oscars on Sunday night, a surprising achievement for a film once thought to be straight-to-DVD fodder. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" with Dev Patel and Freida Pinto has a ""rags-to-riches"" storyline with wide appeal. The colorful story, which mixes the gritty life of Mumbai's poor with the shiny aspirations of the new India, features no stars recognizable to Western audiences, but it may have made one of its native country. So, is it time for Bollywood -- as India's huge Mumbai-based film industry is called -- to come to America? ""International cinema comes in cycles in the United States,"" said Frank Lovece, a film critic with Film Journal International. ""Now, it's Bollywood's time."" But ""Slumdog"" is a far cry from the lavish movie musicals made by Bollywood, which releases nearly 1,000 films annually. And it's not authentically Indian -- it was directed by Briton Danny Boyle, and the leading actor, Dev Patel, was born and raised in England.  Watch the ""Slumdog"" principals talk about their victories » . However, the film is a celebration of India -- from the slums to the Taj Mahal. It pays homage to Bollywood by incorporating many of the industry's norms -- vibrant colors, fast-paced editing, a fairy-tale love story and a feel-good musical dance ending. "" 'Slumdog' is the reason why people go to the movies. It's the whole package,"" said Gene Newman, editorial director at Premiere.com. ""It's an incredible story ... and it makes you feel good.""  Memorable moments from the Oscars » . Priya Joshi, associate professor of English at Temple University and author of the forthcoming book, ""Crime and Punishment: Nationalism and Public Fantasy in Bollywood Cinema,"" said the film's ""rags-to-riches"" storyline has a lot to do with its wide mainstream appeal. ""Hindi film and Bollywood, in particular, is a profoundly political cinema about the crisis of the day,"" she said. ""Today, the typical American feels like the poor in the world. ... This sense of vulnerability is what the film is able to capture.""  Watch the ""Slumdog"" stars talk about bonds between the cultures » . Hollywood often has used international styles and filmmakers to its advantage. In its early days, the U.S. film capital embraced European directors such as Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir. The 1960s saw the influence of French New Wave cinema. Japanese films inspired ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""Star Wars""; Hong Kong works inspired Hollywood blockbusters such as ""The Departed"" and ""The Matrix."" ""Slumdog"" isn't even the first film centering on India to attract Hollywood's attention. ""Indian cinema has been around in the United States since Satyajit Ray in the early 1940s,"" Lovece said. Ray, who won the Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 1992, made films in Bengali, a language spoken in eastern India. Despite that fact, his movies, notably ""The Apu Trilogy,"" have had universal appeal. Since Ray, many Indian actors have emerged on the Hollywood scene. Aishwarya Rai, one of Bollywood's leading ladies, starred in 2004's ""Bride and Prejudice"" and appeared, more recently, in ""The Pink Panther 2."" ""India's movie stars are essentially the country's ambassadors,"" said Gitesh Pandya, box-office analyst and founder of BoxOfficeGuru.com. ""A lot of people going to see [""Pink Panther 2""] are learning about Bollywood through [Aishwarya Rai]."" From Ray to Rai, Indian influence in American cinema is vast. Many Hollywood films also have been influenced by Bollywood. Baz Luhrman's 2001 musical ""Moulin Rouge,"" a tragic romance told with song and dance, borrows heavily from Bollywood. ""These big, epic numbers are very reminiscent of Bollywood,"" Newman said, also referring to ""Chicago,"" ""Mama Mia!"" and ""West Side Story."" ""Musicals have always been part of the tradition of American cinema, and Bollywood really just took it to the next level."" Hollywood films such as 2008's ""The Love Guru"" and 2005's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" -- which ends with a musical dance number -- also borrow from Bollywood, Newman said, but are comedies that parody the enchantment in Bollywood films. ""There's innocence and playfulness in a lot of the cinema in India,"" he said, which is why Bollywood, in its authentic form, would not appeal to American audiences. ""We're a little more cynical,"" said Newman. "" 'West Side Story' is kind of laughable by today's standards. ... But, for some reason, in India, that innocence is still acceptable."" Joshi said the cultural differences between Bollywood and Hollywood could make it difficult for Bollywood films to cross over to America. ""India is still clinging on to its social values, which explains Bollywood's success everywhere but in America,"" she said. ""Bollywood films don't have any kissing in them or tend not to. Warner Bros. used to make movies like this in the past. ... If it's ready to ready to return to its roots, then it's ready for Bollywood."" American audiences may want to explore Bollywood films after seeing ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" Pandya said, but it is unlikely that they will find another film like it. ""The film is obviously very successful, but it is its own entity so it doesn't necessarily mean that people in this country will wake up to Bollywood overnight,"" he said. ""Bollywood is not for everybody. ... People who love to see Adam Sandler movies are not going to line up to see Bollywood films."" Newman agreed, saying that, for now, America will see Bollywood only in small traces. ""I think a lot of filmmakers have been enamored with Bollywood,"" he said. ""They're investing over there, like [Steven] Spielberg."" But in American cinema, ""for the most part, there will be little tinges of Bollywood.""","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not authentically Bollywood or Indian .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A watchdog group critical of pork barrel spending released its latest findings Wednesday targeting the top Congressional ""porkers."" Some of the pork projects, according to the group, include a Lobster Institute; the Rocky Flats, Colorado, Cold War Museum; and the First Tee, a program to build young people's character through golf. Members of Congress requested funds for all these pet projects and thousands of others last year, according to the latest copy of the annual ""Pig Book"" released by Citizens Against Government Waste. ""Congress stuffed 11,610 projects"" worth $17.2 billion into a dozen spending bills, the group said in the report released Wednesday. The ""Pig Book"" names dozens of what the citizens group considers the most egregious porkers, the lawmakers who funnel money to projects on their home turf.  Interactive: Pork barrel spending » . Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, requested the most money, $892.2 million, according to the group. In a statement to CNN, Cochran said he doesn't ""accept the premise"" of the group's claim that ""any and all federal spending not specifically requested by the Executive Branch is wasteful and irresponsible."" ""The Congress is vested with the power to appropriate funds to be spent by the federal government by the U. S. Constitution. We will continue to carry out that responsibility with care and a commitment to serve the public interest,"" he said. ""There were several candidates for the Narcissist Award,"" Tom Schatz, the president of the group said. Read the group's 2008 report . ""But this one went to House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel for the Charles Rangel Public Service Center at the City College of New York -- $1,950,000 [for a project] that he named after himself."" Rangel, a Democrat from New York, said last summer he was ""honored that City College chose to have my name attached to what is an important project, not just for the residents of my congressional district, but for New York City and this nation."" Some lawmakers defended their earmarks, such as Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California, who channeled $742,764 to olive fruit fly research. ""The olive fruit fly has infested thousands of California olive groves and is the single largest threat to the U.S. olive and olive oil industries,"" he said. Schatz responded that his organization is criticizing the way lawmakers direct money to specific projects, not the projects themselves. ""There are existing programs for virtually everything in the 'Pig Book.' If members [of Congress] believe they should be given additional funding, give them to the agencies rather than to specific projects,"" he said. The problem with earmarks, he said, is that ""we don't know if [the projects] are valuable or not."" Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, the third ranking Democrat in the House, defended his earmark for a program that funds a youth golf program for children on U.S. military bases. ""It's a character building program, that seems to be working well for low income kids and that's why we do it throughout the United States of America. I just feel that children living on military installations ought to have this program as well,"" Clyburn told CNN. Clyburn also defended the practice of earmarking federal funds. ""I can name earmark after earmark, there's absolutely nothing wrong with congresspeople responding to their constituents and funding programs that they feel are necessary to improve the quality of life of the people who live in their districts."" Clyburn also raised questions about the group releasing the ""Pig Book"" saying, ""they're not telling the truth about this earmark no more than them telling the truth about where they get their money from. The committee against government waste isn't against government waste."" He cited press reports from the St. Petersburg Times that the Committee Against Government Waste received money from the tobacco industry and other private groups to lobby Congress. Both parties came in for criticism, with the Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, topping the Republicans in spending. The Democrats were behind 5,199 projects worth $5.5 billion, while the Republicans earmarked 3,408 projects worth $4.4 billion, the citizen's group said. And in a sign bipartisanship is not dead, the two parties jointly backed 2,518 projects worth $3.8 billion.  Interactive: Map of pork per capita by state » . The three senators running for president were not among the top targets of criticism, and one got an entirely clean bill from the watchdog group. ""Sen. [Barack] Obama had 53 earmarks worth $97 million dollars, and Sen. [Hillary] Clinton had 281 earmarks worth $296 million. Sen. Obama recently said he would not request any project for this upcoming fiscal year,"" said Tom Schatz, the president of Citizens Against Government Waste. ""And of course Sen. [John] McCain has never requested them and he won't be doing so in 2009. So now the question is if Sen. Clinton will join the other major candidates in saying that she will not request any earmarks for 2009."" To qualify for the Pig Book, a project must meet at least one of these standards: it was requested by only one chamber of Congress; was not specifically authorized; was not competitively awarded; was not requested by the president; greatly exceeded the president's budget request or the previous year's funding; was not the subject of congressional hearings; or served only a local or special interests.

"(CNN)  -- The U.S. government has dropped charges against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the suspect in the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole, according to a Pentagon spokesman. Parents and friends at the funeral in 2000 for a sailor killed during the bombing of the USS Cole. The charges were dropped ""without prejudice"" by Susan Crawford, convening authority at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according to Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon. The proceeding did not address specifics of the government's case against al-Nashiri, who remains a ""high value"" detainee held at Guantanamo. In removing the charges without prejudice, prosecutors can resubmit charges at a later date while at the same time complying with President Barack Obama's order to the military to hold off on cases for four months. On his first day in office, Obama ordered the halt, requiring prosecutors to seek delays in the 14 active cases before military commissions there. But the judge, Col. James Pohl, ordered arraignment for Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri to go ahead as scheduled on Monday. With this move, all cases at Guantanamo are now in line with the president's order to halt court proceedings at the detention center, according to Gordon. Al-Nashiri is accused of planning the October 2000 bombing of the Cole while it was in the Yemeni port of Aden. The attack killed 17 American sailors and crippled the vessel, which returned to service in 2002. The Office of Military Commissions, which manages the prosecutions of suspected terrorists, said last week that it might have to temporarily drop charges against al-Nashiri to comply with the presidential order. When prosecutors asked for a continuance in the trial, Pohl denied the request, saying the government's ""argument for continuances were unpersuasive,"" according to a copy of his opinion. Pohl noted there had been no previous requests for a delay, and that the public's interest in a speedy trial would be harmed by further delay. Al-Nashiri was captured in 2002. He was held in secret locations until being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006. Meanwhile, the White House has invited families of sailors who died in the Cole bombing to meet with Obama on Friday. A number of the families were called Thursday afternoon, according to Andrew Hall, the lawyer who represented families. The invitation was for the families to attend ""without their lawyers,"" according to Hall. They were not told why they were going to meet with Obama, he added. According to the White House schedule for Friday, Obama will meet privately with families of the Cole attack and also with families of victims of the 9/11 attacks. ""The president wants to talk with these families about resolving the issues involved with closing Guantanamo Bay -- while keeping the safety and security of the American people as his top priority,"" the schedule said.","NEW: Obama meeting privately with families of bombing Friday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain feared that it would have been overwhelmed in the event of a Soviet attack because of the depleted state of its armed forces, according to secret files made public on Tuesday. U.S. President Jimmy Carter watches UK PM James Callaghan speak at a 1979 meeting in Guadeloupe. Papers released by the National Archives, under the 30-year rule, reveal that Royal Air Force fighter jets only had sufficient ammunition for two days of combat and the Royal Navy would fail to defend the country from Russian submarines. The army would have been too over-stretched to cope with a widescale campaign of sabotage and subversion by Soviet special forces, the papers show. Prime Minister James Callaghan called the situation a ""scandal"" when he discovered the scale of the problem and demanded resignations among the military. ""Heaven help us if there is a war!"" he scrawled on one note. But ministers could do little until the Tornado fighter plane became available in the mid-1980s along with other military hardware. The problem became clear when senior intelligence officers warned in late 1977 that, in the event of a conventional war, the Russians could unleash up to 200 bombers and 18 submarines against the UK. The assessment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was that British forces would be unable to cope. ""UK forces cannot match the threat postulated by the JIC assessment,"" the chiefs noted in January 1978 in a document marked Top Secret UK Eyes Alpha. ""Air defenses would be outweighed because aircraft would be outnumbered and stocks of air defense munitions would sustain operations for only two or three days. ""Maritime forces need better anti-submarine weapons, and face a massive threat from submarine and air-launched missiles and also from mines; the most serious deficiency is in numbers. ""The army in the UK would, until mobilization is complete, have insufficient forces to meet its commitments; after mobilization of the reserves, a process taking between 15-20 days, the Army would be able to counter the currently assessed Soviet land threat during the initial stages of the war but, lacking supporting arms and logistic support, it would be inadequate to deal with any more significant threat, including sabotage or subversion on a wide scale.""","Britain feared it would have been overwhelmed in Soviet attack, papers reveal .

"(CNN) -- World record holder and Olympic champion Usain Bolt added yet another title to his tally after racing to victory in the Bupa Great CityGames 150 meter sprint in a new best time in Manchester on Sunday. Usain Bolt smashed the world 150m record in his first race of the season in Manchester on Sunday. The Jamaican, who broke both the 100m and 200m records before anchoring his country to the 4x100m relay title in Beijing, clocked 14.36 seconds -- smashing the previous world's best by 0.39 seconds. Bolt, in his first competitive outing of the season, finished well ahead of Britain's Marlon Devonish, who ran 15.07. The 22-year-old, who was only passed fit on Monday after a car crash which required minor surgery on his foot just over a fortnight ago, was given a bye into the final. But he did not disappoint and the breakdown of times in his sprint were staggering. He covered the first 100m in 9.90, which although well short of his record-breaking 9.69 in Beijing, was still impressive on a very damp temporary track constructed in the city center. Even better was his speed over what is termed ""the flying 100"" -- from 50-150m -- which he covered in just 8.72 seconds. It all added up to a run which eclipsed the previous best of 14.75 by American Tyson Gay, whose time was recorded during a 200m race and not a straight 150m sprint. ""It is one more to the tally,"" Bolt told reporters when told of his world-best time. ""I thought I would just go out there and run a good time. I am not in the best shape and I still have a lot of work to do but I am getting there,"" he added. Debbie McKenzie Ferguson of the Bahamas won the women's race in 16.54 seconds ahead of Olympic and world 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu, who finished in 17.10.","Usain Bolt shatters world record by winning 150m in Manchester on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of shooting into a crowd outside an under-21 nightclub -- killing two teenage girls and wounding seven other people -- before shooting himself was in critical condition Monday, police in Portland, Oregon, said. A shooting outside a Portland nightclub Staurday killed two people and injured seven others, police said. Investigators identified the gunman in Saturday night's shooting in Portland as Erik Salvadore Ayala, 24, and are trying to determine why the rampage happened, police said. ""This is unprecedented in the city of Portland. We don't have this type of thing,"" Portland police Detective Mary Wheat said, adding that even seasoned police veterans were shocked by what she called ""a random act of violence."" ""Nobody knows the motive at this time,"" Wheat said, noting that Ayala didn't have a police record. ""We're trying to figure what drove him to this."" Investigators believe Ayala sprayed bullets into a crowd of students outside a non-alcohol nightclub called The Zone on Saturday night and then shot himself, authorities said. The students were participants in a Rotary Club foreign exchange program. Slain were Ashley Wilks, 16, and a Peruvian exchange student, Marta ""Tika"" Paz De Noboa, 17, according to Wheat. Wilks, a Portland high school sophomore, was getting ready to spend her junior year in either France or Spain, her principal said. Two juveniles, four 18-year-olds and a man in his 40s were wounded, Wheat said, adding that exchange students were among those hurt. Scott Bieber, youth protection officer for the exchange program in northern Oregon and southwestern Washington, said the shooting was ""nothing like anything we've ever seen in Rotary before, to have as many of our kids involved in something as tragic at one time."" ""Our main focus right now is to build a support structure for the students who were involved and their host families and their real families, and also for the families of the 28 other inbound students we have in our Rotary district,"" Bieber said. Eleven exchange students went to the club to celebrate a birthday and were waiting in line when the assault began, Bieber said. Wheat said a 9 mm handgun was used in the shooting. ""It doesn't appear at this time that he reloaded,"" she said. Paz De Noboa was attending Columbia High School in White Salmon, Washington. School officials were helping students deal with their grief over the incident, and counselors were available, said Superintendent Dale Palmer and Vice Superintendent Jerry Lewis of the White Salmon Valley School District. ""She was very shy and reserved,"" Palmer said. ""I think she was a good student and helpful to other struggling students."" Matt Utterback -- principal of Ashley Wilks' school, Clackamas High School -- issued a statement on the school's Web site confirming Wilks' death and the wounding of Susy De Sousa, an 18-year-old foreign exchange student from Italy. Wilks' was a ""bright and curious student"" who took honors classes and was a member of the swimming team, Utterback said. He passed along praise from her teachers and her swim coach. ""An awesome student with a beautiful smile. She was the kind of person that lights up a room. A truly wonderful, delightful kid,"" Utterback said. About De Sousa, Utterback said: ""Susy challenges herself to take rigorous classes despite the fact that English is her second language. She has a good sense of humor and is known for her persistence."" De Sousa was in critical condition but improving, Wheat said. Classes were not in session Monday because it was a teacher workday. Utterback said counseling was available for students, and deplored the shooting. ""Such a horrific act is impossible to accept or understand,"" he said.","Two teens killed, seven other people wounded in Portland, Oregon, shooting .

"(CNN) -- The forthcoming trial in Germany of John Demjanjuk could be the last occasion on which a Nazi war crimes suspect faces prosecution. German officials claim John Demjanjuk was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a Nazi death camp. But the legacy of decades-old efforts to bring the perpetrators of World War II atrocities to justice means that those who commit similar offences in the 21st century will not be able to hide from their past so easily, according to a leading war crimes prosecutor. Many leading Nazis such as Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer were prosecuted by the main allies -- the U.S., the Soviet Union and the UK -- shortly after the end of the war at the Nuremberg Trials. South African judge Richard Goldstone, formerly the chief U.N. prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, told CNN that Nuremberg had been the ""first attempt of any importance to hold war criminals accountable"" and had laid the foundations for the development of modern humanitarian law. Yet many lower-ranking servants of the Nazi regime and its allies were able to escape punishment for their crimes, assuming new identities, fleeing Europe or even finding employment with Soviet or western security agencies as determination to bring them to justice waned with the advent of the Cold War, according to Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. ""These murderers walked into small cities and killed men, women and children and walked away without a trace,"" Hier told CNN. ""The sad thing is that had the world wanted to prosecute Nazi war criminals after Nuremberg, and had (countries) put up the budget and the resources then every one of these elusive criminals would have been brought to justice."" But Goldstone said that the creation in 2002 of the International Criminal Court marked a ""very important step forward"" to ensure that future atrocities would not be so quickly forgotten. While previous tribunals investigating crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia were ad hoc creations set up by the U.N. Security Council, the ICC is a permanent institution with a specific remit to investigate and prosecute cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Goldstone said that developments in humanitarian law and the evolution of international justice meant that modern institutions were more sophisticated and fairer than Nuremberg had been, recognizing the rights of victims to representation but also ensuring a fair trial for defendants. ""Modern international law requires trials that are a lot fairer than the trials that were put on at Nuremberg,"" he said. The jurisdiction of the ICC is currently recognized by 108 countries -- though not by the U.S., Russia or China. But Goldstone said the court was ""moving quickly"" towards universal ratification and said U.S. President Barack Obama's new administration was likely to be more cooperative and friendlier to the ICC than predecessor George W. Bush had been in office. ""I'd love to see the day when there is universal ratification because when that happens there will be nowhere for war criminals to run to,"" he said. Demjanjuk, an 89-year-old native Ukrainian deported from the U.S. this week, is alleged to have been a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of more than 29,000 people. Hier said Demjanjuk's extradition marked the culmination of greater efforts in the U.S. since the late 1970s to send suspected war criminals to face trial. An Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979 to hunt for war criminals on U.S. soil, while legislation allowed even suspects who had acquired U.S. citizenship to be extradited for lying on their naturalization papers about their Nazi pasts. But he said Demjanjuk's trial could be the last of its kind -- and not just because of the age of suspected war criminals still at large. ""You can't just have a trial with documents. You have to have living witnesses,"" Hier said. ""Most of those witnesses are very old, most of them are well into their 80s and beyond and they have to be in sufficient good health that they can be questioned and travel to take part in the trial."" But Hier said it was very important that former Nazis were pursued to the grave, living out their final years with the fear that their past crimes could still catch up with them. ""(Nazi hunter) Simon Wiesenthal talked about two kinds of justice. There is the justice of handcuffs and putting someone on trial. But there is also a psychological fear of a knock on the door,"" he said. ""Every Nazi war criminal should live every night of his life with the possibility that in his case there will yet be a knock on the door.""","Expert: Trial of Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk could be last of its kind .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Syrian arms dealer was sentenced to 30 years in a U.S. federal prison for conspiring to sell weapons as part of a plot to kill Americans in Colombia, according to prosecutors. Syrian-born arms dealer Monzer al-Kassar, seen in a file photo, tried to sell weapons to undercover U.S. agents. Monzer al-Kassar was also ordered Tuesday to forfeit all of his assets, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Al-Kassar's co-defendant Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy received a 25-year prison sentence for his role in the conspiracy. Both men were convicted in November of five charges, including conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, conspiracy to acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, conspiracy to provide support for FARC guerrillas in Colombia, and money laundering. The federal indictment paints al-Kassar as an international arms dealer with a hand in conflicts in nearly every part of the world, with a web of bank accounts and front companies across Europe and the Middle East. Al-Kassar was arrested in Spain in 2007 on a U.S. warrant and his associate Moreno Godoy was arrested in Romania. Both were extradited to the United States. The arrests stemmed from an undercover sting operation involving U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents posing as members of FARC. During the 16-month operation, the agents arranged to buy more than 12,000 weapons from the two men, according to the indictment. Al-Kassar agreed to provide surface-to-air missiles for the FARC to shoot down American helicopters, and also offered to send 1,000 men to fight with the FARC, plus explosives and men who could train the FARC in how to use them, the indictment charged. Al-Kassar demanded 3,500,000 euros ($4.4 million) as ""partial payment"" for the weapons, it said. Justice Department officials say al-Kassar has been a source of weapons and military equipment for armed combatants since the 1970s. Kassar had told journalists before he was arrested that he had retired from arms dealing, but the United States says he had been involved since the 1970s, providing weapons and military equipment to armed factions in Nicaragua, Cyprus, Bosnia, Croatia, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and elsewhere. CNN Justice Producer Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Syrian sentenced in conspiracy to sell weapons in a plot to kill Americans .

"CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN)  -- Venezuela temporarily seized a pasta-making plant Friday belonging to U.S.-based food giant Cargill, citing a production quota dispute. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's government takes over a Cargill plant for the second time in recent months. Rafael Coronado, Venezuela's deputy minister for food, announced the takeover live on the state-run Venezolana de Television channel. He said the plant did not meet production levels for pasta sold at lower, government-mandated prices. An inspection of the plant Thursday found that 41 percent of its pasta met the government-established level, Coronado said at a news conference in front of the food plant. Fifty-nine percent was ""out of regulation,"" he said. The Venezuelan government will take over the plant for 90 days, he said, and then will determine what steps to take next. It was the second time in recent months that the government of left-wing President Hugo Chavez has taken over a Cargill plant. Chavez announced in March that he had ordered the takeover of a Cargill rice plant. Cargill spokesman Mark Klein said Friday afternoon the Minnesota-based company did not have an immediate comment. But Klein said in March, when the rice plant was taken over, that Cargill ""is committed to the production of food in Venezuela that complies with all laws and regulations."" Cargill has been doing business in Venezuela since 1986, according to the company's Web site. Its operations include oilseed processing, grain and oilseed trading, animal feed, salt, and financial and risk management. The company has 2,000 employees in 22 locations in Venezuela, the Web site says.","Venezuela cites production quota dispute in takeover of pasta-making plant .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of Gulfport, Mississippi, and his wife were arrested Wednesday on charges they defrauded the federal government and an insurance company of more than $220,000 in claims related to Hurricane Katrina, authorities said. Gulfport Mayor Gregory Brent Warr, shown in 2005, says the charges ""will not change my commitment"" to the city. Gregory Brent Warr and Laura Jean Warr were named in a 16-count federal indictment handed up last week by a grand jury, the Department of Justice said in a news release. They are accused of conspiracy, Federal Emergency Management Agency fraud, Department of Housing and Urban Development home grant fraud and insurance fraud, all arising from claims after Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005. If convicted on each count, the couple would face up to 210 years in prison and up to $4 million in fines, prosecutors said. ""Understand that what has been alleged toward my wife and me has no connection to me as mayor,"" Brent Warr said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""This has not and will not change my commitment to the progress and recovery of our city."" He said he pleaded not guilty, but said he will not speak further about the case. ""I am the mayor of Gulfport, and I will continue working to rebuild our city,"" Warr said. ""We have hundreds of dedicated employees, department heads and directors, and everything we have achieved thus far is a result of their hard work and love for this city. ""For Laura and me, personally, this is a difficult time, but I will continue the work as mayor."" According to the indictment, the Warrs in 2005 applied for FEMA assistance regarding a Gulfport home, telling officials that home was their primary residence when it was not. In 2006, the indictment says, the couple applied to the Mississippi Development Authority for a Homeowner's Assistance Grant funded by HUD, again claiming they lived at the address. The indictment also alleges the Warrs made misrepresentations to Lexington Insurance Company regarding personal property in the insured home, payment of rent for alternative living after Katrina and the extent of damage to the home. The Warrs received a total of $222,798 ""as a result of the said offenses, for which the defendants are liable,"" the indictment says. The couple was released on bond and ordered to appear for trial April 6, the Justice Department said. In his statement, Warr said the inquiry ""has been going on for more than a year now, and we hope and pray for a much faster resolution."" City spokesman Ryan LaFontaine issued a statement saying that while he was not in a position ""to speculate what is happening in the mayor's personal life ... I can tell you that as for the city, we are continuing to carry out the people's business. ""The mayor has indicated that he has every intention of coming to work tomorrow, and every day after that, as the mayor of Gulfport,"" LaFontaine said. ""In the nearly four years that he has been here, Mayor Warr has created a framework and an agenda for the recovery of Gulfport. And he has assembled a very talented team of directors and employees that understand the enormity of the recovery challenges that lie ahead. ""Under his continued leadership, I'm very confident that this city will continue to move along the path that he has set,"" LaFontaine said. ""The people of Gulfport don't care about the mayor's personal issues. They only care about what he's doing to fix their issues.""","Gulfport, Mississippi, mayor ""will continue working to rebuild our city""

"(CNN)  -- A wheel from the main landing gear of a Colgan Airlines passenger plane fell off and rolled away as the aircraft was landing in Buffalo, New York, earlier this week. A wheel fell off the landing gear of Q400 Bombardier upon landing on Colgan Flight 3268 earlier this week. On Thursday night, The Toronto Sun posted a video of the incident shot by a passenger on the Q400 Bombardier -- the same type of plane involved in a fatal Colgan Airlines crash three months ago, also on approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The video shows the wheel touch down on the ground and then roll away, followed by metal parts that are meant to keep the wheels in place. The plane was towed to the gate, where everyone on board ""deplaned normally,"" said Joe Williams, a spokesman for Pinnacle Airlines, Colgan's parent company. ""At no time was any passenger or crew member at risk, nor were any injuries reported,"" Williams said of the Tuesday incident. ""The aircraft was properly maintained in accordance with the manufacturer and Federal Aviation Administration procedures."" Williams said the incident ""appears to have been caused by the failure of the outer wheel bearing ... the bearing was relatively new, having been on the aircraft for five weeks."" Colgan Flight 3268 originated in Newark, New Jersey. ""I was scared, and the other passengers looked worried, too,"" one passenger told the Toronto newspaper. ""For a moment, I thought the worst in that we may not make it."" Three months ago, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed in nearby Clarence Center, New York, killing all 49 passengers and crew members aboard. One person was killed on the ground.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The original judge has been dead for 15 years, and no one has been able to find the criminal case file since 2004. Yet a 1977 sex scandal involving famed director Roman Polanski and a 13-year-old girl continues to stalk the courts of Los Angeles. Academy Award-winning director Roman Polanski hasn't left France in 30 years because of a U.S. fugitive warrant. Attorneys for the 75-year-old Academy Award-winning director asked a judge Tuesday to put the matter to rest once and for all. But a judge denied the request, saying the director must show up in court to obtain a ruling. That poses problems for Polanksi because prosecutors have vowed to seek his arrest on a bench warrant the minute he sets foot in the United States. The bench warrant was issued when Polanski failed to appear for sentencing more than 30 years ago. Lawyers Douglas Dalton and Chad Hummel last month filed a 239-page dismissal ""request,"" citing allegations brought to light in the documentary, ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired."" The documentary was first broadcast in June on HBO, which shares a corporate parent with CNN. The court filing alleges that a meddling prosecutor who believed Polanski should be behind bars improperly influenced a judge to ignore the terms of a plea bargain, as well as the wishes of the district attorney's office, the probation officer and the victim. None of them wanted Polanski to serve jail time. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski, who has lived in exile in France since 1977, shows up in court. ""It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,"" Espinoza said in court. But he declined to dismiss the case entirely, a decision that didn't surprise legal experts who said such rulings are extremely rare. ""You have to give [Polanski attorney] Chad Hummel the creative lawyering of the year award,"" said legal analyst Laurie Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Espinoza in effect said he was tossing out the request without considering whether it has merit because Polanski hasn't shown up for court. But he suspended his ruling, writing that ""if the defendant submits to the jurisdiction of this Court within 30 days, the Court shall consider the merits of the motion."" Polanski's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out. Larry Silver, the victim's lawyer, said he was disappointed in the ruling and that Espinoza ""did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption."" He argued in court that had ""Mr. Polanski been treated fairly"" his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the incident. Levinson said the victim's support may offer a sliver of hope for Polanski. ""The best thing he has going is the victim,"" she said. ""In this age of victims' rights, if I were the lawyer I would be playing that card too."" But prosecutors have consistently argued that dismissing the Polanski case would be a miscarriage of justice, allowing a man who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child"" to go free. Polanski's attorneys back up the allegation with a DVD of the documentary, a script, a copy of Polanski's 1977 pre-sentencing report and various court transcripts, interviews and declarations. They paint a picture of backroom conversations between a prosecutor itching for a piece of the case and a judge so image conscious that he kept a scrapbook of media clippings, asked lawyers to ""stage"" Polanski's sentencing hearing and feared criticism if he didn't send the director to prison. Allegations of prosecutorial and judicial misconduct are commonly raised on appeal, but only a small percentage of these appeals succeed. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. The director, his lawyer and the prosecutor handling the case believed they'd hammered out a deal that would spare the young victim a public trial and Polanski jail time, according to the filing. The first surprise came when Judge Laurence J. Rittenband sent Polanski to prison for ""diagnostic testing"" to determine whether he was what then was called a ""mentally disturbed sex offender."" (The results came in after Polanski spent 42 days at a maximum security prison. He wasn't.) The second surprise came on the eve of sentencing, when Rittenband informed the attorneys that he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. Polanksi fled the United States and has been living in exile in France ever since. Previous attempts to resolve the case failed, including a recently disclosed secret negotiation in 1997. The sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to come to court because he would face almost certain arrest the moment he set foot in the United States. As a director, Polanski is best known for the films ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Chinatown"" and ""The Pianist,"" a 2002 drama about the Holocaust that won him the Oscar for best director. But he is also known for a personal life tinged with tragedy. He was born in France and moved to Poland with his parents as a small child. Later, he escaped Krakow's Jewish ghetto and hid from the Nazis with the help of strangers. His mother died at Auschwitz. He endured the anti-Semitism of post-war Europe, attended film school and directed ""Knife in the Water,"" which won a 1963 Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film. He then came to Southern California to make ""Rosemary's Baby."" As he was making his mark in Hollywood, Polanski was also making headlines in connection with two lurid Los Angeles crimes in the 1960s and '70s. Polanski was filming in Europe when members of Charles Manson's ""family"" butchered the director's pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, and four others in August 1969. Eight years later, he stood accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. Nicholson was not at home, but his girlfriend at the time, actress Anjelica Huston, was. According to a probation report contained in the filing, Huston described the victim as ""sullen."" She added, ""She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25. She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing."" Huston said Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl. ""I don't think he's a bad man,"" she said in the report. ""I think he's an unhappy man."" As she has from the beginning, the victim says Polanksi shouldn't go to prison. Samantha Geimer, now 45, married and a mother of three children, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly, she said, because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Earlier this month she filed a court declaration accusing prosecutors of victimizing her yet again by publicizing graphic details of the sexual encounter. The makers of the documentary also talked with people who played roles behind the scenes. From those interviews, the tale of alleged backroom dealings emerged. Former prosecutor David Wells was regularly assigned to Rittenband's Santa Monica courtroom. He handled routine matters and told the filmmakers he had the judge's ear. ""I was in the court every day,"" he said in an interview with the filmmakers. ""So Rittenband [would] ask me questions about the thing because he counted on me, or whoever was his favorite DA at the time, to advise him on what the -- what the law was, criminal law. He was very good at civil law, but criminally, he left that to his DAs to do."" Although he was involved in the early stages of the investigation, Wells was taken off the Polanski case. He said he was ""miffed"" at the way it was handled because he believed Polanski should go to jail. Wells recommended the 90 days of diagnostic testing to the judge because Polanski would be in a prison setting but couldn't appeal, he said. Wells told the filmmakers he showed the judge a photo of the director at an Oktoberfest celebration while the sentence was pending. ""I took the picture into Judge Rittenband. I said, 'Judge,' I said, 'Look here. He's flipping you off ...' And I said, 'Haven't you had enough of this?' And then he exploded and what happened happened."" Polanski's attorneys said the conversations were improper ""ex parte"" communications -- and nothing short of prosecutorial misconduct. Legal ethics and rules of criminal procedure usually bar one party in a case from discussing it with the judge unless the other side is present. Wells could not be reached for comment. His voice mail was full, and was not accepting new messages. But he recently told the Los Angeles Times that he did nothing wrong and that he still strongly feels Polanski should go to prison. It will be Judge Peter Espinoza's call on how to handle a celebrity case that appears to have been snakebitten from the start.

"(CNN) -- No one expected to find Donna Molnar alive. Donna Molnar's body temperature was 30 degrees Celsius when rescuers found her Monday. Searchers had combed the brutal backcountry of rural Ontario for the housewife from the city of Hamilton, who had left her home three days earlier in the middle of a blizzard to grocery shop. Alongside his search-and-rescue dog Ace, Ray Lau on Monday tramped through the thick, ice-covered brush of a farmer's field, not far from where Molnar's van had been found a day earlier. He kept thinking: Negative-20 winds? This is a search for a body. ""Then, oh, all of a sudden, Ace bolted off,"" said Lau. ""He stooped and looked down at the snow and just barked, barked, barked."" Lau rushed to his Dutch shepherd's side. ""There she was, there was Donna, her face was almost totally covered except for one eye staring back at me!"" he said. ""That was, 'Wow!' There was a thousand thoughts going through my head. It was over the top."" With one ungloved hand near her neck, Molnar, 55, mumbled and tried to scream as Lau yelled to other rescuers. Dressed in a leather coat, sweater, slacks and winter boots, Molnar was carefully extracted from a 3-foot-deep mound of snow that had apparently helped to insulate her.  Watch how the rescuers found Molnar » . Then, rescuers got their second shock. ""She was lucid, and said, 'Wow. I've been here a long time!' and then she apologized and said, 'I just wanted to take a walk, I'm sorry to have caused you any trouble,' "" said Staff Sgt. Mark Cox of the Hamilton Police Department, one of the leaders in the hunt. ""And we're all thinking this is incredible, this is really something."" ""I've been doing search and rescue for seven years, and this is the wildest case I've had in finding someone alive,"" he said. She was rushed to a hospital and immediately sedated to begin the agonizing steps of hypothermia treatment. ""I think the snow must have worked to trap her body heat, and that's what really saved her,"" Cox said. ""This really speaks to what's possible."" David Molnar is calling his wife's survival his ""Christmas miracle."" He wasn't able to speak with her immediately after she was taken to the hospital. But while she was under sedation, he leaned over her and whispered in her ear, ""Welcome back, I love you."" ""My wife, you know, doesn't pump iron. She is strong physically and spiritually,"" he said. ""When people say to me how do I explain how she survived, I said I believe God reached down and cradled her until the rescuers could find her, because there's no rational explanation."" In addition to hypothermia, Donna Molnar is being treated for severe frostbite, and her recovery will take months. But his wife's condition was upgraded Wednesday from critical to serious. ""That may not sound like a great thing to everyone, but to us, that is the best news we could possibly get on Christmas Eve,"" David Molnar said. As for Ace, he's still awaiting his reward: a T-bone steak. It's the least that can be done for a dog who, in his own way, paid it forward.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Martin, the speaker of Britain's House of Commons, said Tuesday he would resign in the face of widespread public anger over expense claims by lawmakers. Michael Martin, the House of Commons Speaker, has tendered his resignation. Martin, whose statement lasted barely a minute, said he would step down June 21. He is the first speaker to be forced out of office since 1695. Martin said he was stepping down in order to promote ""unity"" in the House of Commons. Prime Minister Gordon Brown later Tuesday announced recommendations for comprehensive reforms to the expenses system to put an end to the ""abuses and misjudgments of the past.""  Watch how the rules have led to abuse » . He proposed a review of expense claims of the past few years by an independent panel, and the introduction of an outside agency to regulate expense reimbursements, which Parliament currently does itself.

The reforms are currently only proposals. It is not clear if they will be implemented. Brown also paid tribute to Martin and added that he had chaired a meeting of party leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss an overhaul of the expenses system. The speaker traditionally chairs debates and ensures protocol is followed. But part of the reason MPs are now focusing their anger on Martin is that his office also handles expense claims.  Watch more on Martin's resignation » . Critics say he allowed claims to run amok and failed to recognize the depth of public disgust at the amounts being claimed -- into the tens of thousands of dollars for some lawmakers. Martin was savaged by MPs on Monday after he addressed parliament, with one lawmaker after another demanding to know when he would resign. Politicians across the political spectrum have been under fire after weeks of front-page headlines revealing their expense claims. What do you think about the expense scandal? They included requests for reimbursements for mortgages that had been paid off, members of the same family claiming the same expenses and reimbursement for lavish home furnishings. The justice minister, Shahid Malik, resigned from the Cabinet over his claims, which he insisted were within the allowable limits.

The expenses scandal came to light in a series of recent front-page reports in The Daily Telegraph newspaper. The expense claims were to be made public in the summer, but the Telegraph obtained them early. Many lawmakers put in the spotlight by the newspaper insist they broke no rules. London's Metropolitan Police announced shortly before Martin's resignation that they would not investigate the leaking of the expense reports to the press. ""The leak of documents is not something that the (Metropolitan Police) would condone,"" they said in a statement, but felt it was unlikely they would obtain the evidence they need to launch a successful prosecution. The police had not yet decided whether to investigate whether politicians broke the law in their expense claims, the statement added.","NEW: British PM announces recommendations for reforming system .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's hard-line Islamic group Al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar, the president's hometown, after a battle with pro-government forces Sunday. An Islamist fighter mans a position in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, on Saturday. Jowhar is a major town 55 miles (88 kilometers) southeast of Mogadishu, the capital. ""All businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while Al-Shabab are roaming the streets,"" a local journalist said. The town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government, which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from Al-Shabab in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006. After seizing control of Jowhar on Sunday, the rebels started conducting ""search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town,"" the journalist added. The clashes extended into the suburbs of the town, where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces, said the journalist, who requested anonymity for safety reasons. The town's seizure comes amid escalating tension between Somalia's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia, which has waged days-long attacks in the capital. In the latest round of violence, one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in Mogadishu on Sunday. Clashes between the rebels and the government in Mogadishu have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded, Somali officials said Friday. The east African nation has not had an effective government since 1991. Last week, a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters. ""It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government,"" said Sheikh Hassan Ya'qub, a spokesman for Al-Shabab. ""There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us."" The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, the spokesman said. Somalia's new president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, recently approved implementing sharia, but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form. Meanwhile, a powerful Islamist warlord defected to the government Saturday after he disagreed with rebel Islamist groups on the war against the transitional government. The warlord, Sheikh Yusuf Mohamud Siad Indha Ade, was the military commander of Hassan Dahir Aweys, who is suspected by the United States of being a terrorist.","Group Al-Shabab is affiliated with al Qaeda, according to the U.S.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A military offensive to rid Pakistan's northwest of al Qaeda and Taliban fighters has killed more than 1,000 militants since it began in full force earlier this month, the country's interior ministry said Sunday. A Pakistani girl displaced by the offensive against the Taliban rests at a camp Saturday north of Islamabad. Officials also said that only 2 percent of the North West Frontier Province remains under Taliban control as a result of the operation. Both claims were difficult to verify independently. The government did not say whether the operation resulted in civilian casualties, or how many people it displaced. The United Nations said Saturday that more than a million people have been displaced as a result of the two-week-old offensive. The U.S-led coalition and NATO -- based in Afghanistan -- have long said Pakistan is not being proactive enough in battling militants who are launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border. Pakistan has denied the claim. But the country's military launched an intense operation to rout out militants from the area after Taliban fighters took control of a district just 60 miles from the capital, Islamabad. The control of the Buner district brought the Taliban closer to the capital of the nuclear-armed country than it had been since it mounted its insurgency.

Human rights groups deplored the high number of casualties, urging both sides to comply with international law in respect to the civilian population. Thousands of families have fled the capital, Mogadishu, seeking a safer environment in camps south of the city.

"(CNN) -- She had many plans for the future: to go to college, start a career, meet the man of her dreams, raise a family -- when the time was right. Expert: ""There's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value."" It was all cut off by an unexpected pregnancy. The baby became her life, consuming her energy and forcing her dreams to the back burner of her life. She is 19 or younger and Latina, and has had her first baby. It's not what she wanted. Nor did her parents, who are the greatest influence on her decisions about sex, according to a wide-ranging survey released Tuesday by experts on the Hispanic community in the United States. The survey also found that 84 percent of Latino teens and 91 percent of Latino parents believe that graduating from college or university or having a promising career is the most important goal for a teen's future. Somewhere along the way, the aspirations fail to match up to reality. The survey attempts to examine some of the reasons for the disparity and why Latinas now have the highest teen birth rate among all ethnic and racial groups in the United States. ""There's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value,"" said Ruthie Flores, senior manager of the National Campaign's Latino Initiative. According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 53 percent of Latinas get pregnant in their teens, about twice the national average. After a period of decline, the birth rate for U.S. teenagers 15 to 19 years rose in 2007 by about 1 percent, to 42.5 births per 1,000, according to preliminary data in a March 2009 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. In 2007, the birth rate among non-Hispanic whites ages 15 to 19 was 27.2 per 1,000, and 64.3 per 1,000 for non-Hispanic black teens in the same age range. The teen birth rate among Hispanic teens ages 15 to 19 was 81.7 per 1,000. Of the 759 Latino teens surveyed, 49 percent said their parents most influenced their decisions about sex, compared with 14 percent who cited friends. Three percent cited religious leaders, 2 percent teachers and 2 percent the media.  Watch more on the survey results » . Three-quarters of Latino teens said their parents have talked to them about sex and relationships, but only half said their parents discussed contraception. The survey also found that: . • 74 percent of Latino teens believe that parents send one message about sex to their sons and a different message altogether to their daughters, possibly related to the Latino value of machismo. • Latino teens believe that the most common reason teens do not use contraception is that they are afraid their parents might find out. • 72 percent of sexually experienced teens say they wish they had waited. • 34 percent of Latino teens believe that being a teen parent would prevent them from reaching their goals, but 47 percent say being a teen parent would simply delay them from reaching their goals. • 76 percent said it is important to be married before starting a family. Flores said it is crucial to understand the beliefs and attitudes that influence teen behavior in order to reduce the high rates of Hispanic teen pregnancy. The survey, co-sponsored by the Hispanic advocacy group National Council of La Raza, was an attempt to to do just that. She said that despite a rich culture and the growing influence of Hispanics in America, the Latino community disproportionately suffers from troubling social indicators. Consider that fewer than six in 10 Latino adults in the United States have a high school diploma. Latino teens are more likely to drop out than their non-Hispanic counterparts, and of all the children living in poverty, 30 percent are Latino. ""Teen pregnancy is not an isolated issue,"" Flores said. ""It's related to poverty, to dropout rates. That's going to have an impact on our national as a whole."" Flores said 69 percent of Latino teen moms drop out of high school, and the children of teen mothers are less likely to do well in school themselves and often repeat grades. ""That has a big economic impact,"" Flores said. It's an impact that is sure to be noticed. The nation's 45 million Latinos constitute the largest minority group in the United States with a growth rate twice that of the general population. That means by 2025, one-quarter of all American teens will be Latinos.","53 percent of Latinas are pregnant by their 20th birthday, survey finds .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's hard-line Islamic group Al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar, the president's hometown, after a battle with pro-government forces Sunday. An Islamist fighter mans a position in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, on Saturday. Jowhar is a major town 55 miles (88 kilometers) southeast of Mogadishu, the capital. ""All businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while Al-Shabab are roaming the streets,"" a local journalist said. The town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government, which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from Al-Shabab in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006. After seizing control of Jowhar on Sunday, the rebels started conducting ""search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town,"" the journalist added. The clashes extended into the suburbs of the town, where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces, said the journalist, who requested anonymity for safety reasons. The town's seizure comes amid escalating tension between Somalia's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia, which has waged days-long attacks in the capital. In the latest round of violence, one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in Mogadishu on Sunday. Clashes between the rebels and the government in Mogadishu have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded, Somali officials said Friday. The east African nation has not had an effective government since 1991. Last week, a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters. ""It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government,"" said Sheikh Hassan Ya'qub, a spokesman for Al-Shabab. ""There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us."" The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, the spokesman said. Somalia's new president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, recently approved implementing sharia, but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form. Meanwhile, a powerful Islamist warlord defected to the government Saturday after he disagreed with rebel Islamist groups on the war against the transitional government. The warlord, Sheikh Yusuf Mohamud Siad Indha Ade, was the military commander of Hassan Dahir Aweys, who is suspected by the United States of being a terrorist.","Group Al-Shabab is affiliated with al Qaeda, according to the U.S.

"Editor's note: Eve Ensler is the playwright of ""The Vagina Monologues"" and the founder of V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women and girls. V-Day has funded over 10,000 community-based anti-violence programs and launched safe houses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, South Dakota, Egypt and Iraq. This commentary was adapted from remarks Ensler made Wednesday to the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs and the Subcommittee on International Operations and Organizations, Human Rights, Democracy and Global Women's Issues. Playwright Eve Ensler says conflict in Congo is taking a terrible toll on women and girls. (CNN) -- I write today on behalf of countless V-Day activists worldwide, and in solidarity with my many Congolese sisters and brothers who demand justice and an end to rape and war. It is my hope that these words and those of others will break the silence and break open a sea of action to move Congolese women toward peace, safety and freedom. My play, ""The Vagina Monologues,"" opened my eyes to the world inside this world. Everywhere I traveled with it scores of women lined up to tell me of their rapes, incest, beatings, mutilations. It was because of this that over 11 years ago we launched V-Day, a worldwide movement to end violence against women and girls. The movement has spread like wildfire to 130 countries, raising $70 million. I have visited and revisited the rape mines of the world, from defined war zones like Bosnia, Afghanistan and Haiti to the domestic battlegrounds in colleges and communities throughout North America, Europe and the world. My in-box -- and heart -- have been jammed with stories every hour of every day for over a decade. Nothing I have heard or seen compares with what is going on in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where corporate greed, fueled by capitalist consumption, and the rape of women have merged into a single nightmare. Femicide, the systematic and planned destruction of the female population, is being used as a tactic of war to clear villages, pillage mines and destroy the fabric of Congolese society. In 12 years, there have been 6 million dead men and women in Congo and 1.4 million people displaced. Hundreds and thousands of women and girls have been raped and tortured. Babies as young as 6 months, women as old as 80, their insides torn apart. What I witnessed in Congo has shattered and changed me forever. I will never be the same. None of us should ever be the same. I think of Beatrice, shot in her vagina, who now has tubes instead of organs. Honorata, raped by gangs as she was tied upside down to a wheel. Noella, who is my heart -- an 8-year-old girl who was held for 2 weeks as groups of grown men raped her over and over. Now she has a fistula, causing her to urinate and defecate on herself. Now she lives in humiliation. I was in Bosnia during the war in 1994 when it was discovered there were rape camps where white women were being raped. Within two years there was adequate intervention. Yet, in Congo, femicide has continued for 12 years. Why? Is it that coltan, the mineral that keeps our cell phones and computers in play, is more important than Congolese girls? Is it flat-out racism, the world's utter indifference and disregard for black people and black women in particular? Is it simply that the UN and most governments are run by men who have never known what it feels like to be raped? What is happening in Congo is the most brutal and rampant violence toward women in the world. If it continues to go unchecked, if there continues to be complete impunity, it sets a precedent, it expands the boundaries of what is permissible to do to women's bodies in the name of exploitation and greed everywhere. It's cheap warfare. The women in Congo are some of the most resilient women in the world. They need our protection and support. Western governments, like the United States, should fund a training program for female Congolese police officers. They should address our role in plundering minerals and demand that companies trace the routes of these minerals. Make sure they are making and selling rape-free-products. Supply funds for women's medical and psychological care and seed their economic empowerment. Put pressure on Rwanda, Congo, Uganda and other countries in the Great Lakes region to sit down with all the militias involved in this conflict to find a political solution. Military solutions are no longer an option and will only bring about more rape. Most of all, we must support the women. Because women are at the center of this horror, they must be at the center of the solutions and peace negotiations. Women are the future of Congo. They are its greatest resource. Sadly, we are not the first to testify about these atrocities in Congo. I stand in a line of many who have described this horror. Still, in Eastern Congo, 1,100 women a month are raped, according to the United Nations' most recent report. What will the United States government, what will all of you reading this, do to stop it? Let Congo be the place where we ended femicide, the trend that is madly eviscerating this planet -- from the floggings in Pakistan, the new rape laws in Afghanistan, the ongoing rapes in Haiti, Darfur, Zimbabwe, the daily battering, incest, harassing, trafficking, enslaving, genital cutting and honor killing. Let Congo be the place where women were finally cherished and life affirmed, where the humiliation and subjugation ended, where women took their rightful agency over their bodies and land. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eve Ensler.","Eve Ensler: War in Congo is targeting girls and women .

"PARKLAND, Florida (CNN) -- Sherri and Ira Rojhani stopped paying the mortgage on their 2-year-old South Florida home in April, victims not of a troubled economy, but, they say, of drywall from China that they believe is making them sick. An air conditioning unit in a Florida, is blackened and corroded from Chinese drywall, homeowners say. They join a growing list of homeowners in 13 states who face foreclosure or the prospect of paying both their mortgage and rent on alternate housing as they seek relief from what they describe as corrosive gasses emitted from the Chinese drywall. The drywall is now the subject of several scientific studies. ""Families are being forced to make health decisions based on financial consideration, and that is fundamentally flawed,"" said Sherri Rojhani, a homeowner in Parkland, Florida. ""We shouldn't be in a position to stay in a home, based on our health,"" she said. Homeowners allege the gas is causing home appliances and copper wiring to fail and causes chronic, long-term upper respiratory infections. Federal authorities including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission are studying the possible health effects of the drywall. Most of their results are still some time off. On Tuesday the EPA announced that it found sulfur, a corrosive material, in the Chinese drywall samples it tested and that sulfur was not found in the U.S. manufactured drywall samples it also tested. The EPA also found strontium in the Chinese drywall at levels about 10 times higher than in the U.S. drywall. Strontium is a metal often used in manufacturing the glass for television screens. The EPA also detected two elements typically found in acrylic paints in the Chinese drywall but not in the U.S. drywall. The EPA said these results are not intended to establish a definitive link between the drywall and the conditions being found by homeowners in their homes. The CPSC says representatives from the Chinese government are in the U.S. working on the issue. Pointing to the blackened copper on their home's corroded air conditioning unit as all the evidence they need, the Rojhanis say they aren't going to wait for the government studies. They say the air in the home they share with their son, Seth, 18, who is paraplegic with a history of cancer, is giving them headaches and causing sinus infections. Sherri says she's been coughing since February. ""What we are doing is discontinuing our mortgage, and saving our money for moving expenses, and for a rental property,"" Sherri Rojhani told CNN. They stopped paying their mortgage in April. Their attorney contacted their mortgage company, Countrywide, recently bought by Bank of America, almost a month ago with details of their plight. A letter to the Rojhanis from Bank of America's counseling center said the bank intends to move forward with the foreclosure process. That doesn't make sense to Sherri Rojhani. ""It's worth zero. They cannot sell it. They face the same issue we do for a potential buyer,"" she said. Countrywide / Bank of America did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Indeed, banks and mortgage companies across the country may soon find themselves in the same position if homeowners walk away and allow their homes to be foreclosed. ""They're having to make choices about their credit and whether they are going to lose their home, but they're always going to pick their health first,"" said Michael Ryan, the Rojhanis' attorney. According to the Gypsum Association, a trade group that represents drywall manufactures, enough drywall was imported from China during the housing boom from 2005 to 2007 to build 30,000 complete homes. But it's possible that some of the Chinese drywall was used in smaller remodeling projects across the country. So, the number of homes affected is difficult to calculate. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has made clear that not all Chinese drywall is bad. Rather than foreclosing, the Rojhanis suggest the banks team with homeowners against those who supplied the drywall. ""It's in their best interests to join us in going after ... the distributors and the manufactures to get remediation,"" she said. The Rojhanis are now suing their home builder. Joseph Espinal lives in the same Parkland, Florida, area as the Rojhanis, but his lender, HSBC, has given him and his family a three-month grace period in paying their mortgage. In an e-mailed statement, an HSBC spokeswoman, Kate Durham, told CNN: ""HSBC does not comment on individual customer matters but we can tell you that our home preservation team members regularly work with customers facing various hardships, to offer assistance."" But what happens after that three-month payment hiatus ends is anybody's guess. ""It's a great start,"" Joseph Espinal told CNN. ""But I don't see anybody coming up to the plate and saying, Mr. Espinal, I know we screwed you by building a house with toxic chemicals, here's a temporary home, while we repair what went wrong."" He's moving his wife and two young daughters into a rental this month, after what he describes as almost two years of sickness and visits to doctors. ""We have sinus headaches which lead to antibiotics, and then three weeks, four weeks later, I'm back asking for more,"" he said. Espinal made a 40 percent down payment on his home. He's concerned and angry about what's happened to his investment. ""I don't want to lose my money,"" he said. CPSC says Florida leads the nation in complaints about Chinese drywall. Other complaints from homeowners are coming from Louisiana, Virginia, Wisconsin, Ohio, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, California, Washington, Wyoming, Arizona, Tennessee and Washington D.C. Many homeowner's have turned to their home insurance companies for help, only to find that any problems would not be covered by homeowner's policies. ""If it's defective, where they have to be recompensated, that would have to come from the manufacturer,"" said Loretta Worters of the Insurance Information Institute, an insurance industry trade group. Last week, Florida Reps. Robert Wexler, a Democrat, and Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican, were successful in passing legislation that required the secretary of housing to examine the effect of Chinese drywall on mortgage foreclosures and to study the availability of property insurance coverage for these homes. ""It is critical that we address this problem swiftly to avoid devastating results in our communities and long-term effects on the health and well being of our families,"" Diaz-Balart said in a written statement. Meanwhile, Florida's attorney general has warned consumers to be aware of fraudulent companies selling bogus test kits and quick fixes, costing thousands of dollars. There are no quick fixes according to state and federal experts. Sherri Rojhani says she won't be taking any chances. ""If the fumes are strong enough to corrode metal, and copper pipe is turning black, I don't need a degree from the EPA to determine if my lung tissue is at risk.""","Chinese-made drywall emits corrosive gasses, homeowners say .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Dozens of gay and lesbian rights activists planning a parade in southwestern Moscow Saturday have been detained, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Gay and lesbian rights activists are detained in Moscow Saturday ahead of a planned march. The arrests included Nikolai Alexeyev, a prominent gay activist in Russia, and his associate Nikolai Bayev, Interfax said, adding that more people trickling into the location were being arrested without explanation. Officials of Moscow's gay community had announced earlier plans to rally at Novopushkinsky Park in central Moscow, Interfax said. The arrests came ahead of Saturday night's Eurovision Song Contest, which is being held in Moscow. The contest has a strong following among the gay and lesbian community.  Watch police break up the march » . Journalists from various countries gathered at the scene, as police barricaded the park with metal bars. Trucks with soldiers onboard were parked on nearby streets, Interfax said. UK gay human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, in a statement on his Web site ahead of the march, said it was being held to coincide with the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. ""This parade is in defense of human rights. We are defending the often violated human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Russians. They want legal protection against discrimination and hate crimes. I support their cause. ""Not all Russians are homophobic, but many are. Gay Russians suffer queer-bashing attacks, blackmail, verbal abuse and discrimination in education, housing and employment. This shames the great Russian nation."" The Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, sees singers and groups from a short list of European nations perform a specially written song before telephone votes from each nation decide the winner. In western Europe, the contest is regard as a light entertainment spectacular, with a strong following among the gay and lesbian community. Many fans dress up, hold parties and gather round the TV to watch the three-hour-plus televised marathon. In recent years, however, eastern European nations, which take the contest much more seriously, have come to dominate. The contest is also known for its political edge, as nations either give zero points to traditional enemies -- or, if they are enjoying good relations, the maximum number of points, as a sign of friendship. The most famous winners of the contest were ABBA, who came to attention as the Swedish entry with ""Waterloo"" in 1974. In 1988, Celine Dion won the contest while singing on behalf of Switzerland. The dance show Riverdance first came to attention as an interval act when the contest was held in Dublin, Ireland, in 1994. The organizers of the contest estimate it is watched by 100 million people worldwide.","News agency: Police barricade park where demonstrators due to meet .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of young elephants covered in the brown dirt of dried-up wells tell a heartrending story. A baby elephant in the Gourma region of central Mali had been trapped in a well for three days. Reaching desperately for drops of water, they had lowered their trunks, toppled in, remained trapped and died in Mali's scorching heat. The ""last desert elephants in West Africa"" have ""adapted to survive in the harsh conditions"" they face, Save the Elephants said Monday. But now, the group says, conditions have gone from bad to worse, and they are living ""on the margin of what is ecologically viable."" Save the Elephants distributed new pictures Monday that depict the devastating drought and the struggle for survival in Mali, one of the poorest nations in the world. ""Six elephants have already been found dead,"" the group wrote in a news release accompanying the photos. ""Four others, including three calves, were recently extracted from a shallow well into which they had fallen when searching for water. Only the largest survived."" The youngest are in the most danger, since their smaller trunks can't reach deep into the few remaining wells, the group said. The worst drought in 26 years is threatening the existence of the ""last desert elephants in West Africa,"" the northernmost herds in the continent, Save the Elephants said. The animals, now numbering only about 350 to 450, have been called ""the last elephants of Timbuktu,"" said Jake Wall, a scientist with Save the Elephants. But they're south of Timbuktu, Wall told CNN in a phone interview from Bamako, Mali. ""We tend to refer to them as 'the last Sahelian elephants.' ""  See a map of Mali » . Each year, the elephants trek farther on the fringes of the Sahara to find water. They have the longest migration route of any in the continent, traveling ""in a counterclockwise circle"" of about 700 kilometers (435 miles), Save the Elephants said. The images are signs of the crisis gripping the northwest African nation. The U.N. Development Programme ranks Mali near the bottom of its Human Development Index. It cites a 56 percent poverty rate in the country, with nearly a third of the population unlikely to live past age 40, and an illiteracy rate of 77 percent. The World Food Programme says the majority of infant deaths in Mali are due to malnutrition. The drought, combined with soaring temperatures, has also led to deaths of cattle, Save the Elephants said. ""The stench of rotting corpses fills the air, and what little water remains is putrid and undrinkable by all standards."" In areas where the elephants live and search for water, ""the normal peaceful coexistence between the elephants and herdsmen is starting to break down and giving way to conflict over access to water,"" Wall said. There is some hope for the weeks and months ahead. ""We're hoping the rains start in June, and that will allow the elephants to start drinking out of shallow ponds until the really heavy rains begin"" in July or August, Wall said. But ""urgent action"" is needed in the interim ""to secure water for the elephants,"" Wall's group said in its news release. Save the Elephants, which focuses on helping elephant populations worldwide, said it has partnered with a foundation and the Mali government in its fundraising appeal.","Elephants dying in Mali are among 350 to 450 left in the area .

"BIHAR, India (CNN) -- Extreme flooding has displaced millions of people on either side of the India-Nepal border after a river burst its banks, authorities said Thursday. People walk along a flooded railway track in Madhepura, India. In India's northeastern state of Bihar, almost 3 million people have been affected by the worst flooding in decades, and more than 100,000 people have been displaced in southeastern Nepal after the breach last week. The Saptakoshi River in Nepal is the same one that flooded neighboring India's poorest state, although the Indians call it the Kosi River. In some stretches, it is three miles (5 km) wide. Nepalese Home Secretary Umesh Mainali said that of those displaced in Nepal, ""more than 40,000 are living in government run camps."" Many victims are taking shelter in schools and colleges. Residents were forced from their homes after an aged and damaged embankment on the river burst August 18 in Nepal. Water flowed so forcefully through the breach that it actually changed the course of the river, which now flows 75 miles (120 km) east of its original bed. Bad weather and washed-out roads -- including the region's main highway -- have hampered relief efforts, officials said. The heavy rains have also made repairing the breach difficult. Nepalese and Indian teams have been working separately to try to stem the flow of water, Mainali said. State-run Nepal Television reported Thursday that many Indian citizens are coming through the open border because of the availability of food and shelter. The Indian government said that about 50 people have been killed, revising the figure down from 87 deaths reported Wednesday. The Disaster Management Department in Bihar released a death toll of 12, an increase of two since Wednesday. There was no immediate explanation for the variance in numbers. ""Flood is understatement,"" Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said. ""It's a disaster.""  Watch how India is struggling to cope » . Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress party, flew over the four most flooded districts of Supaul, Saharsa, Araria and Madhepura, the news agency Press Trust of India reported. Singh announced immediate aid of about $238 million and promised the delivery of 125,000 metric tons of grain to the region. CNN's Sara Sidner traveled by boat Thursday with some of the soldiers and called the mayhem ""enormous."" ""We have seen panic, we've seen sorrow, we've seen despair. ... Hundreds of people screamed to us from rooftops as we floated by."" The soldiers were trying to pull people to safety, Sidner said, ""but there are simply too many people to rescue and too few boats to do so. People were literally screaming, waving, running with suitcases in water trying to get to us."" The Home Ministry said that nearly 153,000 people have been evacuated, and 31,000 are staying in 155 relief camps. About 228,000 homes have been damaged. There was no number provided Thursday on the number of homes destroyed. Madhepura district, where 1 million people live in 378 villages, is the worst hit, officials said. There are 900,000 residents in Supaul and 250,000 in Araria. More than 2.7 million people in 1,600 villages have been affected, thousands of them marooned on thin strips of dry land peeking out from cloudy brown waters of the swollen Kosi River. With heavy rainfall forecast for the next two days, officials worry that the situation will get much worse. Indians call it the River of Sorrow. Every summer, from June to September, the relentless monsoon rains cause the Kosi to overflow, bringing untold misery. This year, though, it swallowed entire villages in areas unaccustomed to water that deep -- with the worst flooding in 80 years in the landlocked rural state. Government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and good Samaritans have begun doing what they can: using motorboats to rescue stranded residents, for example, or dropping thousands of food packets from the sky.  Watch as boats deliver supplies, provide rescue » . The scale of the disaster is overwhelming. About half the state is under water, a submerged area the size of the entire U.S. state of Delaware. One man told CNN's partner network IBN that he scrounged together 2,000 rupees ($45) to pay a boatman to ferry his family to safety. ""We agreed on 2,000 (rupees), and he upped it to 2,700 ($61) just like that,"" he said. ""What can I do? I paid him."" But many others stayed put. Nine hundred million Indians survive on less than 85 rupees ($2) a day, a British government study found this year. Many of them live in Bihar, the poorest and considered to be the most lawless state in India. They have nowhere to go. ""It's raining here. People are on rooftops begging to be rescued,"" CNN's Bharati Naik said while touring some of the affected area Thursday. There are ""not enough boats. Villagers are crying and extremely frustrated."" Officials worry that in coming days, stranded residents may start drinking the contaminated river water, raising fears of an epidemic. ""There is no water to drink,"" one man told CNN-IBN. ""We are hungry. We're thirsty. We have to drink something."" Roshan Kumar, a teacher from one of the flooded villages, arrived at an army base to seek help for his neighbors. About 30,000 people are stranded, he said. The army said it's doing all it can. Meanwhile, the water level in many areas continues to rise even as hope, among many, is beginning to falter.","India and Nepal battle worst flooding for decades .

"(CNN) -- Serbian police are conducting another search for war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic and another fugitive, the office of the war crimes prosecutor in Belgrade said Friday. Ratko Mladic, pictured in 1993, is the highest-ranking war crimes suspect still at large. The search, launched at the request of Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic, is being conducted around the town of Arandjelovac, 45 miles (75 kilometers) south of Belgrade, the prosecutor's office said. Serbia is offering a reward of 1 million euros for information leading to the capture of Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general wanted by the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY, in the Hague. A reward of €250,000 is offered for information leading to the arrest of Serbia's other fugitive, Goran Hadzic. Mladic is the highest-ranking figure from the conflict to remain at large following the July arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Mladic commanded the Bosnian Serb military during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.N. tribunal indicted Mladic in 1995, along with 51 others, on charges involving war crimes and atrocities committed during four years of civil war. In July 1996, an international arrest warrant was issued for Mladic after investigators collected evidence at the site of the Srebrenica massacre. Mladic stepped down as military commander in November 1996 and returned to Belgrade. But he disappeared after former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001. The 66-year-old faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity over the killing of some 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. He's also wanted for his role in the 1992 shelling of Sarajevo. In 1992, as hostilities broke out in Sarajevo, Mladic led the ""shelling and sniping to target civilian areas of the city and its civilian population and institutions, killing and wounding civilians, and thereby also inflicting terror upon the civilian population,"" the war crimes tribunal contends. The status of Mladic is one of the major stumbling block's to Serbia's admission to the European Union. In April Serbia's government signed a preliminary agreement setting the country on the path to full EU membership. But ratification of the agreement was made conditional on Serbia sending Mladic to the Hague. CNN's Ben Blake in London, England, contributed to this report.","Serbian police search for former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The then-senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee urged the CIA in 2003 not to destroy videotapes it had made of the interrogations of terrorist detainees, according to the newly declassified letter. Lawyers for several Guantanamo detainees say the government has defied orders to preserve evidence. Rep. Jane Harman wrote in a letter dated February 10, 2003, that destruction of the tapes would ""reflect badly on the agency."" The Democrat from California released the letter Thursday. Last month, the CIA acknowledged videotapes were made in 2002 of two terrorist detainees but were destroyed in 2005. Some of the tapes showed the harsh interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. In the case of Zubaydah, the tactics captured on videotape included waterboarding, which simulates drowning, a controversial technique that critics consider a form of torture. Shortly after becoming the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee in 2003, Harman was briefed on the CIA's interrogation and detention program, and the existence of the videotapes. She was told of the intention to destroy the tapes once an internal inquiry into the program was complete. Harman wrote her letter to the CIA's chief lawyer urging the agency to reconsider its plan. ""Even if the videotape does not constitute an official record that must be preserved under the law, the videotape would be the best proof that the written record is accurate, if such record is called into question in the future,"" she wrote. The release of the letter comes a day after the Justice Department announced there is enough evidence to warrant a criminal investigation into the destruction of the CIA tapes. The inquiry will look into whether the CIA or other government officials committed crimes in the handling of the tapes.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- The United Nation's International Maritime Organization (IMO) has gathered this week in the shipping hub of Hong Kong to draw up new rules on ship recycling. Ship-breaking yards in Bangladesh are responsible for pollution and health problems. As the delegates meet in the city's Convention and Exhibition center overlooking the harbor, many of the vast container ships that glide past them will end up 1,500 miles away on the beaches of south east Bangladesh. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh take 80 percent of end-of-life ships, according to the NGO Platform on Shipbreaking, but critics of the U.N. convention being discussed fear the problems of pollution and poor working conditions these countries experience through badly regulated shipbreaking will not be properly addressed. Lee Adamson, the IMO's spokesperson, is confident the convention will be ""a tremendous step forward in terms of health and safety for workers in the industry and for protection of the environment from end-of-life ships. It will set standards where none previously existed."" But those standards don't go far enough for lawyer and head of the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, Rizwana Hasan. She has been trying to clean up the dirty and dangerous industry through the law courts since 2003. Her passion and persistence led to a Bangladesh High Court ruling in March this year finally forcing the government to tighten its regulations of the trade. It has also brought her the Goldman Environmental Prize in April and increasing international attention. ""Now I have an international connection, my opponents are taking me more seriously as a threat,"" she told CNN. The main objection of Hasan and the nongovernmental organization Platform on Shipbreaking against the IMO convention is that it fails to deal with the issue of pre-cleaning -- the removal of toxic materials from ships before they are beached and dismantled, which is often done by hand by laborers without any safety equipment. ""Technical details about recycling are being discussed, but nothing about pre-cleaning of ships. It's the core issue. Pre-cleaning is when the majority of in-built toxic material of a ship is removed before being beached in a foreign country. Plus, nothing is being said against beaching -- Bangladesh's beaches have become a natural disadvantage,"" Hasan told CNN. Secretary-General of the IMO Efthimios E. Mitropoulos stated in his opening address of conference its aim ""is to adopt a new convention on the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships, while balancing the commercial and economic considerations of the industry."" With perhaps too much emphasis on the economic considerations of the industry, Hasan believes the IMO is in effect legalizing shipbreaking in the name of ship recycling. ""They're talking about the responsibility of the ship owners in building new ships, but not about the existing ships and what to do them,"" said Hasan. More ships to scrap . The ship breaking industry is booming. Single-hull oil tankers have to be taken off the high seas by 2010, but the financial downturn has also become a major factor. With less trade in goods, container ships are being taken out of service and scrapped, as shipping lines can no longer afford to keep them afloat. In turn shipbreaking industries fuels local businesses in iron milling and create local markets for parts from ships, including anything salvaged, from doors and tables to nuts and bolts. Shipping companies often sell their decommission ships to intermediary companies that then sell the ships to breakers yards. Less scrupulous companies will not ensure the ships are as free of toxic materials as they should be before they are dismantled and even change their flag of convenience so they are not bound by the UN Basel convention on the exporting of toxic material. In 2006 legal actions instigated by Hasan were successful in turning away two toxic-laden ships from being beached in Bangladesh. The dangerous job of breaking up ships has migrated from dry docks in industrial countries to other ports across the world, where labor and environmental laws are not strictly upheld. While still happening on a smaller scale in India, it was because of tighter laws there that more ships started being beached across the Bay of Bengal. The bulk of Bangladesh's shipbreaking is done on the beaches around Chittagong in southeastern Bangladesh. Casual laborers often include children and don't have the most basic of protection gear, such as gloves, hard hats or face masks while breaking up the ship by hand and have to handle a cocktail of toxic waste including asbestos, PCBs, lead and other heavy metals.  See more photos of the shipbreaking yards » . Accidents and death are common, although Hasan says it's almost impossible to say how many accidents occur; the shipbreaking companies are cagey on the numbers. ""I call it exploitation, I don't call it employment. The majority of the laborers are seasonal migrants from the north, the poorest of the poor. They will get three meals and day and rarely some payment, but they will definitely get diseases,"" said Hasan. Environmental devastation . As well as the human impact, the environmental damage has been equally devastating, with heavy metals contaminating the surrounding land, oil leaking into the oceans, and asbestos released into the air. Mangroves, natural protection zones against floods, have been cut down to make way for the shipbreaking yards and high value beachland leased out to the companies that run them. Fishing, the traditional livelihood of many in the region, has been ruined because of polluted water and few fish left in coastal waters. ""Bangladesh is allowing its beach to turn into a dumping ground. It's a classic example of environmental injustice,"" said Hasan. Yet Hasan is not denouncing the industry completely but the way in which it is conducted. ""It's a matter of disgrace for Bangladesh to have this industry in its current form. I'm not saying I want the industry to shut down, because the main stakeholders, the workers have a say in this. They should have a say whether we need the industry or not,"" said Hasan. There have been improvements in the treatment of workers since the High Court of Bangladesh ruled in March in favor of tighter regulations surrounding the industry. ""Until very recently the owners [of the shipbreaking companies] didn't take responsibility for deaths or injuries. After we started filing the cases they have started paying compensation."" The cases Hasan won were founded on the U.N.'s Basel Convention on the export and disposal of toxic waste. Although it has provided the means for Hasan and her team to score victories in the courts, the Basel ruling is a set of guidelines where the principal was to regulate toxic waste and not a legally binding rule for shipping. Adamson maintains that the Basle convention and other UN measures to protect ship workers and the environment were ""heavily involved"" in the draft convention. He also questions the usefulness of a convention that does not get universal agreement. ""There is nothing that can force a sovereign state to become party to an international convention should it consider it not in its interests to do so. What would be the value of a convention to which those states were not party? That, I think, is very much at the heart of the matter,"" he told CNN. Regardless of the final wording of the convention, Hasan's attentions will focus on improving the situation in Bangladesh for shipbreaking workers and the environment. ""There's something called natural justice. Enough is enough. Since the workers have been informed that there has been a ruling things have changed; they're getting their compensation. But that's not my goal -- to kill people and then give them compensation. My ultimate goal is to see this industry doesn't pollute and does not kill,"" said Hasan.","U.N. meeting in Hong Kong to draw up new convention on ship recycling .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- President George W. Bush called India's prime minister Thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the Indian leader this week, a White House spokesman said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal. ""Both leaders expressed their desire to see the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible,"" Gordon Johndroe said. The phone call took place two days after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament. The vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. The tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by Bush and Singh a year ago. Under the agreement, which will need to be approved by the U.S. Congress, India would have access to U.S. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants. That would happen even though New Delhi, which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998, has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements. In return, India has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program, and it would allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants. The plan would also expand U.S.-Indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology. The plan was approved by India's Cabinet last year, and does not have to be ratified by the parliament. The leaders of India's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in Parliament -- have accused Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal. A no-confidence vote would have forced Singh to resign, and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed. The Congress Party-led coalition has governed India since 2004. Tuesday's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of Singh's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers. Shortly after Singh survived the vote, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino praised the deal as ""a good one for everybody."" ""It's good for India because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need, one that is nonpolluting and one that doesn't emit greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said. ""And we think that we can move forward with this. If their legislature lets it move forward, then we can do the same here and then we'll be able to get this wrapped up.""","President Bush calls India's PM to push a proposed nuclear partnership .

"YANGON, Myanmar (CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and an American man who swam to her lakeside home went on trial in the military dictatorship Monday behind closed doors inside a prison compound. Soldiers guard the entrance to Insein Prison on Monday in Yangon, Myanmar. The trial is expected to last about three months, said Nyan Win, spokesman for her National League for Democracy party. Suu Kyi's lawyer asked the court to open up the hearings but was turned down because of security concerns, Win said. Police put up roadblocks on the streets leading to the Insean Prison near Yangon, with a half-dozen officers at each station. Shops around the prison were closed, according to opposition exile groups. A group of diplomats from Germany, Italy, Australia and Britain tried to pass through the barricades to attend the trial. They were stopped and turned away. ""It was a way of signaling our concern at what's happening and the need for the proceedings in the court to take place in an open and transparent fashion,"" Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Mark Canning, told CNN. About 100 supporters of Suu Kyi waited outside. The American visitor, John Yettaw, is charged with immigration violations and trespassing into a restrictive area, charges that carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Watch more on Suu Kyi's trial » . He is accused of staying overnight in Suu Kyi's lakeside home earlier this month, violating the conditions of her house arrest, according to the country's ruling military junta, which rarely grants her visitors. The central Missouri man was appointed a lawyer selected by the U.S. embassy, Win said. Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and two of her maids have been detained under Section 22 of the country's legal code -- a law against subversion -- according to Nyan Win, spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. Suu Kyi, 63, had been scheduled to be released from house arrest later this month after being incarcerated 13 of the past 19 years. She is now being held in a specially built area of Insein Prison, where Yettaw also is detained, a U.S. Embassy official told CNN on Friday. The timing of Suu Kyi's detention raised suspicion among her supporters, who said the government's action was an excuse to extend her house arrest.  Watch former U.S. president Jimmy Carter discuss Aung San Suu Kyi » . ""This is the cunning plan of the regime to put Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in continuous detention beyond the six years allowed by the law they used to justify the detention of her,"" said the U.S. Campaign for Burma, a pro-democracy group fighting for her release. ""Daw"" is an honorific. The southeast Asian country was known as Burma before the military government changed it to Myanmar. Those who oppose the junta still use the old name. Suu Kyi's lawyer, U Kyi Win, blamed her prison detention on Yettaw. Local media said Yettaw, a 53-year-old former military serviceman from Falcon, Missouri, swam almost two miles across Inya Lake on May 3 and sneaked into Suu Kyi's home. Police maintain a round-the-clock presence outside the house. And swimming in the lake is forbidden. U Kyi Win told CNN that Yettaw arrived at his client's house that day and that she asked him to leave immediately. U Kyi Win said Yettaw refused to leave, first saying he didn't want to swim in daylight for fear of being captured, and later blaming leg cramps. Yettaw finally left May 5. Suu Kyi didn't tell authorities about the visit because she didn't want Yettaw or anyone else to get in trouble, Win said, nothing that several of her party members and supporters are already in jail. He added that Yettaw would likely be in the courtroom during the trial. Little else is known about Yettaw's role in the Myanmar incident or his intentions, apart from local media reports that said Yettaw, a diabetic, told Suu Kyi's two housekeepers he was tired and hungry after the swim and they offered him food. Some previous media reports referred to him as John William Yeattaw. He appeared healthy and in good spirits at a hearing on Friday at Insein Prison, the U.S. Embassy official said. The defense will argue that Yettaw entered Suu Kyi's home due to poor government security, said Jared Genser, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who is one of the attorneys on her defense team. ""Frankly, she does not believe she did any offense,"" Genser said. He noted that Insein Prison houses many political prisoners, and the conditions are poor for even a young, healthy person. Tuberculosis is rampant, mosquitoes and other insects are numerous, and nighttime temperatures at the prison frequently reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit (29-32 Celsius) with no fresh air traveling through the facility, Genser said. ""There is deep reason to be concerned with her detention,"" he said. ""Insein is a notorious prison. It is filthy. ... When you combine that with her health concerns, it is very worrying."" Suu Kyi has been the face of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement and the focus of a global campaign to free her. Her National League for Democracy party won over 80 percent of the legislative seats in 1990, but she was disqualified from serving because of her house arrest, and the military junta ignored the results. It was during her house arrest that she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on trial with U.S. man .

"(CNN) -- Move over Wonder Woman and Lois Lane - Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin are breaking into the world of comic books. No capes, no tights: Female Force stars Sarah Palin, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Caroline Kennedy. Washington-based publisher Bluewater Productions released a series of comic books featuring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on March 11. The company says it has already sold 7,500 copies of each to distributors. ""We really want to show strong, independent, female role models in comics,"" said Darren Davis, president of Bluewater Productions. Another company released comics about President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain during the presidential election. Then they decided that Hillary Clinton's story needed to be told. ""She was the first [major] female presidential candidate, so we just started with [her], and there was so much interest in it,"" said Jason Schultz, executive vice president of Bluewater Productions. The first two issues in Female Force, already released, feature Clinton and Palin. The next two will feature Caroline Kennedy and First Lady Michelle Obama. The Michelle Obama comic is expected to be released in April, and has pre-sold 28,000 copies. The next set will feature other ""strong, independent women"" such as Princess Diana, Schultz said. Comic fans approve of the idea. ""I think it just says, like, that women are important,"" one comic book fan told CNN. Another added, ""It shows that comics aren't just about guys in tights beating each other up -- it's about information, it's about understanding people a little better,"" said another reader. Richard Laermer, CEO of a public relations firm and author of several books on marketing, said he's not surprised. ""We're in a very politically minded time right now,"" he said. The creators expect to expand the comic book world to a larger demographic with the books. ""It's bringing a whole new demographic to comic books,"" Schultz said. ""It just shows little girls, young women, that they can be anything they want,"" he added. Mary Ellen Balchunis, an assistant professor of political science at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said ""getting girls [interested in politics] at a younger age is brilliant."" ""I think it's great that they're doing these comic books,"" Balchunis said. ""In the past, women have shown a low level of political efficacy."" She said the choices are ""fabulous,"" because ""these are the women who are at the top of the totem pole right now."" Each comic will be biographical, Schultz said. ""With Hillary, it starts with her life and ends up with her as Secretary of State."" ""It would be fun to see how the superhero Hillary sort of pushes her way forth and shows people what she did in her life. To me that's just awesome,"" said Laermer. Another professor of political science said the way the women are portrayed will be important. ""Comic books, by definition, are caricatures, but there are different ways of doing those caricatures,"" said Landon Storrs, an associate professor of history at the University of Houston. ""So it's a question of what the artists go for. If they just tap into familiar stereotypes, then they could reinforce negative ideas about powerful women, even as they are trying to do the opposite,"" she added. The fact that real, living women are now in comic books is another barrier that Davis and Schultz have broken through, historian and author Trina Robbins said. ""It's about time. They've never done a major living woman,"" she said. ""I think what's good is they're doing women in politics and not Paris Hilton."" LaNeice Collins reported from New York. Robyn Sidersky reported from Atlanta, Georgia.","A comic book series featuring real women of power has hit the stands .

"(CNN) -- Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera, a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means ""Shorty,"" is the most wanted man in Mexico. He's also one of the most wanted men in the United States. Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel, which is battling for turf along the border. For five years, the State Department has kept a $5 million bounty on his head, calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security. Guzman, who leads the Sinaloa cartel, is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border. He recently upped the stakes, ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors, according to the Los Angeles Times. The cartel's tentacles and those of its chief rival, the Gulf cartel, already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March. ""No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does,"" said Arabit, who heads the DEA's office in this year's border hot spot, El Paso, Texas. See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. A December 2008 report by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities. So far, the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico, where the cartels' running gunbattles with police, the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year. It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007. Once again, drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year, Arabit said.  See who the key players are » . The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker, DEA agents say. But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire. ""It's coming. I guarantee, it's coming,"" said Michael Sanders, a DEA spokesman in Washington. Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman's shoot-to-kill instructions aren't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing sources and intelligence memos. The move is seen as dangerously brazen, the newspaper reported. In the past, the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement. U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border. The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border. But $700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target. Guzman, who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel, is said to be worth $1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade. He made this year's Forbes list of the richest of the rich, landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune. Popular Mexican songs, called narcocorridos, embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader. ""Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico,"" said security consultant Scott Stewart, invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993. Stewart, a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor, a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman's worth. Just a decade ago, Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians, moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels. The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back. Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits. Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, according to the DEA. Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine. Marijuana became the cartels' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007, bringing in $8.5 billion. Cocaine came in second, at $3.9 billion, and methamphetamine earned $1 billion, a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year.  Watch how marijuana became the cartels' top cash crop » . The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels, but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border, according to the DEA agents, local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN. The cartels' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa, Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence. The status and alliances of the players continue to shift. Although the DEA and some analysts disagree, others say the Zetas, a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police, are now running the Gulf cartel. ""From what we've seen, the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel,"" analyst Stewart said. ""In violent times, soldiers tend to rise to the top."" These soldiers are incredibly well-armed, police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime ""Hummer"" Gonzalez Duran. It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles, including AK-47s; 287 grenades; two rocket launchers; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. At the very least, the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table. The DEA's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate. Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a former military man who is also known as ""El Lazco,"" or ""The Executioner."" The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors. The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas; Sonora Nogales, across from Nogales, Arizona; and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California. Two years ago, the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas. It's all about the highways that help move the drugs. Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor, and Juarez has easy access to I-10, a major east-west interstate, and I-25, which runs north to Denver, Colorado. Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5, which heads north all the way to the Canadian border. Some of the battles are internal, Arabit said. Some are with other cartels. And some, he said, can be attributed to the cartels' ""desperate"" attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers. As soon as he took office in January 2007, Calderon called out the cartels. He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and, in some cases, do the job of local police. Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office. The violence involves beheadings, running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches. Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight. The cartels' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets. ""The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq,"" analyst Stewart said. ""It was simple machismo. The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas."" When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant, beneficiaries of their location. Today, they are shadows of their former selves, weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders. Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997. Known as ""The King of the Skies"" for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes, he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest. Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery. Two of them later were killed. His death, along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen, set the stage for the ongoing turf battle. When Cardenas was extradited in 2007, Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez  as well as Nogales. Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston, Texas, where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros, Mexico. Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana, and last year, Guzman made a move on that plaza as well. ""Right now, they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar,"" said the DEA's Elizabeth Kempshall, who heads the agency's office in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix has become the nation's kidnapping capital, largely because of the cartels' increasing presence. Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition: ""That is the worst thing for any cartel leader, to face justice in the United States."" CNN's Eliott C.

Suu Kyi's lawyer, U Kyi Win, blamed her prison detention on Yettaw. Local media said Yettaw, a 53-year-old former military serviceman from Falcon, Missouri, swam almost two miles across Inya Lake on May 3 and sneaked into Suu Kyi's home. Police maintain a round-the-clock presence outside the house. And swimming in the lake is forbidden. U Kyi Win told CNN that Yettaw arrived at his client's house that day and that she asked him to leave immediately. U Kyi Win said Yettaw refused to leave, first saying he didn't want to swim in daylight for fear of being captured, and later blaming leg cramps. Yettaw finally left May 5. Suu Kyi didn't tell authorities about the visit because she didn't want Yettaw or anyone else to get in trouble, Win said, nothing that several of her party members and supporters are already in jail. He added that Yettaw would likely be in the courtroom during the trial. Little else is known about Yettaw's role in the Myanmar incident or his intentions, apart from local media reports that said Yettaw, a diabetic, told Suu Kyi's two housekeepers he was tired and hungry after the swim and they offered him food. Some previous media reports referred to him as John William Yeattaw. He appeared healthy and in good spirits at a hearing on Friday at Insein Prison, the U.S. Embassy official said. The defense will argue that Yettaw entered Suu Kyi's home due to poor government security, said Jared Genser, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who is one of the attorneys on her defense team. ""Frankly, she does not believe she did any offense,"" Genser said. He noted that Insein Prison houses many political prisoners, and the conditions are poor for even a young, healthy person. Tuberculosis is rampant, mosquitoes and other insects are numerous, and nighttime temperatures at the prison frequently reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit (29-32 Celsius) with no fresh air traveling through the facility, Genser said. ""There is deep reason to be concerned with her detention,"" he said. ""Insein is a notorious prison. It is filthy. ... When you combine that with her health concerns, it is very worrying."" Suu Kyi has been the face of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement and the focus of a global campaign to free her. Her National League for Democracy party won over 80 percent of the legislative seats in 1990, but she was disqualified from serving because of her house arrest, and the military junta ignored the results. It was during her house arrest that she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on trial with U.S. man .

"EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- Marina Diaz knows each day could be her last when she leaves for school each morning. Marina Diaz and Alejandro Caballero cross a U.S.-Mexico border checkpoint on the way to school each day. But that doesn't stop her from making the trip from her home on the dusty outskirts of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a key battleground in Mexico's drug wars, to El Paso, Texas, where she attends high school. From the moment she catches a bus to downtown Juarez, she is mindful of her surroundings. This is a city that saw 1,600 homicides last year. She warily watches the federal soldiers patrolling the streets. Diaz, 18, finally relaxes after she clears customs at a border checkpoint and passes the ""Welcome to Texas!"" sign greeting pedestrians at the intersection of El Paso Street and 6th Avenue in downtown El Paso. From there, it's another five minutes to the Lydia Patterson Institute. She is not the only student making the trip across the border each day. In fact, most of the students in the school do it: About 70 percent of the institute's 459 students live in Juarez. Some are American citizens with Mexican parents; others are Mexican citizens who carry a student visa to any one of three U.S.-Mexico border checkpoints in El Paso that serve tens of thousands of students, white-collar workers and day laborers each day.  Students describe their lives and daily challenges » . When she gets to the school each morning, Diaz changes out of her jogging pants and into her uniform skirt. ""Because of the people over there, I don't feel comfortable with the men and stuff, so I wear pants,"" she explains. ""You definitely see a difference here. The streets, they are more clean here than they are in Juarez, and I think the people respect you a little more. You don't have to worry about people giving you trouble."" El Paso, population 734,000, has long enjoyed the benefits of strong community ties with its industrial sister city of approximately 1.5 million. But the violence and insecurity created by the war between the Mexican government and the drug cartels has strained that relationship. For students at Lydia Patterson, who live in Juarez and cross the bridge each weekday, the small, United Methodist preparatory school has become a safe haven in the months since drug-related violence in Juarez has intensified. ""My school is a home for me because I have teachers and they treat me like parents,"" says Hazel Barrera, 18. ""Here, they take care of us and they make us feel comfortable and safe."" Lydia Patterson's faculty and administrators -- many of whom are graduates of the school, and also reside in Juarez -- say the school's mission is very much the same as it was when it was founded nearly 100 years ago as a sanctuary for Mexican families fleeing the violence of the Mexican Revolution. ""Our students are exceptional, and I always tell them I respect them and I admire their courage because they're living through this horrible time,"" says the school's president, Socorro Brito de Anda.  Watch de Anda talk about how cartel violence affects her school » . ""There are some students who've had some very horrifying experiences, and we have to be there for them,"" she says. ""Make them feel safe is mainly what we want to do here, make them feel that there's a place where they can go to school and concentrate on school without having to worry about their safety."" Despite the Spartan aesthetic of the school grounds, which occupies a city block in downtown El Paso, most students might agree that Lydia Patterson lives up to de Anda's standards. Hazel Barrera and other Lydia Patterson students help clean the school to pay for their scholarships. By 7:30 a.m., the cafeteria is buzzing with chatter in English and Spanish of students who come in early for free breakfast. In the open-air courtyard that divides a pair of red-brick, two-story buildings of classrooms, students sit alone and in groups, reading books and exchanging gossip. In between classes, they gather in the office of their beloved student activities coordinator, an alumnus who helps them study history and plan activities. After classes, students linger as long as they can before it gets dark, chatting in empty classrooms with bars and gates over the windows and doors. Many stay for team sports or clubs, others contribute to the school's upkeep -- a stipulation of the scholarships that more than two-thirds receive. If a soccer game or yearbook meeting ends late, the school ensures that a teacher, coach or parent escorts the students over the bridge, oftentimes, all the way home. ""There are teachers who can take us home because they are close to us and they want to be sure that we come home safe,"" Hazel says. ""I don't feel like it's two countries, I feel like it's two homes.""  Watch Hazel talk about her two homes » . Since Mexican border towns became battlefields in the drug war, American towns like El Paso have become refuges for middle- and upper-class Mexicans. Many have moved their businesses stateside; the El Paso real estate market is seeing an influx of Mexican nationals and green card-carriers from Juarez purchasing homes and relocating their families. Families that cannot give up their lives in Juarez send their children to schools like Lydia Patterson, which has accepted 25 new students from Mexico since January. The instability in Juarez has sent ripple effects through the school. ""We've had more inquiries from parents wanting to bring students to our school because of security, but on the other hand, they're struggling financially because many have had to close their business in Juarez due to the violence, so they're looking for a safe place for their children,"" de Anda says. ""I've had parents in my office crying and pleading for us to take their children. They say the part of the day that their children are in school is the only time they don't fear for their safety,"" she says. Ask any student walking through Lydia Patterson's fluorescent-lit hallways how ""narcotrafico"" related violence has affected him or her, and most relay some vignette about a relative or neighbor who was robbed at gunpoint, extorted with death threats or caught in the middle of gunfire. Diaz remembers the time she and some friends were walking to the mall when they spotted a crowd swarming around a body. ""They told us that it had happened just a few minutes before, and it was like, wow, if we were there only a few minutes earlier, maybe it could've been us,"" she says, smiling nervously at the thought. Many of the teens at Lydia Patterson appear trapped between two worlds: one in which society tells them they're not safe, and another in which they feel such fears are exaggerated. The violence in Juarez has curtailed the social lives of Diaz and her friends, as their parents forbid them from going out after school or after dark on the weekends. ""It's not that they don't trust my friends or the things I do, but they're seriously worried that I may be in the wrong place at the wrong time and that something might happen to me,"" says Irvinn Ceja, 16.  Watch Irvinn describe how drug violence has changed his life » . Ceja says he is concerned more for his parents' safety than his own. ""I think that especially my dad, he's the one who works, he's a salesman, he works in the streets, he has to visit his clients, has to offer his products, so most of his time is on the streets driving and that's a big cause of stress because anything might happen,"" Ceja says. Parents view Lydia Patterson as a means of elevating their family above the instability of Juarez. ""What would have become of my children if they stayed in Ciudad Juarez? Our lives changed the moment we were able to leave the danger, the fear of going out in the streets,"" says Maria Isabel Munoz Bustamante, whose daughter graduated from Lydia Patterson five years ago, and has a son, Alejandro, enrolled in his senior year. ""We were nearly at the point of being another statistic in Ciudad Juarez, just a number."" The situation is Juarez also affects students who live in El Paso. Mari Brito says her father's import business has taken a hit, and the family doesn't visit relatives in Juarez as much anymore. Also gone are the days when Brito would cross freely between El Paso and Juarez to hang out with friends. Their contact is now limited to the school day and the Internet. ""We used to have all kinds of fun [in Juarez] and now we can't anymore because we don't know if it's safe,"" says Brito, whose parents sent her to Lydia so she could get in touch with her Mexican roots. Like many El Pasoans, Brito sympathizes with the plight of her classmates and considers it a problem that extends to her community. ""I've learned to be grateful that I have the opportunity to live in El Paso and to probably care a little more about my neighbor city,"" she says. ""We're all exposed to it because we know of it and we know the danger of it ... , so we've all been through it.""","70 percent of Lydia Patterson Institute's students commute from Mexico .

"SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- India's military on Wednesday accused Pakistani forces of another cease-fire breach in Kashmir. Indian troops in Kashmir go through their drills. This week has seen tensions mount in the region. ""Pakistani troops fired six 82-mm mortar rounds in a span of one hour... at our positions,"" Indian defense spokesman Lt. Col. A. K. Mathur said Wednesday. But the report was denied by Pakistan's army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, who said there had been no ""exchange of fire from our side ... of the LoC [Line of Control],"" that divides the Kashmir region between India and Pakistan . Mathur said no Indian forces were wounded in the incident, and they ""maintained restraint and didn't retaliate."" ""We contacted the Pakistan army on the hotline and told them to stop the firing so that the situation doesn't escalate,"" the Indian spokesman said. But Abbas said he had no reports from local commanders of any incident . ""This has been their [India's] allegation but as far as the local commanders are concerned ... there is no incident from our side of any kind,"" Abbas said. The reported incident came after Monday's border clash in Kashmir, the first major skirmish between South Asia's nuclear rivals since a 2003 cease-fire. India maintains that Pakistani crossed the LoC and fired on Indian soldiers, prompting a firefight. Pakistan blamed India for sparking the incident by crossing into its territory in Kashmir. Senior Pakistani and Indian military officials met briefly Tuesday to discuss the incident, in which one Indian soldier was killed. Pakistan denied reports that its forces sustained casualties. Indian and Pakistani forces have exchanged periodic gunfire since May, but Monday's clashes appear to be a serious setback to the ongoing peace process between the two nations. Indian Defense Minister A. K. Antony blames Pakistan for 19 cease-fire violations since January, which Pakistan denies. Kashmir has been at the root of two wars between India and Pakistan, both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998. An 18-year separatist campaign in the Indian-controlled portion of the largely Muslim territory has claimed more than 43,000 lives, according to government officials, although human rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the toll at twice that number. India has long accused Pakistan of supporting the separatists in Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies. India blamed militants from Pakistan for a suicide car bombing outside its embassy in Afghanistan that killed 58 people on July 7.

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. He is host of ""No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET on CNN while Campbell Brown is on maternity leave. Roland Martin says Michael Vick has served his sentence and should be allowed back on the field. (CNN) -- When Michael Vick completes home confinement in July, he will have served the 23-month prison sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to federal dogfighting charges. After his release from a Kansas prison Wednesday, he headed to his home in Virginia to serve the final two months under home confinement, because all the beds at halfway houses in the area are taken. But that hasn't deterred the Vick haters who are still in an uproar over the heinous details of his dogfighting kennel. Yes, reading the details of the treatment of the dogs, including the killing of some of them, could make anyone sick. Yet what's the point of sentencing someone to jail, then having them serve their time and be released if we still want to imprison them for the rest of their lives? Frankly, I'm sick of Americans who talk all day about ""do the crime, then do the time,"" then still want to treat a man like a criminal when he gets out of prison. This doesn't just apply to Michael Vick. Look at all the individuals who are sent to prison, get out and then can't find a job. Why? Because they have the Scarlet Letter on their record, which is a big fat ""F"" for felon. Don't think I'm looking for any sympathy for someone who goes to jail. I firmly believe that you deserve all that you get for breaking the law. But listening to some of these zealots go on and on and on about Vick needing to continue to be punished is ridiculous! The judge in Vick's case has imposed a number of restrictions. One of them is that he can't ever own a dog again. OK, gotcha. But to say the man shouldn't be allowed to play in the NFL is D-U-M-B. The crimes of which he was convicted had nothing to do with playing sports. Remember Wall Street star Michael Milken? When he was sent to jail for securities fraud, he was banned from working on Wall Street again. I get that. He was an insider and allowing him back into the financial game would have been atrocious. I get it when someone is convicted of molesting children that they can't live within a certain distance of a school or be left alone around children when released. But there is nothing related to Vick's crime that says he should not be allowed to play professional football. What is particularly galling is that, right now, you have any number of football players who have beaten people -- including their wives and girlfriends -- served time for drunk driving or committed other crimes, yet they have resumed their careers. The same goes for teachers, radio and television broadcasters, politicians and others. So is this any different because it involved dogs? Are we to say that the horrible treatment of dogs is vastly different than mistreatment of human beings? The critics will likely say, ""These men are role models. Kids look up to them. They should have no business on the field."" Yet some of these same kids are living with fathers and mothers who are felons. So are we supposed to remove them from the home as well? Enough with the public bullying. Vick was sentenced and served his time. And now he's gotten out. If you want to be angry with him, fine. But please, cut the sanctimonious crap. He deserves to make amends and get on with his life. If you were in his shoes, you would want to do the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: By July, Michael Vick will have finished his 23-month sentence .

"GAINESVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- When 19-year-old Reid Overton wants to smoke a cigarette on his college campus, he has to walk to a distant parking lot and get into his car, but he doesn't seem to mind. ""Even as a smoker, I don't like to walk past a cloud of smoke,"" he says. Reid Overton, a freshman at Gainesville State College in Georgia, heads to his car when he wants a smoke. Overton is one of 5,300 students at Gainesville State College, an hour north of Atlanta, Georgia. A 4-year-old ban prohibits anyone from using tobacco products on campus, including students, faculty and visitors. A smoke-free campus was the brainchild of longtime college president Martha Nesbitt, herself a former smoker. ""It's just a healthier place to be,"" says Nesbitt, ""because as you go in a building, you're not going to have to go through smoke. When you walk out, you don't see cigarette butts littered around. It's just a cleaner, healthier campus."" Nesbitt reports there haven't been any problems enforcing the ban. Signs are posted around campus, and the policy is prominently displayed on everything from the school Web site to admissions applications. The American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation reports nearly 60 college campuses around the United States have smoke-free policies that affect the entire campus. Other schools have limited restrictions, banning smoking indoors in residential housing and student facilities. Nesbitt believes her college is one of the first to fully prohibit the use of tobacco products. Watch more on efforts to curb smoking on campus » . The American Cancer Society says the movement is catching on. ""The trend toward a smoke-free country is going on everywhere,"" says Daniel Smith, president of the American Cancer Society Action Network. ""I think college campuses are simply reflecting the same trend we're seeing in society."" With the 30th anniversary this week of the nationwide Great American Smokeout, the cancer society is pushing a smoke-free college campus initiative. It encourages campus coordinators to hold competitions and distribute survival kits that include gum and support information. The group is trying to convince students that if they can quit for a day, they can quit for good. According to the cancer society, the prevalence of smoking in the United States is highest among college-age students, ages 18 to 24. While other age groups are decreasing their tobacco use, the cancer society says college students are smoking at a greater rate. Those statistics worry Smith. ""We know that 30 percent of all cancers are caused by smoking,"" he says. He blames the addiction rates among young adults on heavy marketing efforts on college campuses by tobacco companies. ""Many people might initially think it's cool. But when they're educated about the health effects, by that time, they are addicted, and it's very hard to quit."" Overton isn't all that worried about cutting back on his pack-a-day smoking habit, but he says that long walk to his car has provided some added benefits. ""It doesn't encourage me to quit, but it does encourage me to cut back some."" That's welcome news for some of his nonsmoking classmates. ""I'm not forced to be around all of the smokers,"" says freshman Matthew Bradford, 19. ""I'm not breathing it in all of the time, and it's nice to get some fresh air when you get out of class.""

"(CNN) -- Residents of a western Pennsylvania neighborhood can return home Sunday after a chemical leak forced them to evacuate the night before. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee Saturday after a chemical leak in Petrolia, Pennsylvania. Authorities surveyed the neighborhood in Petrolia and determined that no traces of the toxic chemical remained, said Freda Tarbell, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. A leak at the Indspec Chemical Corp. plant in Petrolia on Saturday formed a cloud affecting at least 2,000 residents -- some of whom fled their homes. Others huddled indoors with their windows shut, authorities said. Three people were taken to hospitals, but officials could not immediately say why.  Watch why residents were asked to evacuate » . It was not immediately clear how many people were injured, though plant manager Dave Dorko said all employees and inspectors at the plant were safe and accounted for. Tarbell described the chemical as fuming sulfuric acid, which is also known as oleum. The plant uses the chemical during its production process, she said. The plant produces a chemical called Resorcinol -- essentially a strong glue used in the tire industry. The leak affected between 2,000 and 2,500 residents, Tarbell said. Some stayed the night with friends and relatives and some sought refuge in shelters. Others opted to stay indoors and ""shut their windows and doors to make sure the acid cloud was not entering their home,"" she said. Ed Schrecengost, a former Indspec employee, said firefighters showed up at his son's wedding reception, urging the guests to leave. ""It's about as dangerous as you can get,"" Schrecengost told CNN affiliate WPXI. ""It's a very fuming acid. A quart bottle of this material could fill a household in two seconds."" Dorko said the leak was caused by an overflow from a tank. The material, he said, evaporates easily, creating a toxic cloud.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A Georgia man suspected of shooting to death a 21-year-old up-and-coming rapper at a ritzy Los Angeles shopping center Monday afternoon is being held on $1 million bail, Los Angeles Police said. Rap artist Dolla arrives at the Soul Train Music Awards in Pasadena, California, on March 10, 2007. Dolla, whose real name is Roderick Anthony Burton II, was shot in the head about 3:10 p.m. at the Beverly Center, his publicist said. Police later arrested Aubrey Louis Berry, 23, at Los Angeles International Airport, a Los Angeles Police statement said. No other details were given about Berry, who was arrested on suspicion of murder. Dolla, who was based in Atlanta, Georgia, was in Los Angeles recording his debut album. He caught the attention of multiplatinium R&B singer Akon when the then-12-year-old Dolla was performing with friends at showcases around Atlanta. The two collaborated on Dolla's first single, ""Who the F--- is That?"" which also featured another high-profile singer, T-Pain. Another Dolla song, ""Feelin' Myself,"" appeared on the soundtrack to the 2006 movie ""Step Up."" According to his MySpace page, Dolla was born in Chicago, Illinois. His twin sister died at birth due to complications from an enlarged heart. The family moved to Atlanta after Dolla's father committed suicide -- while Dolla, then 5, and another sister watched from their parents' bed, the Web page said. Dolla began composing rhymes in elementary school and decided to pursue a career in music. A source close to the record company said Dolla had just arrived in Los Angeles to work on his debut album.

"PADUCAH, Kentucky (CNN) -- The aunt of former U.S. soldier Steven Green told jurors tearfully Monday that ""We did not send a rapist and murderer to Iraq"" as defense lawyers worked to save her nephew from a death sentence. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl. Patty Ruth, a Texas elementary school principal, told a civilian jury about Green's childhood as a reader who loved to be hugged by relatives. ""I do not know how we got to this spot,"" Ruth said in emotional testimony. ""I do not know how this happened."" Green was convicted last week in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of murder, rape, conspiracy and obstruction of justice in connection with a 2006 rape-and-murder south of Baghdad. A jury found him guilty of raping a 14-year-old girl, then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence. Green also was found guilty of killing the girl's parents and 6-year-old sister. He could become the first former U.S. soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court, where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light. Four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover-up that followed. Green faces either death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. His fate will be in the hands of the jury by week's end. The defense has presented relatives and medical professionals who have pieced together a picture of Green's childhood as troubled and stressful. It included the breakup of his parents' marriage, routine beatings to the point of injury by an older brother and being moved about through Texas by his mother. Ruth, the final witness scheduled by the defense, said that when the idea of the military came up for her nephew, she was unsure the Army would accept him. Even after he received a high school diploma through a correspondence course, she said, ""I could not picture or imagine how he could make it through basic training."" Ruth said when she saw a picture of her nephew before his September 2005 deployment, she knew he wasn't ""Stevie"" anymore, standing as tall as his father in the photo at Fort Benning, Georgia. When he returned from Iraq 11 months later, he was ""remarkably thin,"" Ruth said, and she noticed circles under his eyes. Green and his father spent a night at the Ruth home, his aunt said, and she remembered him pacing the yard while smoking. He fell asleep wearing his fatigues, she said. When asked by the defense about the rape-murder plot that left an Iraqi family dead near Yusufiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad, Ruth responded, ""He's my Steve. You can't stop loving someone."" There were other family members in the court on Monday. Green's father, John, an oil field worker from Midland, Texas, looked on quietly. He did not testify. Ruth, who is John Green's sister, noted for the jury that Green's mother is not at the trial this week. The mother is moving and had to attend a going-away party, Ruth said. Final arguments are expected Wednesday.","Steven Green in sentencing phase after being convicted of rape, murder .

"LONDON, (England) CNN -- Natalia Vodianova is best known as the supermodel who has graced the cover of Vogue, walked the catwalk for the likes of Chanel and Versace. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova's charity plans to build hundreds of play parks for children in her native Russia. But Vodianova has a dream that couldn't be further from the glitzy world of fashion -- to build 500 play parks in her native Russia. Vodianova, born and raised in Russia, was in the country during the 2004 Beslan school siege, in which at least 339 hostages, around half of them children, were killed. Deeply affected by the tragedy she returned to New York, where she was living at the time, determined to do something to help the surviving children. Vodianova organized a fundraising event that generated $350,000 to build the children a playground and she founded her charity, the ""Naked Heart Foundation."" With an ethos that play is not only therapeutic for children, but a necessity, the foundation aims to provide playgrounds for Russia's urban youth. So far the charity has built 23 playgrounds around the country, starting in her home town of Nizhnii Novgorod, and there are 15 more in the pipeline. ""For me, since I started my charity, it has been a very different way of life,"" Vodianova told CNN.  Watch Vodianova take CNN around Moscow » . ""Giving back just feels so great. I always try to open each play park with myself present for the children, because it makes it more special for them. I go to very remote parts of Russia are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love."" For Vodianova, this is just the start. She told CNN that her dream is to build 500 play parks in Russia. The charity's play parks can cost anywhere between $27,000 and $400,000, depending on their size and range of play equipment. Vodianova admits, ""It's a big dream -- an expensive one!"" When it comes to fundraising, Vodianova's secret weapon is her connections in the fashion world. Last year she organized a ""Love Ball"" in Moscow -- a Valentine's Day fundraiser that counted among the guests the likes of designer Valentino, actress Lucy Liu, singer Natalie Imbruglia, and supermodel Eva Herzigova.  See photos of ""The Love Ball."" » . The event was held in a former royal residence, Moscow's 16th century Tsaritsino Estate. It featured an ice palace made from 220 tons of ice and music provided by British band Razorlight, among others. The highlight was a Valentine's-themed auction, with lots including a private performance from rock star Bryan Adams, bought for $120,000, and a painting by British artist Damien Hirst called ""Love is All Around,"" which sold for $1.6 million. The auction alone raised $6.7 million for the charity. Vodianova admits that the global economic crisis is making it harder to get sponsorship for this year's event and says it will be more low-key than last year. ""We are not going to make it a very extravagant event; it's very disrespectful of what's going on in the world right now, with the recession and a lot of people losing their jobs. ""We're not gong to spend a lot of money on it, but it's important to keep going,"" she told CNN. With a husband and three young children, Vodianova says it can be hard to divide her time between family, career and her charity. She describes her charity work as a 24-hour job. ""I feel a huge sense of responsibility for my foundation because it's really very important to me. Somehow it became my most difficult baby to raise,"" she says. But she has no doubt about the value of her work, both for Russia's children and herself. ""The biggest thing I can do for my soul is to hear that laughter and to see all these children that come and play on the play parks that my foundation built.""

"Editor's note: Clark Howard, the Atlanta-based host of a nationally syndicated radio show, will be host of a new television show designed to help viewers save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times. ""Clark Howard"" debuts on HLN January 3. The show will air Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m., noon and 4 p.m. Clark Howard says there are good bargains in store for those who wait until January to shop. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Retailers have received the biggest lumps of coal in their Christmas stockings in memory. Americans have been on a buyers' strike all fall and have not been interested in 50 percent off sales, doorbusters or any other promotions to get them to pry open their wallets. In a normal year when Christmas season sales are strong, retailers offer whatever they have left after the holiday, just the unloved stuff that didn't sell, at incredible markdowns. This year is different. You may get some bargains after Christmas, but if you want really rock-bottom prices, wait until January 5. Retailers are going to be stuck with massive amounts of goods and those will be reduced to fire sale prices. If you have money that you can afford to part with, get out there the first full week of the New Year. Everything from electronics to clothing to appliances to furniture will be a deal. Be careful if you shop from December 26 through January 4. The bargains are mostly fake ones during those 10 days because patterns are completely disrupted by gift cards. Most people are off from work between Christmas and New Years, have the time to shop and have the gift cards burning a hole in their wallets. Stores are able to ""pretend"" to offer bargains in the immediate after-Christmas period and people feel like they ""have"" to spend right away with store credit from returns and that gift card dough. As a result, the discounts are relatively small. However, follow my way and your wallet will really smile on you. Wait to do returns until after the 5th and those long return lines are gone. Retailers usually give 14 or so days after Christmas to do returns so you are still OK on the deadline and you don't have to wait in lines, which I avoid like the plague. Then think about it: You get the pick of all the merchandise that people returned that has been marked down and you get access to all the stuff that didn't sell that is on final clearance. But that's not all: I love January shopping because you have the stores virtually to yourself. My favorite time to go is Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night when you will find more employees than customers in the stores. I do have a special warning about all those gift cards. A lot of retailers that have been selling gift cards this season are not going to make it. Expect a wave of retailer bankruptcies in January, February and March. Over and over again bankruptcy court judges have wiped out the value of gift cards. Don't let your's lie around in a drawer gathering dust after Christmas. Use them over the next month before they go bad. Speaking of stores going bust, don't get fooled by ""Going Out of Business"" sales, known in the lingo of the trade as GOB's. They are as phony as a $3 bill. When any chain store goes broke, they hire a specialist company known as a liquidator. The liquidator is the one who puts those big going out of business sale banners on the stores and pays those guys to stand on street corners holding signs that say 40 percent, 50 percent, even 60 percent off. But the deals are usually fake. Many liquidators will sell the store's merchandise at a discount, but usually not as good as prices on a regular sale. The real money is made by the liquidator in many cases by bringing in what I call ""fake"" goods. They are not literally fake, just things that were never sold in the store in the first place. Those items are priced with high prices that are then ""discounted"" 50 percent or more to fool you into thinking you are getting a real deal. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Clark Howard.","Clark Howard: American consumers have been reluctant to buy this year .

"(CNN) -- Police in Milwaukee are working to track down a serial killer linked to at least seven unsolved homicides dating back more than two decades, authorities said. Five victims (clockwise from top left): Debora Harris, Joyce Mims, Tonya Miller, Quithreaun Stokes, Sheila Farrior. Law enforcement officials in the Wisconsin city have matched the unknown man's DNA with seven women -- six prostitutes and a runaway involved in the drug trade. The deaths occurred between 1986 and 2007. ""Six of the victims were women who were working as prostitutes -- high-risk behavior that makes them vulnerable to crime,"" authorities said. Police believe the killer had sex with the runaway, but she was killed by someone else. The developments have prompted officials to form a local, state and federal task force to investigate the homicides. A state lab is working to determine whether the DNA of at least 23 other slain prostitutes matches that of the killer. ""In the past, we might have linked some of these homicides through their method of operation, but theory has given way to technology,"" said Edward Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief. ""Within the last couple of weeks, we have been able to confirm a link."" Flynn, who described the killer as an ""unknown suspect who conducts his business in secret,"" said the investigation would require tips from the community. ""This suspect has been able to avoid and evade law enforcement for these last 23 years. He has never been arrested for a felony as he does not appear in any DNA database,"" Flynn said. Police said 42 prostitutes were killed between 1986 and 2007, and that 31 percent of the cases have been solved. There has been a higher clearance rate -- 78 percent -- in other homicides. Of the seven killed, two were in 1986, three in 1995, one in 1997 and one in 2007. The runaway was one of the three killed in 1995. Flynn said there have been ""patterned homicides"" discovered across the country as a result of advanced DNA technology, citing investigations in Los Angeles, California; Mesa, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada. However, he said there is no link with the Milwaukee cases. In discussing advances in DNA technology, Flynn said there were no matches in 1990s, two around 2000 and the seven have been linked in recent weeks. ""We already have determined that five suspects in murders of other prostitutes -- completely unrelated to this investigation -- have been identified because their DNA match open homicide cases. Three of them already are in prison for cleared homicides of prostitutes,"" police said in a statement Tuesday. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report .","Police in Milwaukee match unknown man's DNA with seven slain women .

"(CNN)  -- Congressional auditors have uncovered widespread abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline special-education students in U.S. schools, with some deaths linked to the practices, a top congressman says. Investigators in Utah say a teacher left Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours. The findings are among those expected from a Government Accountability Office report scheduled to be released Tuesday. The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground. The GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students. ""I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,"" said Rep. George Miller, D-California, the committee's chairman. In other cases, children as young as 6 have been locked away ""for hours at a time,"" Miller said. ""What the GAO is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread,"" he said. ""The state regulations about how to handle these incidents don't exist in about half the states, and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations."" The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having ""special needs"" -- conditions including autism and Down syndrome -- are patchy at best. Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs. Only five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school. When confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution. Some of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions. State investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to ""shut up."" While the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing. His parents, Joshua and Becca Peck, said the child has an attention span of about 10 minutes, and they believe that after the first few minutes, he had no idea why he was in the cubicle. ""It was so sad. We felt it was a form of torture for him but he, being autistic, he had no way to express it,"" Joshua Peck said. ""He couldn't tell."" And Becca Peck said her son had been left in the cubicle with nothing but a magic marker -- which he used to scrawl all over himself. When she came to school to pick him up, ""He was covered in marker -- on his eyelids, on his hair, face, clothes, arms, eyelids -- everywhere."" ""I started thinking, 'What was he thinking?' Was he thinking, 'Why is my mom letting this person do this to me? Why am I here? I trust no one now.' "" In Garrett's case, like others cited by the GAO, the teacher remains on the job. And what frustrates experts is that efforts to force unruly children to comply don't actually work. At one school in Pennsylvania, however, teachers appear to have better results using sharply different methods. The Centennial School at Lehigh University serves severely emotionally disturbed children that have been passed from school to school, and even from juvenile justice centers. When school director Michael George came to Centennial in 1999, the school had documented more than 1,000 cases of restraint and seclusion that year. After the school revamped its approach, no such incidents were reported. When they get to Centennial, students can be violent and aggressive. But instead of trying to force a change in behavior, the school teaches the children new skills to get what they need. Children who might be violent because they are desperate to escape an uncomfortable task or environment learn to communicate their discomfort in nonviolent ways. Children who need to move frequently -- a common trait with conditions such as autism -- are permitted to do so, then re-directed to the task at hand. Staff are forbidden from saying anything negative about the children, parents or other teachers, even among themselves. And when a child acts violently, the staff is trained to step aside, rather than immediately attempt a potentially dangerous restraint. On a recent visit to the school, all students appeared to be calm and receptive to teachers. The school's philosophy can be summed up in a question George likes to ask teachers interviewing for jobs there: Which teacher you remember most from your own childhood? ""No one ever mentions the person who yelled at them, who screamed at them, who told them to write a phrase a hundred times, who slammed them into closets, who was abrupt, who made them feel stupid. No one ever mentions those people,"" said George. ""Our job is to teach. Sometimes the children we are teaching here present extraordinary challenges; it can be very, very difficult. But that's the job we chose to do.""","GAO report uncovers abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline children .

"(CNN) -- Woody Allen's lawsuit against American Apparel for unauthorized use of his image on billboards ended Monday with a $5 million settlement to be paid to the actor-director by the clothing company. Woody Allen received $5 million to settle a suit with American Apparel. Allen said the case should discourage advertisers from using celebrities' images without permission, but American Apparel's head said he still thinks his company had a good defense. The settlement, announced just moments before jury selection was to begin in New York, interrupted a trial that lawyers had hinted could include a parade of witnesses testifying about Allen's sex scandals. ""Threats and press leaks by American Apparel designed to smear me did not work, and a scheme to call a long list of witnesses who had nothing to do with the case was disallowed by the court,"" Allen said. ""I hope this very large settlement will discourage American Apparel and others from doing this type of thing to myself or others in the future."" Dov Charney, founder and CEO of American Apparel, issued a statement published by London's Guardian newspaper saying lawyers for his insurance company -- which will pay the money to Allen -- made the decision to settle the case. ""For the record, I personally think we had a good case,"" Charney said. Allen filed his suit, asking for $10 million, against American Apparel in March 2008 after the company placed several billboards and online ads using an image of Allen dressed as a Hasidic Jew in his 1977 movie ""Annie Hall."" ""I sued American Apparel because they calculatingly took my name, my likeness and image and used them publicly to promote their business,"" Allen said Monday. ""Testimony revealed that American Apparel believed that fear of publicity would keep me from ever taking action, and so they put my face on billboards, on the Internet, and my image on their building,"" he said. Charney, who said he finally could talk about the case, said the ad was a ""an attempt to at least make a joke about"" sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him and his company in recent years. ""Today, two years later, all the claims in the lawsuits have been completely disproven and yet at the time, some writers characterized me as a rapist and abuser of women, others asserted that I was a bad Jew, and some even stated that I was not fit to run my company."" Charney said it was ""ironic that I have to explain this to Woody Allen when he has expressed similar frustrations in the past."" American Apparel lawyers wanted to call as witnesses Allen's former companion Mia Farrow and Soon-Yi Previn, Farrow's adopted daughter and Allen's wife. Allen's relationship with -- and eventual marriage to -- Previn was scandal material for tabloids beginning in 1992, when she was 21. Allen said the company's lawyers may have been persuaded to settle because the judge made it ""clear that the court considered their phony First Amendment ranting and claims of parody, sheer nonsense.""","Woody Allen's image was used by American Apparel without his authorization .

"(CNN) -- Pirates captured a Belgian ship and said they were taking it to the coast of Somalia after the vessel was reported missing early Saturday, NATO and pirate sources told CNN. The Dutch frigate De Zeven Provincien tracked seven pirates Saturday back to their mother ship. The Pompei, a Belgian-registered ship believed to have a mostly Belgian and Croatian crew, was one of two vessels that came under attack near the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles on Saturday, the sources said. The second ship escaped the attack after a brief exchange of gunfire with pirate vessels, the pirate source added. Meanwhile, Dutch naval forces captured seven pirates and freed 20 captive fishermen after tracking the pirates to their ""mother ship"" in the western Gulf of Aden on Saturday, a NATO maritime spokesman said. The Belgian government tried to communicate with the Pompei ""without success"" before the ship was confirmed to have been hijacked, according to an official.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . ""This morning we received two different channels, a silent alert, that there was a problem on the boat, which is a Belgian boat on its way to Seychelles,"" Belgium Government Crisis Center spokesman Peter Martens told reporters. ""We tried to have a contact with the ship but without success until now."" The archipelago where the attack occurred is roughly 800 miles off the Somali coastline. ""Somali pirates are getting wilder and out of control,"" pirate spokesman Ali Sugulle said on April 11. ""They go too far away from the Somali [coast] and go to the Kenyan coast even."" The European Union, NATO and the United States have been patrolling the waters off Somalia since an upsurge in piracy in the region last year. No NATO vessels were in the region at the time of the attack, said Cmdr. Chris Davies from NATO's Maritime Component Command Headquarters in Northwood, England. Meanwhile, the Dutch rescue operation happened after pirates launched an unsuccessful attack on petroleum tanker MT Handytankers Magic, NATO Cmdr. Chris Davies told CNN. The Dutch frigate De Zeven Provincien was with the NATO fleet patrolling the region. After the Dutch disarmed the pirates, they released them, Shona Lowe, a spokeswoman from the maritime headquarters, told CNN. Because the crew was on a NATO mission, they lacked the jurisdiction to hold them, according to reports. The MT Handytankers Magic is part of a fleet belonging to Handytankers, a company that distributes petroleum products in Europe, the Mediterranean, and the United States, according to the company's Web site. Last week pirates attacked a U.S.-flagged ship, the Maersk Alabama, off the Somali coast.  The crew regained control of the ship but the captain was taken hostage and held for five days on a lifeboat.  The crisis ended when U.S. Navy sharpshooters shot and killed three of the pirates who were holding the captain.

"(CNN) -- The photograph was shocking: a hooded detainee, in U.S. custody, standing on a box with electrical wires hooked up to his fingers. Images of abuse at Abu Ghraib changed the discourse on the war, says Abdul Rahman al-Rashed of Al-Arabiya TV. That photo, as well as the others depicting detainee abuse inside Abu Ghraib at the hands of U.S. troops, came to symbolize ""America in the eyes of the world at that time,"" said CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. ""Those pictures unfortunately became symbolic, emblematic of all the troubles that the U.S. faced in the last four years of the Bush administration, particularly given its war in Iraq,"" Amanpour said. ""Beyond that, it caused a great deal of outrage around the world."" It was against this backdrop that President Obama reversed course last week, telling government lawyers to object to a court-ordered release of additional images showing alleged abuse of detainees. Military commanders urged him to fight the release of the photos, fearing it would endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers. The photographs first appeared in a report on ""60 Minutes 2"" in late April 2004, followed by an extensive story on the abuse by award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker. ""It was a big shock,"" said Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, the head of the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television station. ""It hurt mostly the ones who were for the fall of the Saddam [Hussein] regime. ... It was a heated debate in the Middle East at the time -- whether [the invasion] was the right decision and whether the Americans had bad intentions or not."" iReport.com: Did Obama make the right call on photos last week? The fallout was immediate, both overseas and at home. A year into the Iraq war, the American public had grown increasingly uneasy about the direction of the war, and the Abu Ghraib photographs gave anti-war protesters the ammunition they needed to rally around their cause and question Bush administration policies.  See Bush administration interrogation tactics » . A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll immediately after the photos were released showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans said the mistreatment of the detainees was unjustified under any circumstances. Bush's overall performance rating sank to what was then the lowest of his presidency, 46 percent. The poll also showed support for the war at its lowest since before it began, with only 44 percent saying they believed it was worthwhile.  See some of the disturbing photos (discretion advised) » . It was a blow from which the administration, especially then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, never fully recovered. Amanpour said Obama's presidential victory and big wins by Democrats in the House and Senate were proof of that. ""The American people said that they wanted their good name, the name of their country, the influence and credibility of their country's standing, to be restored in the rest of the world,"" she said. The photos did what a print report could not do. They showed front-and-center what human rights groups had been saying for months: that the Bush administration was abusing prisoners within U.S. custody. Some photos showed naked prisoners piled on top of each other like a pyramid. Another showed a smiling female U.S. soldier giving a thumbs-up next to a naked, hooded prisoner. As a result of the furor unleashed by the pictures, 11 American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses, and some officers were reprimanded. Al-Rashed said he had expected violations in war, but nothing like ""humiliating individuals in those kinds of scenes."" The Middle East has a ""bloody, long, bad record about torture of prisoners,"" he said, but what happened at Abu Ghraib was even more reprehensible because it undercut America's democratic values. ""You talk about democracy, you talk about the respect of individuality, the freedom. ... The prison pictures just really made us speechless."" ""It was something completely new -- something that we had not seen before in all the dictionary of prisoners and torture and mistreatment. It just weakened the argument completely about the wisdom of getting rid of a regime like Saddam. It made the argument for the other side stronger."" The photographs had a direct impact within the Iraq insurgency. Just days after the photos became public, American contractor Nicholas Berg was beheaded -- with his executioners saying they were retaliating for Abu Ghraib abuses. The insurgents posted video of the killing on the Internet for all to see. ""The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals,"" Obama said. ""In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion, and to put our troops in greater danger.""  Watch Obama explain reversing course » . The court had ordered the release in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU said the Pentagon had agreed to release a ""substantial"" number of photographs by May 28. Officials at the Pentagon said the photographs are from more than 60 criminal investigations between 2001 and 2006 and show military personnel allegedly abusing detainees. Obama's decision has sparked a heated debate on what is best for democracy. Marc Thiessen served in the Bush administration from 2001 to 2009, including time as Bush's chief speechwriter. He has said that the ""enhanced interrogations"" of detainees worked and has opposed the release of the latest round of prisoner abuse photos.  Watch more on the photo debate » . ""If these photos had been released, within two seconds flat, they would have been up on jihadi Web sites, and al Qaeda would be using them to incite violence,"" he said. ACLU attorney Amrit Singh disagrees, saying terrorists already have plenty of information ""at their disposal to conduct violence."" ""They can conduct all the violence they want without the release of these photographs,"" she said. ""So to pick on these photographs as the cause of violence, I think, is a grave mistake. There were people who suffered immensely, the victims of torture depicted in these photographs. It's for their sake and for the sake of future victims of torture that these photographs must be aired."" She added, ""It is essential that these photographs be released so that the public can know the full scale and scope of prisoner abuse that took place in its name."" Republican strategist Kevin Madden said Obama sided with national security instead of ""the fury of propaganda that would be unleashed against U.S. forces overseas."" He said the liberal left is trying to use the photos ""as a vendetta against the Bush administration."" ""And in that process, what they're doing is essentially smearing the country as a country that condones detainee abuse and condones the torture, when in fact we don't,"" he said. To that, Singh shot back, ""But what is the limit of that argument? If gross human rights violations have been committed, do you sweep them under the rug because they will cause outrage?"" Al-Rashed of Al-Arabiya said Obama's decision didn't get much play in the Arab world last week, mostly because the alleged abuse isn't as ""shocking anymore."" ""It's not as big news as it used to be,"" he said. CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, a former adviser to several Republican presidents and one Democrat, said Obama made a wise political decision, even if he upset the left. ""I think in these situations, you can't think about who is going to be pleased and who's not. I think you have to think about what's the right decision for the president and assume good policies ultimately make good politics.""","Head of Al-Arabiya says 2004 Abu Ghraib photos ""just really made us speechless""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his concern over the potential of a nuclear-armed Iran during meetings with top congressional leaders Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walks Tuesday with Reps. John Boehner, left, and Nancy Pelosi. He met with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee first, followed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader John Boehner. An Iranian regime armed with nuclear weapons ""is a great danger to all of us, to Israel specifically and to the moderate Arab regimes, [and] to America,"" Netanyahu said after his meeting with Pelosi and Boehner. ""Especially if this regime were to arm itself or arm terrorists with nuclear weapons, the consequences could be unimaginable."" Netanyahu also reiterated his call for normalizing relations between Israel and the ""broader Arab world"" while moving forward on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  Watch where Mideast flash points could be » . ""We have to do this in tandem,"" he said. ""That's going to be our policy. ... If we do it together, we'll get a lot further, a lot faster."" Pelosi said she endorsed a two-state solution for the Israelis and Palestinians, but emphasized that it ""must be a solution that provides for a democratic Jewish state of Israel living side by side with her Palestinian neighbors."" ""The question of Iran is one that is of concern to us in Congress,"" she said. ""... It is an issue for the world. It is important for all of us to work together to be sure that Iran does not develop a weapon of mass destruction."" Netanyahu is on his first visit to Washington since becoming prime minister earlier this year -- his second time as head of Israel's government. He met Monday with President Obama at the White House and dined with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Obama offered the hawkish Israeli leader a small diplomatic victory, warning that he would not allow Iran to drag out talks as a way of buying time while it develops nuclear weapons. Speaking at an Oval Office news conference, Obama again refused to commit to an ""artificial deadline"" for Iranian negotiations. But he also warned that he would not allow such talks, which he expects to accelerate after the Iranian presidential election in June, to be used as an excuse for delay.  Watch Obama start the clock on Iran » . ""We're not going to have talks forever. We're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while Iran proceeds with developing ... and deploying a nuclear weapon,"" he said. He said the United States is not ""foreclosing a range of steps, including much stronger international sanctions, in assuring that Iran understands that we are serious."" The issue of Iran's nuclear ambitions has become increasingly urgent in recent months. Netanyahu wanted a time limit for negotiations relating to such ambitions, with the threat of military action if no resolution is reached. Both Israel and the United States believe Iran is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program; Tehran denies the accusation. Israeli leaders have pointed to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's calls for the end of Israel as a Jewish state, and argue that quick action is needed. Clinton and Netanyahu also talked about Iran, among other issues, during a 90-minute working dinner Monday night, according to a senior State Department official. ""Clinton's messages were entirely consistent with President Obama's,"" the official said. ""She reiterated our support for a two-state solution, and explained our strategy for direct engagement as a means to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability."" In his appearance at the White House, Netanyahu emphasized that while ""the common goal is peace ... the common threat we face are terrorist threats and organizations that seek to undermine [that] peace and threaten both our peoples."" The prime minister called Iran the biggest threat to peace in the region. ""If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists, or worse, could actually give [them] nuclear weapons. And that would put us all in great peril,"" he said. Obama is considered to have a more conciliatory approach to the Arab and Muslim world than Netanyahu. Obama supports the idea of a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. Netanyahu has not endorsed the idea, arguing that Israel first needs security guarantees and a clear Palestinian partner for peace talks. The Palestinians issued a statement after the meeting criticizing Netanyahu for failing to more explicitly endorse a two-state solution. Netanyahu ""missed yet another opportunity to show himself to be a genuine partner for peace,"" said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat. ""Calling for negotiations without a clearly defined end goal offers only the promise of more process, not progress.""  Watch how hard-liners have driven breakthroughs for peace » . Despite their differences, Obama and Netanyahu agree on numerous key issues, such as U.S. military and financial support for Israel. Obama also supports funding for Palestinian entities not controlled by Hamas, which controls Gaza and which the United States labels a terrorist organization. Before making his trip to Washington, Netanyahu met with leaders of Jordan and Egypt, viewed as potential partners in the effort to bring peace to the region.

"CLAXTON, Georgia (CNN) -- Chrysler LLC's decision last week to close nearly 800 dealerships may just be business, but for the people who work and trade in those showrooms and service bays, it's personal. Claxton Chrysler Dodge Jeep is at the literal and figurative heart of Claxton, Georgia. ""They're not terminating a building or a franchise, they're terminating people that need jobs. And it's not right. It's just not right,"" said Daniel Womack, owner of Claxton Chrysler Dodge Jeep in tiny Claxton, Georgia. Womack received a hand-delivered letter from Chrysler on Thursday. ""When I got to 'We regret ...' I stopped,"" Womack said. The bankrupt automaker was terminating its agreement with Claxton, the only Chrysler dealer within 25 miles, and a profitable one at that. ""It was like standing out in the road and having a bus run over the top of us,"" he said. The agreement ends June 9, but the effect is already being felt. All of the dealer's major lending banks called and said they would no longer work with Claxton, general manager Doug Shontz said.  Watch the owner's heart break for his employees » . ""Since the thing happened, we haven't had a soul in here for service,"" he said. ""We haven't turned one wrench. We have nothing for next week. When they brought that list out, that was the kiss of death."" The dealership, its employees and their customers are intertwined like dashboard wires. ""There's only 11 of us here, but we're family,"" said Shontz, who just started there in December. ""We all know each other, we see each other every day. I spend more time with this group here than I do with my own family."" Townsfolk tend to wander in off the street, just to shoot the breeze over a cup of coffee. Take Gary Sapp, for example. The military veteran, wounded in Vietnam, stopped in Saturday, as he does just about every day, to say hello and maybe talk about cars a little bit. He said he might come back Monday and make a deal, just as he's done there three times in the past 10 years. But it's not really about the cars and pickup trucks. ""These are good folks here,"" Sapp said. Claxton, a town of about 2,300 hard by the Canoochee River about 50 miles west of Savannah in southern Georgia, is famous for its namesake fruitcakes, which are sold with pride at Mrs. Rogers' Restaurant and seemingly half the other businesses in town. On East Main Street, a whitewashed brick building still bears an S&H Green Stamps sign and Stella's Phase III serves up $6.95 mountains of soul food, which you can top off with a slice of fluffy sweet potato pie for $1.25. A couple of blocks away, across from the Krispy Chic, a jolly white-haired man sells baseball-sized tomatoes and boiled peanuts out of the back of a pickup under a rainbow-colored umbrella. At opposite ends of Duval Street are a prison surrounded by high fences topped with coils of razor wire and the new elementary school with its gleaming blue metal roof. At the center of it all, literally and figuratively, is Claxton Chrysler Dodge, sporting colorful helium-filled balloons and blue paint bleached pale by the scorching Southern sun. ""We've been on this corner for 40 years,"" Shontz said inside his small office, looking out toward Duval Street. ""We could stand out there and have 50 or 60 people wave at us before the day is out that know us -- 'Hey man! How y'all doin'? Hang in there!' "" In a small town, everybody knows you and knows what you're up to, Shontz said. ""Everybody goes by here. I don't care who you are, everybody goes by here at least once a day,"" he said. And people in Claxton know whom they can count on for help with their causes and events and fundraisers. Over the years, Claxton Chrysler has sponsored Little League baseball and Pee Wee football, supported beauty pageants and donated to local charities, Shontz said. ""We've bought more chicken dinners, and junk, and stuff ... rodeos ... parades ... there's always something,"" Womack said with a chuckle. ""Everything's a big deal here."" ""I've never seen so many 'Misses,' "" Shontz added as they both laughed the kind of laugh you hear toward the end of the third day at the funeral home. Chrysler LLC doesn't understand its market, said loyal customer Jerry Akins, 64, who has bought three vehicles from Claxton Chrysler. ""How the hell they gon' sell to those people in small towns?"" he said. ""They're a different breed. They're not gonna go no damn hundred miles to buy a car."" Akins' loyalty extends to his sons, both of whom have bought cars from Claxton Chrysler. But that's not unusual around here. Salesman Paul Michel said he's sold 11 vehicles to one family since December 2005. ""That's that generational thing I was talking about,"" Shontz said.  Watch what happened to Michigan's oldest Dodge dealer » . Womack intends to stay in business as a used car dealer after the agreement with Chrysler ends June 9, but it will be a very different operation. With no warranty work, the service and parts departments will be closed, Shontz said. ""I just hired a new parts guy three weeks ago,"" he said. ""He left a great job to come here. And now I told him I'm probably going to have to let him go. Great guy, real smart, knows Chrysler like the back of his hand. And I feel bad that I've put him in that kind of predicament."" Almost as an afterthought, Shontz mentioned that he'll probably lose his own job, as will 800 of his counterparts across the corporation. ""There's going to be a lot of me's out there looking for work. General managers will be a dime a dozen."" The change will have a ripple effect on other businesses, Shontz said. The dealer's subcontractors who handle body work, upholstery, dings, glass, used tires, scrap metal and signs all are losing a significant customer, he said. ""It's just a cryin' damn shame, is what it is,"" he said.","Axed Chrysler dealership holds central place in tiny Georgia crossroads .

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- Opposition lawmakers Tuesday ridiculed President Nicolas Sarkozy for taking France back into NATO's military command after more than 40 years, but were unable to stop the move when it came to a vote. French troops on patrol with the Afghan army as part of the NATO mission in Afghanistan. The National Assembly voted in favor of Sarkozy's plan, 329-238. Socialist Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, told Prime Minister Francois Fillon: ""You tell us this would mean more independence and more influence. It would probably mean less independence and less influence."" The move did not technically require parliamentary approval, but the president's party scheduled the debate to give opponents a chance to voice their opinions -- and to show a majority backed it. Asking the National Assembly to vote on the issue also showed how sensitive the matter is in France. France was a founding member of the NATO alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid friction with the United States. ""To cooperate is to lose your independence,"" French President Charles de Gaulle said at the time. For the next 43 years, even though France selectively participated in NATO military operations, de Gaulle's principle remained the governing cornerstone of French foreign policy. If Paris took orders from NATO military commanders, it was reasoned, the nation would no longer have complete control of its destiny. Sarkozy, however, believes the opposite -- that cooperation in NATO is a guarantee of French independence. Rejoining NATO's military command, he argued, will give France a seat at the table for decision-making. From its earliest years, the organization's trans-Atlantic ties were strained because U.S. analysts warned that if the European allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance, they risked losing the support of the United States, according to NATO. Meanwhile, the European nations felt the United States was trying to dominate the organization, according to NATO. De Gaulle's 1966 decision meant no French forces could be under permanent allied command and that France would have no participation in defense planning. In 1995, France rejoined NATO's military committee, which advises NATO's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO's strategic commanders. While France was still not a part of the military command, it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities, including actions in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Half of all French troops outside the country are assigned to NATO military operations. Opponents of Sarkozy's move -- who include some members of his party -- believe de Gaulle, not Sarkozy, had it right. They started a last-minute petition drive to stop his march back into NATO. ""With this decision, France will return as a subordinate country and will lose its ability to represent another image in the world,"" said Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a member of the French National Assembly. The president's allies calculate Sarkozy's move will strengthen Europe's hand on defense issues. ""There will be more European weight in the way decisions will be made,"" said Louis Giscard d'Estaing, a member of the National Assembly's U.S. Friendship Committee. ""Therefore, the balance of power between the USA and Europe will be re-established within this French move.""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The driver of a truck that collided with a bus in northeast Mexico, killing 12 people including 11 passengers from the United States and Canada, was intoxicated, a Mexican official said Tuesday. Emergency workers wheel a crash victim on a gurney after Monday's bus crash in Mexico. The tractor-trailer's 21-year-old driver was among those hospitalized after Monday's crash near Monterrey, Mexico, said Segismundo Doguin Martinez, a police official in the Mexican state of Coahuila. The driver of the bus was among those killed, and 15 bus passengers were injured. The Senda Express bus, operated by Grupo Senda, had been traveling from McAllen, Texas, carrying tourists to Zacatecas in central Mexico. Eight of those who died were from the United States, three were from Canada and one, the bus driver, was from Mexico, Doguin said.  Watch rescuers work at scene of deadly crash » . The survivors, most of them in grave condition, were taken to the Christus Muguerza Hospital and the Clinica La Concepcion, the Mexican official said. ""They are in a delicate state but out of danger,"" Doguin said. El Milenio newspaper reported on its Web site that eight of the injured are from the United States, four are from Canada and three from Mexico. Seven of the injured Americans are from Texas and one is from Iowa, the newspaper said. El Norte newspaper's Web site and El Porvenir said the dead and injured included tourists. Among those killed in the crash was 73-year-old Ronald Christy, said his daughter, Pam Fordyce. Christy's wife, Margaret Christy, was in critical condition in a Mexican hospital, Fordyce said. ""He was doing exactly what he loved -- traveling,"" Fordyce, of Altoona, Iowa, told CNN by telephone Tuesday. ""He was right where he would want to be, on a bus."" She said the couple wintered in Texas and lived in West Liberty, Iowa, in the summer. The U.S. consulate called her at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday to tell her that her father had been killed, Fordyce said, and then followed up with an e-mail with photographs of the crash. ""I didn't even know he was on a bus,"" she said. ""I guess I could believe [the consulate] when I talked to my brother"" who knew the couple was traveling, she said. ""Until then you don't want to believe anything."" Doguin, the Mexican official, said the accident occurred when a truck driver went off the road and then overcorrected and swerved into oncoming traffic, hitting the bus. Video of the scene from CNN affiliate TV Azteca 13 showed the left side of the bus sheared off and the semi's cab completely flattened. Rescue efforts took five hours, TV Azteca 13 reported. The U.S. consulate in Monterrey will not release the names of the dead or injured until all family members have been notified, said consulate spokesman Todd Huizinga. ""On Monday evening, staff from the consulate in Monterrey went to the Christus Muguerza Hospital to offer assistance to some of the injured who were brought there after the crash,"" Huizinga said. ""The consulate expects to have more detail in the coming hours."" The truck driver was injured and is being held by authorities at a hospital, Doguin said. The Web site for Grupo Senda says the company started in Linares, Mexico, more than 75 years ago. It provides bus service to 15 Mexican states and the Texas Valley, the site says. Elizabeth Suarez, director of the McAllen Central Bus Station, where the bus trip originated, issued a statement saying, ""We are very saddened by the news this morning. We offer our condolences to the families. The city of McAllen is the landlord of the bus terminal facility in McAllen. Grupo Senda is our tenant.""

"(CNN) -- Two photographs of Madonna set to appear in a Christie's auction next month will probably sell for at least $10,000 each, according to estimates posted on the company's Web site. Christie's will auction a nude photo of Madonna (partially shown above) taken by Lee Friedlander. One, a full-frontal nude black-and-white photograph of the singer, was taken in 1979 by celebrated American photographer Lee Friedlander for a series of nudes he was working on, said Milena Sales, a spokeswoman for the auction house. Madonna was about 20 when the photograph, one of several, was taken. A handful from the shoot appeared in Playboy magazine in 1985, Sales said. Christie's put price estimates for the photograph at $10,000 to $15,000. The second photograph of Madonna was taken in the 1980s by Helmut Newton. In the Newton photograph, which is in color, Madonna is wearing a short dress and black stockings with garters. The circumstances behind the photo shoot were not immediately clear. The auction will take place in New York on February 12.","Christie's to auction Madonna photos .

"(CNN) -- Contrary to a report in a British newspaper, Michael Jackson does not have skin cancer, says Randy Phillips, president and CEO of AEG Live, the promoter of the King of Pop's upcoming concerts at London's 02 Arena. Michael Jackson gestures to the crowd at the March announcement for his series of London concerts. ""He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,"" the executive told CNN. Phillips said he asked Jackson point-blank about the skin cancer rumor yesterday, and the entertainer just brushed it off and laughed. ""He's used to rumors like this. He's been famous ever since he was 5. He doesn't read the newspapers or watch news reports,"" Phillips explained. He also had an answer for an item in the British tabloid The Sun that said Jackson had been ""making regular trips to a dermatologist in Beverly Hills wearing a mask and surgical cap."" ""Michael is very close friends with his dermatologist. It's as simple as that,"" said Phillips. According to Phillips, the 50-year-old pop star had passed a stringent physical exam before he and AEG inked their deal for Jackson to headline a 50-show residency at 02 beginning July 8. ""And he'll have to take another before the shows start,"" he offered. Phillips also told CNN a tour with sister Janet Jackson and other performing members of the Jackson family was ""never in the works, at least from Michael Jackson's side."" He added, ""Never say never, but right now, he's focusing on his own show. It's not about his family."" ""He's working out every day with his choreographers and his dancers. He's in better shape at 50 than I was at 30,"" Phillips laughed. Phillips took the opportunity to knock down a couple of other rumors. ""For now, he has no plans for his kids to be in the show. And there are no elephants. No elephants in the show, and he's not dying of cancer."" Phillips said the London shows were the first step in a multi-phase package with Jackson that he called ""more than a 360-degree deal."" He said there are also plans for recorded music and movies, including a 3-D live concert film and a 3-D movie based on Jackson's 1983 ""Thriller"" music video. Phillips didn't rule out a tour or a concert residency in another city, stating it would most likely start in Europe, then roll out to Asia, North America and South America.","U.K. tabloid reported that Michael Jackson has skin cancer .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- It was the hottest ticket in town. Colin Farrell was there. So were Michelle Branch, Josh Groban and Chris Isaak -- the latter accompanied by his manager's dog, Rodney. Yusuf, formerly known as Cat Stevens, believes he can help bridge gaps between cultures. No, we're not talking about a Britney Spears or U2 concert. We're talking about a star-studded, invitation-only club show by Yusuf -- the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens. It was the legendary folk singer's first L.A. show in 33 years, and the audience gave him a heartfelt ""welcome back."" He played for just over an hour: half a dozen songs from his new album, ""Roadsinger,"" plus a few gems from the '60s and '70s. It was ""Peace Train"" that elicited a singalong, with the entire room participating in the song's signature hand claps. Branch, who sings backup on Yusuf's new album, admitted to getting teary-eyed. ""You don't understand,"" she said. ""I learned how to play guitar with the Cat Stevens songbook!""  Watch Yusuf talk about his songbook -- and his life » . The whole evening seemed awash in good vibes. Concertgoers didn't even mind having a security guard electronically wand them on the way in. It was perhaps an extra security measure given some of the lingering controversy surrounding the headliner's conversion to Islam at the height of his popularity in 1977, during which time he changed his name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam. In 2004, he was famously denied entry into the United States after his name appeared on a no-fly list. He maintained that it was a case of mistaken identity with another man named Yousuf Islam. However, there was no mistaking the artist on stage at the El Rey Theater last week. At 60, he may look more like a hip college professor than the dark-haired, sensitive sex symbol he was in the '70s, but the message and the music remained the same. The following is an edited version of his interview with CNN. CNN: For a lot of people, it's not only the music but what the music represents. Hearing the old Cat Stevens songs makes people feel warm and fuzzy, a throwback to a simpler time. Yusuf: That's true, and that's why we gave a sprinkling of those songs. When I want to see Paul McCartney, I'd expect to hear ""Eleanor Rigby"" -- something from the past -- because there's something about that that we connect with, and a person becomes part of our life. And I am a part of a lot of people's lives, and my words have resounded in a lot of people's philosophies and the way they look at things, and that's great. Somehow, that's one of the reasons I took life and songwriting very seriously. CNN: But you gave it up for a while. Yusuf: At a certain point I said, ""I've got more living to do,"" and I stopped making music, and I started living. CNN: Many people don't think they start living until they HAVE the fame and fortune. But you didn't start living until you gave it up. Yusuf: It's true. I was very normal -- in some sense, a very shy person. I had to become a persona. I had to kind of put it on a little bit, and therefore I retreated a little bit at a certain point in my career because I thought, ""I can't do this."" So I just became withdrawn, and then people say, ""Well, the guy's a bit of a recluse, you know."" The fact was, I was just a little bit scared of being out there! And I wanted to be sincere, as well. It wasn't easy to be sincere in the music business. CNN: I think a lot of people were surprised when you converted to Islam in the '70s. People didn't understand it. Even today, I think there are those who still don't understand it. Yusuf: It's true. I used to be prejudiced -- as prejudiced as anyone about Islam. ... And then I was given the opportunity of reading the actual source, the Quran itself, without anybody forcing me or looking over my shoulder and saying, ""What do you think?"" It was just me in my space. And the more I read the Quran, the more I realized that it was like an incredible matrix of connection with Christianity and Judaism. I mean Jesus, Moses, the religion of Abraham in this book! And I said, ""Wow, how come I didn't know this before?"" It was kind of like a secret. So that was kind of my discovery, and a lot of people, I don't think, have gone through that process because they've seen Islam as a headline -- and you never learn anything about a headline. Because headlines, you know -- people make things up, to be honest. CNN: In 2004, you were put on a no-fly list and denied entry into the United States. How did you view that? Yusuf: I felt chosen! I felt suddenly, I was given a halo. ""This guy stands for peace, and they won't let him in."" And so I turned it from a no-fly list to a no-song list, and I wrote a song about it (""Boots and Sand""), and I decided to take it lightly. It was really kind of a joke, in a way, because the person I am and the kind of things they were kind of insinuating by putting me on this list with other people who were very dangerous -- . CNN: You mean you're not dangerous? Yusuf: No! Touch me! (laughs) It was upsetting for a lot more people than myself. And you know, I'm here now (in the United States), so things are kind of working themselves out. But there's a new administration, a new president, and it's a great new day. CNN: Obama seems to be reaching out to people of all faiths around the world. Yusuf: I think a person like Obama has some kind of faith in his special role that he has to perform. And that role -- if not prophetic -- it's a divine role. It's helping humanity and people get together and live together and prosper. That's a big demand on one person, so it cannot happen with him alone. There's going to have to be a lot of changes around the world. But it is happening. CNN: There are people who have said you've been associated with groups funneling money to Hamas. Yusuf: Yup. Yeah. So the biggest thing in my life is ... why do I have to defend being charitable? Oh, because somehow, somewhere, somebody got a bit of that money, and he's on a list, and somebody else is on a list -- God almighty! That has nothing to do with me. I'm just trying to be charitable! I think if everybody followed every penny that they ever gave, they would find some very interesting stories behind what has happened to their money. Possibly a lot of it would have gone to waste in administration, as well as other places. It's unfortunate that people have to associate someone because he's got a different faith -- or because he's a Muslim -- with something bad. CNN: Do you believe that will get better? Yusuf: Oh, yeah. I'm very much an optimist. And I believe in the hereafter, as well. And that's a big thing! CNN: Do you believe that you have a role and that your role is to reach out and touch people through song? Yusuf: Very much. I think I've been given a position and place in this world which is quite unique. The fact that I'm a Westerner by birth and I'm a Muslim at the same time -- and living in this time where there seems to be such a gravitational split in polarities -- there need to be bridges, and I think music is one of the best ways to bridge all those gaps.","Yusuf, formerly Cat Stevens, has new album: ""Roadsinger""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- With outrage mounting over AIG's $165 million in bonuses to executives, the president's chief economic adviser offered a new line of defense for the White House in an exclusive interview with CNN. Larry Summers said an AIG meltdown was too risky for the economy to push too hard on executive bonuses. Larry Summers suggested that if Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had pushed the insurance giant too hard on the bonuses, AIG could have collapsed just like Lehman Brothers and sparked an even bigger crisis. ""Secretary Geithner has used all the legal authorities that are open to him to contain and limit the payment of bonuses,"" said Summers, chairman of the National Economic Council. ""What he did not do, and what would have been irresponsible to do, as outrageous as these payments are, would have been to put at risk the stability of the financial system. ""To have courted the kind of disaster that followed the decision to let Lehman Brothers simply collapse might have felt good briefly, but it would have touched the lives of a huge number of Americans who would have unnecessarily become unemployed or seen destruction of their lifetime savings."" The collapse of the 158-year-old investment bank in September turned the U.S. crisis, based on the subprime loan debacle, into a global one, leading to credit freezes and plummeting markets nearly everywhere. Summers said Geithner was notified about the AIG bonuses last week. The secretary tried to stop them, Summers said, but ran up against a legal contract. ""Secretary Geithner courageously has gone after these bonuses and will continue to go after these bonuses in a very aggressive way, but we can't suspend the rule of law and we can't put the whole economy at risk,"" said Summers. Asked whether AIG could get more bailout funds down the road, Summers suggested the door is open to more taxpayer money, despite the bonus controversy.  Watch senators' plan to retrieve money » . ""It is wrong to govern out of anger,"" said Summers. ""We have to recognize what we are angry about, do something about it. That's why we are focused on a new resolution regime as part of a sweeping overhaul of the financial system. "" ... But we can't let anger stop us from taking the steps that are necessary to maintain the stability of the financial system, keep credit flowing.""  Watch tempers rise over bonuses » . Summers said President Obama's entire economic team is working hard to mitigate the problems caused by bank failures, bailouts and credit freezes and boost the country's economy. ""There's one lesson of the history of financial crisis that no one can argue with, and that is that they all end, and this one will, too,"" he said. ""And if we are able to maintain the right policies, we'll bring forward the day when it ends, and -- probably even more important -- we'll have a sounder stronger economic expansion at the end of it."" The former treasury secretary is not quite as bullish about a turnaround, however, as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who predicted the recession may be over by the end of 2009. Asked about Bernanke's prediction, Summers said he was upbeat about some aspects of the economy -- such as a 22 percent spike in housing starts and recent upticks in the stock market -- but said he was cautious about making any grand pronouncements. Summers told CNN that while he's confident of a turnaround, ""just what day the turn will come isn't something that I would dare to forecast."" ""Something that the president has made clear to us is his approach and the approach he wants us to take is a recognition that we don't panic when there's a bad number, bad day on the markets, and we don't become euphoric when there's a good day in the markets, or a good number,"" Summers said. Asked specifically about Bernanke's prediction on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" about the recession ending this year and 2010 potentially being a year of recovery, Summers demurred. ""We always are at pains to recognize when we talk to the president that economic forecasting is the most imperfect of sciences,"" said Summers. ""Many people would say it wasn't a science at all. We stress the uncertainties in this situation.""","Larry Summers is President Obama's chief economic adviser .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Rudolpho Marquez, Richard Reyes and Cesar Cruz make for a most unlikely car pool. They are all former gang rivals who have spent hard time in prison. But they've put the past behind them for common goals: jobs and their families. Rudolpho Marquez, Richard Reyes and Cesar Cruz are ex-gang members working together now. ""It's a lesson in that you don't have to kill your neighbors,"" said Reyes, who spent the last decade in and out of prison for an array of drug offenses. ""It don't matter where you come from, what background you come from. We are all humans, and we should learn to live together."" Marquez chimed in, ""We treat each other like normal human beings now. We get along great. We socialize."" The three men are part of a solar-installation program paid for by Homeboy Industries, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that works with former gang members and others who have spent time in prison to put them to work.  Watch Homeboy help ex-gang members » . The latest project is aimed at green jobs, offering former gang members and parolees a chance to break ground in alternative energy programs while the issue is being pushed by President Obama and the nation's lawmakers. Homeboy is the brainchild of the Rev. Gregory Boyle, known simply as Father Greg by everyone here. Boyle first started a small program in 1988 to offer alternatives to gang violence in one of Los Angeles' toughest neighborhoods. ""I started burying young kids who were killed in our community,"" he told CNN. ""I buried my first in 1988 and just buried my 165th two months ago. So we as a community started to say, 'We have to do something.' "" Over the last two decades, Homeboy has reached out to the 1,100 gangs in metro LA, helping provide a second chance to those who want it. The organization provides much-needed job training, hires ex-gang members for transitional jobs and helps give other free programs to people who otherwise struggle in the outside world. Boyle said it's a simple philosophy: Offer gang members hope through gainful employment, and they'll want to ""leave behind all of their gang past."" ""This population really can't afford to just go to school. They are not living at home with their parents. They have no one there, really,"" he said. Reyes calls the Catholic priest a saint. ""If there were more people like him, there'd be less people like me,"" he said. In Reyes' case, he missed the births of his daughters -- Valerie, 9, and Vanessa, 7 -- because he was behind bars. ""I feel I wasted my life,"" he said. ""I thought being a father was making babies, but being a father is taking an interest in your kids."" Since his release from prison in May 2008, he has graduated at the top his class in the Homeboy-sponsored solar program. He is now working on a $2.5 million project for Lite Solar to install 1,500 solar panels on an apartment building. As he watched his daughters play on a recent afternoon, he said, ""It feels good knowing you can provide for them."" On Tuesday, Reyes got another reward: He welcomed his first son into the world. His wife, Susana Reyes, said the Homeboy program completely changed her husband. ""Before, it was all about his gang,"" she said. ""Now, I know he loves his daughters."" Albert Ortega, now 34, spent seven years in prison, beginning when he was just 19. He was hired by Homeboy and is now the coordinator of the solar program.

"(CNN) -- A 23-year-old woman suffocated her son and then buried his body beneath the sand of a playground, police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said Thursday. Tiffany Toribio, 23, was arrested and charged with killing her son. Police arrested Tiffany Toribio about 4 a.m., just hours after they said they wanted to speak to her about her missing 3-year-old son, Ty. Family members had contacted authorities, saying her son matched the description of a boy found Friday at an Albuquerque playground. Police Chief Ray Schultz said she confessed to killing the boy soon after being apprehended. ""She placed her hand over her son's mouth and nose and suffocated him. She had second thoughts about what she did. She performed CPR on her son, brought him back to life and then decided to go forward with that original act she had started to commit,"" Schultz said.  Watch Schultz describe the alleged killing » . ""What makes this story especially sad is, when asked the reason why she took Ty's life, Tiffany said that she did not want him to grow up with no one caring about him, the same way that she had grown up where nobody had cared about her."" An emotional Schultz added that Toribio has tried to kill herself since her arrest. She was being held in isolation at a detention facility and kept under observation, he said. He added, ""As you can see, this case has been very emotional for everybody in the department."" Toribio was charged with first-degree murder and an array of other charges, including abuse of a child under 12 that caused death. The discovery of the body at Alvarado Park on Friday shocked the community, which dubbed the boy ""Baby Justice"" and ""Baby Angel"" as they rallied around his case. Police released a composite image of the boy Tuesday, hoping to garner more leads in the case. They weren't able to release a photo of the boy because his body was so disfigured by the sand's heat. Schultz said that after killing her son, Toribio dug a hole under gym equipment at the playground, moved the body and buried him in the shallow grave. ""Since that time, she's been walking the streets of the city of Albuquerque,"" he said. The boy was wearing Arizona brand clothing, size 3T: nylon black running pants with red stripes, a red shirt with a monster truck on it and black, gray and lime green Skechers sneakers. Toribio did not comment Thursday morning after her arrest as she was put in a police car. Schultz said there had been no reports of child abuse filed against Toribio. But he said family members indicated that she did not express the typical love of a mother for her child. ""She did not show the normal relationship that you would see with a mother, son,"" he said. This week, police had gone to residences where she had lived previously, but she wasn't there, Schultz said. Police had gone there after family members expressed concern because ""they did not like the way Ty was being treated,"" the police chief said.

"(CNN)  -- On Monday's night edition of ""Larry King Live,"" guest host Ali Velshi talked with TV cooking host Rachael Ray. Rachael Ray visits ""Larry King Live"" on Monday night to give tips on stretching a family's food dollar to the max. CNN's chief business correspondent asked Ray how you can make your meal-time dollars stretch in these tough economic times without sacrificing nutrition or taste. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Ali Velshi: How do we keep from packing on the recession pounds? Tonight, help is on the way. Joining me in New York is Rachael Ray, host of ""The Rachael Ray Show."" ... We're all kind of stressed right now. We're trying to sort of do more with less and certainly eating in a hurry. You've got some great advice on that. Ray: We need to go back to the way our grandparents prepared food. Instead of buying pieces of chicken, buy a whole chicken. You make that on Sunday, take the leftovers, roll that into fajitas, soups, stews, make your own stock. You've got to start thinking in bigger increments. ... Stock up on lean meats and proteins, on veggies that you know your family likes and turn yourself into your own frozen food factory. Every time that chicken breast goes on sale, stock up. Go home, put it in individual storage bags, pound it out nice and thin. It's a quick defrost.  Watch Rachael Ray's appearance on ""Larry King Live"" » . Velshi: All right. So you freeze; I like that. You make yourself into your own frozen food factory. Ray: Even with vegetables. ... You know, if broccoli is on a great price this week, buy a ton of it, go home, blanch it a little bit of salted water, cold shock it, put it in a plastic food storage bag, done. Velshi: What's the better deal: Buying your vegetables canned, buying them fresh? Ray: Buying them at a local food market. You know, whether you're in a big city or a small town, farmers markets are your best bargain. You can buy direct from the small producer. And, you know, it's a great way to not only get organic, but get a great price on it. Velshi: Let's talk about takeout food. Parents are trying to save time and money. In many cases, that leads us to fast food, because it's cheap and fast. ... Ray: The food that we can get most readily and at the best bargain isn't good for us. It's processed. I mean all things in moderation. Everybody can have a burger once in a while. Velshi: What do you recommend to our viewers [for fast food]? Ray: Hey, I love a veggie sub at Subway. You know, I think that there is affordable fast food. If you're on the go, fine. Everybody needs to pick up a salad or a burger once in a while. There are healthy choices there. .... If the kids really love fries, tell them they can have a few as long as they eat the veggies, too. And, there are a lot of great strategies you can take with kids in getting them to eat healthier -- little things like switching to whole wheat macaroni, whole wheat pastas. Velshi: It sounds like it's a lot like dealing with the rest of your financial life -- if there's a little bit of planning ahead of time, you can actually save a lot of money. Ray: Absolutely. I think you've got to go into the store armed with a good attitude ... and with coupons. And another really simple thing: When you go grocery shopping, do not look at the price on the product. Look at the unit price. Right there on the shelf, it will tell you the price per ounce or unit of measurement. And that's how you find your truest bargains. Velshi: Let's talk about planning for shopping. When people are trying to trim their bills, what are the biggest mistakes they make? Ray: They go shopping hungry. They make a lot of impulse buys. They shop too many times during the week. ... Try and make that one master list, really think it out and try and plan one day of the week where you can do a big cook. Velshi: Are you a big leftover fan? Ray: Absolutely. But I don't think they should taste like the first time. You know, I'm all for cooking a big chicken and then making chicken chili, chicken pasta. Velshi: Not having roast chicken for four days? Ray: Exactly. Velshi: How do you make that switch if your kids are addicted to  processed and fast food? Ray: Children love good food, and they love being involved. They love feeling like they're helping. If you give children ownership of the meal, if you involve them in the process, they feel like they're problem-solving and it becomes a great self-esteem builder. And for the transition, it can be as simple as taking things that they like, such as macaroni and cheese, and using a whole wheat pasta instead of a plain pasta. Velshi: Do you tell them that you're doing it? Ray: No. I don't think so. Just let them enjoy it. Velshi: What I haven't graduated to is coupons. I get them in the newspaper every week. Is this something we should be looking at now? Ray: This is the perfect time to be using coupons. Whether you're somebody that has [money] or somebody who lives on a very limited budget, it's always fun to get more for your money. Velshi: One of the things in your magazine that I really enjoy is the Supermarket 101 column, just sort of factoids about supermarkets. Ray: Yes. And it gives people neat tips on how to save money when they go shopping. Velshi: Yes. And one of them was about buying in bulk, particularly with nuts. Is that the case for everything? Ray: Everything. When you buy in bulk or you buy a generic name, you have to read the label and make sure that the quality is the same. But, yes, I think it's truly a bargain.","Rachael Ray says we need to go back to way our grandparents prepared food .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama will address the future of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Thursday morning in a speech at the National Archives. The Guantanamo facility houses terror suspects, and lawmakers don't want them in the U.S. In a speech that is being billed as a major address, Obama is also slated to discuss issues of state secrets, transparency and protecting national security, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the most outspoken critics of Obama's policies, is scheduled to give an opposing argument Thursday morning. Cheney has charged that Obama's national security decisions have left the United States more vulnerable to attack. Obama's address is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET at the National Archives. Cheney will speak before the conservative American Enterprise Institute at 10:45 a.m. Obama is hoping to rally support behind his national security measures after angering some with his decision to resume the Bush administration practice of military tribunals and by reversing course on his decision to release photos of alleged inmate abuse at Guantanamo. On Wednesday, Obama was dealt another blow when the U.S. Senate passed a measure that would prevent detainees at Guantanamo Bay from being transferred to the United States for now. The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in a 90-6 vote. A similar amendment has already passed the House. It was attached to a supplemental war funding bill. Following in the steps of House Democrats, Senate Democrats rejected on Tuesday the administration's request for $80 million to close the Guantanamo facility. They instead asked that President Obama first submit a plan spelling out what the administration will do with the prisoners when it closes the prison. Obama, in one of his first official duties as president, announced that he would close the prison by January 22, 2010. Congressional Democrats, however, are now attempting to avoid an onslaught of criticism from Republicans, who argue it would be reckless to shutter the prison before deciding where to transfer the detainees. FBI Director Robert Mueller told members of Congress earlier Wednesday that he is concerned about the potential dangers that may result from the release of detainees in the United States. In response to a question from Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Mueller said he is concerned about the potential for fundraising to support terrorist groups and the radicalization of others, as well as the potential for attacks within the country. Mueller also said that while he is not concerned about dangerous terrorists escaping from maximum security federal prisons, he is concerned about the potential of activities being directed from within prison walls, and he cited such actions by dangerous gang members. Attorney General Eric Holder, the president's point man overseeing the Guantanamo plan, sought to downplay the FBI director's concerns and the Senate vote to bar funds. ""The concerns that have been expressed by the director and concerns expressed by other people will all be taken into account in formulating the plan that we will ultimately use,"" Holder told reporters late Wednesday. ""We're not going to do anything that's going to put the American people at risk,"" he said. The attorney general continued to express confidence that the Guantanamo Bay prison camp will be permanently closed by Obama's deadline. iReport.com: Sound off on Obama, Cheney speeches . ""We will have conversations with Congress, and I'm confident that as a result of those conversations, the necessary funds will come our way,"" Holder said. At the White House, press secretary Robert Gibbs echoed Holder's promise. ""The president understands that his most important job is to keep the American people safe and that he is not going to make any decision or any judgment that imperils the safety of the American people."" CNN's Terry Frieden and Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","White House says Obama is not going to make any decision that imperils safety .

"(CNN) -- Former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick left a federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, early Wednesday, according to his publicist and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Michael Vick, left, arrives at federal court with attorney Billy Martin in Richmond, Viriginia, in 2007. He will serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement in Virginia, his publicist Judy Smith said. He is a native of Newport News, Virginia. Vick, 28, pleaded guilty in August 2007 to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. He will return to professional football as soon as September if reinstated by the NFL, according to the sports agent who negotiated Vick's 10-year, $140 million contract with the Falcons. Meanwhile, Vick's attorneys have said he will work at a Newport News construction firm following his release, and he has also agreed to participate in a documentary for $600,000. Last month, a federal bankruptcy judge denied a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan presented by Vick, urging him to offer the court another plan to emerge from bankruptcy. The plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but added he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much. Santoro suggested Vick's next plan not call for him to keep two houses and three cars, as did the rejected proposal. In testimony, Vick acknowledged committing a ""heinous"" act and said he should have acted more maturely. He said he has been earning 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor in prison. His Falcons salary, he said, was between $10 million and $12 million. He acknowledged failing to handle his money well.  Watch a panel discuss his release » . Vick plans to work with the Humane Society of the United States on anti-dogfighting campaigns, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN on Tuesday. Vick will work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting, and also on programs to assist young people who have already been involved in the blood sport. Pacelle said the Humane Society was approached by Vick's representatives. He said he has traveled to Kansas twice to meet with the former quarterback, and during the second visit, the two discussed how Vick could use his sway over youths to discourage them from involvement in dogfighting, as well as help those who were apprehended in connection with it.  Watch more about Vick's dogs » . Details have not yet been hammered out, Pacelle said, but will be in the next couple of days. iReport.com: Does Vick deserve a second chance? More attention has been paid to dogfighting as a result of Vick's case, Pacelle said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Janelle Monae is a girl from another planet, and she's invading your world. Janelle Monae creates ""cool, futuristic soul with a real '80s quality,"" says a DJ. Sightings of the singer-songwriter will include this week's ""American Idol"" finale, the Hollywood Bowl and concert stages across America this summer and TV's Sci Fi Channel this fall. Monae insists that her real identity is Cindi Mayweather, an android traveling through space and time to escape destruction ordered because she fell in love with a human, a fatal infraction of robots' rules. Along the way, she's making music that moves into the future while drawing from decades past. ""It is cool, futuristic soul with a real '80s quality,"" said Garth Trinidad, a disc jockey at Los Angeles, California, radio station KCRW. Trinidad spotted Monae three years ago, and he's been watching her like an astronomer tracking the approach of a distant comet destined to light Earth's sky. ""I believe she's going to be a household name in the next year or two,"" said Trinidad, a self-described ""champion of the underdog"" who is credited with giving Jill Scott and Gnarls Barkley early radio airplay. Monae -- the human -- is a striking combination of voice, style, imagination and fearlessness that defies conventional description, making it easier to buy into the fantasy of Mayweather the android. When her song ""Many Moons"" was nominated for a Grammy in December, it was in the urban/alternative category. If Monae is an android from the future, her musical programming included the past. Trinidad compared her ""very fluid, very pleasing"" voice to Donna Summer, circa 1976. At a Los Angeles show this month, she mixed 20th-century classics with her own futuristic songs. Monae delivered a sweet version of Nat King Cole's ""Smile"" while standing atop a barstool. Senior citizens danced the ""Twist"" when her band broke out into the Beatles' 1964 hit ""I Saw Her Standing There."" She loves timeless music, Monae said after her show. ""We look to a lot of people whose bodies are dead and gone, but their spirit is still with us,"" Monae said. Her choreography borrows from James Brown, Michael Jackson and Devo, with dance moves from the future. Monae -- or Mayweather -- thinks she can fly. She jumped head-first into the audience, ""crowd surfing"" the unlikely mosh pit in UCLA's Royce Hall. Search Monae's name on YouTube and you'll see her jumping into swimming pools to end her shows. She climbed a tree in New York -- after her swim. Unlike some performers, her talent matches Monae's onstage antics, Trinidad said. ""It's one thing for her to perform a certain way, but she backs with it up with talent,"" he said. Monae's android-on-the-run theme, reminiscent of the 1982 movie ""Blade Runner,"" reminds Trinidad ""of all the great albums from the past that had a story and concept attached."" ""She was just kind of like bored with everything else going on, and she wanted to transcend it and tell a story,"" he said. Monae said she is not following a formula, that she is ""being led by my maker."" ""I'm very similar to a terminal,"" she said. Monae will inevitably capture the world's attention because she is ""outshining a lot of what's happening in the mainstream,"" Trinidad said. That time may be near. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs signed her to his Bad Boy Records, giving her music distribution. Coca-Cola hired Monae to sing on its ""Open Happiness"" ad campaign. It airs on this week's ""American Idol"" finale. Her tour stops next month include at least six shows in the northeastern United States, opening for Gwen Stefani's reunited rock group No Doubt. Monae then plays the Hollywood Bowl with the legendary jazz singer Etta James. She plays herself in two episodes of the Sci Fi Channel's ""Stargate Universe"" this fall.","Janelle Monae popping up on commercial, on tour, on TV .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Thursday sent a civil nuclear agreement with the United Arab Emirates to the Senate for ratification, but its passage remains uncertain, thanks to a recently disclosed video. Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan allegedly tortured a business associate on videotape. Senior U.S. officials said lawmakers critical of the deal could use the video, which shows a member of the UAE government's royal family torturing a man, to argue the United States should not have such nuclear cooperation with a country where the rule of law is not respected and human rights violations are tolerated. The senior officials said the Obama administration deliberately held off sending the deal to Congress for ratification because of fears some lawmakers would try to use the video to undermine the agreement. But the administration felt comfortable sending the agreement to Congress at this time, officials said, given that there has been little reaction to the release of the video except for a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier this month from U.S. Rep. James McGovern -- the Massachusetts Democrat who co-chairs the congressional Human Rights Commission.  Watch how the video came to light » . McGovern expressed ""outrage and concern"" and asked Clinton to ""place a temporary hold on further U.S. expenditures of funds, training, sales or transfers of equipment or technology, including nuclear, until a full review of this matter and its policy implications can be completed."" He issued a statement Wednesday after Obama signed the agreement, saying he would not support the deal until the UAE addresses his ""very grave concerns"" about its human rights record. In the video, an Afghan grain dealer is seen being tortured by Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi, one of the UAE's seven emirates, whose leaders also run the federal government. The government has since arrested the sheikh, pending a full investigation. The video emerged in a federal civil lawsuit filed in Houston, Texas, by Bassam Nabulsi, a U.S. citizen, against the sheikh. The men, former business partners, had a falling out, in part over the video. In a statement to CNN, the sheikh's U.S. attorney said Nabulsi is using the videotape to influence the court over a business dispute. The U.S.-UAE pact is similar to one the United States signed last year with India. Under it, Washington would share nuclear technology, expertise and fuel. In exchange, the UAE would commit to abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Agency inspection safeguards. The small oil-rich Gulf nation promises not to enrich uranium or to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear bombs. A statement issued Thursday by the State Department said the deal will ""serve as a model for responsible nuclear energy development"" in the Middle East. ""The UAE agreement contains the strongest nonproliferation conditions of any negotiated by the United States,"" the statement said. Of special note, it said, is the UAE's commitment to obtain nuclear fuel from reliable and responsible suppliers rather than pursue indigenous uranium enrichment and reprocessing, fuel cycle activities that pose the most serious proliferation risks. This commitment ""is reflected within the agreement as a legally binding obligation on the part of the UAE,"" the State Department said. The civil nuclear agreement was signed in January by the Bush administration, but had to be recertified because it was not approved before Obama took office. The deal is part of a major UAE investment in nuclear energy, and the government has already signed deals to build several nuclear power plants. UAE Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba said his country will ""seriously consider"" U.S. companies to implement the program. The United States already has similar nuclear cooperation agreements with Egypt and Morocco, and U.S. officials said Washington is working on similar pacts with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan. The United States has praised the UAE's development of nuclear energy, a stark contrast to criticism of Iran, which is suspected of attempting to enrich uranium for a nuclear bomb. But UAE's ties to Iran have caused concern. Iran is among the UAE's largest trading partners. In the past, the port city of Dubai has been used as a transit point for sensitive technology bound for Iran. Dubai also was one of the major hubs for the nuclear trafficking network run by Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, who admitted spreading nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya up until the year 2000. He was eventually pardoned by the Pakistani government. Such ties contributed to stiff opposition in Congress to the failed deal for Dubai Ports World to manage U.S. ports. Some in Congress have expressed concern that the new deal could fuel an arms race and proliferation in the region. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has said she was ""deeply disappointed"" the United States signed a ""flawed agreement."" ""Transferring nuclear technology and know-how to this unproven partner is inconsistent with the administration's expressed commitment to the pursuit of stronger nonproliferation controls,"" Ros-Lehtinen said in a statement after Obama signed the agreement. ""The UAE's long history as a conduit for Iran's nuclear weapons program, its failure to fully implement effective export controls, and the danger of expanding nuclear facilities and expertise in the Middle East make this agreement a dangerous precedent."" She introduced legislation earlier this year that would prevent the agreement from going into effect until the president certifies that the UAE has met a number of conditions regarding export controls and terrorist financing.","Obama sends nuclear agreement with the United Arab Emirates to the Senate .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A top Mexican drug cartel suspect has been arrested along with 12 accomplices, including five women, federal authorities said. Police guard suspected members of the Beltran Leyva cartel  after they were arrested in a 2008 raid. Rodolfo Lopez Ibarra, known as El Nito and believed to be a top lieutenant in the Beltran Leyva cartel, was arrested Monday at an airport in Nuevo Leon state, said the Mexican National Defense secretary. Along with the suspects, officials said they also confiscated a Cessna 550 airplane, two cars, a large quantity of drugs and cash, firearms and a hand grenade. Soldiers acting on an anonymous tip arrested the eight men and five women, including one minor, National Defense said in a release Tuesday. Authorities said they confiscated 40,680 pesos (U.S. $3,150), $29,385 (379,507 pesos), 13 packages of marijuana weighing 13 kilograms (29 pounds), three computers and 28 cell phones. The Beltran Leyva cartel is one of the top drug organizations in Mexico, allied with the Gulf cartel in its battle against the Sinaloa organized crime syndicate. The Beltran Leyva group was formerly allied with the Sinaloa cartel, considered the largest drug-trafficking organization in the nation. The two other major drug organizations in Mexico are the Juarez and Tijuana cartels. According to media reports, someone alerted authorities when a tipster noticed heavily armed men waiting at the airport in northern Mexico. Ibarra was on a flight back from a baptism in Acapulco at which drug cartel chief Arturo Beltran Leyva had anointed him with the top post in Nuevo Leon, the news reports said. A published photo of Ibarra after his arrest shows him wearing a long-sleeved printed shirt and blue jeans, a forlorn look on his face as he gazes off to the side. Ibarra, 33, was the second top suspect from the Beltran Leyva cartel arrested in recent weeks. In March, authorities announced the arrest of Hector Huerta Rios, also known as ""La Burra"" or ""El Junior."" Like Ibarra, he was arrested in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Nuevo Leon state, along Mexico's border with the United States. Mexican officials also have recently announced the arrests of several other high-ranking cartel suspects as President Felipe Calderon wages a battle against a drug trade he says killed 6,500 people last year. About 2,000 more Mexicans are believed to have been killed this year. In April, authorities announced the arrest of Vicente Carrillo Leyva, a suspected leader of the Carrillo Fuentes drug cartel. A couple of weeks earlier, officials said they had arrested Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, a drug-trafficking suspect accused of attacking a U.S. consulate and killing Mexican soldiers. Talamantes, also known as ""El Canicon,"" also is suspected in attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex agency said. That same week, the Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant.","Suspected top Beltran Leyva cartel lieutenant arrested at airport in Nuevo Leon .

"(CNN) -- She had many plans for the future: to go to college, start a career, meet the man of her dreams, raise a family -- when the time was right. Expert: ""There's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value."" It was all cut off by an unexpected pregnancy. The baby became her life, consuming her energy and forcing her dreams to the back burner of her life. She is 19 or younger and Latina, and has had her first baby. It's not what she wanted. Nor did her parents, who are the greatest influence on her decisions about sex, according to a wide-ranging survey released Tuesday by experts on the Hispanic community in the United States. The survey also found that 84 percent of Latino teens and 91 percent of Latino parents believe that graduating from college or university or having a promising career is the most important goal for a teen's future. Somewhere along the way, the aspirations fail to match up to reality. The survey attempts to examine some of the reasons for the disparity and why Latinas now have the highest teen birth rate among all ethnic and racial groups in the United States. ""There's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value,"" said Ruthie Flores, senior manager of the National Campaign's Latino Initiative. According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 53 percent of Latinas get pregnant in their teens, about twice the national average. After a period of decline, the birth rate for U.S. teenagers 15 to 19 years rose in 2007 by about 1 percent, to 42.5 births per 1,000, according to preliminary data in a March 2009 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. In 2007, the birth rate among non-Hispanic whites ages 15 to 19 was 27.2 per 1,000, and 64.3 per 1,000 for non-Hispanic black teens in the same age range. The teen birth rate among Hispanic teens ages 15 to 19 was 81.7 per 1,000. Of the 759 Latino teens surveyed, 49 percent said their parents most influenced their decisions about sex, compared with 14 percent who cited friends. Three percent cited religious leaders, 2 percent teachers and 2 percent the media.  Watch more on the survey results » . Three-quarters of Latino teens said their parents have talked to them about sex and relationships, but only half said their parents discussed contraception. The survey also found that: . • 74 percent of Latino teens believe that parents send one message about sex to their sons and a different message altogether to their daughters, possibly related to the Latino value of machismo. • Latino teens believe that the most common reason teens do not use contraception is that they are afraid their parents might find out. • 72 percent of sexually experienced teens say they wish they had waited. • 34 percent of Latino teens believe that being a teen parent would prevent them from reaching their goals, but 47 percent say being a teen parent would simply delay them from reaching their goals. • 76 percent said it is important to be married before starting a family. Flores said it is crucial to understand the beliefs and attitudes that influence teen behavior in order to reduce the high rates of Hispanic teen pregnancy. The survey, co-sponsored by the Hispanic advocacy group National Council of La Raza, was an attempt to to do just that. She said that despite a rich culture and the growing influence of Hispanics in America, the Latino community disproportionately suffers from troubling social indicators. Consider that fewer than six in 10 Latino adults in the United States have a high school diploma. Latino teens are more likely to drop out than their non-Hispanic counterparts, and of all the children living in poverty, 30 percent are Latino. ""Teen pregnancy is not an isolated issue,"" Flores said. ""It's related to poverty, to dropout rates. That's going to have an impact on our national as a whole."" Flores said 69 percent of Latino teen moms drop out of high school, and the children of teen mothers are less likely to do well in school themselves and often repeat grades. ""That has a big economic impact,"" Flores said. It's an impact that is sure to be noticed. The nation's 45 million Latinos constitute the largest minority group in the United States with a growth rate twice that of the general population. That means by 2025, one-quarter of all American teens will be Latinos.","53 percent of Latinas are pregnant by their 20th birthday, survey finds .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Republican congressman Wednesday asked the head of the FBI to investigate allegations that the CIA lied to Congress about the Bush administration's use of ""alternative"" interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists. Rep. Darrell Issa asked the FBI to investigate Speaker Nancy Pelosi's claim that the CIA lied to Congress. Rep. Darrell Issa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, asked FBI director Robert Mueller whether the bureau was investigating that allegation and whether he could request a probe as a member of Congress. He said the claim, leveled last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left him doubting whether ""I can believe in the briefings I am receiving"" from intelligence agencies. ""If CIA is lying to any of us -- and I have been briefed many times by them on the Intelligence Committee -- it puts me in a position of not being able to do my job properly,"" said Issa, R-California. Pelosi made the charge in response to questions about what she was told about the use of the techniques, which critics say amounted to the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody. Her claim provoked a firestorm on Capitol Hill, with Republicans -- who generally defend the techniques -- blasting Pelosi and demanding she back up the allegation. Mueller said he would check into whether Issa's request would be enough to launch an investigation.  Watch more on the Pelosi-CIA controversy » . Justice Department documents released in April show Bush administration lawyers authorized the use of techniques such as sleep deprivation, slapping, stress positions and waterboarding, which produces the sensation of drowning. Waterboarding in particular has been considered a form of torture since the Spanish Inquisition, and U.S. authorities prosecuted Japanese officers who used the techniques against American prisoners during World War II. But Bush administration lawyers argued that the tactics did not violate U.S. laws against torture as long as interrogators had no intent to cause ""severe pain."" Many Republicans, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, argue the tactics produced useful intelligence that saved American lives. Pelosi, D-California, has called for an investigation into whether the Bush administration authorized the torture of suspected al Qaeda figures, prompting Republicans to question what she knew about the tactics at the time they were approved.  Watch Colin Powell's former aide speak out on CIA's history » . She told reporters last week that she was briefed by the CIA on such techniques once -- in September 2002, when she was the ranking Democrat on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee -- and that she was told at the time that techniques such as waterboarding were not being used. She said she learned that waterboarding had been used after other lawmakers were briefed in 2003. CIA spokesman George Little said last week that the agency's records indicate Pelosi was briefed on the interrogation methods being used. But Little said it was up to lawmakers ""to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened."" Rep. Pete Hoekstra, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Monday that Pelosi may be forced to resign if her claims are proven untrue. ""Either the CIA needs to be held accountable for their performance during this time, or the speaker needs to be held accountable and be responsible for the actions and the statements that she made last week,"" Hoekstra said. But Rep. Baron Hill, D-Indiana, said Republicans are trying to divert attention from the question of torture by attacking Pelosi. ""I think a lot of people have lost focus on the people who put those torture policies in place in the first place,"" Hill said. ""Nancy didn't do anything wrong, in terms of the legalities, that I'm aware of. I don't know what she was told.""","Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, is a member of the House Judiciary Committee .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova returned to competitive singles after a near 10-month absence on Monday as she bids to prove her fitness for the forthcoming French Open in Paris. Maria Sharapova is hoping to prove her fitness ahead of the French Open in Paris starting on Sunday. The Russian defeated Italy's Tathiana Garbin 6-1 6-7 6-3 to book her place in the second round of the Warsaw Open claycourt tournament . Sharapova's world ranking has slumped from No.1 to No.126 during her absence from the court because of a shoulder problem that saw her miss three Grand Slam tournaments. The 22-year-old had to sit out last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open and also failed to recover in time for the 2009 Australian Open. She has had to shelve comeback attempts but did appear in one losing game in the doubles tournament at Indian Wells in March. Sharapova, who has three majors to her name, broke her Italian opponent four times in a row in the opener, dropping her own serve once en route to the set. Garbin offered stiffer resistance in the second set although Sharapova wasted four match points at 5-3 and 40-0 up in the ninth game -- a seventh double-fault in the subsequent tie-break giving her rival a set point that she converted.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the ""American Idol"" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants. In this corner: Kris Allen, the guy next door. ""It is the battle of the acoustic rocker versus the glam rocker. Conway (Arkansas) versus California. The guy next door versus the guy-liner."" After three performances apiece and plenty of judge feedback, it seems that the Southern California glam-rocker Adam Lambert has the edge -- but it didn't look that way early in Tuesday's show. In the first round, where the contestants chose a song from a favorite past performance this season, Simon Cowell declared Kris Allen the winner after his rendition of ""Ain't No Sunshine"" on piano.  Watch Allen and Lambert talk after the show » . Lambert chose to sing ""Mad World"" while wearing a long black coat and walking around a stage filled with white smoke, all of which Cowell found ""over-theatrical."" ""I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic,"" Lambert told reporters after the show. ""It talks about people who don't feel like they fit in."" Round two featured a tune hand-picked by ""American Idol"" creator Simon Fuller, where Lambert ditched the black overcoat and belted out Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" while sporting a shiny silver suit. Paula Abdul told Lambert ""it was the best I've ever heard you sing, ever!"" Allen's feedback after singing Marvin Gaye's classic ""What's Goin' On"" in the second round was much less flattering.  See the best and worst performances from season eight » . ""I thought it was too laid back for a night like this,"" said Cowell. He then gave round two to Lambert. Round three featured a bit of a twist -- both contestants had to sing a song co-written by judge Kara DioGuardi called ""No Boundaries."" Lambert went first and had little difficulty with the ballad. Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that ""you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show."" Allen, however, struggled to stay in tune during the entire performance ... but the judges were less harsh this time. ""You have thoroughly, thoroughly deserved to be standing on that stage tonight, congratulations,"" said Cowell.  Watch anchors debate ""Idol"" finalists » . After the show, Lambert told reporters that they did not have a lot of time to work on ""No Boundaries"" and it was kind of a ""rush job.""

"(CNN) -- An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear Pope Benedict XVI preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his first trip to Africa. Pope Benedict XVI celebrates Mass in Angola, where he told Angolans on Sunday to ""trust in God's promises."" He spoke of the need for reconciliation in a country that endured a brutal civil war lasting nearly three decades. ""Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth. In this way you will build something that will stand and endure ... a lasting heritage of reconciliation, justice and peace,"" Benedict said in English to polite applause. The service's Bible reading's ""vivid description of the destruction wrought by war echoes the personal experiences of so many people in this country amid the terrible ravages of the civil war,"" Benedict said in the Mass, which was broadcast by TPA, a CNN affiliate in Angola. ""How true it is that war can destroy everything of value: families, whole communities, the fruit of men's labor."" Benedict also expressed ""deep sorrow"" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday, papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said. Cardinal Tarciso Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, earlier led a Vatican delegation to the hospitals where the bodies of two dead women are being kept, Lombardi said. They prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified, a catechism teacher in a parish in Luanda whose last class was Saturday morning. Midway through the Mass, a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff, as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir, members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps. Women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs, many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope. The 81-year-old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service, while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas. The pope spoke in English and Portuguese, the language of Angola's former colonial rulers, during the hour-long service, while local clergy read short passages in tribal languages. Benedict has been in Africa since Tuesday. He returns to Rome on Monday. Africa is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope. ""He knows he has to do this. He knows Africa is the future of the [Roman Catholic] Church, as it is for all of Christianity,"" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular. One in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from fewer than one in 50 in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database. So Benedict is making the visit, although travel ""is not his cup of tea,"" Gibson said, in contrast to his predecessor. ""John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through."" But Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of ""The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World."" The trip opened with controversy, with the pope reiterating the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Tuesday while flying to Cameroon, the first stop on his journey. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it. Gibson said this week's visit may be Benedict's only trip to Africa. ""Knowing that the pope is older, he cannot travel as much -- he does not like to travel -- makes these trips more poignant. He may never come back to Africa again."" CNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","NEW: Pope expresses ""deep sorrow"" at deaths in stampede at his Saturday event .

"(CNN) -- Although many people think of a heart attack as a painful, sometimes fatal event, there are some heart attacks that go entirely unnoticed. Some people may have had heart attacks without knowing it, studies show. Undiagnosed, or ""silent,"" heart attacks affect nearly 200,000 people in the United States annually. As many as 40 to 60 percent of all heart attacks are unrecognized, studies show. By definition, a heart attack usually happens when a clot gets in the way of blood flow from a coronary artery to the heart. This may cause symptoms such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting and nausea. Anyone who believes that he or she is having a heart attack should seek emergency medical attention. But sometimes a heart attack is not painful, or the person experiencing it does not recognize the symptoms as heart-related, so he or she does not go to a hospital for treatment. Cardiologists have only recently become attuned to the prevalence of these silent heart attacks, and research on treatment is limited. The risk factors for silent heart attacks are the same as for regular heart attacks, experts say, and include smoking, diabetes, stress and family history.  Watch CNN Health Files: Heart attacks » . A new study from Duke University Medical Center shows that these silent heart attacks may occur more frequently than physicians thought. Even if a heart attack occurred in the distant past, it may still leave a signature called a Q-wave on an electrocardiogram. But there are silent heart attacks that do not have associated Q-waves. Researchers used a relatively new technique called delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance and then followed up with patients after about two years. The study was done on 185 patients who had never had a diagnosed heart attack but were suspected of having coronary artery disease. The researchers found that 35 percent of patients had evidence of a heart attack and that silent heart attacks without Q-waves were three times more common than those that had Q-waves. Patients with non-Q-wave silent heart attacks also had 11 times higher risk of death from any cause and a 17-fold risk of death from heart problems compared with patients without any heart damage. But experts do not recommend that people generally be screened for silent heart attacks unless they have other heart-related problems. ""Currently, there has not been a study that has demonstrated that early identification and therapy changes how patients with unrecognized heart attacks do in the future,"" said Dr. Han Kim, a cardiologist at Duke University and lead author of the study. ""If you don't know when an actual event occurred, it becomes difficult to prescribe therapy."" Although the study was done on a relatively small sample of people at risk of coronary artery disease, meaning the results may not apply to the general population, other cardiologists say the study has merit in adding to the knowledge of silent heart attacks. ""Ultimately, we're going to need trials to really establish what treatment works and what doesn't,"" said Dr. Eric Schelbert, a cardiologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was not involved in the study. Treatment for someone who has had a silent heart attack is usually the same for someone who came to the hospital immediately after a heart attack, Kim said. This may include beta blockers, statin drugs, aspirin or other medications, Schelbert said. Schelbert said he has seen plenty of patients who have had silent heart attacks; in fact, he has treated some of his own colleagues who have experienced them. ""It's an incredibly important thing that the physician scientist community needs to explore further,"" he said. Researchers noted that patients with non-Q-wave silent heart attacks were also generally older and were more likely to have diabetes. There needs to be more of a focus on prevention among these risk groups, said Dr. David Wiener, a cardiologist at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the study.","Silent heart attacks affect nearly 200,000 people in the United States annually .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Oprah Winfrey often says that moms have the hardest job in the world, but plenty of fathers carry the burden of raising a child all by themselves. In fact, 2.5 million single fathers in the United State are doing it all-- juggling schedules, putting food on the table and going to school plays or soccer games -- single-handedly. Larry Shine and his expanded family visited Oprah Winfrey on her show. Larry Shine and his wife, Kate, had their first son, Henry, 19 years ago. When Kate died of cancer only two-and-a-half years later, Larry says he was overwhelmed with grief. ""The year after she died, I was just so immersed in the tragedy of her death,"" he says. ""Then I thought: 'I can't live like this anymore. I can't have this be our life.'"" He decided it was time for Henry to have a sibling. At the time, it was almost impossible for a single male to adopt in the United States, so Larry applied for both international adoption and surrogacy. Surprisingly, both applications went through, and soon Larry became a father of three. Still, he says he was ready for more. Today, Larry is raising nine children on his own! ""I never thought I'd be a father of nine. Actually, I never imagined I'd be a father,"" he says. ""Maybe this all happened for a purpose. Because if Kate hadn't died, I never would have done what I did and these kids wouldn't have had a home."" Oprah.com: 8 things never to say to an adopted child . When it comes to raising nine kids (Henry, 19; Ari, 16; Halle, 15; Eli, 13; Lili, 12; Sofia, 10; Genevieve, 8; Simone, 5; and Lucia, 3), Larry says there is never a dull moment. His schedule is jam-packed, and it starts at 3 a.m. As if being a single dad isn't enough work, Larry also works full time as a corporate attorney. ""When the second bus picks up the younger kids at quarter of nine, I leave and drop Lucia off at daycare. Then I go to work all day and come back and pick her up when daycare closes at 6 o'clock and then head home,"" he says. ""[I work at] a very warm and family-oriented firm, so they're very supportive."" Though Larry's big family is thriving, he says there were a few small bumps along the way. Eli's arm broke when he was an infant and hadn't healed properly before he joined the Shine family, but Larry says extensive orthopedic surgery fixed the problem. Lili had failure to thrive syndrome, which caused her to have trouble connecting with others -- though Larry says she opened up after three months in his busy house and is doing great. And, Simone's speech was delayed, he says. ""She had therapy for about six months, and now sometimes I wish I hadn't given her speech therapy,"" he jokes. Is there room for any more kids in the Shine family? Depends on whom you ask! ""I thought five was it, and I thought six was it,"" Larry says. ""My sense is that nine is probably it ... because international adoption's a lot more difficult, and I'm older. ... [But] I've been given a lot of opportunities, and if it happened again, I'd have a hard time saying no."" Henry, who is a sophomore at Notre Dame, says the family is at capacity. ""We're at a pretty full limit right now,"" he says. ""Now that I'm in school, I'd like to be around if there's going to be another sibling."" Though he's rooting for Lucia to be his youngest sibling, Henry says he's incredibly proud of his dad. ""Just how selfless he is,"" he says. ""I don't know of anybody else who puts people before themselves like he does."" Though Larry didn't plan on being the single dad of such a huge family, he says it came naturally to him. ""I'm more comfortable doing something for somebody else than myself,"" he says. ""Particularly with adopting the kids overseas, when I went to Paraguay for the first time to adopt Ari and saw all the kids who didn't have a home and or a place to go at night, I just thought, 'This isn't right.'"" It may have been an unexpected path for Larry, but he says its one he's grateful for. ""I love parenting,"" he says. ""I just felt, 'This is what I want to do.'"" Oprah.com: Talks every parent should have . Matt's blog . On March 25, 2008, Matt Logelin woke up to what should have been a perfect day. He and his wife, Liz, were proud new parents -- their daughter Madeline had been born the day before. But that afternoon, Liz died of a blood clot that no one knew she had. With a newborn in his care, Matt had no time for mourning. ""Right after Liz died, I had to go straight in and I had to feed her (Madeline). I mean, she had to eat. I had to change her diapers. Life didn't stop when Liz died,"" he says. ""I didn't know what I was going to do. I literally didn't know if I was going to live through this."" Matt and Maddy survived the tragedy, and Matt used the blog he'd created to document Liz's pregnancy as an outlet for his grief. ""If I write it, I can get it off my chest,"" he says. After Liz's death, tens of thousand of people started reading Matt's blog. The outpouring of support -- including notes, money and toys -- from the online community shocked him. ""To have total strangers giving us stuff and wanting to make sure we're okay all the time was just incredible,"" he says. Matt says he's determined to give back as much as he's been given. ""We've donated all of the clothes that no longer fit and the toys that we couldn't use,"" he says. ""We've been given a lot of money as well, and we've tried to give that away as much as we can."" Matt has also established the Liz Logelin Foundation, which helps widows and widowers with children. A year after Maddy was born, Matt's still adjusting to life as a single parent. He's even joined the neighborhood new moms group. ""They sort of adopted me,"" he says. ""They took me in and made sure I wasn't screwing things up too terribly."" Matt says one of the scariest things about Liz's death is that she took all her parenting knowledge with her. ""Liz had read all the books. She had done everything that we needed to do to make sure that this baby was taken care of properly,"" he says. ""It's not something I ever anticipated doing on my own."" Matt says he'd planned to be the free-spirited parent, while Liz would be the rigid one. Given the circumstance, Matt has struck a balance. ""I've had to be a little more strict in the way that I do things, but I still let her eat sticks and leaves from time to time."" Oprah.com: Meet more unforgettable fathers!

Farrah Fawcett, seen here in 2006, has waged a very public battle with anal cancer. ""No one has said to her you have two months to live,"" Stewart said Monday. ""So I'm looking at that as a really good sign.""

""You know, they're reliving two years of hell that they've endured together."" King asked Spencer whether Fawcett, who made her name a household word on the hit '70s TV series ""Charlie's Angels,"" and O'Neal might marry. ""He said you never know.

King also had a panel of medical experts on his show to discuss Fawcett's cancer. Dr. Thomas Vogl, who at one time treated the actress in Germany, called her medical condition ""very, very serious."" Dr. Allyson Ocean, a medical oncologist in New York, said only about 5,000 cases of anal cancer are diagnosed in the United States yearly. Unlike Fawcett's case, it usually doesn't spread, and only about 10 to 15 percent of cases are advanced, Ocean said. Fawcett's cancer, however, is in Stage 4 and has spread to her liver. Ocean said there are various causes of anal cancer. ""One of the causes is a virus called the human papilloma virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. It seems to be more common in women, in general, outside of any viral infections. Smoking is actually a risk factor,"" she said. King asked Dr. Paul Song, a radiation oncologist, if he had seen Stage 4 cancer cured. ""Not with anal cancer. I have seen it with other GI malignancies such as rectal cancer,"" Song said. ""But anal cancer is a little bit more difficult to treat."" Despite the bleak outlook, Song had praise for Fawcett and her documentary. ""I think one of the most powerful things that Miss Fawcett did in this documentary was give patients a sense of hope and to just show how she's handled this with such courage and dignity,"" Song said. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta told King that doctors have to strike a delicate balance when they are caring for patients such as Fawcett. ""You have to be absolutely honest with patients, but, you know, you don't want to strip away their hope and optimism, either. There are people, Larry, as you know, who beat the odds,"" Gupta said. Vogl told King he developed a close relationship with Fawcett during the time he treated her in Germany and expressed admiration for his one-time patient. ""From a lot of treatments and contact and communication, I think she is extremely special, an extremely brave person,"" he said.","""Insider"" host Lara Spencer says friends, family holding out for a miracle .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pete Sampras and Roger Federer are two of the modern era's greatest tennis players. Between them, they have won a staggering 27 Grand Slam singles titles -- and yet, neither player has ever won the French Open. Tennis great Pete Sampras won 14 Grand Slam tournaments but never managed a French Open victory. That legendary players like Sampras and Federer have somehow failed to win at Les Internationaux de France de Roland Garros is just one of the reasons why this Grand Slam tournament holds such a special place on the tennis calendar. The French Open is notably the only Grand Slam event contested on clay -- a factor that separates it from the other three majors, and more than anything else defines the tournament. The layers of crushed brick that constitute the orange-red clay courts of Roland Garros are what brought Sampras -- and still bring Federer -- so much grief. Fellow greats John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg also failed to win the coveted title. The reason clay may have affected the natural games of these players is because the surface slows the ball and produces a slightly higher, loopier bounce than grass or hard courts. This means the high-power serve of someone like Sampras is negated, opening the way for players with a different style of game. To this extent, the French Open helped create the legend of one of the finest players of all time -- Swedish star Bjorn Borg. Borg won a record six times at Roland Garros. He also won five Wimbledon titles -- but never managed an Australian or U.S. Open crown, both tournaments fought out on hard courts. Describing what makes the French Open so special in an rare one-on-one interview with Indian Web site Rediff.com in 2001, Borg said: ""It is toughest to win on clay. It is easily the most draining, the toughest Slam."" Offering advice to Sampras, who was at the time still playing for a French Open title, Borg added, ""I would advise him to concentrate on mental strength, to build it up, to hold that strength over the course of the fortnight. ""Along with that, you also need a great deal of physical strength. And most importantly, you have to believe that you can win on clay."" It is not surprising therefore, that Spanish players -- who are generally well-accustomed to playing on clay -- have come to dominate the tournament in recent years. Nine of the last 12 French Open finals have featured at least one Spaniard. The tournament is still held in high regard by France's population. A record crowd of more than 450,000 people came to watch the action at Roland Garros in 2008, and according to the tournament organizers, it is the most-watched French event in the world. First played in 1891 as a national tournament, it became an international event in 1925, and in 1928 moved to the Roland Garros facility at Porte d'Auteuil in Paris, where it remains today. Its chosen title, Roland Garros, was the name of a legendary World War One French aviator, who had frequented the tennis venue when he studied in Paris. The 2009 edition of what Borg called ""the toughest Slam"" promises to be just as entertaining and draining as those that have gone before. World number one Rafael Nadal is searching for his fifth consecutive title to usurp Borg's record of four in a row, which he currently equals. Meanwhile, world number two Roger Federer is looking to avenge three consecutive final defeats at the hands of Nadal. In the women's draw, the tournament appears wide open. Last year's champion Ana Ivanovic has slipped to eighth in the world rankings, while the top four ranked players have only one French Open title between them.","Legendary players like Sampras and Federer have failed to win French Open title .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the ""American Idol"" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants. In this corner: Kris Allen, the guy next door. ""It is the battle of the acoustic rocker versus the glam rocker. Conway (Arkansas) versus California. The guy next door versus the guy-liner."" After three performances apiece and plenty of judge feedback, it seems that the Southern California glam-rocker Adam Lambert has the edge -- but it didn't look that way early in Tuesday's show. In the first round, where the contestants chose a song from a favorite past performance this season, Simon Cowell declared Kris Allen the winner after his rendition of ""Ain't No Sunshine"" on piano.  Watch Allen and Lambert talk after the show » . Lambert chose to sing ""Mad World"" while wearing a long black coat and walking around a stage filled with white smoke, all of which Cowell found ""over-theatrical."" ""I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic,"" Lambert told reporters after the show. ""It talks about people who don't feel like they fit in."" Round two featured a tune hand-picked by ""American Idol"" creator Simon Fuller, where Lambert ditched the black overcoat and belted out Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" while sporting a shiny silver suit. Paula Abdul told Lambert ""it was the best I've ever heard you sing, ever!"" Allen's feedback after singing Marvin Gaye's classic ""What's Goin' On"" in the second round was much less flattering.  See the best and worst performances from season eight » . ""I thought it was too laid back for a night like this,"" said Cowell. He then gave round two to Lambert. Round three featured a bit of a twist -- both contestants had to sing a song co-written by judge Kara DioGuardi called ""No Boundaries."" Lambert went first and had little difficulty with the ballad. Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that ""you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show."" Allen, however, struggled to stay in tune during the entire performance ... but the judges were less harsh this time. ""You have thoroughly, thoroughly deserved to be standing on that stage tonight, congratulations,"" said Cowell.  Watch anchors debate ""Idol"" finalists » . After the show, Lambert told reporters that they did not have a lot of time to work on ""No Boundaries"" and it was kind of a ""rush job."" ""There was a lot of lyric, and it was a big song,"" said Lambert. ""But it's a beautiful song."" It almost seems appropriate that these two are facing off in the finale. According to Allen, he and Lambert were once roommates during the competition. They even critique each other's rehearsals. ""He's always giving me stuff to change about mine ... to make it better,"" Allen told reporters. iReport.com: Who should win: Kris or Adam? A little over an hour before the show began, a magnitude 4.0 quake aftershock hit 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Tuesday night's telecast was held at the Nokia Theater, which is in downtown Los Angeles. A 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck the area shortly before 8:40 p.m. Sunday. But, to Allen's disappointment, neither of the contestants felt the jolt Tuesday. ""I was totally upset, too, because I've never been to California (except for 'American Idol'), and I was like, 'I want to feel an earthquake.'

"(InStyle.com) -- The co-star of ""27 Dresses"" discusses his personal style. ""I just feel dirty,"" says James Marsden. Not to be alarmed: There's nothing indecent going on here. James Marsden talks about his favorite kind of clothes and how his style has changed over the years. The 34-year-old is explaining what it feels like to be sporting facial hair for a film he's working on with Cameron Diaz. Yet even the newly grown whiskers can't hide the finely chiseled features of an actor who seems to have cornered the Hollywood market on hottie-who-loses-the-girl roles (""Enchanted,"" ""Superman Returns"" and, of course, ""The Notebook."") But the Oklahoma-bred star doesn't mind his wholesome image. ""That's really me,"" he says. ""I'm a little dorky -- awkward."" However, his onscreen luck could be changing with his latest film, ""27 Dresses,"" a romantic comedy co-starring Katherine Heigl. Scruffy or not, we'll be watching. You've played a prince in ""Enchanted"" and the superhero Cyclops in the ""X-Men"" movies. Is that a big deal to your kids and their friends? My daughter, Mary, is only 2, and my son, Jack, is 7. He has a Cyclops action figure, but he's really into Spider-Man and Pixar movies -- Buzz Lightyear is his guy. No ""Superman,"" no ""X-Men."" I think he just assumes that everyone at his school has a dad who's a big superhero. You also played Corny Collins, the TV dance-show host in ""Hairspray."" What were you like in high school? That's when I came out of my shell and became more social -- people thought I was funny. I got into a whole preppy thing -- Duck Head shorts and Dockers. How would you describe your style now? Functional comfort. For a guy, it shouldn't ever look like you thought about it too much, like the clothes are wearing you. Whose clothes do you like? Paul Smith off the rack -- it's a slim cut, and I don't need to have it tailored. I always feel like an 8-year-old when I dress up in a suit, like, when can I take this thing off? But I wore a black Dolce & Gabbana suit to the première of ""Hairspray"" that was like, OK, now I know what a great suit is. Classic, clean lines -- sharp, sharp, sharp. Do you change your style from coast to coast? In L.A. it's too easy to throw on a pair of American Apparel sweats, a T-shirt and running shoes and just wear those for days. In New York, I actually like looking nice. Maybe I'm just getting older, but young guys need to pull their pants up. Do you ever shop for your wife? I love shopping for dresses, and I actually do a pretty good job. When I was in New York, I went into J. Crew in Soho and got her a cool fifties type dress with tiny polka dots. Style-wise I'm good, but figuring out sizing is a different story. What do you find sexy on a woman? I like spaghetti straps for my wife -- she has great shoulders and a great neck. I love when she puts her hair up, because I can see the back of her neck, so delicate and vulnerable. It's the vampire in me. Or my obsession with cheerleaders -- their hair up in a ponytail. When I was young, I could never have that. Never got the cheerleader? Eventually -- my wife was a cheerleader. What does your wife find sexy on you? A button-front shirt with [baby] spit-up on the shoulder. That means a guy is taking care of the kids and is a good father -- that's sexy to a woman. The adult version of rose petals and champagne is if I let my wife sleep in and I get up to change the baby's diaper, feed the kids, and do the dishes. Who inspires you? Paul Newman. My middle name is Paul, and my grandfather once said I was going to look like Paul Newman. That stuck with me. Beyond being a good-looking guy, Newman is a great actor with a long career, and he's got a life. He's married with kids and lives in Connecticut, sells popcorn and marinara sauce, and gives the money to charity. Anyone else? George Clooney dresses like Gary Cooper might have. Cary Grant. ""A Streetcar Named Desire""-era Marlon Brando. They all made it look effortless. Their clothes framed their personalities really well -- comfortable, classic, but sharp. These guys could pull off a great suit, or jeans and a T-shirt. Don't you agree that guys have it easy -- they are considered ""distinguished"" as they grow older? I don't think it's guy-specific. As women get older, they become more comfortable with themselves. Susan Sarandon is the poster woman for that. A lot of guys fantasize about being with women who are in their forties or fifties. So your advice is ...? Act your age. Dress your age. Look your age. That doesn't mean you can't have fun. And isn't it time you got the girl in one of your movies?

CNN's Jack Cafferty says ""the pain won't go away"" until Bush administration's misdeeds are addressed. (CNN) -- It doesn't go away by itself. Watergate ""went away"" when Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in disgrace and left town never to be heard from in an official capacity again. The Bush presidency is thankfully over...but the damage he and Dick Cheney did continues to press on the nerve of the American people like an impacted wisdom tooth. And until the questions surrounding arguably the most arrogant and perhaps most corrupt administration in our history are addressed, the pain won't go away. From Nancy (""Impeachment is off the table"") Pelosi to President Barack (""I want to look forward, not backward"") Obama, the country is being poorly served by their Democratic government. And on this subject President Obama is dead wrong. George W. Bush and his accomplices damaged this country like it's never been damaged before. And it's not just the phony war in Iraq or the torture memos that justified waterboarding. It's millions of missing emails and the constant use of executive privilege and signing statements. It's the secretive meetings with Enron and other energy executives and the wholesale firing of federal prosecutors. It's trying to get the president's personal attorney seated on the Supreme Court and that despicable Alberto Gonzales sitting in front of congressional investigators whining, ""I don't remember, I don't know, I...etc."" It's the domestic eavesdropping in violation of the FISA Court, the rendition prisons, and the lying. It's looking the other way while the City of New Orleans drowned and its people were left to fend for themselves. It's the violations of the Geneva Conventions, the soiling of our international reputation and the shredding of the U.S. Constitution. It's the handing over of $700 billion to the Wall Street fat cats last fall, no questions asked. Where is that money? What was it used for? It's the no-bid contracts to firms like Halliburton and Blackwater and the shoddy construction and lack of oversight of reconstruction in Iraq that cost American taxpayers untold billions. If the Republicans were serious about restoring their reputation, they would join the call for a special prosecutor to be appointed so that at long last justice can be done. It's too late for George W. Bush to resign the presidency. But it's not too late to put the people responsible for this national disgrace in prison.

"SAN BERNARDINO, California (CNN) -- Three-year-old Briant Rodriguez remained in a hospital bed fatigued and malnourished Monday, 15 days after being kidnapped at gunpoint and then dumped on the streets of Mexico. Liberato Vega, 30, left, and Israel Moreno, 28, are suspects in the kidnapping of 3-year-old Briant Rodriguez. Police don't know much about what happened to the boy, who was taken after gunmen tied his family and ransacked his California home on May 3. They don't know why the gunmen broke into the home, why they kidnapped the bubbly 3-year-old or how he ended up wandering the streets of Mexicali with a shaved head, rather than the long hair he had sported before the kidnapping. But police believe they do know who is responsible. In a news conference on Monday, the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department and FBI identified the two suspect gunmen as Liberato Vega, 30, and Israel Moreno, 28. The two men, who authorities said were illegal immigrants with criminal records, are believed to have burst into the San Bernardino home, ransacked the house, tied up 3-year-old Briant Rodriguez's family and snatched the child two weeks ago. The boy was returned to his family Saturday in the border town of Calexico. ""It was a very emotional and unforgettable experience,"" said San Bernardino County Sheriff's Sgt. Doug Hubbard, who was with the boy's mother when he was returned. ""Enough said there -- before I get emotional."" Officials said the boy was still in the hospital Monday and was being treated for malnourishment and fatigue. ""We're very happy that he's alive,"" San Bernardino County Sheriff Rod Hoops said this weekend. ""A 3-year-old goes missing in this country for two weeks -- sometimes it has an unhappy ending. ""This one did not."" Now, police are trying to piece together exactly what may have happened during the 13 days the boy was missing. Detectives from the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department and Federal Bureau of Investigations agents were able to identify the alleged kidnappers based on unspecified physical evidence at the San Bernardino home and interviews with the boy's family and neighbors. Hubbard said the family has adamantly denied knowing who may be responsible for the kidnapping or having any association with those responsible. FBI Supervisory Special Agent Don Roberts said it was, however, ""likely that this family was the target"" of the kidnappers. ""But why, we don't know,"" Roberts said, adding that the kidnappers had clearly planned the crime. Officials said they believe Vega and Moreno are the two men they captured on video at a home-improvement store near the Rodriguez home before the crime buying tape like the kind that was used to bind the family. Hubbard said there are no-bail warrants issued for both men for home invasion robbery and kidnapping and  Roberts said the FBI also obtained federal warrants for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for both men. ""We will leave no stone unturned until these two are returned to San Bernardino to face justice,"" Roberts said. ""We will not take a break until that day happens."" Authorities are hunting for both men, who have criminal records, in Mexico where they were both born. Roberts said both men have previously been deported from the United States, where they were living illegally. Their previous residences are empty, police said. Vega, who police said they considered to be the primary suspect, has had seven encounters with authorities in San Bernardino, according to court records, including four convictions in 2005 for a variety of charges, including driving under the influence. He also has a dismissed burglary case and two open cases against him for driving under the influence,  providing false information to police and driving without a license. Police described Vega as a Hispanic male, 5 feet 9 inches weighing 130 pounds. Moreno was convicted in 2008 for driving under the influence and has another similar case open against him. Police described Moreno as a Hispanic male, 5 feet 6 inches weighing 150 pounds. Police have said they are also looking for 21-year-old Claudia Acosta, Vega's girlfriend, who may be traveling with him. They aren't sure how she's related to the kidnapping.","NEW: Liberato Vega, 30, and Israel Moreno, 28, suspects in kidnapping .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- An accident involving de-icing solution being sprayed on an Alaska Airlines plane in snow-covered Seattle sent seven people to a hospital Wednesday, airport and hospital officials said. Emergency vehicles gather around Alaska Airlines planes in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday. The seven, who were crew members, were transported to Highline Medical Center for minor issues, such as eye irritation, dizziness and nausea, said Sea-Tac Airport spokesman Perry Cooper. Eighteen passengers were treated at the scene. There had been an initial report that two people were badly hurt, but Cooper said all of the injuries were minor. He said six of the crew members transported to the hospital were working and one was off duty. Caroline Boren, Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, confirmed the injury numbers and said the most extensive treatment given to the passengers was an eye wash. None of them requested further treatment or were transported to the hospital. Matt Crockett, assistant administrator at Highline Medical Center, confirmed the hospital was assessing seven people in its emergency room. He said six of them were in satisfactory condition and another was still being evaluated. The incident began when fumes from the de-icing application got into the cabin of Alaska Airlines Flight 528.  Watch an ex-transportation official explain how the fumes seeped into the plane » . Alaska Airlines said the flight was getting ready for takeoff to Burbank, California, when passengers began to complain of eye irritation and strong fumes from the chemicals. Video footage showed several emergency vehicles around the plane on the snow-covered tarmac. The airline said the plane, a Boeing 737-800, was carrying 143 passengers and several crew members. Boren called the situation ""very unusual"" and said maintenance crew had been working on the plane. Cooper said the airline was bringing in another aircraft to transport the passengers to their destination. Seattle has been blanketed with nearly 9 inches of snow this week, and forecasters predicted snow mixed with rain Wednesday, with an accumulation of about a half inch of new snow through Thursday. One passenger, Joe Dial of Seattle, told CNN affiliate KIRO-TV that passengers were exposed to the de-icer fumes for 45 minutes before they were able to leave the plane. The jetliner had pulled away from the gate Wednesday morning, but then had to return for the de-icing process, Dial told KIRO. Meanwhile in Moline, Illinois, an AirTran Airways jet skidded off the runway at Quad City International Airport, CNN affiliate WQAD-TV reported. Witnesses said passengers were being evacuated to buses, and there appeared to be no injuries, according to WQAD. The airport was closed to all traffic after the accident, the station said. At airports elsewhere across the U.S., weather was forcing significant delays as travelers tried to reach their destinations by Christmas. Flights bound for Newark-Liberty International Airport in New Jersey faced delays averaging three hours. Flights into Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in Illinois, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and San Francisco International Airport in California were all subject to delays averaging an hour or more, according to the FAA. Travelers at O'Hare were hoping Wednesday went better than the day before as thousands were stranded in the nation's second-busiest airport overnight when hundreds of flights were canceled. ""It is ruining my holiday,"" one stranded passenger, Keith Bouchard, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV. ""I am not going to have a holiday mood till I get home,"" stranded passenger Ken Estes told WLS. O'Hare's trouble extended to South Florida, where Laura Weichhand and Rachel Lewis got stuck at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport when their flight to Chicago was canceled. ""If we want to be home for Christmas ... our only option is we're going to drive 26 hours to be home for Christmas,"" Lewis told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV. The Chicago area was expected to get 1 inch to 3 inches of new snow Wednesday. At Colorado's Denver International Airport, lost luggage was a huge problem. Thousands of pieces of unclaimed baggage were in the airport's arrivals area, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported. Deanna Nokes, who was stranded in Denver on her way to Portland, Oregon, told KGMH her bags were nowhere in sight. ""They don't even know where my bag is,"" she told the station. ""It still could be in Vegas, or Phoenix, or Portland."" Airports in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, were hit hardest by weather delays earlier in the week, with hundreds of flight cancellations Sunday through Tuesday. The two Northwest airports were reporting just a few delays Wednesday, but a new storm was rolling in from the Pacific Ocean, bringing snow and rain, the National Weather Service said. ""It will not be as strong as this past weekend's storm,"" said weather service meteorologist Kirby Cook in Seattle. But that may be of little consolation to thousands of travelers stranded at Northwest airports because of cancellations earlier in the week. Alaska Airlines, the area's major carrier, said fully booked holiday flights left it with few options to accommodate the weather weary, CNN affiliate KHQ-TV in Spokane, Washington, reported. Some in Spokane turned to Craigslist.com to try to get home for Christmas. The Web site had more than 30 posts from people looking to get to or out of Spokane, CNN affiliate KXLY-TV reported. ""I know Craigslist has a rideshare community so I thought I'd try, and so far not so good,"" Priscilla Davis of Federal Way, Washington, told KXLY.","NEW: 18 passengers treated at scene after exposure to de-icing fluid .

"(CNN)  -- Austrian officials are seeking to secure the release of two Austrian nationals who were kidnapped by an al Qaeda group while vacationing in North Africa ahead of a midnight Sunday deadline. Reinhard and Christine Lenz, right, the parents of kidnapped Austrian Andrea Kloiber. ""There are efforts in all areas, unrelenting efforts to secure the earliest possible release of our citizens,"" Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal told CNN. The team of high-ranking government officials met Sunday morning and planned to work throughout the day, he said. Wolfgang Ebner, 51, and Andrea Kloiber, 44, were last heard from on February 18 while on a vacation in southern Tunisia, foreign ministry spokesman Martin Gaertner said. Earlier this month, the Austrian government received an audio message via the Internet from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claiming to have kidnapped the pair. The kidnappers' primary demand is the release of five prisoners in Algeria and Tunisia, Launsky-Tieffenthal said. While the kidnappers have set a midnight deadline, there are preliminary indications that it may be extended, he said. The government is in contact with authorities in Tunisia, Algeria, and Mali in an effort to find the missing duo, who are from the Austrian town of Hallein. A few weeks ago, the kidnappers released a set of written demands and six photographs that include images of the Austrians. Among the images was one that appeared to show the pair flanked by men holding assault rifles and a rocket launcher. Another appeared to show more than 15 group members -- several of them armed. Kloiber's face is obscured in all of the photographs in which she appears. E-mail to a friend .","Officials battling a midnight deadline to secure release of kidnapped Austrians .

"(CNN) -- A pea-sized seahorse, the world's longest insect, a ""ghost slug"" and the world's smallest snake were among the top 10 species discovered in 2008, a committee of scientists said Friday. A tiny seahorse and the world's longest insect were among the top 10 new species discovered in 2008. These unusual critters were among thousands of species found last year, many in remote or tropical regions of the planet, that hint at the breadth of the Earth's undiscovered biodiversity. ""Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth's species is,"" said Quentin Wheeler, director of the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University, which announced the top 10 new species list. ""We are surrounded by such an exuberance of species diversity that we too often take it for granted,"" Wheeler added. The ASU institute and an international committee of taxonomists -- scientists devoted to species exploration and classification -- compile the top 10 list of new species each year. Also on the 2008 list are a caffeine-free coffee plant, a snail whose shell twists around four axes, a palm that flowers itself to death and microscopic bacteria that live in hairspray.   See photos of the new species » . Here's the complete list: . 1. Pygmy seahorse: Classified by its Latin name, Hippocampus satomiae, this species measures about half an inch long and was found near Derawan Island off Kalimantan, Indonesia. 2. A plant that kills itself: Found in a small area of northwestern Madagascar, a rare genus of palm -- Tahina spectablilis -- produces huge, spectacular flowers and then dies and collapses. Fewer than 100 have been found. 3. Decaf, please: Known as Coffea charrieriana, this plant found in Cameroon is the first record of a caffeine-free coffee species from Central Africa. 4. Spray-on species: An extremophile bacteria, Microbacterium hatanonis, was discovered in hairspray by Japanese scientists. 5. A stick that moves: The world's longest insect, with a body length of 14 inches (22.3 inches including legs), Phobaeticus chani resembles a stick and was found in Borneo, Malaysia. 6. The Barbados Threadsnake: Leptotyphlops carlae measures only 4.1 inches long and is believed to be the world's smallest snake. 7. A pale ""ghost slug"": Selenochlamys ysbryda was a surprising find in the densely populated area of Cardiff, Wales. 8. A very limber snail: This unique species, Opisthostoma vermiculum, is found on a limestone hill in Malaysia and has a shell that twists around four axes. 9. Damsel in the deep blue sea: Chromis abyssus is a beautiful species of damselfish found in deep-reef habitat off the coast of Ngemelis Island, Palau. 10. Fossil mama: A fossilized fish, Materpiscis attenboroughi, is an extremely rare find from Western Australia and shows a mother giving birth 380 million years ago. Scientists are still classifying species found around the globe in 2008, so final data for that year are not available. But on Friday, the taxonomists issued a State of Observed Species report card that states 18,516 species new to science -- about half of them insects -- were discovered and described in 2007. The vast majority of the 18,516 species named in 2007 were invertebrate animals (75.6 percent), vascular plants (11.1 percent) and vertebrates (6.7 percent). The report was compiled by ASU's International Institute for Species Exploration in partnership with other scientists. ""Charting the species of the world and their unique attributes are essential parts of understanding the history of life,"" Wheeler said.

"(CNN)  -- Hurricane Paloma continued to intensify Friday night as the Category 3 storm pounded Grand Cayman island with strong winds and heavy rain. As of 10 p.m. ET Friday, Paloma was moving northeast through the Cayman Islands. The National Hurricane Center said additional strengthening of the storm could occur through Saturday night as Paloma turned northeast and headed toward Cuba. A hurricane warning was in effect Friday throughout the Cayman islands, with residents being told that ""preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the center said. A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within 24 hours. Cuban officials also issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey and Las Tunas, the Miami, Florida-based hurricane center said in an advisory. As of 10 p.m. ET, Paloma's winds were near 115 mph (185 kph) with higher gusts. Paloma is forecast to approach Cuba as a Category 2 storm after weakening late Saturday, according to the hurricane center.  Watch rainstorms beat the Cayman Islands » . Friday evening, the center of Paloma was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Grand Cayman Island and about 275 miles (443 kilometers) southwest of Camaguey, Cuba. It was moving northeast at about 7 mph and was expected to pass near Grand Cayman Friday night and approach the coast of central Cuba late Saturday, the hurricane center said. The storm's projected path would steer it away from the U.S. mainland and into the Atlantic.  See where the hurricane could be headed » . J.B. Webb, a manager at a radio station on Grand Cayman, said Friday evening that some residents had gone to shelters and others were shutting themselves in downtown businesses rebuilt to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. He said the local government had advised people to be off the roads by 11 a.m. The storm is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches over the Caymans and central and eastern Cuba, with isolated maximum totals of 15 inches possible. Flash floods and mudslides are possible, forecasters said. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles from the center, and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 120 miles, the hurricane center said. iReport.com: Are you in Paloma's path? Forecasters predicted storm-surge flooding of 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels, accompanied by dangerous battering waves, near the center of Paloma in the Cayman Islands. Near where Paloma is expected to make landfall, along Cuba's southern coast, storm surge flooding of 8 to 12 feet is forecast, the hurricane center said. Cuban television was broadcasting advisories to viewers, telling them not to cross swollen rivers, to avoid fallen cables and to evacuate if told to do so by Civil Defense officials. In Las Tunas, students in boarding schools were sent home, because the schools will be used as shelters. Evacuations were under way in some coastal areas prone to flooding.

"LONDON, England -- Former Culture Club singer Boy George has been convicted of falsely imprisoning a male escort. The judge told Boy George he faced jail. Norwegian Audun Carlsen, 29, said the frontman with the 1980s band beat him with a metal chain as he tried to flee his London flat after a naked photo shoot. A jury at a London court found on Friday that the case was proven against the 46-year-old musician -- tried under his real name of George O'Dowd. The singer declined to give evidence during the trial but the jury heard he told police he handcuffed Carlsen to his bed while he investigated alleged tampering with his computer. Carlsen told the court O'Dowd invented the story about computer tampering so he could punish him for not having sex at a previous meeting. He said: ""I think he couldn't handle the refusal -- me not having sex with him."" O'Dowd looked grim as the verdict was delivered, according to the Press Association. The singer was bailed until sentencing on January 16. Judge David Radford warned him that he was likely to face jail. ""The fact that your bail is being continued does not imply that this will be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence. I don't want any false expectations created,"" he said.","Boy George convicted by jury in London of falsely imprisoning male escort .

"(CNN) -- This season on ""American Idol,"" there's a huge question looming around Adam Lambert. Kris Allen, left, and Adam Lambert are battling it out to become the next ""American Idol."" No, not that one. The one about whether this season would have been as exciting had he not been a part of the show. Love him or hate him, Lambert has added an element to the competition that has been woefully lacking in seasons past: a contestant so unique that you can't wait to see what he will pull next out of his bag of tricks. Regardless on how the season concludes, with Lambert being named ""American Idol"" or losing the title to competitor Kris Allen, it's obvious that a star has been born, and we all got to watch. ""I don't think there would be nearly the interest that there is if it weren't for Adam,"" said Brian Mansfield, who blogs about the show for USA Today. ""Really, all season long it's been Adam and the rest of the field, and is there anybody in the rest of the field that can beat Adam.""  Read and watch the best ""Idol"" performances » . Indeed, the talent level for ""Idol's"" 2009 edition has been fairly high. Once upon a time, the show plucked apparent unknowns from auditions and thrust them before millions of viewers for a ready-made career. Now, ""unknown"" has become a relative term as more contestants like Lambert, who toured with a production of ""Wicked,"" have shown the polish of veteran professionals. But not everything has worked at a high level. The show's ratings have declined a bit from unbelievable to simply juggernaut. And then there's the tried-and-true format, which producers attempted to mix up a bit this season. Among the changes: more semifinalists -- and fewer semifinal performance shows. That meant viewers didn't have the opportunity to see the contestants perform more than once. At least a few felt cheated. ""It's a situation where they get who they want to get, and they pimp those people, which takes away from some of the really good singers,"" said ""Idol"" fan Ricky Hoggard Hollman, who gained fame during season six for correctly guessing the top 24 semifinalists. This season's robust group of 36 contained some fine potential finalists, Hoggard said, but he believed it wasn't a level playing field partly because producers chose to focus more on back stories than talent. There was also the addition of a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, to the longtime triumvirate of Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul, which in the end added nothing but time. Producers also added a ""judges' save,"" which became a throwaway. Much of the criticism has fallen on DioGuardi, a Grammy-nominated songwriter who was supposed to bring a fresh and informed perspective. Instead, she brought uninspiring critiques, some crazy costumes based on the week's theme and the magical ability to force Abdul into a few weeks of coherent comments. Even Cowell wasn't acting like the Simon we have come to alternately adore and want to shake a finger at. He engaged in juvenile antics with Abdul (at one point drawing on her face) and at times stared into space with such complete boredom that you wondered whether Susan Boyle's ""Britain's Got Talent"" performance had forever altered his state of consciousness. ""Simon has shown a level of disinterest and a level disdain for the show that I think is kind of alarming,"" said Michael Slezak, who writes about the show for Entertainment Weekly. ""We sort of expect Simon to speak for us as viewers. We expect him to be up-front and honest and the voice of reason, and he's just been completely disinterested. ""I think it's disrespectful to the contestants, and I think even more so it's disrespectful to us as viewers,"" Slezak added. ""For better or for worse, and crazy or not, we take this show and what's happening up on that stage seriously. It's our escape from reality for the week."" And boy, do viewers take it seriously. iReport.com: Who do you want to win? As CNN.com's regular ""Idol"" blogger, I have never been more lambasted -- pardon the pun -- than on the weeks I have dared to give Adam Lambert anything less than a flawless critique on the ""American Idol"" blog. My sanity has been questioned. So has my nationality. (Hey, critics: My last name is ""France."" It's not the location of my blog posts.) Question Lambert's ability, and the Lambs -- his devoted fans -- come out in force. I haven't been completely sold on Lambert. He can be over the top with the dramatics, and the way his tongue hangs out during certain notes is, frankly, bizarre to me. Yet, for all of his antics, Lambert is unbelievably interesting to watch. It took me a while to warm up to him, but with Lambert, I wanted to watch if for no other reason than I didn't want to be left out of the watercooler conversation the next day. He was the pathway that allowed me to also fall in love with Allen's musicality, Allison Iraheta's mature-for-her-years voice and Anoop Desai's determination to be the first Indian R&B star. I was able to cheer Scott McIntyre's persistence, jeer the lack of the use of the judges save for Alexis Grace and puzzle over Megan Joy's quirky performances.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Indian owners of car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) have agreed to pump ""tens of millions"" of dollars into the luxury car brand to prevent a cash flow crisis, it was reported Monday. Jaguar Land Rover was bought by the Indian company Tata earlier this year for $2.3 billion. The moves comes as the British government ponders a public-funded bailout of the West Midlands-based automaker, the Financial Times newspaper said. Tata, which bought JLR earlier this year, warned its support for the UK subsidiary did not negate the argument that the British government should provide bridging loans and credit guarantees to help the company and the car sector as a whole through the current financial difficulties, the FT said. Last week, the ailing ""big three"" automakers in the U.S. were given a boost when the Bush administration agreed a $13.4 billion loan package. Now British Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has come under pressure to come up with a similar package for UK manufacturers. JLR employs 15,000 workers in Britain and is seen as a vital contributor to the West Midlands regional economy in particular. However, the business secretary at the weekend reiterated that the state had to be a ""lender of last resort,"" only after Tata has looked to its own resources, the FT reported. Any state support would be conditional on the due diligence on the Indian parent company being conducted by the government's City advisers, according to officials. A spokesman for Lord Mandelson's Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform told the British Press Association: ""The Government doesn't have an open cheque-book to bail out ailing companies, but we are doing all we can to help businesses overcome the current challenges. ""Jaguar Land Rover have owners who are well resourced and have the first responsibility to sustain the companies they own."" According to the FT, accountancy firm KPMG and investment bank NM Rothschild have been called in to advise the UK government on the Indian group's complex finances and to assess demands from the car sector.","Tata bought the British-based luxury car maker earlier this year .

"(CNN) -- When makers of one of the most anticipated video games of the year invited users to help design part of the game, the gamers jumped at the chance to create animated characters. Users will have the option to incorporate other people's ""Spore"" designs or choose to block them all. But some took it upon themselves to create something entirely different: a new kind of Internet porn. It started when the makers of ""Spore"" released a Creature Creator program that allowed users to develop their own characters to drum up hype before the game's scheduled release in September. The game, a joint venture from ""Sims"" creator Will Wright and Electronic Arts, allows users to create a unique creature and then control its evolution from a single cell into a complex cultural civilization. Within 24 hours of the Creature Creator's release, gamers had gone creature-crazy, designing millions of critters that were all thrown into a database and shown on a YouTube channel for the public to see. But scrolling through the database -- past the three-legged sea horse, past the seven-eyed wildebeest and the half-motorcycle-half-pig -- revealed something many users didn't expect. Buried among the more wholesome attempts were two-legged dancing testicles, a ""giant breast monster"" and a four-legged ""phallic fornication machine,"" for starters.  Watch Bradshaw demonstrate the ""Creature Creator"" and ""Spore"" » . These naughty -- some would say obscene -- creations have spawned an Internet meme nicknamed ""Sporn,"" short for ""Spore"" porn. For EA, the developer of ""Spore,"" it's the downside to tapping into the booming user-generated content arena, which has made sites like YouTube, Flickr, MySpace, Facebook and Second Life so popular. These games and sites often allow people to create and host their own content in addition to creating cartoon personas, called avatars, for themselves. Many of the popular user-generated content sites have faced similar challenges in trying to control obscene material. In Second Life, users can read Slustler, a cyberporn magazine, or buy programs that allow them to have animated sex with other characters. ""Whether it's modeling clay, dolls or crayons, a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar,"" said Lucy Bradshaw, ""Spore's"" executive producer. Despite its ""Sporn"" issues, ""Spore"" is poised to become one of the most popular games because of its ability to let people tell their own story, rather than one mapped out for them, Bradshaw said. ""Rather than putting players in the shoes of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins, we're giving them the opportunity to be George Lucas or Peter Jackson, as they create their own universe from scratch,"" she said. But for every George Lucas and Peter Jackson, there's always a spoiler. Enter the Spornmaster, a 37-year-old Web developer who refused to give his name for this interview. He, like many others, has spent hours creating characters and turning them into sexual beings. ""It came up simply as something silly and juvenile to do,"" he said. The creatures are not just static. Users can create animated scenarios for the characters to engage in, some of which include sexually graphic acts. When EA got word of the Sporn creations, it began working with YouTube to pull them down. Players who repeatedly upload ""offensive content"" are warned, suspended and eventually banned, Bradshaw said. But the policing isn't restricted to EA and YouTube. Users also are able to flag and report content that they find offensive. That angered some content creators, who feel that they should be able to create whatever they want. ""It was a totally ridiculous overreaction,"" the 37-year-old Web developer said. ""I admit it is silly and juvenile, but I don't think there's anything perverted, vile or awful about it. If people find it offensive, they can simply not search for it online. No one is forcing anyone to see this content."" In response, he created a site to preserve as many of his naughty creations as possible. He said many other creators of Sporn have told him that they too were only joking around. But the Web developer and other Sporn creators have had their share of critics. On blogs and message boards, some have called these creators perverts. ""I consider this very similar to child pornography, at least to the extent of distributing the material to children,"" said 18-year-old Michael James from Calgary, Alberta. James said he has flagged about 10 of the ""disgusting"" creations. EA plans to make sure nobody sees the content if they don't want to, Bradshaw said. When playing ""Spore,"" users will be given three choices regarding people's creations: to receive no outside content, to receive content from buddies only or to receive all external content. Bradshaw hopes the sexual characters don't spoil ""Spore"" for everyone or get in the way of what she says is a revolutionary game. ""User-created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible,"" Bradshaw said. ""It also gives them a powerful emotional connection to the game, since they've created the world from scratch."" Miles Moffit, a gamer attending the University of Georgia who has created tons of ""clean"" characters on his own, is glad to know EA will be regulating what makes it into the game. Moffit is eagerly awaiting the game's September 7 release. And if by chance a Sporn character shows up in his virtual ""Spore"" world, he has a plan. ""My initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it wouldn't show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it,"" Moffit said. ""Go ahead, create a walking phallus. See how long it lasts in the databases and galaxies of 'Spore.' ""","Creature Creator allows gamers to design characters for new ""Spore"" game .

"ALTADENA, California (CNN)  -- When she was laid off in February, Patricia Guerrero was making $70,000 a year. Weeks later, with bills piling up and in need of food for her family, this middle-class mother did something she never thought she would do: She went to a food bank. Patricia Guerrero was laid off in February. Desperate to make ends meet, she recently went to a food bank. It was Good Friday, and a woman helping her offered to pay her utility bill. ""It brought tears to my eyes, and I sat there and I cried. I was like, 'This is really where I'm at?' "" she told CNN. ""I go 'no way;' [but] this is true. This is reality. This is the stuff you see on TV. It was hard. It was very hard."" Guerrero is estranged from her husband and raising her two young children. She's already burned through her savings to help make ends meet, and is drawing unemployment checks. She has had to take extreme measures to pay for her interest-only mortgage of $2,500 a month. In fact, her mother moved in with her to help pay the bills. Guerrero even applied for food stamps, but was denied.  Watch Guerrero describe going to food bank » . ""I never used the system.

Stories like Guerrero's are becoming more common as middle-class Americans feel the pinch of an economic downturn, rising gas prices and a housing crunch, especially in a state like California that has been rocked by foreclosures. On Wednesday, a key government report on the battered housing market found new home sales fell to their lowest level in 13 years in February, suggesting the nation's housing market is still struggling. Americans also have been attending in large numbers foreclosure fairs where mortgage lenders, financial planners and counselors offer tips to hard-hit homeowners. ""Our economy is struggling, and families in the 'Inland Empire' and across the nation are hurting,"" California Rep. Joe Baca said, referring to an area of Southern California in his district.

In the last 12 to 18 months, Brock said, the agencies he supplies have begun seeing more middle-class families coming to their doors. ""Our agencies have said there is an increasing number of people coming to them for help,"" Brock told CNN by phone. ""Their impression was that these were not people they normally would have seen before. They seemed to be better dressed. They seemed to have better cars and yet they seemed to be in crisis mode.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Murphy bounds up the stairs, down the stairs, over the hurdles, through the tunnel and stops. He cautiously sidesteps the large white ring in front of him and sits down. Betty Yadlosky tries to tease her Himalayan Persian named Tangerine with a feather. ""Through the ring! Come on, Murphy, through the ring!"" his owner encourages, as she enthusiastically jingles a feathered toy on the other side of the obstacle. Murphy glances over, clearly saying, ""There is no way I am jumping through that hoop."" And anyone watching -- anyone who has ever owned a cat -- knows he is right. ""It can be frustrating,"" Donna Hinton says from the sidelines of the agility course. ""But it's a challenge, a new dimension to showing."" Hinton is the owner of Kevi, one of the nation's top agility cats. Dressed to impress, Hinton looks more like a business executive than a cat fanatic -- but the breeder of Maine Coon cats has more than 20 years experience in pedigree showing. ""Some people like to go to the golf course on the weekend. I like to go to a cat show,"" she says with a smile. This time around, it was last weekend's Cat Fanciers' Association's International Cat Show, in Atlanta, Georgia -- touted as the Western Hemisphere's largest cat show, with 729 cats from 41 breeds and 14 countries. Elaborately decorated cages fill both sides and the back of the convention center floor. Vendors sell everything from cat hammocks to gutter guards (even the show manager isn't sure why gutter guards are there), and a man in a wig shows off his tightrope-walking cats. But arguably the most important activity takes place just past the garbage cans marked ""Dump litter here, please."" Judging . Bob Druzisky carries Zoe -- short for Mittsnpaws Zoe of Wyldephyre -- two-handed under her belly, stretching her out to her full length as they walk to one of the 12 judging rings. ""[We do this] to show her off to the crowd and to avoid handprints on her fur,"" he says. Zoe's judge wipes down his table with disinfectant and then picks up Zoe, staring into her eyes as her feet dangle four feet above the ground. He puts her down and proceeds to feel her coat and check her response time. At one point, she tries to escape from the table, but is nabbed by the quick-handed judge. The whole thing is over less than a minute later. Each cat is judged by six judges throughout the weekend, show manager Emily Turner says. The cats are split into three groups: kittens (less than 8 months), champions (adult cats), and premiers (adult neutered/spayed cats). These categories are broken down again by breed, color and sex. On Sunday morning, judges tally up the points and select the top two cats from each category. A panel then picks the best in show. ""That's it in a nutshell,"" Turner says. Of course, it's slightly more complicated. Each judge must train for six years. They must know the standards for each breed -- written descriptions of the ""ideal"" cat -- and be able to tell which Siamese has the perfect ear width or which red cat has the best color. Time and money . The ideal breed standard is impossible to reach, Turner says, but owners spend hundreds of hours, and dollars, trying. That's most evident when an announcement comes over the loudspeaker for a DNA ""blue-eyed"" breeding seminar, starting in one hour. Druzisky and his wife, Jennifer, attend approximately 30 cat shows each year. The couple arrived in Atlanta with Zoe and Angel on Thursday night after a 12-hour drive from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Between gas, hotel rooms, entrance fees and cat supplies, Druzisky estimates the shows cost him between a couple hundred and $1,000 per month. Of course, showing cats is a lot cheaper than showing horses -- as Betty Yadlosky is quick to point out. She and her husband Bill showed horses for many years before switching to Himalayan Persians. The couple has 11 Persians, all of which need regular baths if they're showing. Each bath takes Betty Yadlosky an hour and a half to two hours, including a blow dry. So how much time does the average owner spend grooming their cats? ""Just depends on how many you have and how well you take care of them,"" she says. ""You've got to keep them healthy and happy."" For the love of it . Back in the ring, Kevi is running Hinton ragged. He zooms through the other obstacles, only to stop short at the blue weave bars. Once, twice, three times he stops, before Hinton sighs, wiping her forehead with her arm. ""I think we're tired,"" she says. ""Bored, not tired,"" agility instructor Carol Osbourne calls out to Hinton. ""[Kevi] could do this all night. Keep your body ahead [of the cat] and make a wide sweep with your arm."" Hinton goes to scoop up Kevi, only to miss the rascal by inches. This starts a game of chase that ends with Kevi in a red carrier and Hinton laughing. Putting on a show this large takes more than a year, and it's scenes like this one that convince Turner her hard work is worth it. She says most of the people who come to shows are there simply because they love animals. ""There's the best of all things,"" she says, speaking loudly over the call for Tokinese cats in ring three. ""At night, when you go home you have this warm, fuzzy, cuddly animal that adores you and you adore him or her. I mean, how could you ask for anything better?""","Cat Fanciers' Association holds International Cat Show in Atlanta, Georgia .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge has stayed what would be the nation's first military execution since 1961, saying the U.S. soldier -- who was convicted of rape and murder two decades ago -- should have more time to pursue a federal appeal. Pvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, since 1988. A court-martial panel sitting at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, unanimously convicted him of committing two murders and other crimes in the Fayetteville, North Carolina, area and sentenced him to death. Last month, the Army said Gray was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection December 10 at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. But in an order issued November 26, U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers of Kansas said that a stay is necessary so Gray can pursue his federal appeal. Rogers ruled on a motion filed by Gray's attorneys, who asked for time to challenge the legality of his convictions and sentence. Government attorneys have asked Rogers to reconsider his decision, saying that Gray seeks a stay ""apparently based on the premise that at some point he will identify a new legal issue or discover new evidence"" upon which to appeal and that Gray ""continues to delay unnecessarily."" Gray has had ample time to appeal, the Justice Department attorneys said. In a response filed Tuesday, Gray's defense attorneys point out that the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal in March 2001, and ""since then, it has taken the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice and the Office of the President over seven years to approve as final Private Gray's sentence of death. The significant constitutional issues presented on the face of Private Gray's case ... have obviously troubled the decision-makers, as evidenced by the years they had his case under advisement."" President Bush approved Gray's death sentence in July, making it final, defense attorneys write in the filing. Inmates sentenced to death in state and federal courts are given a year to file federal appeals after their death sentence becomes final, they claim, and members of the military under death sentences should receive the same consideration. ""Private Gray is seeking federal habeas court review for the first time and he has not delayed commencing this action,"" defense attorney Thomas Bath wrote. ""In fact, until the president approved his death sentence, there was no action available."" Gray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg. He also was convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at the post. Military and civilian courts both found Gray responsible for the crimes, which were committed between April 1986 and January 1987. Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms. The general court-martial at Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders, an attempted murder and three rapes. Bush's July action, the Army said in a statement at the time, followed ""completion of a full appellate process, which upheld the conviction and sentence to death."" Members of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history, but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the Uniform Code of Military justice, the military's modern-day legal system. The Army has also sought Bush's authorization to execute another condemned soldier, Pvt. Dwight Loving, who was convicted of killing and robbing two cab drivers in 1988. The last U.S. military execution was in 1961, when Army Pvt. John Bennett was hanged for raping and attempting to kill an 11-year-old Austrian girl. Bennett was sentenced in 1955. The U.S. military hasn't actively pursued an execution for a military prisoner since President Kennedy commuted a death sentence in 1962. Nine men are currently on military death row.

"(CNN) -- Somalia's transitional president has resigned amid a power struggle with the African nation's prime minister and parliament, sources told CNN on Monday. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed tried to fire his PM this month but later lost a confidence vote. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed announced his resignation Monday before parliament in Baidoa. Ahmed's resignation is the latest turn in the political crisis in Somalia, which is already struggling with an Islamist revolt, a refugee crisis and rampant lawlessness that has fueled a wave of piracy off the Horn of Africa. Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991. The U.N.-backed transitional government has the support of Ethiopian troops that ousted an Islamist government at the end of 2006, but it controls little of the country outside the southwestern city of Baidoa. Ahmed attempted to fire his prime minister, Nur Hassan Hussein, earlier this month for being ineffective. But Hussein said the president did not have the power to fire him, and the vast majority of members of parliament backed Hussein in a vote of confidence. Kenya -- a major player in international efforts to stabilize Somalia -- warned that the government crisis endangered peace efforts and singled out Ahmed over his attempt to sack Hassan.","Somalia's transitional president resigns amid power struggle with PM, parliament .

"Kathryn Kolbert is president of People for the American Way, a nonprofit advocacy group that supports equality and freedom of speech and religion. An attorney who has been recognized as one of the most influential lawyers in America, she appeared frequently before the U.S. Supreme Court from 1986-1997, arguing in favor of retaining a legal right to abortion. Before joining People for the American Way, she was executive producer of Justice Talking, a radio show about law and American life and senior research administrator with the Annenberg Public Policy Center. Kathryn Kolbert says Rick Warren's selection upset activists who supported Barack Obama . (CNN) -- The announcement that Pastor Rick Warren has been chosen to give the invocation at Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony landed with a thud in my inbox. Many people who know Warren as the affable megachurch pastor and best-selling author may be confused about the anger and disappointment that his selection has generated among progressive activists who worked so hard to help elect Obama. Here's my explanation; you can find plenty of other voices online. Warren enjoys a reputation as a bridge-building moderate based on his informal style and his church's engagement on issues like AIDS in Africa. He took grief from some of his Religious Right colleagues when he invited then-Senator Obama to his church for a conference on AIDS a couple of years ago. And, in August he hosted presidential candidates Obama and McCain at his church. Warren has worked hard to cultivate a moderate public personality but his views are very similar to those of traditional Religious Right leaders.In an email sent before the 2004 election he wrote a Falwell-esque message proclaiming that, for Christian voters, the issues of abortion, marriage for same-sex couples, stem cell research, cloning and euthanasia were ""non-negotiable."" In fact, he said, they are ""not even debatable because God's word is clear on these issues."" And while some Religious Right leaders were nervous that Warren would give Obama a platform to talk about poverty and the environment at the August event, Warren thrilled them by eschewing those issues entirely in order to emphasize issues like abortion and marriage that worked to McCain's advantage with the evangelical audience. iReport.com: Your thoughts on Rick Warren . Warren also campaigned for Proposition 8, the initiative that stripped same-sex couples in California of their right under the state constitution to get legally married. But it's not just his support for Prop. 8 that is so galling to equality activists. It's that Warren, in an interview with Beliefnet.com, has since equated allowing loving same-sex couples to get married with redefining marriage to permit incest and pedophilia. And he has repeated one of the Religious Right's big lies: that somehow allowing marriage equality to stand would have threatened the freedom of preachers like him to say what they thought about homosexuality. That's not remotely true, but it's a standard tool of Religious Right leaders trying to resist the public's increasing support for equality. In other words, Warren has been divisive and dishonest on the issues of marriage equality and religious freedom -- and on other issues important to many Obama supporters, as well. He adamantly opposes a woman's legal right to abortion and dismisses common-ground efforts to reduce the need for abortion by comparing them to accommodating the Holocaust. He is disrespectful of progressive people of faith, suggesting that they are tools of the Democratic Party or more Marxist than Christian. So much for the values of unity and respect, not to mention the constitutional principle of equality, on which President-elect Obama campaigned. Why exactly is he being given the high honor of delivering the invocation at one of the most historic ceremonies in American history? There is no shortage of religious leaders who reflect the values on which President-elect Obama campaigned and who are working to advance the common good. Rev. Joseph Lowery, who has been selected to give the benediction, is a lifelong advocate for justice. There are others like him, and in our increasingly diverse nation, they aren't all Christian. Rick Warren gets plenty of attention through his books and media appearances and has every right to promote his religious views. But he doesn't need or deserve a position of honor at the inauguration of a president who has given hope to so many Americans by rejecting the politics of division and emphasizing his commitment to constitutional values. I am still excited about the tremendous changes in policy that I expect under an Obama administration. But it's the job of progressive advocates to hold public officials accountable, and to speak up even when our friends drop the ball. This decision, which will leave a bad taste in the mouths of many passionate supporters of Barack Obama, is one of those times. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathryn Kolbert.","Kathryn Kolbert: Rick Warren has image of a moderate religious leader .

"(CNN) -- A new national poll suggests Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich could be on the top of Santa's naughty list. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich tops new CNN poll of which politician has been the naughtiest of 2008. Fifty-six percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday said Blagojevich, who has been arrested on corruption charges, was the naughtiest politician in 2008. Blagojevich, accused of attempting to sell President-elect Barack Obama's former Senate seat, has said he has done nothing wrong and plans to fight the allegations. The poll also found 23 percent believed former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer should get the nod, followed by 19 percent for former presidential candidate John Edwards. Spitzer resigned in March after it was revealed he was Client No. 9 in a high-end prostitution ring. In November, prosecutors announced they would not be bringing criminal charges against Spitzer. Edwards, who had been considered a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, admitted in August to having an extramarital affair with former campaign staffer Rielle Hunter. The former North Carolina senator also denied he was the father of Hunter's then-newborn baby. CNN polling director Keating Holland said while Blagojevich's top spot in the survey may be due to his arrest occurring more recently than the transgressions of the others, there may be another reason. iReport.com: Do you trust your political leaders? ""Americans typically take a much dimmer view of corruption than of sex scandals, since the former is a violation of the public trust and the latter is usually considered more of a private matter,"" he said.","CNN poll: Rod Blagojevich was the naughtiest politician in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- No budget for a new computer in this recession? It's a common malady these days. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. But this doesn't mean you have to suffer along with substandard performance from your system just because it's got more dust on its cover and less hard drive space than that shiny floor model you've been drooling over at the local Fry's. Will an '09 Ford Escort outpace a '67 Mustang in a drag race? If the Mustang's been neglected and allowed to rust away in the back yard for the past decade, then...probably. If it's been babied and protected from the elements, then it's not even a fair contest. Like any machine, a well-maintained car or computer will surprise you, no matter its age. In our modern consumer culture, it's not surprising that many people are under the impression that newer always means better. Yesterday's top-shelf computer is as disposable as a Taco Bell spork, and what cost $3,000 four years ago is now surpassed by technology that didn't even exist -- for any price then -- for a comparable pittance. We're conditioned to kowtow to the expectations of obsolescence. Why settle for less, manufacturers will ask coyly, when we could have so much more -- interest-free for six months if we just sign up today? I'm here to tell you that even if you don't have the riches to get your dream setup today, you don't have to settle for less than what yesterday's perfect computer can offer. Here's a list of things that could help keep you and your machine playing nicely together for a while until you can save up enough pennies for tomorrow's offerings. It may be your software that's slow -- not your computer. Check for driver and version updates either at your computer manufacturer's Web site or through the list of software you use frequently; see if new drivers or versions are available. If you've been using the same programs for a year or two, it's likely that such updates are available, and those updates could result in noticeable performance improvement. The future of the desktop is on the Web, where there's little (if anything) for you to install to (and slow down) your system. For this reason, I recommend moving as many of your activities to the Web as possible. Many of today's Web sites are built with rich JavaScript frameworks, which enable amazing in-browser experiences for everybody. If you can, begin accessing and managing your email from the Web rather than the desktop. If you use more than one computer on a regular basis, this is likely what you're doing anyway. A lot of people I know swear by Google's Gmail (especially for its pretty good spam-filtering capabilities), but you have many options -- and most of them are free. At the risk of seeming Google-centric, I have to point out that it's even possible to manage basic documents and spreadsheets online -- once proprietary to bloated Microsoft Office products -- for free with Google Docs. And sharing the data from these applications for collaboration with friends and coworkers has never been easier. If you're still using Internet Explorer, stop! Please, stop. It's not fast -- not by today's standards. You're better off with a newer build of Firefox or possibly Google Chrome or Safari (my personal favorite). External hard drives are a good way of keeping transient data off your computer's core hard drive, which should give your operating system some extra room to do its job more efficiently. Another option takes us back to the Web -- you can often get an online backup plan that will remove your valuable data not only from that main hard drive, but also from your computer's immediate vicinity. If a calamity (whether human-created or, as insurance companies like to say, an ""act of God"") befalls your household, your data will be safe in a sanctuary far, far away and not melted on that physical, external hard drive next to that poor old computer we've been trying to save! Instead of downloading music and storing it indefinitely, consider paying for a music/content subscription service instead. There'll be less data bogging down your computer, less stuff for you to manage, and you'll have access to so much more content. Comparably minor hardware upgrades like more RAM or better video cards will likely make a major difference in your old system's performance. A second monitor is one way I've found of, if not making my computer more productive, at least making my interaction with the computer more productive. Doubling your screen real estate is a great way of getting the most out of the information that your computer's giving you without having to switch back and forth between pages on a smaller, single-screen setup. Make sure your video card supports this option; if not, there are USB converters that might help overcome this obstacle. See? Your old computer, treated with care and respect, can still make that pan-global road trip on the Information Superhighway. It just needs a careful hand on the wheel and a steady toe on the pedal to maximize its potential: That New Computer Smell on an Old Wallet Budget.","Here's how to squeeze the most performance out of your older computer .

"Editor's note: You can follow the Bilsons' progress on CNN American Morning 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. through February 4. Mary Bilson tries to contain her autistic daughter Marissa's tantrum, as Marissa's brother Brendan looks on. Seal Beach, CALIFORNIA (CNN) -- The Bilson family is like many other families: three kids, a cat, and a small, lovely home with lots of family photos and carved wooden wall signs with sayings like ""Live, Laugh, Love."" But step inside their house after 4 p.m. most weekdays and you'll want to cover your ears because of the noise -- the screaming, to be exact. These are not the shouts of sibling rivalry or parental annoyance. This is the high-pitched, ear-shattering sound of a 13-year-old girl. More accurately, it is the sound of a frustrated, irritated, very loud teenager with autism. Marissa, the middle Bilson child, was diagnosed with autism when she was a toddler. Her mother, Mary, a nurse, knew something wasn't right early on, when young Marissa's tantrums were off the charts and seemingly unwarranted. But during the first few years, doctors told Mary Bilson that her daughter was fine and this behavior would eventually pass. They were wrong on both counts. Marissa's behavior has not passed; it has, in fact, become worse. According to Bilson, Marissa and her tantrums rule the household. ""I don't want to hear her screaming and tantruming, so we pretty much let her do what she wants,"" Bilson says. ""We"" means Mary, her husband, John, and their two other children, Brittany, 15, and 6-year-old Brendan. Keeping the peace means that, when it comes to Marissa, the rules are different. She is allowed unlimited time on the one family computer. She is allowed access to her siblings' rooms and possessions. She is allowed to eat dinner at the computer instead of the family table.  Watch part one of the Bilsons' journey » . But before you sit in judgment of the Bilsons, and suggest they just need a firm hand to keep their middle child in line, consider one thing: They are trying to cope with a child with severely impaired social sensibilities. ""Do you think people who don't have children with autism know how tough it is to deal with them?"" CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, asked Marissa's mom in a recent interview. ""No,"" Mary Bilson replied. ""And I don't see how they could."" She's right -- we can't, because many of us have never seen autism in action, day in and day out.  Learn more about autism » . Autism is described on the National Institutes of Health Web site as a ""developmental disorder that appears in the first three years of life, and affects the brain's normal development of social and communication skills."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, autism and related disorders affect about one out of every 150 babies born each year. Autism manifests itself in many different ways. Although there are some common threads, like language issues, repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others, specific behavioral patterns are largely unique to the individual. ""Children with autism are all different; they are like snowflakes,"" explains Dr. Ronald Leaf, co-director of the group Autism Partnership. The one thing that Leaf believes they all have in common is that ""they are not expected to do enough."" Leaf insists we have set the bar too low for what we think children and adults with autism can do. ""They are highly teachable,"" he says. ""You just have to have a good teacher."" A good teacher is exactly what Bilson was looking for to help her with Marissa. The family had already tried various programs, starting when Marissa was a toddler -- but nothing completely worked for her. And as Marissa entered her teen years, her behavior grew worse. Mary knew that her daughter needed to be reined in, and it needed to be done now. ""She is getting older. She's 13 and her tantrums are louder and longer than they used to be. It's just so inappropriate. It was OK when she was much younger, but now that she's going to be an adult soon, she can't be behaving this way,"" Bilson says with tired resignation. But what could the Bilsons do? This family doesn't have a lot of extra money, and most programs either aren't covered by insurance or have long waiting lists. The costs are staggering, according to the Web site FightingAutism.org. Families with autistic children can expect to spend $30,000 annually to provide proper medical, educational and other assistance necessary for dealing with an autistic child.  Watch part two of the Bilsons' journey » . Enter Autism Partnership, or AP. This group, founded in 1994, offers extensive therapeutic services to children and adults with the disorder. One of its most unique programs is an intensive one-on-one, at-home intervention service that is similar in scope to what happens on the television show ""Nanny 911."" It's not cheap -- about $2,500 per day, typically for a five-day period (with additional days on an ""as needed"" basis). Most of AP's work is grounded in a behavior modification technique known as Applied Behavioral Analysis or ABA. Essentially, the method breaks down behavior patterns, rewarding proper behavior while being careful not to encourage improper responses. And that is exactly how AP therapist Rick Schroeder hopes to reshape Marissa Bilson's worst behavior. The group, which met Marissa while working in her school, offered the Bilson family a free week-long intervention with the proviso that CNN be allowed to record the process. The week started off with a day of observation -- a day with lots and lots of screaming and tantrums, that left Schroeder stunned.  He had observed Marissa at school where, he says, she was much less demonstrative. But Schroeder is still eager and ready to tackle the challenge. ""I think the family is starting to realize something needs to change, and that's very good,"" he says after his day of observation. ""As far as Marissa's behavior goes -- and the level that she is capable of going to -- she's pretty much out of control, for sure.""","CDC: Autism and related disorders affect one out of every 150 children .

"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- Three Americans rescued last week from captivity in the Colombian jungle will return to their homes Saturday, the U.S. Army South said. Left to right, Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves and Thomas Howes talk about spending more than 5 years as hostages. Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell have been undergoing a reintegration process at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, since their return 10 days ago to the United States. The men were among 15 hostages, including former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who were rescued July 2 in a Colombian military operation. The men carried with them a metal lock, a bullet and a chess board made of cardboard -- small items that are reminders of the years they spent away from their families, cut off from the world outside the jungle, seeing only fellow hostages and their captors, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The group had held the three U.S. government contractors hostage since February 2003, after their plane crashed in a remote region of the South American country. ""They don't recognize humanity, they don't recognize human rights. They're animals. They're terrorists,"" Stansell said of the FARC. ""We don't want to exaggerate what happened. We just want to tell the truth."" The men painted a gruesome picture of their captivity, describing months in which they were ordered not to speak to each other and an initial campsite where they lived with a rat's nest above them. They slept on the floors of drug labs and were forced to march for hours while chained. Chains were very much a part of their captivity. ""That was put around my neck every night,"" Stansell told Headline News' Robin Meade on Thursday, holding a heavy industrial lock. ""This lock, with 5 meters of chain -- thick, 1-inch links -- went to his neck,"" Stansell said, pointing at Gonsalves. ""We slept like that,"" he said.  Watch how the rescue surprised the hostages » . Gonsalves also held small wooden chess pawns he had carved using a broken piece of a machete. It took three months to make them, he said.  Watch Gonsalves talk about how chess made him feel free » . ""We're in chains, sitting Indian-style on a piece of plastic, just playing chess,"" Stansell said. ""And when you're doing that, you're free."" Howes, the most reticent of the three, carried with him a bullet from a commander who had once threatened to kill him. But despite the chains, the intolerable living conditions and the isolation, being away from their families was possibly the most difficult hardship to endure, the men said. ""I remember my darkest day was in the first month of our captivity,"" Gonsalves said. ""We were, at that point, locked in boxes at night. ... That night, I dreamt about my daughter, who was my little girl and still is. And I had this dream about her that was so real; she was sitting on my lap, and ... she had little braids in her hair,"" he said.  Watch Gonsalves talk about his darkest hour » . ""It was a wonderful dream, with all of my family. But the problem was, I woke up."" Colombian government agents infiltrated the FARC leadership over several months, eventually tricking the rebels into moving the hostages by saying a humanitarian group wanted to check on them. A helicopter carrying fake rebels picked up the hostages at a rendezvous point on July 2, ostensibly to take them to another rebel camp. But it was actually a Colombian military helicopter and the hostages were flown away, free, without a shot being fired. Read about the daring rescue mission . The FARC, which has been fighting with the Colombian government and other paramilitary groups for decades, defends the taking of captives as a legitimate act of war. The group is thought to be holding about 750 prisoners in the nation's remote jungles. Along with the former contractors, French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt was also freed from FARC. She was abducted by the rebels in 2002 during her campaign for Colombia's presidency. She told CNN's Larry King on Wednesday that her time as a hostage was ""hell."" Stansell, who was captured while his girlfriend was pregnant with twins, said he believed for a while that one had died. A guard told Stansell he saw a photograph of the girlfriend with only one son, he said, although the guard did not produce the photograph. Then, one day on the radio, he heard ""two little guys ... sending me messages."" On Sundays, Caracol Radio airs a program called ""Voices of Captivity,"" a lifeline for FARC hostages as the program often plays messages from the family members of the hostages. ""This is just a deep breath of happiness,"" Stansell said of his sons.  Watch the full interview - Part 1; »  Watch the full interview - Part 2 » . The radio was also how Stansell's girlfriend accepted his marriage proposal, which he had smuggled out with a hostage who had been released, he said. She also accepted in person after his rescue, he said. ""And I looked at [her] and I said, 'This is a go, right?' She said, 'That's it. This is our family,' "" he recalled. He said when he saw his sons for the first time, it was as though he had known them since birth. ""I opened the door. ... I hear, 'Papa, Papa, Papa,"" he said. ""And they just hit me; it was like I had never even been gone."" Captivity also separated Howes from his wife and two sons. ""Before this [I] was a guy that was kind of a typical American guy that was working, busy working, running through a life full-speed,"" he said. ""I had a little boy when we crashed that was 5 years old, another one 15. Had a wife who was back in the States; we just got a house. I had 12 nights in the house of my dreams in the States,"" he said. ""And suddenly, we drop off the face of the Earth."" He said, ""When you're in our situation, we realize what's important. We know. The three of us know better than any of you guys out there, it's the family. And I'd like everyone to listen very closely to that.""","Former FARC captives talk to CNN a week after they were freed .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- What recession? Christie's, the famed auction house, this week sold a nearly 36-carat diamond for $24.3 million, which it said was the highest price for a diamond sold at auction. The 35.56-carat diamond dates back to the 17th century. The previous record was a mere $16.5 million for a 100-carat diamond in 1995, Christie's said. ""In the midst of these challenging times, we were thrilled to achieve an historic price for an historic diamond,"" said Francois Curiel, chairman of Christie's Europe and auctioneer for Wednesday's sale. The 35.56-carat Wittelsbach blue diamond, dating to the 17th century, was purchased by international jeweler Laurence Graff, the auction house said in a release. Graff was bidding against Aleks Paul of Essex Global Trading, a professional of Russian origin based in New York, Christie's said. ""Known as 'Der Blaue Wittelsbacher' since 1722, it is one of very few diamonds which can claim 17th century heritage, incredible rarity and exceptional beauty."" The diamond, mined in India nearly 400 years ago, has been privately owned since 1964. Until 1723, Christie's said, all diamonds worn by European royalty came from India. The diamond has a royal lineage. Christie's traces it thus: King Philip IV of Spain (1605-1665) selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter, the Infanta Margarita Teresa (1651-1673). She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria (1640-1705), who later became Holy Roman Emperor. When she died in 1673, her husband retained the diamond, which was passed on to his heirs. In 1722, the diamond entered the Wittelsbach family when the Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria (1701-1756) married the Bavarian Crown Prince, Charles Albert (1697-1745). It was worn by successive rulers until the abdication of King Ludwig III (1845-1921) in 1918. The world's largest deep blue diamond is the ""Hope Diamond,"" a 45.52-carat stone housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Diamonds apparently are recession-proof. Christie's reported jewelry sales of $226 million for the first half of 2008, calling it ""the best jewelry season ever seen at auction."" Sales for the first six months of this year marked a 32 percent increase over the same period in 2007, Christie's said. According to Christie's, key diamonds the company sold in the first half of 2008 included a 13.39-carat fancy intense blue diamond that fetched $8.9 million in Geneva on May 14 and the pear-shaped potentially flawless 38-carat Onassis diamond, which sold for $7.1 million on June 11 in London.","Christie's sells nearly 36-carat diamond for $24.3 million .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Two of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s children are suing their brother, accusing him of wrongfully taking money from their parents' estates. Dexter King, left, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III attend a 2006 tribute for their late mother. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III allege that Dexter King took ""substantial funds"" out of Coretta Scott King's estate and ""wrongfully appropriated"" money from their father's estate. The suit, filed Thursday in Fulton County Superior Court, serves as a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. In a written statement Friday, Dexter King called the suit ""inappropriate and false."" ""I'm disappointed that our personal family disagreement, as it relates to the family business, has evolved into being handled in a public legal forum,"" he said. ""It is my hope that this inappropriate and false claim by my siblings will be swiftly resolved and we can go about the business of focusing on our parents' tremendous legacy."" The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead garbage workers on a protest march. King's wife, Coretta Scott King, also devoted her life to the civil rights movement, died in 2006. Attorneys for Bernice King and Martin Luther King III would not say Friday how much money they are accusing Dexter King of taking from their mother's estate. Bernice King is the administrator of that estate. Dexter King, the suit says, controls their father's estate, which is registered as a Georgia corporation. All three children are shareholders in that corporation. The lawsuit names Dexter King and the corporation as defendants. It alleges that last month, the defendants ""converted substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America for their own use."" Harmon Caldwell, an Atlanta attorney representing the plaintiffs, said Dexter King is a signatory on the account, but ""was not authorized to transfer the funds,"" and gave his sister ""no notice that those funds were being transferred."" The suit says that as a result of the transfer, ""plaintiffs have and will suffer financial loss."" The lawsuit lists Bernice King as a plaintiff both individually and as administrator of their mother's estate. Separately, the suit says Dexter King ""has wrongfully appropriated assets belonging to the [estate of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.] or its shareholders for his own benefit."" Caldwell said Dexter King has refused to say what has happened with some of the corporation's money. ""I can't tell you that he's gone out and used corporate assets for his own living expenses,"" the attorney said. ""What I can tell you for certainty is that by not providing Martin and Bernice with information about how the corporation is using its assets, he is essentially using those assets, appropriating those assets for his own benefit."" The plaintiffs' attorneys would not estimate the size of either estate. But one, Jock Smith, noted that a collection of King's manuscripts and other items was sold in 2006 for a reported $32 million. ""I don't think it was a substantial corporation of any sort before that,"" Smith said. Over the years, the family of the civil rights leader has zealously protected its financial interests, at times taking legal steps even against the media for showing some of King's most famous speeches. In 2005, some news agencies reported on the King Center, a nonprofit, having put millions of dollars into a for-profit business run by Dexter King. The family rejected allegations of wrongdoing, and has generally pushed to keep financial matters private. Smith said his clients made repeated efforts to reach out to their brother in recent weeks before deciding to take legal action. Smith agreed with the suggestion that it was emotionally tough for the King children to file the suit. ""That would be the understatement of the year, Smith said.","Bernice King, Martin Luther King III name Dexter King, father's estate as defendants .

"ALLENTOWN, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- A federal court Thursday struck down ordinances passed by Hazleton, Pennsylvania, that were intended to limit where illegal immigrants could live and work. Last year, Hazleton passed the Illegal Immigration Relief Act Ordinance, which would have fined landlords who rented to undocumented immigrants and would have penalized companies that employed them. Under another law, tenants would have had to prove they were citizens or lawful residents, register with the city and pay for a rental permit in order to receive an occupancy permit. The ordinances were copied by other cities. The court ruled that Hazleton cannot enact any ordinances dealing with illegal immigration because they conflict with the supremacy clause of the U.S. constitution. ""Hazleton, in its zeal to control the presence of a group deemed undesirable, violated the rights of such people, as well as others within the community. Since the United States Constitution protects even the disfavored, the ordinances cannot be enforced,"" U.S. District Judge James M. Munley wrote in the 206-page opinion. Mayor Lou Barletta, who spearheaded the opposition, said he will appeal the ruling. ""This fight is far from over,"" he told reporters outside the courtroom. ""Hazleton is not going to back down. ... We will take it all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.""  Watch mayor decry ""injustice"" » . Barletta drafted the act last year after ""a high-profile murder, the discharge of a gun at a crowded city playground, and drug busts"" allegedly involving illegal immigrants, he wrote on his Web site, www.smalltowndefenders.com. ""Illegal aliens in our city create an economic burden that threatens our quality of life,"" he wrote. ""With a growing problem and a limited budget, I could not sit back any longer and allow this to happen. I needed to act!"" Hazleton's population was 23,000 in 2000. Since then, it has risen to an estimated 30,000 to 33,000, with many of the newcomers being Mexican immigrants, according to Munley. The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania was among several groups that filed the suit on behalf of Hazleton residents, landlords and business owners. The groups contended that only the federal government has the right to regulate immigration or to deprive residents of the rights to equal protection. In addition, they said, the ordinances violated state and federal housing laws. The ordinances, Munley said, ""penalize landlords, tenants, employers and employees without providing them the procedural protections required by federal law, including notice and an opportunity to be heard."" ""Our analysis applies to illegal aliens as well as to legal residents and citizens. The United States Constitution provides due process protections to all persons,"" he wrote, emphasizing ""all."" The city exceeded its police powers by enacting unconstitutional ordinances, wrote Munley, whom President Clinton appointed to the federal bench in 1998. Barletta said he would ""continue to fight for the people of this community and other cities around the country."" ""It's almost amusing to me that the judge would say we can't do what the federal government should be doing, when in fact the federal government is not doing their job,"" he told CNN's Lou Dobbs. A spokesman for the ACLU of Pennsylvania expressed satisfaction with the ruling. ""Hazleton-type laws are designed to make life miserable for millions of immigrants,"" said Vic Walczak, legal director for the group and a lead attorney in the case. ""They promote distrust of all foreigners, including those here legally, and fuel xenophobia and discrimination, especially against Latinos."" Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, added, ""Political leaders, like Mayor Barletta, must stop scape-goating undocumented immigrants for all the problems we confront in our local communities.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- One of the best gifts you can give a child this holiday season may not be the latest gadget, toy, or tasty treat, but instead the gift of a healthy lifestyle. Participants get a workout at the FitWit fitness boot camp. An Atlanta-based non-profit organization is doing its part to combat childhood obesity by teaching kids proper nutrition and exercise in a six-week fitness boot camp similar to NBC's ""The Biggest Loser."" The FitWit Foundation hopes its program will catch on nationwide. ""We wanted to work with teens in a meaningful way, and we saw firsthand how fitness and physical activity in general is being neglected in this population. With a lot of help from volunteers and donors, we've started a program this past spring that encourages hard work and is a fun way to get in shape,"" said FitWit instructor Ben Thoele. FitWit's program is a six-week after-school boot camp competition which rewards participants with prizes for meeting fitness goals. An iPod Nano was the grand prize for Atlanta Public Schools students completing a recent fitness session.  Watch for more on FitWit » . Students who are motivated to get in shape but not involved in an organized sports team are selected as contestants. Participants' fitness levels are assessed at the beginning and end of the program. Each week, volunteers lead three 60-minute sessions that include fitness instruction and physical health education. In addition, the participants are assigned two home workouts to be performed between sessions. ""After six weeks, all participants have an increased total fitness ability. We averaged over 40 percent improvement in total fitness in our first program last spring. It's common to have a participant double their fitness ability,"" Thoele said. ""A lot of these kids don't know how to work out, or that they even have the capacity to work out. They gain an appreciation for pushing their limits, and when that happens, we see a tremendous boost in their self-confidence,"" he said. The need for increased fitness across the country is striking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 17.6 percent of U.S. teenagers were obese in 2006 -- more than triple the rate in 1980.  Obesity puts the teens at increased risk for heart disease, bone and joint problems, sleep apnea, and social and psychological problems, the CDC says. ""Success for us is when a kid is thinking about fitness outside of the program, because they enjoy how they feel when they're in better shape,"" Thoele said. ""Our first winner, Raquel, told us that she continued to come because she just felt better. She had incredible numbers as well. She was not able to perform even one sit-up at the start of the program and did 21 in our final assessments. She also shed more than 90 seconds off her mile time."" ""Since I've been here, I've been eating healthy,"" one FitWit participant said. ""I have been watching what I eat and drink. I drink three cups of water every day. And I exercise more often. I don't spend too much time inside my home anymore.""","FitWit's program is a six-week after-school boot camp competition .

"(CNN) -- An Austrian man who participated in a Nazi massacre of Jews during World War II and later gained U.S. citizenship has been deported to Austria, U.S. officials said. The Sachsenhausen concentration camp just north of Berlin where the U.S. says Krumpf worked as an SS guard. Josias Krumpf, 83, lived for years after the war in Racine, Wisconsin. The United States revoked his citizenship in 2005 after the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice sought to denaturalize him. Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita Glavin announced Krumpf's deportation Thursday. It was not clear when he arrived in Austria, and representatives of the Austrian Justice Ministry were not immediately available for comment. ""His court-ordered removal from the United States to Austria is another milestone in the government's long-running effort to ensure that individuals who participated in crimes against humanity do not find sanctuary in this country,"" Glavin said. The United States removed Krumpf because of his participation in that and other Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution during the war, Glavin said. Krumpf admits standing watch on November 3, 1943, as SS guards at the Trawniki Labor Camp in Poland shot and killed 8,000 Jews, including women and 400 children, in pits. Glavin said Krumpf said he had orders to shoot any prisoners who survived. Krumpf also served as an SS guard at the Nazi-run Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp in Germany and at slave labor sites in Nazi-occupied France, where prisoners under his watch built launching platforms for German missile attacks on England, Glavin said. The November 1943 shooting was part of a larger Nazi operation called ""Aktion Erntefest,"" or ""Operation Harvest Festival,"" that led to the deaths of 42,000 Jews at three camps in eastern Poland in two days, the Justice Department said. At Trawniki, Krumpf said, he was assigned to watch for victims who were still ""halfway alive"" or ""convulsing"" and prevent their escape by shooting them to death, the Justice Department said. Krumpf, who was born in Serbia, immigrated to the United States in 1956 and became a U.S. citizen in 1964. His removal to Austria is part of an effort by several U.S. government departments and law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute participants in Nazi crimes of persecution who live in the United States, the Justice Department said. The Criminal Division's Office of Special Investigations (OSI) started the operation in 1979 and has since won cases against 107 alleged Nazi criminals, the Justice Department said. The OSI also has a watch list for World War II war criminals that has prevented the entry of more than 180 people into the United States, the Justice Department said.","Josias Krumpf lived for years in Wisconsin before being deported to Austria .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- More than 11,500 public servants have been suspended or fined for corruption during the past two years, the Mexican government said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, at right, spoke at the National Public Security Session last month. ""We have made an important effort to oversee the good use of public funds,"" said President Felipe Calderon on Tuesday. ""We have broken up networks of corruption in Pemex [the state-owned oil company], ... in customs or in areas linked to construction of public works."" Some 40 agents of the attorney general and of the secretary of security also are under investigation for presumed ties to drug cartels. Some are accused of receiving money from the narcotraffickers in exchange for information. Among them is the nation's former anti-drug czar, Noe Ramirez, who is accused of receiving $500,000 per month for passing information to the Pacific Cartel. Although organized crime has penetrated state institutions charged with fighting crime, Calderon said he had a program intended to work on that.  Watch what Mexico is grappling with » . ""With Operation Cleanup, we will continue acting against police, agents, public ministers or any servant implicated in corruption who may have crossed over the line to crime."" The problem extends beyond bureaucracy. A poll by the organization International Transparency shows that Mexico is one of the emerging countries where businesses are more open to paying bribes. In all, 38 percent of Mexican businesses surveyed said they tended to use relationships with friends or relatives to obtain public contracts, and 32 percent said they had bribed politicians and government workers. ""Clearly, this lends itself to corruption,"" said Jose Claudio Trevino, a senior manager with Ernst & Young in Mexico. Corruption is rampant in the private sector, particularly in deals that involve buying or selling, he said. According to official studies, more than 100 million acts of corruption are committed in the country each year, and the typical family spends the equivalent of 25 percent of its income on bribes.","International Transparency poll: Businesses in Mexico more open to paying bribes .

"(CNN)  -- The former Utah state trooper suspected in a series of roadway shootings earlier this week died Wednesday, the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office said. CNN affiliate KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah, provided this file photo of the Dallas suspect, Brian Smith. Police said Tuesday that Brian Smith attempted suicide after Monday's shootings. Smith was brought to a local hospital in serious condition, officials said . At 7 p.m. Wednesday Smith died at Parkland Hospital, the medical examiner's office said. An autopsy is slated for Thursday. Two people were killed in the shootings along a three-mile stretch on and near the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas. Police used ballistic tests to link Smith, a 12-year veteran of the Utah state police, to three of the four shootings, Dallas Police Lt. Craig Miller said Tuesday. Miller said Smith was a suspect in both nonfatal shootings and one of the fatal shootings. He said it was unclear if Smith was a suspect in the fatal shooting that occurred first. The first attack occurred in the city of Garland at about 5:41 p.m. Victim Jorge Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light in Garland when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him, Officer Joe Harn of the Garland police said. A few minutes later and two miles away on the LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers. While one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said. ""He was going to be traveling home,"" Lt. Miller said. ""He was about to park his rig. He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location."" Miller called the truck driver a hero because he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt. The fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway, where gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor-trailer. The bullets missed the driver, but flying glass caused minor cuts, police said. Smith, 37, left his trooper job in Utah after he was caught abusing alcohol and drugs, CNN affiliate WFAA reported, citing an official report. The sergeant began using drugs and alcohol after his patrol car was rear-ended while he was writing a ticket, according to the report by Utah Peace Officers Standards and Training. He moved to Texas shortly afterward, the station said. Harn told WFAA that Smith's wife had phoned police Monday to say her husband was suicidal and driving around with a gun. Police were able to locate him using cell phone transmission towers. A three-hour stand-off followed, ending when Smith shot himself in the head, Harn said.","Police say ex-Utah officer was tied to at least three of four Dallas shootings .

"(CNN) -- When David Green, 22, graduated from Western Washington University in December, he applied for dozens of jobs, from fast food to secretarial positions -- sending out more than 50 resumes and scoring only two interviews in the process. The organization Reach to Teach has seen a 100 percent increase in applications to teach English in Asia. ""It was horrible. I couldn't find anything,"" said Green, a history and social studies major. With few employment options in his hometown of Bellingham, Washington, Green applied to teach English in a South Korean middle school through Reach to Teach, an organization that assists college graduates with finding teaching positions in Asia. Green, who counts trips to Canada as his only experience abroad, will be leaving for Seoul on March 20 for one year. ""I am scared. I've only had one major breakdown so far, ... but I'm really excited about being on my own ... somewhere completely new where I know absolutely no one,"" he said. Like Green, many recent college graduates are searching for alternatives to jumping into the job market in the face of the recession. An increasing number of young Americans are searching out paid positions teaching English in countries like South Korea, Japan, China and Spain as a means to expand their horizons and weather the economic doldrums. Mitch Gordon, director of school relations for Reach to Teach, said his organization has seen more than a 100 percent increase in applications in the last six months, with 3,784 applicants compared to 1,488 during the same six-month period last year. The application system doesn't track U.S. applicants separately, but Gordon estimates more than 70 percent are from the United States. The program also has seen a significant increase in current teachers extending their teaching contracts abroad for an extra year. Gordon said he believes the recession is the primary reason for the steady increase in applicants, and the increase has made the program more competitive. ""We have more people for the same number of positions,"" he said. ""We're able to raise our standards a little bit more."" Japan's JET (Japan Exchange and Teaching) program also has recorded a jump in applicants. For 2009 positions, the Japanese government-sponsored program has received 15 percent more U.S. applications than last year, according to program coordinator Joelle Williams. The program attributes the jump in part to the economic situation and the tough job market in the United States. JET officials also noticed that more applications arrived farther in advance of the deadline this year. 'Taking control of my own life' Ayana Hosten, a spring 2008 graduate of Claremont McKenna College, has been working as an English teaching assistant in Madrid, Spain, since February through a program organized by the Ministry of Education of Spain. Her contract is ending in June and she is already looking to extend her stay for another year. Spain's Ministry of Education has announced more than 1,200 openings for U.S. and Canadian ""cultural ambassadors"" for the 2009-2010 school year. Grants provide the teaching assistants with about $900 a month for the eight-month stay. Teachers are responsible for their own lodging and transportation costs, and applicants should have a functional knowledge of Spanish. For Hosten, 22, going to Spain was a way to escape a rough job market that left her without a full-time job between graduating and applying for the teaching program. ""After being unemployed for three months, it really started to affect me emotionally, which was something I was not prepared for,"" Hosten said in an e-mail. ""Going to Spain was me taking control of my own life and pretty much just wiping my hands of the financial crisis."" Travis Lee, a University of Tennessee alumnus who is in a teaching program sponsored by a university in Wuhan, China, began teaching English in September 2008, originally intending to stay for one year. ""Now I'm thinking of extending my stay for another semester or full year, and if I really like it and can't find a job in America, who knows?"" Lee said in an e-mail. He said the economy and the tight job market have been a big influence in his consideration to stay in China. Trying another path . For many recent graduates, working abroad is becoming a more secure option than searching for a job in the United States. Most teaching programs in other countries will provide teachers with a salary and health insurance, and some programs in Asia will even provide free housing, said Jake Hanin, a teach abroad program coordinator for the Council on International Education Exchange, who also has noticed an increase in applications. For programs in Asia, fluency in English is usually the most important qualification for teaching jobs, and many do not require applicants to have previous teaching experience, Hanin said. Lee's salary in China is approximately $555 per month, which he says is more than enough to live comfortably in Wuhan. The university also provides him with a rent-free apartment and pays his electric bill. ""We make twice what a Chinese teacher with a bachelor's makes and we do half the work,"" Lee said in an e-mail. But for Lee and many other recent graduates, working abroad is primarily about having once-in-a-lifetime experiences in a completely different culture. ""You have plenty of time to get a career, start a family, and follow that path,"" Lee said. ""Why not try another path first? What have you got to lose?"" CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Economy is prompting some recent grads to delay entering U.S. workforce .

"SHANGHAI, China (CNN) -- In between selling tickets and greeting customers, Min Min turned his curvy 6-feet-tall frame to survey the spacious dance hall and revealed he is no ordinary doorman at this extraordinary place. Min Min hosts a drag show in Shanghai while not manning a ballroom dance hall for older gay men. ""When I first started this, it was only a dozen or so of us,"" reminisced the former factory worker-turned-drag queen. ""Now 300 people or more come each night."" Welcome to Lai Lai Dance Hall, arguably the only entertainment venue for older gay men in Shanghai, if not the whole of China. Tucked away in a rundown neighborhood in the city's northeast, Lai Lai sits atop a public bathhouse, and features cracked wooden floors and a primitive sound system. Its location and facilities, however, belie its prominence in a community that thrives almost entirely underground. Every weekend, men flock here to unleash their ballroom dancing skill as well as their true identities for three treasured hours. Lai Lai's ""gay nights"" are only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Casually dressed in jeans and sneakers, men of various ages -- but mostly in their 40's and upwards -- and shapes filled the dimly lit dance floor one recent evening. They waltzed, jitterbugged and rumbaed in pairs to the nostalgic Mandarin tunes churned out by a live band on the small stage. ""You won't see this anywhere else,"" said Min, organizer of this regular gathering, himself a middle-aged gay man whose dual passions lie in ballroom dancing and performing in drag. On this Sunday night, however, he was out of drag, donning a sweater and cargo pants. ""I don't really do this for the money -- it's just great fun."" Patrons pay a mere 5 yuan (70 U.S. cents) to enter and enjoy cheap drinks -- a bottle of beer costs just 3 yuan. Observing from the sidelines, one of Min's fellow drag queens -- known as Teacher Zhang -- noted most older gay men don't feel comfortable going to the more expensive bars or clubs frequented by the younger generation. ""It's a totally different culture and environment in those places, while everyone fits right in here,"" said the 58-year-old former soldier and retired school administrator. ""It's a rare outlet for people to relax, to find friends or sex."" Zhang's personal story mirrors those of many patrons at Lai Lai. Realizing he was gay at an early age, Zhang -- like many gay men in China -- married a woman because of family and social pressure. He is expecting to become a grandfather this autumn. ""My wife and my son have suspicions about me, but it's always going to be a question mark in their minds,"" Zhang said. ""They have seen me perform folk dance in drag, but I will never let them see me in an intimate situation with another man."" Unlike many among Lai Lai's largely blue-collar clientele, Zhang said success in running his own catering business has injected freedom and flexibility into his closeted life. ""I bought a big duplex for my wife, and I told her I would stay in the old apartment to concentrate on work,"" Zhang said. ""Chinese women at her age are very pragmatic -- they are satisfied as long as you take good care of the family."" Taking precautions . Family issues aside, activists have pointed to inconsistencies in government policy to explain older gay men's reluctance to come out. Although homosexuality is not illegal in China and has been removed from the country's list of officially recognized mental disorders since 2001, it remains a taboo topic in the state-run media. Gay venues have popped up in major cities across China in recent years, but the authorities sometimes shut them down during politically sensitive times. The upcoming Olympics appears to be one such occasion, amid reports of a series of recent police raids on gay clubs, saunas and cruising spots in Beijing and Shanghai. Activists have voiced their worries about a new crackdown aimed at ""cleaning up"" the country ahead of the Summer Games in August. Both Zhang and Min said they will keep a low profile and be even more cautious about staging drag shows in the next few months. As an extra precaution, they requested their real names not published and Min also insisted no pictures be taken at Lai Lai. For now the dance routines continue and have attracted new fans like Ray Mahoney, an American volunteer with a local AIDS-prevention organization. Mahoney, 50, has been visiting Lai Lai with fellow volunteers to hand out free condoms and safe-sex literature. While he loves the uniquely romantic dance scene, Mahoney emphasized that he has an urgent message for Chinese gay men of his age group. He said many people in this generation, because of their educational and social background, have never used a condom before -- either with their wives or with their male sex partners. ""I had three friends in the U.S. die in the 1980's of AIDS,"" Mahoney said. ""The people at Lai Lai don't realize AIDS is really close to them and it's spreading quickly in the gay community here."" Acknowledging the rising HIV-infection rate among gay men, Chinese health officials have quietly started their own outreach program, which calls for sending trained staff to gay venues nationwide to promote AIDS awareness and encourage voluntary testing. Although he has welcomed the volunteers and admires Mahoney's dedication, Min still focuses his attention on dancing. He is even prepared to set his sights on an alternative ""Olympic"" event that includes ballroom dancing as a competitive sport. ""In the future we might,"" Min responded when asked if he and other Lai Lai regulars would join the Gay Games -- the gay answer to the Olympics -- next to be held in 2010 in Cologne, Germany. ""We probably won't win,"" he said with a laugh. ""But I bet we could finish in 6th place!""

"(CNN) -- A man sought in the slayings of a woman and her four young children in Oklahoma was arrested Tuesday night after a car chase in Texas, authorities said. Joshua Steven Durcho was arrested Tuesday after a car chase with police. Joshua Steven Durcho was arrested in Waco, Texas, after a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper tried to stop the car Durcho was driving because the trooper suspected a drunk driver, according to Erin Mangrum of the Canadian County, Oklahoma, sheriff's office. The trooper checked the vehicle tag on the car and it matched the tag being sought by Oklahoma police, Mangrum said. Mangrum said Durcho's car sped off, but he later wrecked the vehicle, and Durcho was taken into custody. Durcho suffered minor injuries in the accident, Mangrum said. Officers found the bodies of Summer Rust, 25, and her children Monday in their apartment in El Reno, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. Rust's daughter Evynn was 3, son Teagin was 4, and daughters Autumn and Kirsten were both 7. Durcho is believed to have taken the slain woman's car, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said. CNN affilate KOCO reported that Durcho had been spotted Monday night in Clinton, Oklahoma. His image was captured by surveillance cameras, the affiliate said, quoting police. Authorities would not reveal how Rust and her children were killed, pending the outcome of autopsies. Rust's mother, Susan Rust of Carson City, Nevada, said her daughter had been shot, but she did not know how her grandchildren had been killed. Watch authorities name Durcho as the suspect » . Susan Rust said her daughter was loving and outgoing but tended to get involved with the wrong men. Durcho was unemployed and had been living with Summer Rust and her children, the mother said. Police were asked to check up on the family because Rust and Durcho had had a fight, she said. Summer Rust attended Redlands Community College in El Reno, where she majored in legal assistant training, according to school officials. Rust's mother said she was retraining after losing her job in casino security several months ago. ""Summer was very bright, very outgoing, had a positive attitude and was very determined to complete her education,"" Julie Lamb of the college told CNN Radio. Lamb heads a student support program on campus. The school brought in grief counselors Tuesday to help students affected by the killings. Domestic violence groups also reached out to the students. A friend posting online described Summer Rust as ""fun-loving"" and ""a little crazy kind of person"" who was also very smart. ""Her children were beautiful, funny and always cheerful and sometimes a little wild. They were a great bunch of kids and they loved each other very much. They were proud of their mom for going back to school,"" the friend said. ""She was going to make a better life for her family. I can't believe something like this could happen to her and the kids. ... I will miss her silliness and her smile. I will miss them all.""","NEW: Joshua Steven Durcho arrested after police chase in Texas .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Masters -- April 9-12, 2009 . 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson puts the green jacket on 2008 winner Trevor Immelman. While The Open Championship at St Andrews, Scotland may rival it for history, few would argue that the U.S. Masters tournament is unrivalled in terms of beauty and exclusivity. Played at the prestigious Augusta National Golf club in the city of Augusta, Georgia, the first ""major"" of the golfing year is a strictly invitational event controlled by the club itself. The top 50 golfers in the official world rankings are all guaranteed an invite. The dramatic azalea-draped course -- the brainchild of golfing great Bobby Jones -- provides a tough test for the world's elite golfers, particularly since it has been lengthened or ""Tiger-proofed"" in recent years. However the relatively short 12th hole, named Golden Bell, is arguably the most challenging. Jack Nicklaus once called it ""the hardest tournament hole in golf,"" due to the fact that its perilously narrow green is protected in front by Rae's Creek, with two sand traps behind it. Misjudge the wind or get your club selection wrong and the ball will most likely end up in the water. Since Horton Smith won the inaugural Masters title in 1934, the tournament has become as famous for its traditions as it has for the quality of golf on show. Winners are presented with a green jacket by the defending champion -- which they are obliged to return to the clubhouse the following year. Nicklaus, nicknamed the ""Golden Bear,"" became the first golfer to successfully defend his green jacket. He also holds the record for the most titles won at Augusta with six -- his last coming in 1986 at the age of 46. American players currently dominate the competition, following a period in the 1980s and 1990s which saw European players, including Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo, win 10 titles in 17 years. Current world number one Tiger Woods has won four times at Augusta since 1997, while compatriot and rival for top spot, Phil Mickelson, won in 2004 and 2006. South Africa's Trevor Immelman is the current owner of the coveted green jacket.  2008 season in pictures » . U.S. Open - June 15-21, 2009 . Tiger Woods and his caddie walk up to the 18th green on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park in 2002. The second of the four major tournaments, the U.S. Open is hosted by the United States Golf Association (USGA). Since its inaugural event in 1895 at the Newport Golf and Country Club, the event has been staged at a number of different courses. What's your favorite tournament? It wasn't until 1913 that the U.S. Open championship really caught the imagination when a young American amateur, Francis Ouimet, stunned the golf world by defeating famous English professionals, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, in a playoff. The format of the tournament has changed several times. The USGA extended the championship to 72 holes in 1898, with 36 holes played on each of two days. In 1926, the format was changed to 18 holes played each of two days, then 36 holes on the third day. In 1965, the present format of four 18-hole daily rounds was implemented for the first time. Over the years, much has been made of the way U.S. Open courses have been set up, with incredibly tough pin positions and rough thick enough to require a compass to navigate through. ""Sometimes the players feel [the USGA] has gotten a little close to the edge on some holes,"" defending champion Retief Goosen told the BBC at Pinehurst, North Carolina in 2005. Two years later, when Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania hosted the tournament, World Golf.com quoted Tiger Woods as saying ""a 10-handicapper didn't stand a chance at breaking 100"" on a course that boasts over 200 deep bunkers. Bobby Jones, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Willie Anderson and Hale Irwin have all triumphed at the U.S. Open on four occasions, while Woods, who won last year's event at Torrey Pines following a dramatic playoff victory over Rocco Mediate, counts three so far among his haul of 14 major titles. The U.S. Open is the only major that requires participants to play-off over 18 holes. This year's event at Bethpage State Park's Black Course in Farmingdale, New York should be familiar to Woods, as he won here in 2002. At 7,214-yards, the municipally-owned Bethpage was the longest U.S. Open course in history. The aptly-named Black Course even carries a warning sign about its difficulty on the first tee. In 2002, American Hale Irwin missed the cut for only the sixth time in 33 Open starts after two torrid rounds of 82 and 81. ""They can go out and write a new book and title it, 'Massacre at ... wherever the heck we are,"" U.S. Open.com quoted him as saying. It remains to be seen whether the recently-injured Tiger can tame the course once again.  Watch more about Woods' comeback » . The Open Championship -- July 16-19, 2009 . Padraig Harrington (right) and Greg Norman line up putts during the 2008 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale. Organized by the R&A, which takes its name from Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, Scotland, The (British) Open Championship is the oldest of the four major tournaments. It is also the only one held outside of the United States. First held in October, 1860, The Open was mostly played in Scotland during its early years. Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire was the birthplace of the event, which saw just eight players compete in its inaugural year. A year later the tournament was declared open to the whole world and the event has been known simply as ""The Open"" ever since. Since the early days, the R&A has established a rota of British seaside ""links"" courses to host the event. The major difference between a links course and a parkland course -- such as Augusta -- is that it is far less manufactured. Links courses are constructed out of the sandy, windswept coastal terrain, with few ""man-made"" additions. Players are faced with thick rough, narrow undulating fairways that snake around dunes, and lightening quick greens. There are far fewer trees and water hazards. When the wind gusts these courses demand the highest level of skill and imagination. This year's tournament will be held on the famous Ailsa course at Turnberry on the west coast of Scotland. With its dramatic views and elevated cliff-top holes, the 7,200 yard course previously hosted The Open in 1977, 1986, 1994. The winning aggregate scores in 1977 and 1994 rank among the lowest recorded in Open history, largely because the wind wasn't blowing as it can. Current Open champion Padraig Harrington will arrive at Turnberry looking to win the tournament for the third time in as many years. At Carnoustie in 2007, Harrington became the first Irishman to win The Open since Fred Daly in 1947. He defended his title the following year at Royal Birkdale, finishing four strokes ahead of England's Ian Poulter. Harrington has a long way to go before matching the great Harry Vardon's record of six Open victories between 1896 and 1914. Surprisingly, U.S. golfers -- more used to parkland courses -- have enjoyed great success in the competition in recent years, with 10 wins in 12 years. Tiger Woods, who missed out through injury last year, lifted the Claret Jug in 2000, 2005 and 2006. U.S. PGA Championship -- August 10-16, 2009 . Harrington pumps his fist as he sinks a putt to win the 2008 U.S. PGA Championship at Oakland Hills. The final major of the year, The PGA Championship is organized by the Professional Golfers Association of America (PGA of America) and is also held at a different course each year. The brainchild of New York salesman Rodman Wannamaker, the first PGA Championship was held at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York in 1916 -- the same year the PGA of America was founded. The winners' trophy is named after him. The competition, which was only switched from a matchplay to a strokeplay format in 1958, does not allow amateurs to compete. It always attracts a world class field, in addition to a number of ordinary club professionals in the United States who can qualify through a national tournament. This year's tournament will be held at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, the scene of Rich Beem's defeat of a charging Tiger Woods in 2002. Beem, an unknown club professional who also sold car stereos, held off Woods by recording birdies in his final four holes for a 68 that gave him victory by just one shot. The 7,149-yard course is ranked among the top courses in the United States, according to the PGA. Its signature 16th hole features a wide open fairway that narrows into a long peninsula featuring an elevated green protected by Lake Hazeltine. This year Padraig Harrington will attempt to defend the trophy, a year after he pulled off a dramatic victory over Spain's Sergio Garcia at Oakland Hills. If he succeeds he will become only the second man -- after Tiger Woods -- to be back-to-back PGA Champion. However, both men lag behind Jack Nicklaus, who won a record-equaling fifth U.S.PGA title in 1980 at Oak Hill, Rochester -- the hometown of Walter Hagen, the player whose record Nicklaus tied.","U.S. Masters is always held at prestigious Augusta National, Georgia, U.S.

"(AOL Autos) -- Ever wonder what goes into the making of that round, black, rubber thing that holds air, we refer to as a tire? To the casual observer all tires look the same, but there's a lot more to it than meets the eye ... There are many different tire designs and they may contain up to 200 raw materials. Modern tire construction has allowed for a degree of handling, ride comfort, traction, extended treadwear and fuel economy that far exceeds the tires of just a few years ago. Today there are tire designs that contain up to 200 raw materials, as well as complex architecture of steel belts, textile piles and computer designed tread patterns, which deliver maximum traction under all conditions. Each component of a tire is designed to perform its own function and to work together with the rest of the components. For instance, the belt system's job is to provide stability to the tread area, keep the tread grooves open, and work as a unit with the sidewalls to provide stability in cornering and handling. Kind of reminds me of the old song, ""The toe bone's connected to the foot bone"" well ... you get the picture, right? The major component in tires is rubber. How did this substance find its way into the American automobile tire? As with most inventions, this is a fascinating story. Rubber by itself is a gooey substance that is extremely sensitive to temperature. Back in the early 1830's ""rubber fever"" was the craze, and it ended as quickly as it started. At first, everybody wanted things made of this new waterproof gum from Brazil, and factories sprung up to meet the demand. Then abruptly, the public became fed up with the messy stuff that froze bone-hard in winter and turned glue-like in summer. Not one of the young rubber companies survived as long as five years. Investors lost millions and everyone agreed that rubber had seen its hay-day in America. AOL Autos: Best car deals of the month . Then Charles Goodyear stepped up to the plate. Through extensive experimentation and persistence, Goodyear found that rubber could be stabilized and formed into a useful compound by adding sulfur and applying heat. He found that steam under pressure, applied to the compound for 4 to 6 hours at about 270 degrees Fahrenheit, gave him the most uniform results. This was the beginning of rubber compounds! AOL Autos: Most popular sedans . Rubber compounding is like mixing a cake. Different ingredients are mixed together at different degrees to produce rubber with specific characteristics. Some rubber compounds are stickier for better traction when racing. Some compounds are much harder for heavy-duty work in construction or with heavy equipment. All-season rubber for all-season tires is rubber that doesn't freeze below thirty-two degrees, allowing for movement of the tread in the cold weather so it will grip and give maximum traction in all weather. AOL Autos: Best-selling hybrid cars . Ever wonder how a steel belted radial tire is constructed? Check this out. 1. First comes the construction of the casing. This is the body (or carcass) of the tire ... the ""foundation"" upon which everything is built. The casing is made up of a series of cords (most typically polyester) which are combined to form layers or piles. These layers are connected to two circular strands of steel called beads. Then the inner liner is added, serving as the air seal. Once the casing is formed, everything else is added to make up the tire. AOL Autos: Consumer reports picks best used luxury cars . 2. Next comes the steel belt. This is a belt made up of woven steel strands that cover the casing of the tire and is located directly under the tread. The steel belt adds strength and durability, aids in keeping the tread grooves open for maximum traction, and protects the casing against impacts and punctures. On high performance tires an extra belt is usually added for strength; this is a nylon overlay that is wrapped around the whole steel belt package. As the tire rolls faster it heats up. The nylon in turn heats up and tends to shrink, counteracting the natural tendency of centrifugal force to throw the whole thing apart at high speeds. AOL Autos: Cars with best Blue Book resale value . 3. Finally, the tread is added. Remember that this rubber compound is a special mix for a specific application and varies depending on the function of the tire. In this day and age, computers play a big role in the tread designs. Tread designs are tested for traction in ""virtual reality"" before they are molded into the rubber. While tread designs vary greatly, there are consistent elements present in all tread patterns. The tread block grips at its leading and trailing edge. Within each block, sipes are often molded or cut to provide additional traction. These sipes segment the block and allow for movement of each individual block so that when it comes in contact with the pavement, it opens and closes causing a squeegee (or pumping) action, cleaning the road surface as it rolls along. The grooves built into the tread pattern are designed to channel away weather elements such as water, snow, slush, and mud. To illustrate how a tread design channels away water, just pour water over the tread of the tire and watch the water directed right out of the sides of the tire. On the outside edges of the tires ""shoulder lugs"" are molded into the tread. These heavy segments provide protection as well as additional traction during hard cornering. A final note and credit to Charles Goodyear. He didn't just happen upon this discovery of rubber compounding and the use of heat. Goodyear spent five miserable years in poverty trying to perfect his idea. Then one day, it happened... the great discovery came in the winter of 1839. As stated earlier, Goodyear was using sulfur in his experiments. Although Goodyear himself has left the details in doubt, the most persistent story goes as follows. One February day, Goodyear wandered into Woburn's general store to show off his latest gum-and-sulfur formula. Snickers rose from the cracker-barrel forum, and the usually mild-mannered little inventor got excited and waved his sticky fistful of gum in the air. It flew from his fingers and landed on the sizzling-hot potbellied stove. When he bent to scrape it off, he found that instead of melting like molasses, it had charred like leather. And around the charred area was a dry, springy brown rim -- ""gum elastic"" still, but so remarkably altered that it was virtually a new substance. He had made weatherproof rubber! This discovery is often cited as one of history's most celebrated ""accidents."" Goodyear stoutly denied that. Like Newton's falling apple, he maintained, the hot stove incident held meaning only for the man ""whose mind was prepared to draw an inference."" That meant, he added simply, the one who had ""applied himself most perseveringly to the subject."" Thanks for your perseverance Charlie.

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- Early indications show no problems with the landing gear, tires or brakes on the Continental Airlines jet that veered off a runway at Denver International Airport in Colorado, despite earlier reports. The wreckage of the Continental Airlines plane sits in a ravine December 22 in Denver, Colorado. ""There's no indication from the physical examination on the scene of brake problems at this time,"" said Robert Sumwalt, a National Transportation Safety Board  member leading the investigation team. Saturday's accident injured more than three dozen people, including the captain who piloted the plane. Sumwalt said preliminary evidence indicated no problems with the Boeing 737's landing gear, tires or engines before the jet ran off the runway into a 40-foot-deep ravine during its take-off roll. Earlier Monday, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that early indications suggested that a problem with the landing gear, tire or brakes may have caused the accident. The source said the problem could have caused a wheel to lock up or some other situation that would have made the plane veer off as it headed down the runway.  Watch what NTSB official has to say about flight recorders » . ""The brakes showed no leaks, no locked brakes,"" Sumwalt told reporters late Monday, adding that the brake pads ""looked good."" He said tire marks indicate that all four main landing gear were inflated. The weather was clear, and no obstacles were on the runway, he said. The accident injured 38 people, most from bruises and broken bones as frightened passengers tried to flee a fire that broke out on board Flight 1404. No fatalities were reported. Sumwalt said the captain, an 11-year veteran of Continental, was injured in the accident and ""not physically able"" to be interviewed yet. But an investigator interviewed the first officer, who told them that the initial take-off roll and taxi was normal. The the co-pilot ""noticed a deviation from the center line of the runway and a sudden left turn,"" Sumwalt said. An off-duty crew that flew the aircraft into Denver before the Saturday flight to Houston was also on board. The first officer from that crew said there was ""absolutely no problem with the aircraft"" during the previous flight. Sumwalt said the cockpit voice recorder ""shows nothing out of the ordinary"" during the preflight operations. He said the recording revealed that 41 seconds after the brakes were released, there were sounds of bumping and rattling. Four seconds later, a crew member called for a rejected takeoff. Flight 1404 was taking off about 6:18 p.m. Sumwalt said the plane reached a maximum speed of 119 knots (137 mph) before going into the ravine. Passengers on Sunday described the chaos inside the plane after the plane came to rest.  Watch survivor describe crash on blog » . ""Some people were trying to get luggage from the top, the engine was on fire so I was worried, you know, about getting out of there,"" said Gabriel Trejos.

Watch first responders on the scene » . Trejos, who was traveling with his wife and baby, told CNN he sensed something was wrong with the plane before it took off. ""I heard something over the intercom before, you know, that they were having engine problems and shortly after that they said that everything's fine ... there's going to be an on-time flight."" Continental spokeswoman Julie King, however, told CNN that she was unaware of any announcement of engine problems on board the flight. Sumwalt agreed, saying, ""I don't have any information, no one has come to us that they knew of a problem"" before the accident.","NTSB says early evidence does not point to tires, brakes or landing gear .

"(CNN)  -- Police digging for clues in the deaths of six people found in the New Mexico desert hope the identification of one set of bones will generate leads. An Albuquerque, New Mexico, police forensics team member digs last week at the burial site. The remains of Victoria Chavez and five other people were found in a 92-acre area housing development under construction just west of Albuquerque. Chavez was a prostitute and drug user who was last seen in 2003 and reported missing in 2004, Albuquerque police said. The six bodies were found after a woman walking her dog found a human bone two weeks ago and notified police, said John Walsh, Albuquerque police spokesman. Authorities have not yet identified the other five sets of bones but say they might find others. Attempting to piece together identities could take a long time because, they said,  ""it's very difficult"" to determine cause of death from skeletal remains. ""We're going off of one remain so far,"" Walsh said. ""And that's all we've got at the moment. We've only got skeletal remains. ""This is a slow go,"" Walsh said. ""Things won't pop up in hours, likely in weeks."" Chavez's remains were identified through dental records that her family provided when she was reported missing in 2004. It will be tougher to identify the others. For example, one had no dental work and another had no skull. The cause of Chavez's death was not known, but Walsh speculated that her death could be related to violent sex trade. He said police are looking at reports of missing prostitutes over the years and are trying to determine possible suspects. He said he hopes family members of those missing could help authorities. Police are trying to figure out how the bodies got there. They are investigating the possibility that one person put the bones there. ""At this stage, the best way I can describe it, we have a handful of theories,"" Walsh said. The names of two dead men have surfaced during the investigation of Chavez's death, Walsh said, confirming a news report. One was a pimp who died of natural causes. The other was killed by a pimp after he killed a prostitute, the report said. The last set of remains exhumed at the site was nine or 10 feet deep. Authorities were using heavy and light equipment and cadaver dogs to find bodies and clues. Investigators think there could be even more remains buried on the New Mexico site.","NEW .

"(CNN) -- A rat believed to be extinct for 11 million years, a spider with a foot-long legspan, and a hot pink cyanide-producing ""dragon millipede"" are among the thousand newly discovered species in the largely unexplored Mekong Delta region. The ""dragon millipede"" is among the 1,068 new species discovered in the Mekong Delta region. The region, including parts of Vietnam and five other countries, is home to 1,068 species found between 1997 and 2007, according to a World Wildlife Fund report released this week. Some of the creatures were not lurking in fertile floodplains or tropical foliage. A scientist visiting an outdoor restaurant was startled to see a Laotian rock rat among the nearby wildlife. The hairy, nocturnal, thick-tailed rat, which resembles a squirrel, had been thought for centuries to be extinct. ""There is a certain amount of shock because our scientists will sometimes see something that doesn't fit anything they know,"" said Dekila Chungyalpa, Director of the Fund's Mekong Program. ""They run through a catalogue of wildlife in their brain, asking themselves, 'Have I seen this?'"" Perhaps a more startling discovery than the rat was a bright green pit viper scientists spotted slithering through the rafters of a restaurant in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand. The Fund dubbed the Mekong a ""biological treasure trove."" The organization's report ""First Contact in the Greater Mekong"" says 519 plants, 279 fish, 88 frogs, 88 spiders, 46 lizards, 22 snakes, 15 mammals, four birds, four turtles, two salamanders and a toad were found. Scientists are still trying to determine if they have uncovered thousands of new invertebrate species. Scientists are discovering new species at a rate of two per week, said Chungyalpa, who said the reason for publishing the report now was twofold. ""We realized that we should highlight these discoveries in part because of the legacy of war and conflict in the region,"" she said. ""There's an urgency with the threat of development in the Mekong countries."" A horned bovine found in 1991 living in the evergreen forests of the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam has not been found in recent years, she said. Timber development and mining industries are encroaching. There are 150 large hydropower dams that have been constructed along the Mekong river, and another 150 are slated to be built, according to the Fund. Dams that can trap and kill fish are at different stages of planning in the Greater Mekong. High variation in geography and climate zones that enabled species to flourish are now jeopardized by climate change, said Chungyalpa. War is always a threat in countries touched by the Mekong River, particularly Burma. Also known as Myanmar, the largest country by geographical area in mainland Southeast Asia has been ravaged over the years by conflict, political instability and natural disaster. This summer, for example, the United Nations reported that as many as 100,000 people were killed by a cyclone that hit Myanmar. The country's ruling military junta blocked the outside world for weeks before allowing aid to flow into the region. There are cultural obstacles to protecting rare species, too. Many restaurants serve them as food. Restaurants often have rickety bamboo floors that one can look through to see cages filled with exotic animals, Chungyalpa says. The more exotic the animal, the more status it often bestows on the person who consumes it. ""Reports [like the WWF's] are important because these regions can be educated,"" said Maureen Aung-Thwin, the director of The Burma Project, which is funded by the George Soros Foundation and supports local Indonesian organizations working toward an open society. ""People are taking climate change more seriously and even the ruling junta have a forestry NGO. There are glimpses of hope,"" said Aung-Thwin. ""But it's also a situation where someone could step forward and say 'We don't need this' and cut it all down."" WWF said it is working with governments and industry to plan the conservation of more than 231,000 square miles of forest and freshwater habitats that cross borders with all countries in the Greater Mekong.","World Wildlife Fund documents new species of mammals, plants, lizards, fish .

A woman wades through high waters in Venice's Piazza San Marco. Water burst the banks of the coastal city's famed canals, leaving the landmark Piazza San Marco -- St Mark's Square -- under almost a meter of water at one point, news agency ANSA reported. Strong winds pushed waters to a high of 1.56 meters (5 feet 2 inches) at 10:45 a.m. local time, prompting the city government to issue warnings to the public, the agency said.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Three British guards jumped overboard and were rescued from the water after battling in vain to prevent pirates hijacking a chemical tanker off the coast of Somalia. Three British security guards board a helicopter to be transferred to a Royal Navy vessel. The Liberian-flagged Biscaglia came under ""sustained and heavy attack"" early Friday morning, Nick Davis, Director of Anti-Piracy Maritime Security Solutions (APMSS), said in a statement. The three APMSS-employed security guards -- all former British servicemen -- mounted ""sustained non-lethal resistance"" but were unable to stop the attackers seizing control of the ship, Davis said. The trio were airlifted to safety by a German naval helicopter and flown to a French frigate after the vessel summoned assistance from coalition warships. They were later transferred to a British Royal Navy ship. All three were unhurt, Davis said. ""I have spoken with my team leader on the phone and he informs me that the level of violence was significant and forced them reluctantly to leave the vessel after every effort was made to ensure the safety of the ships crew,"" Davis said. Pirates continued to shoot at the three in the water, Davis said. ""The hijacked vessel with pirates in control then attempted to run them down."" The Biscaglia is managed by Singapore-based Ishima and owned by Winged Foot Shipping in the Marshall Islands and was crewed by 25 Indians and two Bangladeshis who are believed to be still onboard. The vessel is believed to be on its way to an anchorage in Puntland, northeastern Somalia, Davis said. iReport.com: Share your view from 'Inside Africa' Also Friday, pirates released the Greek ship MV Centauri, which was hijacked in September off the coast of Somalia, according to Andrew Mwangura, the head of the Kenya Seafarers Association. There was no immediate information about the 25 crew members on board the ship when it was taken. A multinational naval force including vessels from the U.S., NATO member states, Russia and India has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters seas near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, following a sharp increase in pirate attacks in the region. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off the coast of Somalia coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center. The most high-profile hijacking so far came earlier this month, when pirates seized a Saudi oil tanker carrying $100 million worth of oil and a crew of 25, although that attack occurred outside the pirates' normal operational range, 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya. Pirates are still holding the ship. Another vessel held since September is the Ukrainian MV Farina, which was carrying a cargo of weapons and tanks and a crew of 22. In an interview provided to CNN this week, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue as long as life in Somalia remained desperate. ""The pirates are living between life and death,"" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. ""Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything."" The interview was conducted in August by journalists working for the Somali news organization, Garowe.","3 security guards battle pirates, jump overboard as tanker hijacked off Somalia .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has signed a deployment order to move an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan next year, according to U.S. military officials. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, with its high mountain terrain. The troops will be part of a combat aviation brigade, the latest approved by Gates for the expected build-up of U.S. troops in Afghanistan throughout next year. Earlier this year, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan, requested at least 20,000 additional troops be sent there to fight the increasing violence by the resurgent Taliban forces in the southern and eastern parts of the country. The officials could not say what units are being tapped to go because those units are now being told of their deployment and the announcement has not yet been made public. The aviation brigade will send a number of much-needed helicopters to the region. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, where high mountain roads and passes make it difficult for large transport vehicles to move troops and supplies around the country. There are more than 30,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, a Dutch soldier was killed Friday in southern Afghanistan, the NATO command confirmed. The soldier died in an improvised explosive device strike, according to a news release from NATO's International Security Assistance Force. ""Our sincere condolences and sympathies are with the family and friends of this brave soldier, especially during this holiday season,"" said ISAF spokesman Capt. Mark Windsor Royal Navy. ""This soldier's death is an irreplaceable loss to all of us who fight for the peace and stability of Afghanistan.

"HOLLYWOOD, Florida (CNN) -- For nearly three decades, John Walsh's black leather jackets and swagger have made him a crime-fighting cultural icon. But when he returned this week to the Hollywood police station, he was once again the father of a murdered child. John and Reve Walsh turned their grief into activism on behalf of missing children and crime victims. His face was ashen. His eyes were red and brimming with tears. He clutched the hand of his wife, Reve, as police closed the books Tuesday on their 27-year investigation into his boy's abduction, murder and decapitation. Ottis Toole, a convicted pedophile and murderer who was a partner of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, was officially named the killer. Toole died in prison for an unrelated crime in 1996. After his son's death, Walsh became an advocate for missing children and crime victims, and host of the TV show ""America's Most Wanted."" He always thought Toole was the boy's killer. Now he knows for sure. ""For 27 years, we've been asking, 'Who can take a 6-year-old boy and murder and decapitate him? Who?' We needed to know,"" Walsh said. ""The not knowing has been a torture, but that journey's over."" ""We will always be the parents of that little boy,"" Reve Walsh said.  Watch Reve Walsh thank her children » . In 1981, the world seemed to be a much safer place. It was not unusual for parents to let children play outside unattended or to drop them off at parks, malls and schoolyards. After Adam's murder, his parents went through tough times, separating and later reconciling. They raised three other children, who are now 26, 24 and 14. Adam would be 33. Walsh said the birth of their oldest daughter, Megan, ""probably saved our lives, because she was born a year after Adam [died], when we were spiraling into hell."" Perhaps to save themselves, they made it their mission to preserve Adam's legacy by helping other crime victims. The abduction and murder of Adam Walsh also fundamentally changed the way law enforcement agencies look for missing children. Chad Wagner, the police chief in Hollywood, where Adam was abducted, said law enforcement back then was ""like a whole 'nuther world.""  Watch the chief close the case » . Hollywood police were accused of some major blunders in their investigation, and Wagner apologized to the Walshes for those mistakes. The case, he said, ""made us a better agency.... If this same type of situation were to occur today, I would tell you it would be a much quicker, much better, much cleaner outcome."" ""In 1981, when Adam disappeared, you couldn't enter missing children information into the FBI computer system,"" said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Walshes are co-founders of the center. ""You could enter information on stolen cars, stolen guns and stolen jewelry, but you couldn't enter information on missing children,"" he said. Walsh, who before Adam's murder was a hotel developer, went to Capitol Hill and began a second career as an activist for crime victims. He fought for passage of the 1982 Missing Children's Act, which created the FBI's national database. Today, there are at least 80,000 missing children listed in the database. In 1981, when Adam was taken and killed, there was no coordinated national response to child abductions. The 18,000 police departments across the United States did not effectively communicate. ""Most police departments would tell you he probably just ran away, if he doesn't come back, call us in 48 or 72 hours,"" Allen said. ""But, what we've found in 75 percent of cases, the child is dead within the first three hours. Waiting until the day after tomorrow is just too late."" Walsh lobbied for more federal legislation and by 1984, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was up and running. With it came an explosion of activism that resulted in the faces of missing kids being printed on milk cartons and on fliers that have gone into 85 million homes a week for 23 years. There also have been advances in age enhancement photography.  ""Code Adam"" is now an internal alarm at 70,000 department stores and shops that alerts employees to potential threats to children. The employees are trained to lock the doors when the alarm goes off. ""It's a powerful example of the legacy of one little boy and his courageous parents,"" Allen said. Beyond the technical advances, there are social and cultural changes as well. People have become much more aware of crime, predators and fugitives. The Web site for John Walsh's show, ""America's Most Wanted"" says it has helped catch 1,049 fugitives. ""Society has built on a lot of the things they have done,"" said CNN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks. There are surveillance cameras at businesses, and Amber Alerts are issued when a child is missing. Walsh ""has helped law enforcement immensely,"" Brooks said. ""The more eyes and ears you can get out there looking for a missing person, the better."" The Walshes raised their three other children in an envelope of pain and grief for a sibling they never knew. On Tuesday, the Walsh children, now grown, accompanied their parents to the police station in Hollywood, Florida. They stood silently as their parents clutched hands and fought tears, once again victims, once again the parents of a murdered child.","Murder of Adam Walsh, parents' response, changed law enforcement .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Kennedy, the 51-year-old daughter of President John F. Kennedy, has indicated her interest in filling the New York Senate seat being vacated by secretary of state designee Hillary Clinton. Caroline Kennedy has her eyes on the New York Senate seat. ""I've talked to Caroline Kennedy and she's clearly interested,"" New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said at a news conference Monday afternoon. He indicated that 12 people were interested in the position. ""She's interested in the position,"" New York Gov. David Paterson confirmed. But at the same time ""she realizes it's not a campaign."" Paterson, who will name Clinton's successor, noted that Kennedy had indicated a desire to ""sit down and tell me what her qualifications are."" The Rev. Al Sharpton also released a statement Monday indicating that he had received a call from Kennedy ""who expressed to me her interest in [Clinton's] Senate seat."" Kennedy's interest in the seat could mean the continuation of a family legacy in the Senate that began 56 years ago with the election of her father as the then-junior senator from Massachusetts.  Background: The Kennendys in Politics » . Her uncle Ted Kennedy has represented Massachusetts in the Senate since 1963, and her uncle Robert Kennedy served as New York's junior senator from 1965 until he was assassinated in 1968. ""Remember, [Clinton's] seat in the Senate was once held by Robert Kennedy,"" said Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst. ""[Caroline Kennedy's] other uncle, Ted Kennedy, is ill right now. If Paterson appoints Caroline Kennedy to the Senate, it means there could be a Kennedy staying in the Senate for quite a long time.""  Watch Sen. Schumer on the possible candidates » . CNN reported earlier this month that Caroline Kennedy had called Paterson to discuss the possibility of taking the seat. Paterson has the power to appoint a replacement, who will then face a special election in 2010 to fill out Clinton's term. Paterson confirmed to CNN last week that Kennedy had called and ""asked a few questions"" about the expected vacancy. One Democratic source close to the Kennedy family told CNN earlier this month Kennedy was ""interested to say the least"" in the Senate seat and had asked a tight circle of other family friends and political advisers for advice. Before this year, Kennedy generally limited her forays into the public sphere to nonpartisan activity, penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father's legacy. But in January, she backed a political candidate for the first time, announcing her endorsement of Obama during the Democratic primary season with an op-ed in The New York Times that drew days of the kind of media attention she has spent her life avoiding. ""I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them,"" she wrote. ""But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans."" ""Apparently, she has acquired a taste for politics,"" Schneider noted. ""She wants to be part of this new regime in America, clearly playing a key role in the Senate if she gets that appointment.""  Watch Bill Schneider's report » . There are a slew of high-profile candidates for Clinton's Senate seat, including New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, whose last name carries some star power of its own New York, where his father was once governor. Kennedy's roots in New York also run deep. Her mother, Jacqueline Kennedy, relocated to New York after her husband's assassination in 1963, with children Caroline and John F. Kennedy Jr. Caroline Kennedy has also spent most of her life in the city, working there after graduating from Harvard, meeting her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, on the job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and attending Columbia Law School there. Her most prominent public roles involved overseeing her father's presidential library and presenting the annual Profiles in Courage Award. She's also edited several books, from a volume of children's poetry and an updated edition of her father's book ""Profiles in Courage"" to a collection of patriotic verse (""A Patriot's Handbook: Songs, Poems, Stories, and Speeches Celebrating the Land We Love""). Most of her leadership positions have been based in the arts: serving as host of the annual nationally televised Kennedy Center Honors in Washington and serving as the honorary chairwoman of the American Ballet Theatre, as her mother did. In late spring and early summer she was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate and more recently as a contender for secretary of education in an Obama Cabinet.  But elected office would mark a major shift for Kennedy. In a 2002 Time magazine interview promoting the updated ""Profiles in Courage,"" Kennedy would not rule out the possibility of a run for public office. ""I don't have any plans to do that right now,"" she said. ""I don't plan ahead. My kids are young, and I'm really happy to be able to be around. But I do care about issues, and I'm interested in them. So I don't see that now, but you know, I have a long life ahead of me.""

"(CNN) -- One person has died and another was trapped in a pair of avalanches in the Utah mountains Sunday afternoon, authorities said. One of the Utah avalanches, at Snowbird Ski Resort, buried one woman under 2 feet of snow. She later died. Heather Gross, 27, died Sunday evening at a hospital in Salt Lake City from her injuries, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Deputy Levi Hughes said. Gross, a county resident, had been buried under 2 feet of snow by an early-afternoon snowslide at Snowbird Ski Resort, Hughes said. Rescue teams found her about an hour after the avalanche, and she was flown to University of Utah hospital, where she died. A man who was with her at the time was not injured and reported the slide, Hughes said. A second avalanche occurred nearby in the backcountry area known as Lake Desolation, said Randy Doyle, a spokesman for the Big Cottonwood Canyon resorts nearby. He said the avalanche, which left at least one person trapped, was not within the resort.","NEW: Woman taken University of Utah hospital dies of her injuries .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- One million free text messages will be sent every day for 12 months from Monday in South Africa in a bid to raise HIV awareness and encourage testing for the disease. Former South African president Nelson Mandela launched a similar cell phone initiative in 2003. The ambitious Project Masiluleke is being rolled out across the country after a pilot period that saw calls to a AIDS national helpline shoot up by 200 percent,  organizers say. The United Nations estimates that there are currently six million people living with HIV in South Africa and just one in 10 get the treatment they need. ""South Africa is the epicenter of the global HIV epidemic,"" said HIV activist Zinny Thabethe in Octorber at an annual conference for the social innovation network Pop!Tech, an organization instrumental in developing the concept. 'Project Masiluleke,' or 'Project M' was set up to try to encourage people to seek testing and treatment in a country where cell phones are abundant. Africa is cited as the fastest growing mobile-phone network in the world. In South Africa, more than 80 percent of the population has one -- the country has a population of 49 million, and it is estimated that 43 million have cell phones. Almost 95 percent of the phones are prepaid. The initiative plans to broadcast millions of health messages every month to phones across South Africa. ""This is the largest ever use of cell phones for health information,"" said Gustav Praekelt, one of the project's originators. ""There is near universal coverage,"" said Praekelt during the launch of the project. ""And in the absence of other services, the mobile phone has become the central component for people to get access to information."" Organizers say 'Project M' will offer South Africans the privacy to get tested and pursue treatment options and counseling by staff who are HIV positive themselves. The system sends the messages using a so-called ""Please Call Me"" (PCM) service. This free form of text messaging, common across Africa, allows someone without any phone credit to send a text to a friend asking them to call. Each sent PCM message has the words ""Please Call Me,"" the phone number of the caller, and space for an additional 120 characters. The extra space is normally filled with advertising, which helps offset the cost of running the service. The message reads: ""Frequently sick, tired, losing weight and scared that you might be HIV positive? Please call AIDS Helpline 0800012322."" Encouraging people to get tested is a huge challenge in a country where people with the AIDS virus still face stigma and shame. However, 'Project M' appears to be having an impact, since it was initiated in October. ""We have observed a dramatic increase in the call rate to the AIDS Helpline -- from approximately 1,300 calls per day to a new average of 3,600,"" said Milo Zama, Projects Development Manager for LifeLine, one of the partners. Trained operators provide callers with accurate healthcare information, and referrals to local testing clinics . Many of the messages are broadcast in English and in local languages such as Zulu. As well as Pop!Tech, the project has been developed and funded by HIV charities and technology and design firms, including Nokia Siemens, MTN, the Praekelt Foundation, iTeach and National Geographic. Pop!Tech's Director of Communications Jason Rzepka told CNN there are plans to expand the project to other affected countries after its official launch in February 2009. He said: ""One of the objectives of the February launch event will be to secure additional funding, so we can continue to expand Project Masiluleke into its planned 2nd and 3rd phases beyond South Africa.""","One million free texts will be sent every day for 12 months from Monday .

"(CNN) -- Drew Peterson has met with a prominent divorce attorney more than a year after his wife, Stacy, disappeared, his lawyer confirmed to CNN on Tuesday. Drew Peterson's behavior after his wife disappeared deepened suspicion, but he says she ran off. Peterson, a former Bolingbrook, Illinois, police sergeant, has not filed divorce papers, said his attorney, Joel Brodsky. But Peterson told an author he would look into a divorce after Stacy had been missing for a year. He said he was considering divorce for the sake of their children. ""I can confirm that Drew Peterson did have a consultation with Jeffrey Leving,"" Brodsky said, adding that no divorce papers have been filed. Leving, who bills himself as a father's rights lawyer, represented Cuban immigrant Elian Gonzalez's uncle and ultimately helped reunite the boy with his father. Police have said that 54-year old Peterson is a suspect in his wife's disappearance, which investigators have labeled a ""potential homicide."" Peterson maintains that his wife, who was 23 at the time of her disappearance, left him for someone else. In an interview in May with Derek Armstrong, author of ""Drew Peterson Exposed,"" Peterson hinted that he planned to divorce her after she had been missing for a year. In Illinois, willful desertion or abandonment is grounds for a divorce after a year. The interview begins with Peterson expressing frustration with the media attention and negative reactions from his neighbors. ""We were talking about the neighbors and how it's hard to live in the neighborhood with the media trucks around and the neighbors being so difficult,"" Armstrong told CNN. ""I asked if he was going to move, and he said, 'Yeah, when I get a chance, but Stacy's on the title.' "" After the one-year anniversary of Stacy Peterson's disappearance passed, Armstrong said he began to make some phone calls to see whether Drew Peterson was acting on his earlier plans. Armstrong said he called two other prominent divorce lawyers until he reached Leving's office, which confirmed the meeting. In a phone conversation, Peterson confirmed to Armstrong that he was ""getting information"" and ""exploring options."" Armstrong pressed Peterson, who responded, ""A desertion. She deserted me."" Peterson elaborated, ""I've always said that I'm mad about that. But I'm looking into this for the kids. This neighborhood is not healthy for my kids because of Sharon Bychowski."" Bychowski has been battling Peterson since his wife -- her friend and neighbor -- disappeared in October 2007. Peterson has accused Bychowski and other neighbors of harassing and threatening him. Armstrong asked Peterson whether he thought news of the divorce might encourage Stacy to contact him. ""I have nothing more to say,"" the former cop shot back. Brodsky told CNN he had not been aware that news of the meeting with the divorce lawyer had become public knowledge. ""We definitely didn't advertise it,"" he said. ""That's real thorough detective work. [Armstrong] could show police a thing or two about finding someone."" Drew Peterson said he awoke at his suburban Chicago home to find his wife gone October 28, 2007. He said she called him at 9 p.m. and announced that she was leaving him, Peterson said. Police confirm that there was some activity on Stacy Peterson's cell phone about 9 p.m. October 28, but her family and close friends say she would never leave her two children behind or go away without mentioning it to her family. In the days leading up to her disappearance, Stacy Peterson confided in friends and her sister. She said she was afraid of her husband and wanted to leave him, according to her sister, Cassandra Cales. ""If anything happens to me, he killed me. It wasn't an accident,"" Cales quoted her as saying. At 10 a.m. that Sunday, Stacy Peterson failed to show up for an appointment with a friend. Worried, Cales called police Monday, October 29, and reported her sister missing. The media frenzy and police scrutiny soon revealed that Drew Peterson's third wife had died mysteriously a few years earlier during a nasty divorce. Kathleen Savio died just before the division of the marital assets was finalized, making Drew Peterson the sole beneficiary. Savio was found in the dry bathtub of her home. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. But her family continued to insist that Savio died as a result of foul play. The investigation into Stacy Peterson's disappearance brought renewed interest in Savio's death. Authorities exhumed Savio's body, further tests were conducted, and her death has now been ruled a ""homicide staged to look like an accident."" Some witness statements portray Drew Peterson as jealous, possessive and controlling. He was said to keep such close track of his wife that he frequently called her cell phone and appeared unannounced at social outings to take her home. This caused tension in the marriage, the witnesses told police. Police named Drew Peterson as the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance in November 2007. He has not been charged in the case, but he has been charged with illegal gun possession, which could put him behind bars for up to five years if he is convicted.","Peterson says he's looking into options since wife deserted him a year ago .

"(CNN)  -- Houston Astros shortstop Miguel Tejada is expected to plead guilty Wednesday in federal court to a count of lying to Congress about his knowledge of Major League Baseball players using performance-enhancing drugs, according to officials familiar with the case. Miguel Tejada, a shortstop for the Houston Astros, has been charged with lying to Congress. In a document filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Tejada is charged in a criminal ""information,"" a document that routinely signals a plea bargain agreement. The document does not directly accuse Tejada of using steroids or other substances. However, the court document says that in 2003 Tejada gave another player more than $5,000 in checks ""for substances which he believed to be HGH [human growth hormone]."" The document says Tejada lied to congressional investigators when he told them on August 26, 2005, that he had never heard discussions about steroids by other players, and that he never knew of any other player using steroids. After the December 2007 Mitchell Report on steroid use in baseball, which appeared to contradict Tejada, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Tejada ""made knowingly false statements to the committee."" The investigators concluded he had lied. ""Defendant Tejada unlawfully withheld pertinent information from the committee because defendant Tejada before and during his interview with the committee staff, then and there well knew that Player #1 [unidentified], one of his teammates on the Oakland Athletics, had used steroids and HGH,"" the document says. Tejada played for the Athletics from 1997 to 2003. He is scheduled to appear at 11 a.m. Wednesday before a magistrate judge, indicating the charge against him will be a misdemeanor carrying a maximum sentence of a year in jail. However, a government official familiar with the case said that under sentencing guidelines, Tejada could get from zero to 6 months, which means he may receive probation without jail time. Tejada, who started his MLB career in 1997, hit at least 30 home runs from 2000 through 2004 with the exception of 2003, when he hit 27. He won the American League's most valuable player award in 2002, when he hit a career-best 34 home runs. He matched that total in 2004, his first year with the Baltimore Orioles. He began playing with Houston in 2008. The information came one day after MLB star Alex Rodriguez -- the New York Yankees' third baseman since 2004 -- admitted that he had used a ""banned substance"" during the 2001-2003 seasons. Sports Illustrated had reported that Rodriguez had tested positive for steroids in 2003, when he was playing for the Texas Rangers.","Court document: Tejada knew teammate used performance-enhancing drugs .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two-year-old Tangena Hussain vanished three months ago in the Detroit suburb of Hamtramck, Michigan, and police say the trail has gone cold. Tangena Hussain, 2, has been missing since October 2 and police in Michigan are asking for the public's help. Tangena's mother called police on the evening of October 2, 2008, to report her daughter missing after frantically searching the area where she was last seen. The child's mother, Nilufa Begum, told police she had left the girl in the care of her boyfriend, Jamrul Hussain. Although Tangena and Hussain have the same last name, he is not her father. Begum told investigators her daughter was with Hussain all day while she worked at the Northland Mall. Hussain said he stopped at a gas station with Tangena while on the way to the mall to pick up Begum. They stopped at about 9 p.m. to buy gum and juice, he said. Hussain told police he left Tangena in the car for only a few moments and when he returned, the little girl was gone. He did not call police and did not conduct a search, but instead drove to the mall and picked up Begum, investigators said. When she saw Tangena was not with Hussain, Begum asked him where she was. His response was cryptic, she told police. He said he would take her to the place where her daughter was. Begum became alarmed as Hussain drove to a gas station where, he said, Tangena disappeared. They searched for Tangena together, while Begum called the police to report her daughter missing. A surveillance camera shows the boyfriend, Hussain, going into the gas station's store, police said. On the video, he makes some purchases and leaves within a few minutes. But there is no video of the area where Hussain parked his car, nor any video that could show whether the little girl had been there or how she might have disappeared. Police have not named a person of interest in the toddler's disappearance. When the media picked up the story, a teenager came forward, saying she recognized Hussain as the man who allegedly attacked her. During the investigation, police discovered that the young accuser, then 15, had been Hussain's prior girlfriend. Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with two counts of having sex with a minor. He is free on bail while awaiting trial. ""My client is innocent of the charges. He did not have sex with a minor child,"" said Hussain's lawyer, Shawn Patrick Smith. Tangena's parents said they just want answers. Her father, Mohammad Ahmed, lives in New York and added $5,000 to an existing Crimestopper's reward of $1,000. ""We are praying that someone knows something that can help us find my daughter,"" Ahmed said. ""How can a child disappear without someone seeing something? Something doesn't fit about [Hussain's] story."" When questioned, Begun told police only she and Hussain saw Tangena in the week leading up to her October 2 disappearance. A Michigan Amber Alert was issued for Tangena at 5 a.m. the morning after she disappeared. But in the months since, police have hit a dead end. Police and family members are turning to the public for help. If anyone has seen Tangena Hussain or has any information regarding her whereabouts, please call the Detroit Police Department at 313-596-1240. Tangena is 3' 2"" tall, weighs 34 lbs, has black short hair, brown eyes, and is of East Indian descent. She was last seen wearing white cargo pants, brown long-sleeved T-shirt with a cartoon picture on the front and gold sandals.

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's daughters are moving into a house with a swimming pool, a bowling alley and its own movie theater. Sasha Obama, left, and Malia Obama will make the White House home come January 20. When their father is inaugurated on January 20, Malia Obama, 10, and Sasha Obama, 7, will also be moving into a place where they'll not only be under the watchful eye of the Secret Service but also under the eye of the media. ""One of the negatives of the White House is that its very much a fishbowl,"" presidential historian Doug Wead said. ""There's something that Sasha or Malia will say or do and they'll be remembered for it for the rest of their lives,"" said Wead, who wrote ""All the Presidents' Children,"" a book on the lives of kids at the White House.  Watch what life's like for White House kids » . Theodore Roosevelt's children used to like to drop water balloons on foreign dignitaries, Wead said. They also let their pet snake slither around the White House dining room. John F. Kennedy Jr. was known for hiding under his father's Oval Office desk. His older sister, Caroline, had a pony who romped untethered around the White House grounds. President Abraham Lincoln's youngest son, Thomas, used to startle everyone in the building by making all the White House bells ring at one time. But with the mischief and pranks comes a lifetime of pressure, said Noah McCollough, who wrote the book ""First Kids."" ""John Quincy Adams' kids went through alcoholism and addiction because they couldn't live up to their parents expectation"" in their later years, McCollough said.  Read up on the blessed and star-crossed lives of some other White House kids » . Much of Malia and Sasha's White House experience will be monitored by their mother, Michelle Obama, who seems determined to be active in their lives. Even as her husband campaigned for the presidency, Michelle Obama was a soccer mom, cheering from the sidelines of her daughters' games. ""I'm a mother first. And I'm going to be at parent-teacher conferences, and ... I'm going to be at the things that they want me to attend. I'm not going to miss a ballet recital,"" Michelle Obama said. Together with the president-elect, she'll have to decide where the girls will attend school. ""If they send their child to a private school they'll be called elitist for betraying the public school system,"" Wead said. Jacqueline Kennedy, not wanting Caroline being hounded by the media as she went to school, set up a first-grade classroom on the third floor of the White House. Ten of Caroline's friends also attended, each bringing their own lunch pail. President Jimmy Carter sent daughter Amy, age 9 when she moved to Washington, to the public Hardy Middle School. President Bill Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, attended the private Sidwell Friends School. No matter the choice, even their grades will come under public scrutiny. ""If you flunk that huge math test, it's on the front page of the newspaper the next day,"" McCollough said. But assuming no one gets grounded for bad grades, imagine the possibilities for sleepovers or parties. President Gerald Ford's daughter Susan, for example, held her senior prom at the White House. Whatever the educational choice, the Obamas have made clear their kids won't be an afterthought now that Barack Obama is about to become the world's most powerful person. On Friday morning, before the president-elect met with his advisers on the troubled economy and before his first news conference since the election scheduled for the afternoon, Barack and Michelle Obama went to a parent-teacher conference at the University of Chicago Lab School. And the girls will have company at the house on Pennsylvania Avenue.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British people love pubs -- so much, in fact, that a recent survey found that they cherish only fish and chips and the Queen more. A combination of factors including the smoking ban, higher taxes and cheap supermarket alochol are hurting pubs. Yet this enduring icon of British culture is under threat after having flourished for hundreds of years. Recent surveys found that more British pubs are closing than ever before -- victims of an indoor smoking ban, higher taxes and food prices, and changing times. Tuesday marks one year since England followed Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland to ban indoor smoking at pubs, restaurants and bars. Some feared that would mark the death of the traditional British pub in all its smoky glory -- and they were quick to blame the ban when surveys found the pub numbers in sharp decline. Those findings, released in March by the British Beer and Pub Association and CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale, showed that more than 1,400 pubs closed in 2007. That's a sharp increase from 2006, when 216 pubs closed; and 2005, when just more than 100 closed down. The advocacy groups, however, say the ban may be just one of many factors shutting pub doors.  Watch more on the decline of British pubs » . Pub owners -- landlords, as they're called in Britain -- are turning in their leases for a variety of reasons. Some say it's hard to compete with cheap alcohol sold at supermarkets, a trend increasing amid the credit crunch. Others feel they could make more money operating as a wine bar or cafe. Patrons say two things in particular have had an impact on the decline of pubs -- one being the smoking ban. Those who used to enjoy a smoke along with their pint now must smoke outside, and many pubs -- particularly in urban areas -- have little space or shelter on the sidewalk. CAMRA says, however, that the effects of the smoking ban, introduced just halfway into 2007, are ""not yet fully evident."" Pubgoers were also turned off by a boost to alcohol taxes. ""Rents and rates are shooting up,"" said Ian Lowe, a spokesman for CAMRA. ""There's also things like excise duty. The chancellor kindly put another 4 pence [8 cents] on the price of a pint, and while supermarkets can probably absorb that, the pubs have to pass it on [to the customer]."" Pubs are also passing higher food prices on to the customer, denting a plan by many proprietors to fall back on the menus to boost business. About 57,000 pubs remain in Britain, and while they may be under threat, they're not going away any time soon. A drink at ""the local"" -- where social and financial status cease to matter -- remains one of the average Briton's favorite pastimes. ""If you took a guy from the 10th Century and brought him forward in time, the only things he would recognize in the world today are churches and pubs,"" said Peter Brown, the author of ""Man Walks Into a Pub,"" a history of pubs and beer. The smoking ban may also be attracting a new kind of customer, Brown said. ""[Smokers] stopped going to the pub immediately as soon as the ban came in, whereas a lot of other people who didn't used to go to pubs have now started to come back to the pub because they now prefer a smoke-free environment,"" he said. Advocates say pubs provide a safe place to drink and are a valuable part of British culture. They are lobbying the British government to help stop their rapid decline by cutting beer taxes and changing planning laws to prevent pub demolitions. CNN's Robin Oakley contributed to this report.","Traditional British pubs are facing tough times, with 1,400 closing in 2007 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As familiar and reassuring as the map of the world is, there is only so much that physical geography can tell us about the state of the planet. Forest loss: This cartogram shows areas where the worst deforestation occured from 1990 to 2000. A new book, The Atlas of the Real World, has redrawn the map giving vivid new insights and bringing economic, social and environmental data to life. Not since the German meteorologist, Alfred Wegener, sketched out the first detailed theories of continental drift has the world appeared so misshapen, so otherworldly. The 366 cartograms (statistical maps) which make up the book twist, shrink and distend countries and continents into all sorts of shapes and sizes. The book and the accompanying Web site were devised by Daniel Dorling, professor of human geography at the UK's University of Sheffield, Anna Barford, a research associate at Sheffield and Mark Newman, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan. Work on the project began in earnest in 2006 when Dorling teamed up with Newman, who had co-created a new software technique for creating equal area cartograms the year before. With the software in place, the painstaking task of assembling the data began. The information was drawn from a variety of organizations including the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Bank. For ease of visual comparison, territories are split into 12 geographical regions -- e.g. blue for North America, brown for Northern Africa -- and shading marks out specific countries. The range of subjects is impressive, from greenhouse gas emissions, wealth and disease to more obscure data about numbers of dentists and working tractors. John Pritchard, research assistant at University of Sheffield and part of the team working on the project, told CNN: ""I think the maps of disease are particularly shocking and bring home the scale of the problem in Africa better than a table of statistics does."" Indeed, the map of malaria deaths is striking: 94 percent of deaths from malaria occur in Africa, making the continent appear like a vast bloated blob. The rest of the world is reduced to a disparate series of veiny streaks. There are other sobering statistics to consider. In June 2008, Principal Voices spoke to Head of Research at Oxfam GB Duncan Green about strategies to eradicate poverty. Green talked about the education being crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty, particularly for girls. The new atlas's Girls not at Primary School cartogram graphically illustrates the lack of female education in many parts of the developing world. Team members are currently working on a map of languages and soon hope to be producing animated maps. ""We have a series of maps that show deaths at various stages, which would be particularly suited to an animation, and we now have a PhD student looking at extending the Web site, including ways of mapping flow."" Pritchard said.","The Atlas of the Real World brings economic, social and environmental data to life .

"(CNN) -- The dramatic developments in Gaza over the past three days have driven Arab citizens to the streets, where they have displayed anger directed first and foremost at their own governments. A Yemeni protester rips through an Israeli flag in the capital, Sanaa, on Sunday, December 28. In Yemen, thousands of demonstrators gathered in the capital, Sanaa, shouting slogans in support of Gaza and its residents and burning Israeli and U.S. flags. They cried out against the League of Arab States, which delayed discussion on the crisis. One demonstrator told the Al-Jazeera network, ""The Arab League is worthless. ... They're all worthless leaders, and they should all go home."" Al-Jazeera is based in Doha, Qatar. Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Gaza for three days, in what they say is retaliation for repeated rocket attacks into southern Israel by Hamas. Hundreds of people have died, mostly Hamas militants, according to Palestinian security forces. In Sudan, the scene was similar. A woman wearing a Hamas banner around her forehead told Al-Manar TV, ""Where are the Arab leaders? Where are their actions? Enough condemnation and finger-pointing. Show Gaza your support."" Students at the University of Qatar boycotted their classes and demonstrated their support for Gaza.  Watch a report from CNN's Octavia Nasr » . One student spoke about what he saw as his moral responsibility: ""Our ancestors claimed that the news about the Palestinian disaster reached them late in 1948. We have a responsibility to our children and the future generations. We can't tell them we heard about the Gaza disaster of 2008 but didn't do anything."" Jordan's parliament held a special session in solidarity with Gaza. But one parliamentarian defied the speaker's orders and burned the Israeli flag before stepping on it in the middle of applause from some of his colleagues. The images played repeatedly on Arab media. Egypt has been the recipient of much criticism in this crisis. Hamas supporters say Egypt has sold the Palestinians out by being too close and friendly with Israel and the United States. From Egypt, political analysts retaliated, blaming Hamas for ending the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire, thus inviting the Israeli airstrikes. One expert speaking to the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya blamed Hamas for ""presenting Gazans on a silver plate to the Israeli monster."" He then blamed Syria and Iran for not taking military action to stop the bloodshed in Gaza.","In Yemen, thousands of people demonstrate in capital city of Sanaa .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Four Americans -- two soldiers and two civilians from the Defense and State departments -- were killed Tuesday in a blast that rocked a municipal building in Baghdad's Sadr City, the U.S. Embassy said. The attack also killed six Iraqis and wounded 10 others, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. A second employee from the U.S. Defense Department also died, but that person wasn't an American. The employee was a dual Italian-Iraqi national, the Italian Foreign Ministry said. The U.S. military said the blast struck a meeting of a district advisory council, a neighborhood group that looks at local needs and passes on its assessments to the provincial government. The deputy head of the council was seriously injured, the Interior Ministry official said. The U.S. military blamed Iranian-backed militants it calls Special Groups for the blast and detained three people in connection with the attack, including a suspect ""fleeing the scene [who] tested positive for explosive residue."" ""We believe the target of the attack was a high-ranking [district advisory council] member as well as the U.S. soldiers,"" said Lt. Col. Steve Stover, a U.S. military spokesman. ""We believe the Special Groups criminals were upset that the DAC member was working with coalition forces to improve the quality of life for the southern Sadr City residents."" A statement from Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, identified the slain State Department employee as Steve Farley. ""Mr. Farley was a member of our embedded Provincial Reconstruction Team for the Sadr City and Adhamiya districts of Baghdad City,"" the statement said. ""We extend our deepest condolences to their families and friends, and our profound appreciation for the ultimate sacrifice that they made in service to their country and for the people of Iraq. This is a tragic loss and one we all mourn."" The U.S. Embassy statement didn't identify the other victims. The blast dramatizes the perils the war still poses for Americans despite a Pentagon report Monday that touted a sharp decrease in violence in Iraq in recent months. The explosion also marked the third strike in two days involving local politicians and political institutions in Baghdad. A city councilman on Monday fired on U.S. forces at a municipal building southeast of the capital in the Salman Pak area and killed two soldiers. Separately, the head of Abu Dsheer City Council in Baghdad's southern Dora area was gunned down at his home later Monday. Last week, a bomb ripped through Baghdad's Hurriya district near a neighborhood advisory council meeting where U.S. troops were stationed, killing 63 people and wounding 71 others. The U.S. military also blamed that attack on a Special Groups cell, but Stover couldn't say whether it was connected to Tuesday's blast. ""Last week's event was an attempt to incite sectarian violence and hatred against the Iraqi Sunni population in an effort to keep them from returning to Hurriya,"" Stover said. Sadr City, the scene of Tuesday's deadly blast, is a stronghold of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and where some of the capital's most intense fighting in recent months has occurred between Shiite militia members and Iraqi security forces. A truce deal was reached last month between the Iraqi government and al-Sadr's followers, ending weeks of fighting and allowing the Iraqi army to enter Sadr City, but violence persists. Al-Sadr recently announced his intention to develop a new fighting force that would battle U.S.-led forces in Iraq. Many followers in al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia have heeded a long-standing cease-fire, but some rogue forces are thought to be involved in violence. ""This was the fourth meeting of this district council, led by hard-working Iraqis determined to make a difference and set Sadr City off on the right path. Special Groups are afraid of progress and afraid of empowering the people,"" Lt. Col. John Digiambatista of the 4th Infantry Division said in a news release, referring to Tuesday's attack. Twenty-five U.S. troops have died in Iraq to date this month. There have been 4,109 deaths of U.S. service members since the war began. Other developments . • Three U.S. soldiers and their Iraqi interpreter were killed Tuesday evening by a roadside bomb in northern Iraq's Nineveh Province, the U.S. military said. No other details were immediately released. • A suicide car bomb went off near a police station in central Mosul Tuesday evening, killing a child, a police officer and wounding dozens more. Police and civilians, including women and children, were among the wounded, though injury reports varied from 90 to 70 to 57, according to the U.S. Military, Mosul police and the Iraq Interior Ministry, respectively. All three sources agreed on the death toll, however. Several houses were affected by the blast, which destroyed a coffee shop in a residential area. • Earlier Tuesday, coalition troops in Mosul killed a senior-level al Qaeda in Iraq leader, the U.S. military said. The operation led to the killing of the group's ""emir"" of Mosul, the military said. A dozen people were detained in raids targeting the group in northern Iraq and Baghdad, the military said. • U.S. troops raided a Shiite militant hideout Tuesday in southeastern Baghdad's Karrada district, capturing four suspects the military said were connected to recent attacks on coalition bases. A vehicle bomb being built in the hideout was destroyed, according to a coalition statement. • Anbar province will soon be run by the Iraqi military. The U.S. military said it is transferring security responsibility this week to the Iraqis. Anbar is the 10th of the 18 provinces where Iraqi forces have taken charge of security control since 2003 and the first largely Sunni Arab province to do so.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy submarine and a Navy amphibious ship that collided Friday in the Strait of Hormuz south of Iran have arrived in Bahrain to be assessed for damage, the Navy said. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans are shown in Navy photos. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans arrived Saturday in Mina Salman pier to ""to further assess and evaluate the damage that resulted from their collision at sea,"" the service said in a written statement. Fifteen sailors were slightly hurt aboard the Hartford in the collision, which occurred early Friday morning. On Friday, Navy officials in Washington told CNN that there was significant damage to the sail, or tower-like structure on the topside of the submarine. On Saturday, the Navy said there was no damage to the submarine's propulsion unit. No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans. The ship's fuel tank ruptured, spilling 25,000 gallons of marine diesel fuel in the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy said in the Saturday statement. ""Aerial searches of the area where the fuel spill occurred were conducted yesterday, and revealed no indication of any remaining fuel on the ocean's surface,"" the Navy said. ""The quick dissipation of the fuel is likely due to the type of fuel, and various environmental factors to include air and water temperatures, winds and seas."" When the collision occurred, both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation, Navy spokesman Lt. Nate Christensen said Friday. Christensen said there were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship. The Strait of Hormuz is located between the United Arab Emirates and Iran, linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. It is heavily used by oil tankers. Both vessels are on regularly scheduled deployments to the U.S. Navy Central Command area of responsibility, and conduct Maritime Security Operations.","Vessels in Bahrain ""to further assess and evaluate the damage,"" says Navy .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Corporate lobbyists may have to jockey for attention alongside smaller, grassroots organizations under new ethics rules issued by President-elect Barack Obama's transition team, one analyst says. President-elect Obama's rules will mean nonprofits will have an easier time being heard, an analyst says. Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University professor who teaches lobbyists-in-training, said nonprofit groups are likely to have a stronger voice under the restrictions that  Obama's transition staff issued this week. ""Lobbyists for business will absolutely get meetings with staff for people on the Hill, just like they got meetings before, so their access will not be denied,"" Feldblum said. ""Their positions will be heard, but now they won't be the only ones being heard."" The rules, which transition co-chairman John Podesta announced Tuesday, bar federal lobbyists from contributing to or raising money for the transition effort. Those who leave the transition team will be barred for a year from lobbying the incoming administration on matters related to their transition jobs, and current lobbyists who join the team are barred for 12 months from working in policy fields related to their lobbying work. Podesta called the new policy ""the strictest, the most far-reaching ethics rules of any transition team in history."" They follow a pledge Obama made during his campaign, when he instituted similar rules for aides and vowed that lobbyists ""will not drown out the voice of the American people."" Feldblum said lobbying is protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, and that the trade's ranks in Washington are unlikely to shrink. But she said corporate lobbyists ""will have to share the stage with other people representing other points of view."" ""I think that lobbyists for a broader range of the American public -- lobbyists for Catholic Charities USA, lobbyists for the Epilepsy Foundation, lobbyists for domestic violence groups -- people trying to bring those positions forward will have an easier time being heard,"" Feldblum said. One practicing lobbyist told CNN he hopes the new rules will improve the public image of a trade that has become a ""dirty word."" Michael Lewan, who has pleaded the case for some of the biggest U.S. corporations for 16 years, said a stricter regime Congress imposed on itself after the influence-peddling scandal involving disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff ""wasn't such a bad thing at all."" ""We were all very upset when we found out we could no longer take Capitol Hill staffers to lunch,"" he said. ""But you know what? At the end of the day, we all saved money and lost weight."" But seriously, Lewan said, both Obama and his Republican opponent, John McCain, blasted lobbyists on a near-daily basis during the presidential campaign, ""and it's my hope that we can bring down that level of vilification by cooperating with the new administration.""","Analyst: Corporate lobbyists will not be only ones heard by Obama's transition staff .

"(CNN) -- Imagine the entire population of Kentucky forced out of their homes in the past 25 years, with many of the residents moving to a neighboring country. Displaced children at a camp in El Barrancon, Colombia, earlier this year. That's what has happened in Colombia, a country of 45 million where up to 4 million people -- roughly the population of Kentucky -- have been forced to flee fighting between government forces and an entrenched Marxist rebel group. So many Colombians have taken flight to escape violence that the nation has the second largest number of internally displaced people in the world -- surpassed only by Sudan in Africa. Oftentimes, the violence is not incidental. ""Violence against civilians is a strategy of war for all the parties involved in the warfare,"" said Ellen Beattie, who worked for relief agencies in Colombia for 15 years. ""That's the problem. They do it on purpose. They use it as a strategy. Vicious."" Exact figures are hard to come by. Reliefweb, a United Nations Web site that provides information to humanitarian relief organizations, says nearly 400,000 Colombians were displaced last year. The Colombian government puts the number of displaced at 255,000 for 2008. Likewise, the Colombian government says nearly 3 million citizens have been displaced inside the country in the past few decades. But the non-governmental Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacements, known in Colombia as CODHES, estimates more than 4 million people have had to leave their homes since the 1980s. Mauricio de Vengoechea, a political analyst with the Newlink Group consulting firm, says about 200,000 Colombians have ended up in Ecuador, which has granted 5,500 residency permits in the past eight weeks. At the heart of the violence lies a guerrilla war with the Colombian government and paramilitary groups on one side and the FARC, which is the Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, on the other. The FARC has been waging war against the government since the 1960s and has major strongholds in the jungles of southwest Colombia, near the 366-mile (590-kilometer) border with Ecuador. Narcotraffickers also have strongholds in the area and are often allied with the FARC, who provide security and intelligence. Many times the rebels and the narcotraffickers are one and the same. The guerrillas use drug money to buy weapons. ""There are large parts of Colombia where the state has no presence, no police, no army, nothing,"" said Myles Frechette, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia from 1994 to 1997. ""That's where the narcotraffickers hang out."" That makes it valuable territory for the guerrillas and narcos, said Beattie, executive director of the International Rescue Committee office in Atlanta, Georgia. ""They're more willing to fight over land that is strategic,"" she said. ""You've poured gasoline on the fire with that."" As the army, paramilitaries and the guerrillas fight for territory -- often retaking land one side or the other had held before -- the civilian population gets caught in the middle. When one side comes in, Beattie said, everyone living in the area is suspected of having collaborated with the enemy. That sometimes leads to massacres, or at least kidnappings and death threats. ""The majority of displacements in Colombia are not because of combat, but because people are directly threatened,"" said Gustavo Valdivieso, spokesman in Colombia for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""They are told, 'Leave or be killed.'"" Many times, indigenous populations in far-flung places suffer the most. That's what happened earlier this year to the Awa tribe in southwest Colombia. The FARC admitted in an Internet statement that guerrillas ""executed"" eight people February 6 in the town of Rio Bravo because the rebels believed the Indians were gathering information to give to the Colombian military. The Human Rights Watch organization said the guerrillas tortured some of the Awa before killing them with knives. Luis Evelis Andrade of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia said the FARC had targeted the Awa because the Indians don't want to get involved in the armed struggle and refuse to reveal information on government troop actions. He said the FARC had abducted 120 Awa in February and killed 44. ""We are very worried about the Awa community,"" said Monsignor Gustavo Giron Higuita, the bishop of the city of Tumaco. ""It is a community that is pretty unprotected and that in the past five years has received a type of persecution by armed groups."" The Colombian government has issued a ""risk report"" warning that civilians in the region are in danger, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees proclaimed an alert this week about threats against human rights workers. A U.N. report notes that displacement disproportionately affects Colombia's poorest citizens, and their lives get worse after they are forced to flee. One of every two displaced Colombians is unemployed and a similar number live in makeshift homes made of cloth, cardboard or wood, says the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. More than three-fourths of children who leave school after being displaced never return. Then there's the issue of forced conscription. According to Reliefweb, between 12,000 and 14,000 minors have been forced to join armed groups. Valdivieso, the U.N. spokesman in Colombia, notes that displaced residents have lost about 15 million acres (6 million hectares). That's an area about the size of West Virginia. ""You have displaced people living in hunger in the cities of Colombia while they still have property,"" Valdivieso said. Displacement occurs when people move within a country. When they leave the country, they become refugees. The problem occurs among all segments of Colombian society. The political class is often hit hard. Ramiro Echeverri was among 12 regional lawmakers the FARC kidnapped on April 11, 2002, in Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. The rebels killed him and 10 others on June 18, 2007, when a Colombian army patrol came upon the camp in which the hostages were being held. When the bodies were recovered three months later, autopsies showed most had been shot several times in the back. Echeverri's son, also named Ramiro, was a doctor in Cali at the time. ""We buried him and the next day we left the country,"" he said. He, his wife and younger sister first went to Ecuador, where they lived for two months before securing passage to Atlanta, where he works as a neurological researcher for the Emory University School of Medicine. His mother stayed behind but visits often, especially after the birth of her granddaughter, Rafaela, four months ago. Echeverri, 28, has been in the United States for 16 months but still harbors hopes to return. ""Of course,"" he said. ""It is a very good country. I believe there will be a solution. Once there is, I will go back."" Atlanta resident Ibonne Pinilla Martinez, 25, tells a similar story. Her father was a politician in Palmira, in southwest Colombia about 17 miles east of Cali. He started receiving threats and some colleagues were kidnapped. They first moved around inside Colombia, living in three cities over a two-year period. She, her parents and a younger sister then lived in Costa Rica for five years before moving to Atlanta two years ago, the soft-spoken Pinilla said. ""There is always fear when someone makes threats,"" she said. She, too, holds expectations of returning some day. ""We will wait for the right time and for all that to end,"" Pinilla said. Many refugees end up in Ecuador because it's the nearest country to the killing fields of southwestern Colombia. Some are forced there by the fighting. ""Over the course of the past five years, the FARC has been pushed back into Colombia's less densely populated jungle regions and across the Ecuadorian border,"" said Patrick Esteruelas, an analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm. ""More and more citizens in southern Colombia have been forced out and had nowhere else to go but Ecuador."" Beattie, the aid agency official, has noticed the same phenomena. ""The Colombians go across where the violence pushes them that way,"" she said. ""Often, that's the only direction they can go."" Ecuador has started incorporating the displaced Colombians, giving residency status to 5,500 in the past few weeks. That may seem surprising, given the poor standing between the countries. Ecuador broke diplomatic relations with Colombia in March 2008 and amassed troops along the border after a Colombian military attack against a FARC camp inside Ecuador. The attack killed 25 people, including rebel leader Raul Reyes, four Mexicans and an Ecuadorian. No country in the area is afraid of Ecuador, says Frechette, the former U.S. ambassador. Neither is the FARC. ""Ecuador is a very weak state. It's lost 60 percent of its territory since its independence (in 1822),"" he said. ""Ecuador is a little guy who gets pushed around by everybody."" Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa used the tension to forge national unity when he successfully ran for re-election in April 2009, said Vengoechea. ""It was more convenient for President Correa to be an enemy of Colombia than a friend of Colombia,"" Vengoechea said. ""Now both sides have been trying to find common points to restore diplomatic relationships,"" Esteruelas said. The issue of residency visas, he said, ""is one such point."" Ecuador also may have felt the need to do something about the FARC. ""Ecuadorians are also under a lot of pressure since allegations that the FARC was coming across the border and Ecuador has been looking the other way,"" said Esteruelas. ""Ecuador is under pressure to register all Colombian immigrants coming in to prevent Colombian rebels from coming into Ecuador unregistered and unnoticed.""","Colombian civilians caught in cross fire between rebels, government forces .

"(CNN) -- When the water of Lake Delton ripped through the highway and drained into the Wisconsin River this week, so did the lifeline for much of the surrounding community. Boats sit mired in mud Tuesday after Lake Delton drained into the Wisconsin River the day before. Lake Delton Village and Wisconsin Dells, the self-professed ""waterpark capital of the world,"" are home to about 5,000 residents. But the area's motels, resorts and vacation homes can accommodate more than 10 times that, according to the visitors bureau. Innkeepers, restaurateurs and other business owners were getting ready for the typically bustling tourist season this week when torrential rains sent the 267-acre lake rushing through an embankment propping up Highway A. The manmade lake sucked a 200-foot swath of highway and a half-dozen homes into the Wisconsin with it. ""I was on the water when I realized the plug had been pulled,"" said Steve Zowin, who was towing a capsized pontoon boat when he noticed the water level quickly diminishing. ""It drained like a bathtub.""  Watch a report from the lake » . Zowin and his wife, Kathy, have owned Lake Delton Watersports for almost three decades. In addition to running a marina, the couple offers parasail rides and rents boats. Personal watercraft and ski boats are their most popular wares, he said. ""My gross income will be reduced by about 75 percent, and that's huge,"" he said Wednesday. ""It's a big step backwards for someone who's been in business for 29 years."" Zowin, 56, says that most of the tourists hail from metropolises like Chicago, Illinois; St. Paul/Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- all ""within a gas tank of the Dells."" They start trickling in on Father's Day, and tourism booms between Independence Day and mid-August, he said. Like many business owners around Lake Delton, Zowin is seeing canceled reservations from disenchanted visitors who will be spending their summers elsewhere. Asked whether visitors were canceling reservations at her lakeside resort, one owner who didn't want to give her name replied, ""Every day, many."" Thomas Brown, who owns Port Vista, a popular burger and steak joint on the lake, said that one of his resort-owner friends has refunded $10,000 in deposits for canceled reservations. The friend has closed his resort until at least July, Brown said. iReport.com: Are you near the floods? Send photos, video . Brown, 49, who has owned the bar and restaurant for 15 years, said business hasn't been hit hard yet. ""The first couple of days has been absolutely packed because of all the people coming by to look at the lake and stopping by for a burger or steak,"" he said, adding that he doesn't expect business to boom for long. ""I think when people see what they have to see, it's going to be not so good."" Some business owners who aren't on the lakefront are still trying to gauge what effect the drained lake will have on them.  Watch the rushing lake carry a home away » . Del-Bar is a popular seafood and steak restaurant near the lake on Wisconsin Dells Parkway. It's so popular, in fact, that actor Johnny Depp and director Michael Mann recently stopped in during filming of their upcoming movie ""Public Enemies,"" owner Jeff Wimmer said. Wimmer said his restaurant, which he has owned for 30 years, may be more resilient than lakefront businesses because he relies more on Wisconsin Dells locals. The 66-year-old knows that the summer brings hungry tourists; it's just too early to tell how many of them have been deterred by the dry lake bed. ""We're anticipating that it's going to affect us, but it's too early to tell right now,"" Wimmer said. How long the lake will remain dry is also a question. Business owners say, some skeptically, that there are efforts afoot to refill the lake by mid-July. Delton Oaks Resort ran a warning on its Web site to potential guests, explaining that there was no timetable for refilling the lake and repairing the highway. But the resort's owners showed they still have a sense of humor. ""We at Delton Oaks Resort are 'make lemonade' kind of people, so we will be adding terrific beach volleyball and horseshoe courts in the near future. And, of course, building sand castles on the beach will be big this year,"" the site quipped. ""For all you dog lovers, as soon as the last of the lake bed has dried up, we will have the biggest dog park you've ever seen."" Even if the lake is refilled quickly, business owners like Zowin and Brown fear that the lake's splendid fishing might not make a rapid rebound. The lake was home to white and largemouth bass, walleye, crappie, bluegill and perch, but those fish are now in the Wisconsin River after their habitat burst through the Highway A embankment. ""Fishing might be gone for the next four or five years,"" Brown predicted. Business owners around Lake Delton say they hope to bounce back sooner, perhaps by next summer, but this summer may be a wash. ""Once in a while, the more serious ramifications -- mostly financial -- they hit me, and I'm flooded with a few emotions,"" Zowin said. ""It's going to hurt, but I'll survive.""","Lake Delton went away as businesses were getting ready for busy tourist season .

Her work will be featured on Google's main site for 24 hours on Thursday. The theme of this year's contest was ""What I Wish for the World."" ""Both our country and the world are undergoing significant change,"" Google said on the contest's Web pages. At Google we believe in thinking big, and dreaming big, and we can't think of anything more important than encouraging students to do the same."" ""A New Beginning,"" the title of Christin's doodle, depicts the Google logo as a land and sea naturescape intertwined with trees, a frog and leaping dolphin, a curious lizard, a turtle and fish, and a butterfly set against an orange and yellow background with a rising sun represented by the second ""O"" in ""Google."" In an interview with CNN, Christin said she portrayed a dawn as a symbol of a new day. Her wish was that ""out of the current crisis, discoveries will be found to help the Earth prosper once more."" She added that wanted to portray a brighter tomorrow and ""discoveries being made lead to a better Earth for everyone."" Christin said her initial idea for a doodle was for animal conservation, but then she decided ""it shouldn't just include animals; it should include the rest of the world."" Christin did check out her competition, and said she thought the other doodles were ""much better than mine."" But a panel of independent judges and Google employees, along with close to 6 million online voters, disagreed, and chose her sketch as the overall winner from a field of over 28,000 other submissions. Google's Marissa Mayer, vice president of search products and user experience, and Dennis Hwang, webmaster manager, said on the Google Blog that Christin's design was part of ""a very creative pool of doodles."" As the national winner, Christin will receive a $15,000 college scholarship, a laptop, and a $25,000 technology grant for her school, in addition to having her artwork featured on the Google site. She was presented with her award at the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York City, where Google also unveiled an exhibit of the top doodles. They will be on display until July 5. National finalists also were selected in three grade groups. Each will receive a laptop computer. All winners were treated to a day in New York that Google said ""included activities which promote peace, sustainability and wellness -- all inspired by this year's theme."" The winners also will participate in a doodling class led by Dennis Hwang and the Google doodle team. Grand prize winner Christin -- who told CNN she was excited to visit New York City -- said she's been ""drawing for as long as she can remember."" When she grows up, she said, she hopes to do ""anything to do with art.""","San Antonio, Texas, 12-year-old wins ""Doodle for Google"" national contest .

"ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia (CNN) -- Standing slightly more than 4 feet tall, 9-year-old Tuguldur proudly stated the greatest challenge he faced in a horse race across the Mongolian plains in the country's annual Naadam Festival was serenading his horse. Young wrestlers cheer on teammates during the opening round at the Naadam Festival. ""The hardest part of the race was singing to my horse while riding,"" said Tuguldur, wiping perspiration from the July sun off his face. The long-distance horse race is exclusively for children, ranging in ages from 6 to 12. Riding up to 30 kilometers (19 miles), these children maneuver their galloping steeds on a thin saddle pad that often does not have stirrups. ""Mongolians believe they can communicate with their horses through singing, and their horse will go faster,"" said Tamir, a senior at Mongolian University. ""This is why the kids must keep singing during the race."" Singing to racing horses is just one part of Mongolia's Naadam Festival, an annual event believed to have existed for centuries, and rivaling the Olympics as the premier sporting event in the central Asian nation. ""For us Mongolians, the Naadam Festival is what we look forward to all year,"" said Dashtsogtsol Erdenetuya, who has competed in the Naadam Festival for the past 22 years. ""It is our tradition and a reminder of an ancient way of life. Getting gold in this festival brings as much honor as any Olympic medal."" Held every July, the Naadam Festival was possibly founded as long ago as 800 years ago by Genghis Khan. The festival is believed to have started as a way for Mongols to train for military and hunting expeditions. Today, it formally commemorates the 1921 revolution when Mongolia declared itself a free country. Many of Naadam's customs, which include wearing traditional clothes and singing hymns once sung in battle, are still followed, a sign of the importance of the festival. ""In the Naadam Festival, everyone knows who you are; many companies will sponsor you, and if you win, you can become the face of the country,"" said Nasanbat Oyunbat, director of the Mongolian Olympic National Team. ""The Olympics are only now becoming popular in Mongolia and were televised for the first time in the 2004 Games in Athens."" ""The horses in the Naadam Festival have higher endurance than the horses that will compete in the Olympic Equestrian events in August,"" bragged Edward Rochette, an American lawyer who married a Mongolian woman and is living in Ulaanbaatar. ""Most thoroughbreds would die if you ran them for 30 km. The Mongolian horses have been running across these plains for hundreds of years and have developed the correct body type for this kind of sport."" Rochette's wife's family lives in a yurt (round animal skin tent), owns more than 1,500 and entered 20 horses in the three-day race competition this year, which was visited by thousands of tourists. ""I was overwhelmed watching the clouds of dust rise across the prairie as the horses galloped to the finish line,"" explained Miep Thulijls, a tourist from Holland. ""I could not believe these tiny kids could ride for so long and was terrified when I saw one of the children fall off his horse like a rag doll."" The age limit was raised from 4 to 6 after a child was killed in a race a few years ago. Only small children are allowed to compete in this event because they are particularly light. The kids are generally rewarded with warm mare's milk and candy while the horse owners get money and sometimes even cars. Wrestling without weight limits . Mongolian wrestling has no weight divisions; a time limit was only introduced after a match went on for more than four hours. Wrestlers compete in single elimination events and are weeded down from 512 participants during nine rounds of competition. ""It is more difficult to wrestle the little guys because they are so quick,"" complained Gantogtokh, who at 130 kilos (286 pounds) is an eighth-generation wrestler. His father placed second in Judo in the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico. Dressed in tight blue shorts and a half shirt, which is usually red or blue, the wrestlers dance around the judges in slow graceful sways and then pay homage to the nine flags dating back to Genghis Khan before and after each match. It is rumored that the dress code, which requires wrestlers to compete without shirts was imposed after a female participated in the event disguised as a man. Many of the male athletes who compete in the free style wrestling and judo events in the Olympic Games were once Naadam Festival winners. But, the Olympic gold medal hopeful this year is a female Judo wrestler. ""Each generation of wrestlers gets stronger as they have more opportunities to work out,"" Gantogtokh said. ""I hope this year we will bring home a gold in Judo and wrestling. But, the competition is going to be tough."" Arrows to anklebones . Other athletes participated in archery and anklebone shooting. ""This has always been my dream,"" beamed Dashtsogtsol Erdenetuya, 36, who has competed in the Naadam Festival for the past 22 years. ""I placed second the past three years and finally came in first this time. My mother was a champion in 1969 and 1975 and taught me everything I know about archery."" Archery is usually the only event in which women compete. Men shoot from 75 meters and women from 65 meters. Mongolians sing to the archers and stand on either side of the targets. The singers, dressed in elaborate decor, sing three different types of songs, including an invitational song and songs that recognize a good or bad shot. Famous for his ability to shoot backward on horseback, Genghis Khan created the sport of anklebone shooting to strengthen the middle finger of his soldiers, so they would be better skilled in archery. Anklebone shooting is the newest event in the Naadam Festival, only becoming an official sport in 2000. ""The game is becoming more modern now,"" explained Khatanbator, 56, an anklebone participant."" Competitors now use pieces of deer antler instead of anklebones. It is easier on the wrist to flick than anklebones. But, everyone still refers to the sport as anklebone shooting because it has been this way for hundreds of years."" The competitors are divided into teams of eight who compete against each other. The first to knock all the deer chips down wins. ""People cheer for the other competitor like fans would in a soccer game,"" explained Berkfat Tumenjin, a Mongolian tour guide. ""While the singing in other events is used to encourage competitors, the singing in this event is used to distract them.""","Naadam Festival is held every July in Mongolia .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Flowers arrived at Capt. Marissa Alexander's office at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on June 3, 2005. Arlington's Section 60 is the final resting place for many casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her husband, Staff Sgt. Leroy Alexander, was half a world away fighting with the Special Forces in Afghanistan, but he had found a way to send a floral arrangement to his wife, who was five months pregnant with twins. ""He called me and asked me what building I worked in. He said he had to update some records,"" Alexander said. The flowers lifted her spirits. But a few hours later, her emotions would be thrown into a tailspin. Alexander saw two Army officers in dress uniforms knock on her front door. One of the officers started to talk: ""We regret to inform you..."" If he said any more, Alexander doesn't remember. ""The next memory I have is in my kitchen, banging on the floor. I just couldn't believe it,"" she said. The good feelings from flowers delivered a few hours before were gone, replaced by shock, pain and mourning. A roadside bomb had made her a widow. Staff Sgt. Alexander now lies in Arlington National Cemetery's Section 60, where 500 soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. For years Section 60 has been the one of busiest parts of the cemetery. Every day new burials bring precision marches, the somber tones of taps and the nerve-rattling three-gun salutes.  Watch how widows connect at Section 60 » . Then there are family and friends who come to the graves to make an emotional connection to their lost loved ones. Memorial Day weekend brings even more activity and more visitors. Adults, even some uniformed generals, walk slowly between the rows and rows of headstones, looking for a familiar name. But small children often seem to find the cemetery a place to explore, even play. Their smiles and curiosity remind grown-ups that even in a place synonymous with death, life goes on. A sense of community has emerged in Section 60. ""I've come here at times and I've met people who were paying remembrances to their loved ones. You become friendly,"" Capt. Alexander said. ""You see each other sometimes and you make a friendship because you know that your loved ones died for the same cause."" Angie Capra's husband is buried a few yards from Leroy Alexander. Air Force Tech Sgt. Anthony Capra was an explosive ordnance disposal expert, killed trying disarm a bomb in Iraq. ""Other widows will come by and put something on there for me if they don't see me. They'll put down flowers. It's kind of a community,"" Capra said. More than flowers adorn the graves in Section 60. Visitors of all faiths have picked up the ancient Jewish tradition of leaving a small stone on the headstones to show that a visitor had been to the grave. In most cases these are pebbles found near the grave. But some people have taken to leaving colored glass beads or elaborately painted stones with shamrocks or words like ""hero.""  View images from Section 60 » . Capra recently found a small Yoda figure on her husband's grave. She doesn't know who left it, but it must have been a friend, because her husband loved ""Star Wars."" ""We never know who puts stuff"" on the headstone, she said. Some mementos leave one to wonder about the story behind them. Like the headstone topped by a tiny bottle of Tabasco hot sauce. Or a set of dog tags with a name that didn't match the name on the headstone.  Watch how friends say goodbye to a fallen soldier » . There is another topped by a small Lego toy, perhaps left by a child whose father died in a far-off land before they even knew each other. Or the grave adorned with an empty bottle of Bud Light, a rubber duck and a candle. Nearby an empty Wild Turkey bottle is the lone addition to the grave of a soldier who died in a country where drinking alcohol is strictly forbidden. Capra has found a variety of items on Tony's headstone. ""Coins, lots of rocks, candy. My husband was a candy freak,"" Capra said. ""There was a cross. A little necklace, Mardi Gras beads during Mardi Gras season. Anything they have they'll put on top to show that they are thinking about them at the time."" Alexander seems to draw strength from the items she finds. ""Someone came and did a picture of Lee, and it was a hand-drawn picture. I thought that was very interesting,"" she said. ""People who haven't been seen in years will leave a note of some sort. It's nice to know that you've been remembered after all of this time. To know that we have friends who still love and support us, that is just wonderful."" Section 60 has been called the ""saddest acre in America,"" and without a doubt sadness abounds. But so do comfort, support and even an occasional smile.","National cemetery's Section 60 holds dead from Iraq, Afghanistan wars .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In Russia, a country often associated with consumption of mass amounts of vodka, men have an average life expectancy of just 60 years -- one of the lowest in Europe. Men in Russia have an average life expectancy of just 60 years. Life expectancy for Russian men is well below that of western European countries like Germany, where men have an average life span of 77 years, according to World Health Organization figures. ""The biggest health problem facing Russia is the very high level of mortality among working aged men,"" says Martin McKee, an expert in Russian public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. A new dynamism appears to be taking hold of Russia as it aims to raise its prominence on the world stage. Despite having benefited from a boom in commodities prices before the global economy hit the skids, health indicators like life expectancy have shown marginal improvement. Life expectancy for men has stagnated for quite some time, and a major culprit has been high levels of alcohol consumption. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, alcohol and tobacco use have risen, as Russians have struggled to adapt to economic change, health experts say. The transition from a system of state ownership to a market-oriented economy has not been easy for many Russians, according to Mireia Jofre-Bonet, a health economist at City University London. When the Soviet Union fell and the state disappeared, unemployment soared, and a significant portion of the population was pushed into poverty, she told CNN. Research suggests that those most vulnerable to alcoholism tend to be men with the lowest levels of education and the unemployed. A typical 18-year-old in the West has a 90 percent probability of reaching retirement age, but for young men in Russia the odds are reduced to 50 percent, says McKee. Alcoholism tends to be less of a problem among Russian women -- who have a higher average life expectancy of  73 -- but they face an equally worrisome health threat. There has been a big increase in smoking among women, who are being targeted by tobacco companies, says McKee. Traditionally, rates of smoking among Russian women have been very low, but now, he says, almost 30 percent among those under 30 smoke. ""Ten years of adjusting to a new regime created lots of stress,"" says Jofre-Bonet. The resulting rise in alcohol and tobacco abuse have led to ailments like heart disease and cancer. Besides chronic conditions, epidemics of infectious disease, including tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, have added to the country's health woes. In the 1990s, Russia experienced a resurgence of tuberculosis, considered a disease of poverty. Since then the growth of new cases has slowed, but strains of the disease that can't be treated with the usual drugs continue to pose a serious public health threat. Meanwhile, the number of people living with HIV in Russia has more than doubled since 2001. While largely confined to injecting drug users, HIV remains a challenge. Lack of needle exchange programs has curbed efforts to combat the spread of the disease, says Annabel Kanabus, director of international AIDS charity AVERT. ""The crisis is still going on. Efforts at prevention are not really working."" The Russian government is attempting to tackle its health challenges. The alcohol problem improved briefly in 2006 after federal restrictions were applied to the sale of non-beverage alcohols, such as aftershave, which are commonly drunk, McKee says. But he added, there is a major challenge in ensuring that law is enforced everywhere. And while the Kremlin has invested in upgrading technical equipment in recent years, facilities are still not well equipped to deal with high levels of chronic conditions such as high blood pressure. The economic downturn isn't helping. Anxiety levels are rising as a result of soaring unemployment, and the government doesn't have enough funds to meet the needs of the health system. ""There is no money. It's a big mess,"" says Jofre-Bonet. ""The health care system cannot pay for what it needs and there is a lot of corruption in the way of under the table payments for medicines or doctors that legally people should get for free.""","Russian men face startlingly low average life expectancy of just 60 years .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Four British Coastguard helicopters of the same model as the one that crashed off Canada last week have been grounded in Scotland to replace a gearbox mounting part, and all those models worldwide are expected to be grounded as well. Sikorsky's Web site says the S-92 ""is the most advanced aircraft""  in its civil product line. This move comes after the Transportation Safety Board of Canada indicated on Friday that the components must be replaced on Sikorsky-92 A helicopters across the globe. The Canadian agency said the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will issue an emergency airworthiness directive, effectively grounding all Sikorsky S-92 A helicopters worldwide until the parts are replaced. On March 12, 17 people died when a Sikorsky S-92 A operated by Cougar Helicopters crashed or ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. One person survived. Canada's transportation board on Friday said investigators found a broken main gearbox component that had been addressed in a January alert from Sikorsky. Sikorsky's alert, on January 28, said the ""main gearbox filter bowl assembly mounting titanium studs should be replaced with steel mounting studs."" This ""one-time modification"" was to be done within 1,250 flight hours or within a year of the alert's issue date. According to Britain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Sikorsky on Friday notified helicopter contractor CHC that aircraft operating out of Stornoway and Shetland in Scotland need the ""urgent modification."" The British agency said that when it is clear how long the helicopters will be grounded or need to undergo engineering work, the agency ""will take a decision on implementing a contingency plan for longer term air coverage. The aircraft on the south coast are unaffected.""","Canadian authorities warn Sikorsky-92 A helicopters need gearbox part replaced .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Staff Sgt. Cody Reeves has survived harrowing conditions and stared down enemies on the battlefield during two tours in the military hotspots of Iraq. Staff. Sgt. Cody Reeves works out with his fellow Old Guard soldiers. Now he is stationed near Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, trained to carry the remains of fellow soldiers who perished in that same conflict. Before,""it was all about catching the bad guy,"" Reeves said. ""When you come here, it's all about honoring your brothers who are fallen for catching the bad guys, for their service."" Reeves serves in the Army's Old Guard, a tight-knit group of soldiers of similar height and size who physically bear the weight of the Army's fallen veterans. The Old Guard conducts a 15-minute ceremony called a dignified transfer. A recent decision by Defense Secretary Robert Gates gives families the choice to allow media to film the solemn event. It's the first time in 20 years the ceremony has been open to the press.  Watch members of the Old Guard in action » . Every detail of the transfer is precise. When an American soldier dies overseas, the Old Guard is called into action. They travel from their base to Dover, where they meet the aircraft carrying the soldier's body. The six men receive the flag-draped casket, which can weigh 500 pounds, and carry the soldier's body to a waiting vehicle. Women serve as officers in charge on the Army transfer teams, but do not carry the caskets. For Air Force transfers, which use eight people, women help carry the coffin. Despite the cold or the heat, the late hour when the planes often arrive and the physical and emotional strain of their job, the soldiers keep their faces blank. ""There's definitely times where your mind goes off, even in the ceremony,"" said Spc. Wilbert Steinborn, another member of the Old Guard. ""You say, 'This guy might have a wife or kids or mother or father who's never going to see him again.' ""You can't let it show. Inside you might feel it, and definitely a human's going to feel that -- they're going to feel that emotion. But you can't show that on the outside,"" Steinborn said. The men stifle sneezes, learn to yawn through their noses and betray no sign of the burden they carry. And -- what they say makes keeping their composure even more important -- the team performs its duties in front of the soldiers' families. ""We're soldiers too. We're infantrymen. We could easily be in their place,"" Steinborn said. ""It's hard because you honestly think you see your wife or your girlfriend sitting where the next-of-kin is. You can imagine yourself being there.... So I think that's why we try to be as precise and exact, and look as good, and make them look as good as possible."" Some of the Old Guard choose to learn about the lives of the soldiers they've carried. Reeves asks for information about the fallen after having participated in the ceremonies, but never before he greets the soldier's body. ""It's 'take care of business' and then afterwards I like to know a little bit about the soldier,"" he said. ""That way you can keep emotions at bay and you're just focused on doing the soldier part."" Strikingly, the men, who head to their barracks' gym for intense weight training twice a day and take five-mile runs as a team, seem to be able to communicate without speaking. After drilling for countless hours on the base's grounds, they can feel if another man is even minutely out of step in the ceremony. Sometimes they'll whisper corrections so discreetly no onlooker would ever notice. The nature of their job means the men also share a tighter, unspoken bond. ""When I was walking through the aircraft and saw the transfer case with the American flag draped over it, it was -- it was very emotional,"" Steinborn said. ""I don't know if it sadness or pride or what, but -- it was honestly the most difficult and touching thing that I have ever done.""","""It's all about honoring your brothers who are fallen,"" Reeves says .

"(CNN) -- President Obama delivered the commencement address Friday to the U.S. Naval Academy's graduating class, speaking to an audience of 30,000 that included a former presidential candidate and proud parent of one of the graduates in attendance. Jack McCain shakes hands with President Obama at Friday's commencement ceremony. John Sidney McCain IV, more commonly known as Jack, on Friday became the fourth McCain to graduate from the Annapolis, Maryland, service academy and the fourth with the same name. ""America, look at these young men and women. Look at these sailors and Marines. Here are the values that we cherish. Here are the ideals that endure,"" Obama told the crowd. About midday at the academy's commissioning and graduation ceremony, McCain received a Bachelor of Science degree, taking the oath of office and being commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Navy 103 years after his great-grandfather did the same.  Watch Obama hug John McCain's son » . With parents John and Cindy McCain watching, he shook hands with the president and then walked back into the crowd to applause and more hugs. Joe McCain told CNN that his brother plans to join his father and great-grandfather as naval aviators. ""His grandfather, JSM Jr., was in submarines, commanding three different boats in World War II,"" he said. That grandfather later became Adm. McCain and was commander of the Pacific Theater during the Vietnam War, when Jack's father, now Arizona Sen. John McCain, was being held as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. In an interview last year with GoMids.com, Jack McCain reflected on the advice his father gave him on the day he arrived at the Naval Academy. ""My dad told me there is one thing McCains are good at, and that is not giving in to pressure, and honor -- keeping our honor regardless of what happens,"" Jack McCain said. ""He then said, 'Don't lie, cheat or steal -- anything else is fair game.' "" John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, frequently poked fun at his record at the Naval Academy while on the campaign trail, pointing out that he ""stood fifth from the bottom"" of his class and racked up dozens of demerits. At a campaign event last October, McCain joked that Jack needed a ""DNA check"" because he had yet to receive a single demerit. (Jack McCain told GoMids.com that he did accumulate some demerits -- for wearing flip-flops outside and forgetting to shave). McCain told Fox News on Thursday that his son is graduating ""in better class standing than I had, which wasn't hard to do."" ""I'm very proud of him,"" he said. Meghan McCain, Jack's older sister, sent a message on Twitter Friday saying her younger brother, Jimmy, could not attend because he is serving overseas. McCain told Fox News he is returning home this weekend. In his remarks to the students, Obama made a vow that he would not send them to war unless it is ""absolutely necessary."" ""It's a promise that as long as I am your commander in chief, I will only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary, and with the strategy, the well-defined goals, the equipment and the support that you need to get the job done,"" he said. ""This includes the job of bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end and pursuing a new comprehensive strategy to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Obama also promised additional assistance to military families, vowing that ""we will be with you every step of the way, increasing your pay, increasing child care and helping families deal with the stress and separation of war."" And he said new laws will help ensure that veterans are well taken care of. Obama's commencement address was his third and final of the year. He was also commencement speaker at Arizona State University and the University of Notre Dame.","Son of Sen. John McCain, the former GOP presidential candidate, graduates .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sailors aboard a U.S. ocean surveillance ship reacted with a mix of bemusement and profanity to what they said was harassment by Chinese ships earlier this month, according to video released Friday by the Pentagon. The Navy says this shows a trawler crew member using a hook to try to snag the Impeccable's towed acoustic array. ""Chinese aggression, from aboard the USNS Impeccable,"" one member of the American ship's crew is heard narrating. ""Details at 11."" The Pentagon has raised concerns about a March 8 incident in which ""increasingly aggressive"" Chinese ships harassed the Impeccable, an unarmed survey ship with a mostly civilian crew. China's government accused the ship of violating Chinese and international laws during its patrols, which took place more than 100 miles off the Chinese coast. ""The U.S. claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white and they are totally unacceptable to China,"" Ma Zhaoxu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said after news of the incident emerged. Five Chinese vessels shadowed the Impeccable, with two of them closing to within 25 feet while their crews waved Chinese flags and stripped down to their underwear in a sign of disrespect. The Impeccable also turned fire hoses on one of the ships ""in order to protect itself,"" the Pentagon said. The Pentagon said the Chinese also attempted to snag the sonar equipment that the ship was towing behind it, leaving crew members discussing possible orders to destroy the equipment at one point. ""Lou and Wilson man the hoses while the Chinese irritate us to tears,"" the video's narrator reports. ""Here he comes for another swipe at the array cable.""  Watch Pentagon video of Impeccable incident » . The 281.5-foot Impeccable is one of six surveillance ships that perform military survey operations, according to the Navy. It is an oceanographic ship that gathers underwater acoustic data, using sonar. It has a maximum speed of 13 knots -- or about 15 mph -- but it travels 3 knots, or 3.5 mph, when towing its array of monitoring equipment. It carries a crew of 20 mariners, five technicians and as many as 20 Navy personnel. The Chinese ships involved included a navy intelligence collection ship, a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries patrol vessel, a State Oceanographic Administration patrol vessel and two small Chinese-flagged trawlers, the statement said.","Irritation shows in video taken during harassment of U.S. ship by Chinese vessels .

Ben Kingsely who stars in ""Teen Patti"" is the first Academy Award-winner ever to take a role in a Bollywood movie. Bollywood-produced ""Teen Patti"" (""Card Game"") also marks Kingsley's first return to Indian filmmaking since playing the title role in ""Gandhi,"" the critically-acclaimed biopic of the Indian leader that propelled him to fame in 1982. He is the first Oscar-winning Hollywood actor ever to star in a Bollywood movie, and Kingsley believes that the future of filmmaking could lie in combining the twin talents of the world's biggest film industries. ""I think the two talents put together could be extraordinary,"" Kingsley told CNN in Cannes where he was promoting ""Teen Patti."" The 65 year-old English actor maintains that western cinema is suffering from a lack of originality and ""heart,"" with many films just ending up as a ""copy of a copy of a copy."" He thinks that the Indian approach to filmmaking can give western productions the infusion of originality they need -- and that filmmakers in India can benefit from ""the technology, and the casting opportunities, the directorial opportunities of the west."" ""Teen Patti"" is set in India and the UK, where Kingsley shot all of his scenes, and uses English and Hindi dialogue. The drama, which cost a mere $7 million to make, will have its world premiere in Mumbai in August.  Watch CNN The Screening Room producer Neil Curry search for Ben Kingsely in Cannes » .

Kingsley says he has wanted to be associated with mainstream Indian film ever since he made ""Gandhi"" -- an Indo-British production and so not ""entirely an Indian film""-- with director Richard Attenborough in India. The actor who is acclaimed for performances in ""Sexy Beast"" (2000) and ""Schindler's List"" (1993) says he wanted to know what it would be like to work with an Indian director -- Leena Yadav, ""who was amazing"" -- and a huge Indian star like Bachchan. ""I was very curious about him and he was very curious about me,"" says Kingsley of working with 66 year-old Bachchan, or ""Big B"" as India's most prominent Bollywood star is affectionately known to audiences. Bachchan's deep voice and brooding persona changed the face of Hindi cinema in the 1970s. Up until then Bollywood screens had been populated by wisecracking loverboys -- the trademark Indian hero in the 1960s. Today, he is best-known for hosting the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire"" (""Kaun Banega Crorepati""). Kingsley says that while on set, he and Bachchan ""circled each other like hunters."" Despite his respect for the Godfather of Bollywood, Kingsley refused to socialize with the star: ""Because my character in this film is discovering Bachchan's character and if it's all frittered away in social 'bla-bla' there's nothing left to discover."" Kingsley's Indian connection goes back even further than ""Gandhi."" The British actor was born Krishna Bhanji to an English mother an Indian father and adopted his British name while at drama school. Apart from his Bollywood work Kingsley has just finished filming a Martin Scorsese directed period drama, ""Shutter Island,"" which is expected to hit cinemas later this year. He is also busy producing his own films as part of SBK Pictures, the production company he founded in 2007, as he says, ""putting into practice all the things that one has learnt along the way."" The company currently has five films in development, one of which is a drama about native Indians called ""Whispers Like Thunder."" For Kingsley, producing is a chance to have some control over the filmmaking process that isn't possible as an actor. ""It's tragic when [a film] just misses,"" he told CNN. ""If you'd made a slight adjustment in your casting, or your writing, or your director of photography or the rhythm of editing, it could have been absolutely perfect."" Other Hollywood stars mixing with Bollywood include Sylvester Stallone, who will appear in Sabir Khan's romantic comedy, ""Kambakkht Ishq"" and Mickey Rourke is set to star in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Hollywood debut, ""Broken Horses.""","Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley stars with Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan .

"SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- Senior Pakistani and Indian military officials met Tuesday to discuss a border clash in Kashmir, the first major skirmish between South Asia's nuclear rivals since a 2003 cease-fire. Indian army soldiers on the outskirts of Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar. Pakistan's army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN that Pakistan ""made our point clear"" regarding the firefight, which he said began after Indian soldiers crossed the Line of Control that separates Kashmir between India and Pakistan. But an Indian military spokeswoman, Capt. Neha Goyal, told CNN Pakistani troops crossed the Line of Control and ""started firing on our patrol,"" killing an Indian soldier. ""Our troops also retaliated and the Pakistan army troopers ran back,"" she said. Abbas said ""further action should be taken"" following Tuesday's ""flag meeting,"" but did not elaborate. The meeting took place along the Line of Control. Reports in India's media said four Pakistani soldiers were killed, but Pakistan's military ""strongly denied the report of any (casualties) on the Pakistani side."" Pakistan's military also denied its forces crossed the Line of Control, saying the skirmish started when Indian soldiers tried to establish a forward post on Pakistan's side of the line. ""On Pakistan's' objection, Indian troops opened indiscriminate and unprovoked fire,"" a Pakistan military news release, posted on Monday, stated. ""The Indian fire was immediately responded to. The firing continued -- intermittently during the whole night."" Pakistan said the Indian soldiers ""were forced to flee from the area leaving behind their weapons"" after the firefight. Indian and Pakistani forces have exchanged periodic gunfire since May, but Monday's clashes appear to be a serious setback to the ongoing peace process between the two nations. India and Pakistan had announced a bilateral cease-fire all along their borders in November 2003 and the cease-fire had been holding on the borders until recently. Kashmir has been at the root of two wars between India and Pakistan, both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998. An 18-year separatist campaign in the Indian-controlled portion of the largely Muslim territory has claimed more than 43,000 lives, according to government officials, although human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the toll at twice that number. India has long accused Pakistan of supporting the separatists in Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies. India blamed militants from Pakistan for a suicide car bombing outside its embassy in Afghanistan that killed 58 people on July 7. A December 2001 attack on India's parliament that India blamed on the militants brought the two nations to the brink of another war, but they have expanded economic and cultural ties since the November 2003 cease-fire agreement. -- CNN's Aliza Kassim in Atlanta and Mukhtar Ahmad in Srinagar contributed to this report .","Pakistan: Fighting began after Indian soldiers crossed the Line of Control .

"(CNN)  -- U.S. and NATO forces are engaged in a futile war against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, Canada's prime minister said. Canadian leader Stephen Harper says he backs President Obama's ""renewed commitment to Afghanistan."" ""We are not going to ever defeat the insurgency,"" Stephen Harper told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday. ""Afghanistan has probably had -- my reading of Afghanistan history -- it's probably had an insurgency forever, of some kind."" Harper's blunt assessment comes as nearly 2,800 Canadian forces are fighting in Afghanistan. The country's parliament has voted to pull them out by 2011. Harper spoke with Zakaria last week after a visit by President Obama, who made Canada his first foreign trip since taking office in January. Obama has said Afghanistan is the central front to the U.S.-led war on terror. The Pentagon is in the process of sending an additional 17,000 troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total there to 55,000. Harper told CNN that he supports Obama's ""renewed commitment to Afghanistan"" but said he would not recommit any more Canadian troops until there is a clear plan for leaving Afghanistan. ""What has to happen in Afghanistan is, we have to have an Afghan government that is capable of managing that insurgency and improving its own governance,"" Harper said. ""If President Obama wants anybody to do more, I would ask very hard questions about what is the strategy for success and for an eventual departure.""","Prime Minister Stephen Harper: ""We are not going to ever defeat the insurgency""

"LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN) -- Heads of South American nations lent support Monday night to President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who says opposition leaders are trying to overthrow his government. Indigenous people from El Alto, Bolivia, take part in an anti-U.S. demonstration in La Paz on Monday. Confronting their first crisis, members of the four-month-old Union of South American Countries voted to create a commission to support Morales' democratically elected government, said President Michelle Bachelet of Chile. She read a nine-point statement on Chilean TV that calls for the support of human rights and democracy and the preservation of Bolivia's territorial integrity. The statement condemns any attempts to overthrow the government. It also said the new commission would investigate a reported massacre in the Bolivian state of Pando, where violent clashes killed 30 people last week. Those clashes pitted supporters of eastern governors who want autonomy against the central government. The South American leaders also urged dialogue to address disputes in Bolivia. Morales attended the emergency meeting of the union, which is modeled on the European Union and aims to politically and economically integrate South American countries. The president is poised to approve the start of negotiations between his leftist government and opposition leaders of five provinces who demand greater autonomy and the cancellation of a constitutional referendum that would give the president more power. The opposition also is angry over tax money that Morales is diverting from the provinces to fund elderly programs. Morales said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government. ""This is a coup in the past few days by the leaders of some provinces, with the takeover of some institutions, the sacking and robbery of some government institutions and attempts to assault the national police and the armed forces,"" Morales said. Opposition leaders say they merely want their demands met. Police kept order Monday during a march by about 2,000 pro-government groups opposed to the violence in the provinces. The demonstrators marched past the U.S. Embassy in La Paz. Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia last week, blaming the American government for inciting the violence. The United States called the accusations ""false and baseless"" and said Bolivia was making a ""grave mistake."" Most of South America's leaders attended Monday's emergency summit, with the exception of President Alan Garcia of Peru. Protest leaders asked to attend the summit in Santiago, Chile, but it was limited to heads of state. The protests started 21 days ago in Pando, Beni, Santa Cruz, Tarija and Chuquisaca provinces. The opposition groups have blockaded major roads and threaten to disrupt the nation's natural gas shipments, particularly to Brazil and Argentina. Anti-government protesters also have clashed with police and taken over offices and buildings in the five provinces.  Watch some of the violent demonstrations across Bolivia » . Much of the violence has taken place in Pando -- Morales declared martial law there Friday. On Monday, supporters of Morales, or his so-called militias, were gathering in Santa Cruz, and threatening to encircle the city, stoking fears that blood could be shed there. In Pando, it was reported that arbitrary arrests were taking place as the military took to the streets. Houses had been broken into and shot up, and civic leaders were fleeing to Brazil. It was uncertain, meanwhile, whether the Bolivian military remained solely behind Morales. Some signs of divisions had been seen within the military. Opposition leaders say they will not negotiate if there are any more deaths. Vice President Alvaro Garcia said the government will not negotiate about the dead citizens but will rigorously pursue those responsible for the killings. There are conflicting reports over who killed the 30 peasants. Opposition leaders say the peasants were ambushed by local forces. The government says the peasants were armed and initiated the firefight. The opposition has offered to lift the blockades as a goodwill gesture, but the government demanded that the protesters also relinquish the buildings and other property they have seized. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, was elected in December 2005.

"(CNN)  -- In a Nairobi slum, more than one in four children under 5 will die, but in a wealthier part of the Kenyan capital, the mortality rate is one in almost 67, according to a World Health Organization report released Tuesday. A woman lies next to her sick child at a medical center in Sheshemene, Ethiopia, in July. The World Health Report 2008 aims to spotlight disparities in health care across the globe, and as the Nairobi example illustrates, the differences exist not only between the First and Third Worlds -- they can occur just across town. WHO roundly criticizes the organization, finance and delivery of health care and calls advances in the field ""deeply and unacceptably unequal, with many disadvantaged populations increasingly lagging behind or even losing ground."" The report says that a citizen of a wealthy nation can live up to 40 years longer than someone in a poor country, and of the 136 million women who will give birth this year, about 58 million (43 percent) will receive no medical assistance during childbirth or the postpartum period. UNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman said the sharp inequities in the cost and access to health care often speak to larger societal ills. ""High maternal, infant and under-five mortality often indicates lack of access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation, immunizations and proper nutrition,"" she said in a statement. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan insists the dilemma is not just a matter of haves versus have-nots. ""A world that is greatly out of balance in matters of health is neither stable nor secure,"" she said in a statement from Almaty, Kazakhstan, where the report was released. The difference in annual government expenditures on health care is more canyon than gap, according to the report. While the wealthiest nations dole out as much as $6,000 per person each year, some countries are unable or unwilling to spend more than $20 per person. However, while calling for wide-ranging reforms in the delivery of primary health care, the report notes that it isn't always a matter of government expenditures. Tajikistan and Sierra Leone both spend less than $100 per person on health care. But while the health-adjusted life expectancy in Sierra Leone is under 30 years of age, Tajikistan's is almost 70 -- a figure comparable to the United States, which spends more than $2,500 a person on health care. ""When countries at the same level of economic development are compared, those where health care is organized around the tenets of primary health care produce a higher level of health for the same investment,"" the report says. WHO defines primary health care as being ""universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford."" The organization's report -- titled ""Primary Health Care -- Now More Than Ever"" -- calls for a move toward universal coverage to reverse a trend over the last 30 years in which disparities in the levels of health care have actually widened. Universal coverage, the report says, would lower the risks of disease outbreaks for everyone, not just the impoverished. Currently, the most common means of paying for health care is out of pocket, which WHO says is the ""most inequitable method for financing health care services."" The report says more than 100 million people fall into poverty in a given year because of health care bills. Another problem, the report says, is that doctors tend not to focus on prevention. ""Rather than improving their response capacity and anticipating new challenges, health systems seem to be drifting from one short-term priority to another, increasingly fragmented and without a clear sense of direction,"" according to the report. But the report also handed out accolades, most notably to Iran and Cuba. WHO applauded the Islamic Republic's 17,000 ""health houses,"" which serve about 1,500 people each. The report credited the centers with boosting Iranians' life expectancy from 63 to 71 years between 1990 and 2006. And in Cuba, the nation's ""polyclinics"" have yielded one of the longest life expectancies (78 years) of any developing country, the report says. The report called for all sectors of society to help determine how health care is allocated, and it singled out the United States for spending just 0.1 percent of its health budget on health systems research -- the kind of research that policymakers use to decide how money is spent. The report also points to the pharmaceutical industry's impact on health care in the United States, where the average expenditure on prescription drugs in 2005 was $1,141 per person -- twice the average in Canada, Germany and Britain, and 10 times the average in Mexico. To combat the problems facing global health care, WHO says in its report that nations must improve coverage and delivery, as well as policy and leadership. It acknowledges that primary health care isn't cheap, but asserts that the ""investment provides better value for money than its alternatives."" ""The legitimacy of health authorities increasingly depends on how well they assume responsibility to develop and reform the health sector according to what people value -- in terms of health and of what is expected of health systems in society,"" the report says.","Health care disparities make world ""neither stable nor secure,"" WHO director says .

"(CNN) -- Recent headlines focusing on the rash of pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia should instead focus on the humanitarian crisis driving Somalis to commit crimes on the high seas, an international aid group said Thursday. Somalia's population have suffered from a lack of the most basic services. An estimated one-third of Somalia's population desperately needs emergency aid, the international agency Oxfam said, as donors to Somalia met in Brussels, Belgium. ""Without economic opportunities offering alternatives to criminality, and without law and order to curb these activities, then the massive economic returns of hijacking ships will continue to drive piracy,"" Robert Maletta, policy adviser for Oxfam, said in a news release. ""The international community must urgently focus their attention on finding ways to assist the millions of people in desperate need,"" Maletta said. Somalia, which is racked by poverty and conflict, has not had a fully functioning government since 1991, when its president was overthrown in Mogadishu, the capital. Drought and rising food prices have added to the nation's problems, according to Maletta. ""Families are finding it difficult to meet their most basic needs, as prices for basic food items are at record high levels,"" he said. Not only do civilians need emergency aid, they also need protection from military abuses, aid groups said. ""Since Somalia's security forces have committed so many violent abuses against civilians, efforts to strengthen them also need to make them more accountable,"" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director for Human Rights Watch. The combination of security and humanitarian assistance is necessary to curb piracy in the region, which borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, aid groups said. The April 8 hijacking of the U.S.-flagged cargo ship Maersk Alabama made headlines worldwide when its American captain, Richard Phillips, was held hostage by four Somali men. Phillips was rescued four days later, after U.S. Navy snipers fatally shot three pirates. The fourth suspect, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, was brought to New York to face federal piracy charges. Ships with aid supplies destined for countries in the region, including Somalia, also have been hijacked in the Indian Ocean. Pirates held a ship carrying U.N. food aid for 100 days in June 2005. Two years ago, a cargo ship and crew delivering U.N. aid to Somalia were held and released after 40 days. The Maersk was going to the coastal town of Mombasa, Kenya, to deliver relief supplies intended for various countries in the region, including Somalia.","Oxfam: One-third of Somalia's population desperately needs emergency aid .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Members of an Iranian group say Iraqi forces have beaten and abused them as Iraqis move to expel the Iranians from a camp on Iraqi land. About 3,500 people live at Camp Ashraf, where members of the People's Mujahedin have lived for 24 years. The Iranian group -- designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Iran -- has asked the United States to intervene on their behalf. About 3,500 people live at Camp Ashraf, most of them members of the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran who have lived at the camp for 24 years after fleeing Iran. Iran, Iraq, Canada and the United States consider the People's Mujahedin, which opposes the government in Tehran, a terrorist organization, although the European Union removed the group from its terrorist list in January. The United Kingdom did so last year. The People's Mujahedin accused the Iraqi military of entering the camp north of Baghdad on Friday and forcibly evacuating a building that served mostly as a women's dormitory. Ashraf residents rallied Monday against the military, chanting for Imam Hussein -- the Prophet Mohammed's grandson and a holy figure for Shiite Muslims -- to save them from the abuse of the Iraqi soldiers. Statements from the National Council of Resistance to Iran, an umbrella group of Iranian opposition organizations -- the largest of which is the People's Mujahedin -- accuse Iraq's Shiite-dominated government of doing the bidding of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also a Shiite. ""The Iranian Resistance calls for urgent intervention of the U.S. government and competent international bodies to neutralize plots by the clerical regime and prevent a human catastrophe in Camp Ashraf,"" said a statement dated Sunday. Iraq's government denied that it was acting on Khamenei's behalf. ""The Iraqi government's position is clear and there is no retreat from its decision to close Camp Ashraf,"" said a statement from the office of National Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie. ""The national security adviser is only implementing the decision and the policy of the Iraqi government."" The National Council also accused the Iraqis of barring delivery of all supplies to the camp except for food, banning Iraqi workers from entering the camp and blocking families from visiting relatives inside the camp. The Iraqi government statement denied keeping supplies from Camp Ashraf. ""The Iraqi government continues to facilitate all humanitarian materials entering Camp Ashraf,"" the Iraqi statement said. "" ... We welcome any visit by any international organization."" A People's Mujahedin spokesman in Camp Ashraf called the statement false and asked international groups ""to visit Ashraf and observe the facts and realities of the present situation by themselves."" Camp Ashraf, which has housed Iranians since the mid-1980s, was under U.S. protection until January 1, when it was handed over to the Iraqis. Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council and the long-time leader of People's Mujahedin, sent a letter to President Obama asking for help against ""a conspiracy hatched by the religious dictatorship ruling Iran against the lives of 3,500 residents of Camp Ashraf."" Rajavi cited comments by Khamenei during a meeting with Iraqi President Jalal Talibani last month calling for the expulsion of the People's Mujahedin from Iraq and later comments by former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during a trip to Baghdad calling for Camp Ashraf's closure. After those remarks, the National Council said, al-Rubaie declared that the Iranians at Camp Ashraf had no right to refugee status or to political asylum and would be expelled either back to Iran or to a third country. Rajavi, in her letter to Obama, asked the president to ""issue an order so that the arrangements for the protection of Ashraf are reinstated to that which was in place before January 2009, i.e., the U.S. forces be tasked with the protection of Ashraf."" The U.S. military in Iraq had no comment on the matter, referring queries to the State Department, which did not have an immediate comment. Also known as Mujahedin-e-Khalq, People's Mujahedin was initially formed to oppose the shah of Iran, but fell out of favor with the Islamic revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after 1979. People's Mujahedin, which promotes a secular, Marxist government for Iran, waged a violent campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic Tehran government -- including bombings that killed politicians, judges and Cabinet members -- for years. The group allied with Saddam Hussein in Iraq in the mid-1980s and fought with the Iraqis against Iran in the latter years of the Iran-Iraq war. People's Mujahedin renounced violence in 2001, but a group of 12 former members told Human Rights Watch in 2005 that they were subject to physical and psychological abuse when they made it known they wanted to leave the organization. The group is also said to have provided Western governments with information about Iran's nuclear program. The National Council accused al-Rubaie in particular of ""clearly implementing the dictates of Khamenei"" and said he should ""be prosecuted by international forces.""","People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran have lived at camp for 24 years .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Former New York City police Commissioner Bernard Kerik pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a revised indictment charging him in a corruption and tax evasion case, according to a spokesman for the New York District Attorney. A revised indictment brings to 15 the number of counts against former police Commissioner Bernard Kerik. The revised indictment includes two new counts of aiding the filing of false returns and a charge involving making false statements while applying for a housing loan, spokesman Herbert Hadad of the district attorney's office told CNN. Kerik is accused of failing to report more than $500,000 in income between 1999 and 2004, said Patricia Haynes, the IRS agent in charge of the case. Prosecutors allege Kerik received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale, New York, apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York. Revisions to the original indictment, which included charges of corruption, conspiracy and tax evasion, bring to 15 the number of counts against Kerik. Barry Berke, Kerik's attorney, declined to comment. The indictment also charges that Kerik made several false statements to the White House and other federal officials when he applied for the position as adviser to the Homeland Security Advisory Council, to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and in connection with his nomination to be secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson did not rule Monday on whether the two counts that include charges of lying to White House officials will be tried in Washington or White Plains, New York. Kerik is due back in court February 3 for a hearing on pretrial motions, Hadad said. A trial date has not been set. Kerik, 53, is a longtime friend and former protege of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. President Bush nominated him to be secretary of homeland security after winning re-election in 2004, but Kerik withdrew his name amid allegations that he employed a nanny who had a questionable immigration status. Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson began investigating allegations that Kerik had traded payment on repairs to his Bronx apartment for favors, including city contracts. The former chief pleaded guilty in 2006 to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while he worked as city corrections commissioner. He was fined $221,000 and avoided jail time under his plea agreement. Before tapping Kerik for a Cabinet post, Bush dispatched him to Baghdad to train Iraqi police after the U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. He left three months into an expected six-month stint, with Iraqi officials telling reporters that he had completed his assignment. In 2004, he campaigned for Bush's re-election and spoke at the Republican National Convention in New York. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","Bernard Kerik is accused of failing to report more than $500,000 in income .
