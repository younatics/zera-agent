"By . Nathan Klein . and Ted Thornhill . and Richard  Shears . Search crews have reportedly located the black box from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Perth radio station 6PR tweeted the discovery, citing aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas had revealed the flight recorder had finally been found after more than a month of being missing. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is in China, said he is 'very confident' the signals detected were from the black box from MH370. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . An AP-3C Orion returns to RAAF Base Pearce after a day of searching an area in the Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . 'Encouraging': A total of four signals, matching those of a black box flight recorder, have now been detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the search for flight MH370 . The search co-ordination agency headed by retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston says there is now doubt over whether the pings recorded by search vessels are from the black box of the missing MH370 aircraft . 'We have very much narrowed down the search area...and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from MH370,' he said. 'We have a series of detections, some lasting for quite a long period of time. 'We're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade. We're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires. 'I really don't want to give any more information than that at this stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families.' Speaking from Shanghai, China, Mr Abbott said today's discovery was a huge step in solving the mystery. 'This is probably the most difficult search in human history,' he said. 'Among tragedy, however, there is hope. 'We are confident we know the position of the black box to the nearest kilometre. 'But confidence in the position is not the same as recovering the wreckage from more than 4.5km beneath the sea and finally determining all that happened on that flight.' The fact that Mr Abbott has reportedly used the word 'confident' suggests that searchers are finally convinced that weeks of scouring the Indian Ocean might now have resulted in the discovery of the missing Boeing 777. Mr Abbott has indicated he will first need to brief the Chinese because most of the 239 passengers were from that country. Relatives have complained in the past of not being kept informed of progress in the search. A fifth 'ping' from the black box of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was detected by a surveillance plane conducting an acoustic search yesterday, Australian officials said. The latest signal was picked up by an Australian P-3 Orion aircraft, with on-board instruments tracing it to the same area where two pings were heard this week by Australian ship Ocean Shield. More signals: A handout image released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) shows the search area in the Indian Ocean, West of Australia, where  15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight MH370 more than a month after it disappeared . A map from AMSA shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight MH370 . Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is . co-ordinating the search in Perth, said on Thursday: 'The acoustic data will require further analysis overnight but shows potential of being from a man-made source.' Earlier he said the discovery by Ocean Shield was . 'further encouraging' news in the search for MH370. He said the detection, on Tuesday afternoon, was held for about five minutes and 32 seconds, while the second was held for about seven minutes. 'Yesterday's [Tuesday's] signals will assist in better defining a reduced and much more manageable search area on the ocean floor' he said. Despite what Mr Houston described as 'further encouraging findings' he said that the underwater vehicle 'Blue Fin 21', which can 'sniff out' objects deep in the ocean, would not be launched until the search area could be narrowed. 'I believe we are searching in the right area, but we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,' he said. 'I'm not prepared to confirm anything until such time as somebody lays eyes on the wreckage.' However, U.S. Navy Captain Mark . Matthews said the detections indicate the device emitting the pings is . somewhere within about a 12-mile radius. That would still equate to a 500 square mile chunk of the ocean floor - an area that would take the Bluefin sub between six weeks to two months to canvas. Data analysis of the first two detections at the weekend has shown they were consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder, said the air chief marshal. The Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis . Centre based at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, on the NSW coast south of . Sydney, concluded that the two detections were from a source that was . not of 'natural origin' and was 'likely sourced' from specific . electronic equipment. Mr . Houston, pointing out that his optimism had risen since Sunday, warned . that a lot of silt could complicate the search, which is being boosted . by a sonar buoy and a modified RAAF P3 aircraft to co-ordinate with . Ocean Shield. 'It's . important for Ocean Shield to collect as much data as possible ahead of . deploying Blue Fin 21,' he said. 'The reason we want to do that is . there's no second chances.' The pings detected by the Australian Defence vessel Ocean Shield's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern Indian Ocean may now not be released . The towed pinger locator (TPL-25) on the deck of the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield detected two  signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder, but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with MH370 . The Bluefin 21 submarine drone, which will be used to scour the seabed for MH370 once the search area in narrowed down further, is hosited on board the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield after buoyanct testing . He warned that the recently-detected . signals have been much weaker than the original signals detected - 'so . that means probably we're either a long way from it, or in my view, more . likely, the batteries are starting to fade and as a consequence the . signal is becoming weaker.' He added: 'So we need to, as we say in Australia, make hay while the sun shines.' Ocean . Shield, he said, would be looking to pick up more transmissions that . would help to better pinpoint where the signal was coming from. Once the search area has been narrowed, ships and aircraft could then find something in 'a matter of days,' he suggested. He . continued to express optimism that searchers were closing in on the . plane's final resting place, despite what he believed were signals from . dying batteries. Bluefin . 21, takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator, . which is pulled behind the boat at a depth of 3,000 metres. A RAAF P3 Orion is seen parked on the tarmac after returning from a search mission for debris from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 yesterday . Iinitial confidence of Royal Australian Navy Commodore Peter Leavy (pictured, right, with search chief Angus Houston last month) of the recorded pings being from missing MH370 has now waned . The sub's sonar can scan only . about 100 metres and it can 'see' with lights and cameras only a few . metres. The maximum depth it can dive is 4,500 metres, and some areas of . the search zone are deeper. Search . crews are also contending with a thick layer of silt on the sea floor . that can both hide any possible wreckage and distort the sounds . emanating from the black boxes that may be resting there, said Mr Leavy, . who is helping to lead the search. Captain Matthews said: 'It's . certainly a man-made device emitting that signal and I have . no explanation for what other component could be there. 'I'm . an engineer so I don't talk emotions too much. But . certainly when I received word that they had another detection, you feel . elated. 'You're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved.'","Unconfirmed reports have surfaced that MH370's black box has been found .

"By . Richard  Shears . Meet 'Mr Cool' - also known as Kim Jong-un, North Korea's power-crazy leader who has stepped out in a pair of tinted sunglasses. The reclusive dictator's new look is an unprecedented departure from the look fashioned by his tyrant grandfather Kim II-sung, continued by his father Kim Jong-il. The move has sparked rumours North Koreans will be forced to don the quirky accessory, coming just months after Kim ordered them to copy his trademark hairstyle. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong-Un delivers a speech in Samjiyong, North Korea where he sports his new look; tinted sunglasses. While his father, Kim Jong-il, had an array of tinted spectacles for medical purposes, this is said to be a fashionable reinvention. Kim stepped out in his sunglasses when he visited the Samji Monument at Mt Baekdu this week. Observers said they were convinced the new leader's choice is for appearances only. South Korean media quoted observers as saying today that they believed Kim Jong-un, marking his third year in power, was trying to shape his own distinctive image after being made over into a clone of his grandfather in a bid to lend legitimacy to the young leader. But he's not doing it alone. One source said it was believed that Kim's younger sister, Yeo-jong, has been co-ordinating his wardrobe since he ordered the execution last year of his mentor, Jang Song-taek. Observers believe Kim's new glasses are part of his attempt to create a new individualist image for himself . The look seems to be a reinvention of the tinted glasses his father, Kim Jong-il, wore for medical purposes. The 'quirky' fashion is a far cry from the monotone uniform devised by his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, during his reign . But the new touch, following a look worn by celebrities such as Elton John, is thought to be his most distinctive yet. While Kim is continuing to flex his . muscles - and now turning heads with his new look - his push for added . power has come at the expense of a building in one of his luxury villas. Just . three years after it was built as part of Kim's instructions to his . workers to spread his real estate throughout the country, the roof of a . vast aquarium has collapsed, according to satellite photographs. So-called 'spy cameras' have taken images that reveal faults in workmanship by teams of North Korean military builders. The new look has sparked rumours Kim could make fashion tweaks to his citizens' uniforms . The young leader, pictured here with his wife at a concert, has ordered people to get his trademark haircut . A Google Earth photograph of the huge aquarium in the luxury villa complex in Wonsan, captured in 2012, shows a vast circular domed roof. But an image from a South Korean satellite, captured in March this year, reveals that the roof has gone - and presumed to have collapsed. Kim had the aquarium built with materials imported from Germany and Italy, then filled it with £2 million worth of marine life, including dolphins brought in from China. The fate of the dolphins and other fish is not known. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said today that according to North Korean defectors, military engineers are responsible for building the villa complex. The huge aquarium in Wonsan: Google Earth photograph, 2012 shows a large circular domed roof (left). South Korean satellite image from March 2014 shows the roof is missing, presumed to have collapsed (right) Kim has engaged in a massive construction drive, they say, since he came to power - and the push for speed is leading to faulty construction. According to one source, 'Once Kim Jong-un sets a completion date, there is no arguing. The frantic push to meet deadlines is everywhere causing problems with quality.' Those observations raise questions about the safety of a vast ski resort, Kim's 'pet project', in the Masik Pass. Kim insisted that the project be rushed through to completion by October last year to coincide with the 68th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers Party. One propaganda banner at the resort while building work was still continuing read: 'Full attack. March Forward. Let's Absolutely Finish Building Masik Pass Ski Resort Within This Year By Launching A Full Aggressive War and Full Battle.'","Kim Jong-un appears said to be remodelling his look with tinted sunglasses .

"By . Richard  Shears . Jose Alvarenga's much anticipated press conference in Majuro was cut dramatically short today after doctors said he was not feeling well and would have to remain in their care. His planned flight out of Majuro to Mexico tomorrow has been postponed for at least four or five days until doctors decide he is well enough to travel. Alvarenga said very few words through interpreter Sean Cox. Scroll down for video . Castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga has been taken ill during a much-anticipated press conference in Majuro today. Doctors have postponed his flight home to Mexico, scheduled for tomorrow, for at least four or five days . He said: 'I thank the government of the Marshall Islands and all my friends who have helped me on the way and especially Mr Damien Jacklick', who is the head of the immigration department. Officials said Alvarenga's paperwork had also not been finalised. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Phillip Muller said: 'The investigation is ongoing to verify the story of how he (Alvarenga) got to the Marshall Islands. 'I won't give you all the details, but we will eventually tell everybody. So far the story has been substantiated.' His hair tamed and beard shaved, the 37-year-old had to be supported as he arrived at the press conference . He made no further comment and did not explain why an investigation was still continuing. Officials said it was likely that Alvarenga would not be able to travel until at least Monday - and there was the added problem of finding an official to fly with him. An official from the Mexican Embassy in Manila who was due to leave with Alvarenga tomorrow (Fri) will now have to return to the Philippines on Saturday, leaving the question open of who will travel with the fisherman. It is understood he will fly from Majuro to Honolulu, then on to LA before flying direct to El Salvador. As Alvarenga does not have a passport, he will need special paperwork to be allowed to enter US territory en route to El Salvador. The man who has made headlines around the world washed up on the remote Marshall Islands, 8,000 miles from where he originally disappeared in a small fishing boat, on Monday. He has told of starving on his broken-down fishing boat, living on the flesh of tiny fish and turtles, and drinking the blood of sea birds, turtles and even his own urine. He said he had been drifting for 14 months, after his engine cut out in September, while he was on a fishing trip with a friend. Wearing nothing but a pair of torn shorts, the sailor and his battered 23ft boat washed ashore, 8,000 miles from his home in El Salvador, on the remote coral Ebon atoll. New pictures of the 37-year-old emerged, showing Alvarenga four days after he washed ashore on the remote Ebon atoll. Despite stumbling through the surf to reach the beach semi-naked and wearing nothing but a tattered pair of shorts, four days later the father-of-one appears the picture of health. Washed and clean, he showed no signs of a man who had endured a grueling 14 months at sea. Yet on Monday when he was revealed to the world, Alvarenga looked, arguably, in a worse condition. Today it emerged the Castaway fled his home on the Pacific coast of El Salvador 12 years ago after he was stabbed in a brutal bar fight. This was one of the first pictures of Alvarenga, taken after he was revealed to the world on Monday. He washed ashore in the Marshall Islands days earlier, after surviving 14 months drifting at sea . This picture shows Alvarenga looking healthy and clean just four days after he was washed up on the remote coral Ebon atoll. He looks arguably better than when he arrived on the mainland on Monday to face the world's cameras . While out drinking in the village of . Garita Palmera, Alvarenga got into an arguement with four men and was . stabbed, punched and kicked to the point his family feared he would not . survive. After 15 days in . hospital he made an incredible recovery. But, terrified his attackers, . who lived locally, would target him again he fled the country, deeming . it too dangerous for him to stay. He left his wife Arely Barrera and the couple's 18-month-old daughter Fatima at home. Fatima, who is now 13 years old, has no memories of her father and said meeting him would be 'awkward' having spoken to him for the first time on the phone a few days ago. After crossing the Guatemalan border by bus, Alvarenga settled in the Mexican State of Chiapas where he worked as a fisherman. It was in September 2012, that Alvarenga set off for that fateful day's fishing with his friend's son, Ezekiel in their 23ft boat. Speaking through an interpreter Alvarenga said: 'It broke down and we started drifting. 'We . were lucky that we had already caught two sharks that day and we were . able to eat them for a time but then they went bad and we had to throw . the carcasses overboard.' It emerged Alvarenga fled his El Salvador home after he was stabbed and brutally beaten to within an inch of his life during a bar fight. He left his wife Arely and their young daughter Fatima . Fatima has never met her father, she was a year and a half when Alvarenga left El Salvador for Mexico, where he found work as a fisherman . He said his companion, Ezekiel had died after the pair drifted for four months. 'My friend tried to drink the blood of turtles but he kept being sick because it disagreed with his stomach,' he said. When . it came to the time when his young friend died and he had to lower the . body overboard, he shook his head, indicating it was a moment he did . want to recall. The boat's deck, he said, was triangular and on it was what he said was a large box, although he was vague when it came to describing it exactly. He said: 'I would get under the box to stay out of the sun, but it was also there that I prayed. I prayed and prayed to be saved. I am not a Catholic but I do believe in God. He sent food to me all the time. 'I caught small fish by putting my hands in the water and wriggling my fingers. This attracted the fish and I was then able to grab them.' In what he said was a sign from God, after the many months at sea he woke one morning and saw a bird sitting on the edge of the boat. The 23ft fishing boat Alvarenga claims to have lived on, surviving 14 months drifting through the Pacific . The family of Alvarenga's companion Ezequiel Cordoba, who died after four months at sea. Alvarenga said Cordoba starved to death as he was unable to stomach their diet of turtle's blood and raw fish . The family of Ezekiel Cordoba have demanded answers as to how the 24-year-old died. His brother Romeo Cordoba, pictured, has called for Alvarenga to be brought back to Mexico to be quizzed . 'I crept very quietly to it and I was able to catch it. I broke off its head to drink its blood as I had been doing but as I was doing that, as I was tilting my head back, I saw land. It was the first land I had seen.' He was able to half swim, half stagger, through the shallow water and collapse on the beach. 'It had taken me a long time to reach the beach and it was then early evening. I fell asleep immediately.' But the family of Ezekiel Cordoba have demanded more answers as to how the 24-year-old perished. His brother Romeo Cordoba, 29, has called for Alvarenga - nicknamed La Chancha - to be brought back to Mexico to answer questions. He told The Telegraph: 'We ask the authorities to bring the shipwrecked man, La Chancha, back here or take some of us to meet him, so we can find out was it really our brother who he is talking about. 'If it is, why did he die? Why wouldn't he eat raw fish and birds? What did he do with his body? There is a lot of confusion and we want to hear it from La Chancha. 'It's a miracle that La Chancha survived at sea for 14 months, and we feel no anger towards him. We understand this was an accident and how dangerous the sea can be. 'But we need confirmation from him before we can accept his death.'","Jose Salvador Alvarenga claims he spent 14 months adrift in the Pacific .

"By . Dan Bloom . and Richard  Shears . Surprise admission: Najib Razak said the first MH370 report will be released next week . Military radar in Malaysia did track an unidentified aircraft as it flew across the country's airspace after MH370 lost contact with ground control, it was revealed today. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak said the military's radar tracked what is believed to have been the Malaysian Airlines plane after it had turned back while on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8. 'The military radar, the primary radar, has some capability,' Mr Najib said. 'It tracked an aircraft which did a turn back but they were not sure, exactly sure, whether it was MH370. 'What they were sure of was that the aircraft was not deemed to be hostile.' Mr Najib told CNN he did not believe it when he first heard about the critical satellite data on which the current search in the Indian Ocean is based on. 'To be honest, I found it hard to believe,' said the Prime Minister. 'It's a bizarre scenario which none of us could have contemplated so that's why when I met the team...of foremost experts in aviation industry I asked them again and again ""are you sure?""' 'And their answer to me was we are as sure as we can possibly be.' Earlier reports had suggested military radar had not picked up any definite radar information, leading to speculation that the Boeing 777 had been flown deliberately low and close to the coastline to avoid radar. CNN said that when Mr Najib was asked if he believed the plane was now lost, he replied: 'On the balance of the evidence it would be hard to imagine otherwise.' The Prime Minister also revealed that the government's preliminary report into the disappearance of the aircraft, which had 239 passengers and crew, would be released next week. Did not crash: Dr Mahathir says missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 (file photo) could not have crashed because modern communications systems meant that it could not simply disappear off the radar . Anger: A Chinese relative of a passenger on missing flight at a meeting at Metro Park Hotel in Beijing . Malaysia's preliminary report into the disappearance of flight MH370 will be released next week, the country's Prime Minister has said. Najib Razak made the surprise announcement as his government continued to be beseiged by angry families, some of whom refuse to accept the plane was destroyed unless they have hard evidence. The report has already been sent to the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization but not made public. Mr Razak told CNN: 'I have directed an internal investigation team of experts to look at the report, and there is a likelihood that next week we could release the report.' He later confirmed it will be released next week, CNN reported. Despite seven weeks passing since the Malaysia Airlines jet vanished, Mr Razak declined to say outright that it had been lost for good - 'out of respect' for grieving families. Chinese relatives of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 rest during a meeting . Reflective: A man stands in front of a billboard as Chinese relatives of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have a meeting at the Metro Park Hotel in Beijing . He told CNN's Richard Quest: 'At some point in time I would be, but right now I think I need to take into account the feelings of the next of kin, and you know some of them have said publicly that they aren't willing to accept it until they find hard evidence.' The denial came despite Malaysian authorities a month ago telling families definitively - and by text message - that 'none of those on board survived'. The government has been repeatedly attacked by relatives of passengers, the majority of whom were from China, for not doing enough in its search for the jet. Mr Razak's announcement came as a tropical cyclone again threatened to hamper a 26-nation air, surface and underwater search of the Indian Ocean. Airborne searches were partly suspended for the last two days because of heavy rain, strong winds, rough seas thanks to Tropical Cyclone Jack. The hunt is already the most expensive in aviation history and is focusing on an area where acoustic 'pings' were detected, possibly from the jet's black box recorder, a month after it disappeared. Key to the mission is the U.S. Navy undersea drone . Bluefin-21, which will soon finish scouring a 6.2 square . mile stretch of seabed. Authorities . have said if Bluefin-21 fails to find a trace of the plane in its . initial target search area, 1,200 miles north west of Perth, it will be redeployed to new . areas. Australian . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the airliner's probable impact zone was . 430 miles long and 50 miles wide. A new search strategy would be . adopted if nothing is found in the current seabed search zone. Location: The Australian Transport Safety Bureau had been scrutinising photos of the object, which washed ashore six miles east of Augusta in Western Australia state . Search: The Australian Navy launches its Phoenix Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Artemis as part of the search last week. The hunt for missing flight MH370 has become the most expensive in aviation history . Looking: Captain Flt Lt Tim McAlevey of the Royal New Zealand Air Force flying a P-3 Orion during a search trying to locate missing Malaysia Airways Flight MH370 over the Indian Ocean . ‘If . at the end of that period we find nothing, we are not going to abandon . the search, we may well rethink the search, but we will not rest until . we have done everything we can to solve this mystery,’ he said. Yesterday authorities ruled out any link between debris picked up on an Australian beach and the missing jet. The debris, found on Wednesday on a beach at the southern tip of Western Australia state, was seen as the first lead since April 4 when the pings were detected. But it took Australian authorities less than a day to analyse detailed photographs of the beached debris, which included sheet metal with rivets, and dismiss the possibility that it may be linked to the plane. 'We're not seeing anything in this that would lead us to believe that it is from a Boeing aircraft,' said Australian Transport Safety Bureau commissioner Martin Dolan.","Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak said the military's radar tracked what is believed to have been the Malaysian Airlines plane .

"By . Richard  Shears . The sister of an Australian drug smuggler Corby who was released on parole from prison last week has denied claims her sibling attempted suicide in Bali, it has been reported. Two officials went to the house where she was staying before Schapelle Corby grabbed a knife and threatened to kill herself yesterday, it was claimed. A source close to the Corby family said that when parole officers visited the house Schapelle was staying in, she expressed frustration at the media intrusion and said to them: 'What, are they waiting for me to kill myself?' Under pressure: Schapelle Corby's move from from a luxury hotel to her brother-in-law's Balinese house has coincided with depression, anxiety and hallucinations that she is constantly being followed . She was sentenced to 20 years in . prison in 2005 for smuggling 4.1 kilograms of marijuana into Bali, . hidden in a boogie board bag. However . her sentence was reduced after earning remissions for good behaviour . along with a five-year cut following an appeal for clemency to the . Indonesian president. Last . night Corby's sister Mercedes denied that she had threatened to . kill herself, insisting the knife-wielding incident never took place. However, a senior official later confirmed that Corby had made a suicide attempt by lunging for a knife but was prevented from doing anything further when her family stopped her. The head of the corrections division of the Bali Justice office, Mr Sunar Agus, said he had witnessed the dramatic move when he called at the family house in Kuta on Monday evening with a parole officer. Corby lunged for a knife in what he took to be a suicide attempt. 'I can't tell someone's intention,' he told Fairfax media. 'But what I saw in front of me was that she tried to commit suicide. 'She took a knife, but the family stopped her and the parole officer stopped her,' said Mr Sunar. Freedom gone sour: Schapelle Corby's moments of joy following her release have turned to fear that Indonesian authorities may revoke her parole and incracerate her again . He did not provide further details but it emerged that Miss Corby had visited the parole board office the . morning after the alleged suicide attempt for her first monthly report . and according to parole officer Ketut Sukiati 'her condition was fine.' Corby, 36, is believed to have . been told that her parole could be revoked after a documentary was shown . in Australia on Sunday evening about her release from jail. Under . her parole conditions she was warned against giving any interviews . following speculation that she had struck a million dollar deal with . Australia's Channel Seven TV network. Justice Minister, Amir Syamsuddin, said he would make a decision within days. The incident is certain to be taken very seriously by the Indonesian . government after Mr Sunar said he had reported it to Jakarta. Jubilation after Corby's release (above) has evaporated as brother-in-law Wayan Widyartha admits a 'heavily medicated' Schapelle locked herself in a toilet for an entire day with her anxiety and depression . Corby's jump for joy (above) following her release has now given way to a suicide attempt, confirmed her her sister Merecdes's husband, Wayan, who is also Schapelle's parole guarantor . In . words that strongly suggest Corby's parole is to be revoked, . Justice Minister Amir said he was irritated with the drug smuggler and . her family and there was now a 'probability' that her parole would be . 'reconsidered'. He told the Indonesian newspaper Kompas that if he revoked parole it would largely be the fault of her family. 'I . am waiting for a complete report from the Bali Corrections Board and in . the meantime I'd like to announce that there's a possibility I will . revoke Corby's parole,' he told Fairfax Media. Little more than three weeks after her release (above) Schapelle may have her hard won freedom cut short, as Indonesian authorities decide 'within days' about whether to return her to jail . It . is understood that a number of Indonesian politicians who have seen the . documentary have insisted on her bail being revoked, claiming that the . Corby family had tried to 'sneak' around the law. Corby was seen earlier today checking into a police station under her bail conditions. She has checked out of a luxury villa where she was initially staying and has moved into her brother-in-law's home. In . the documentary she was shown being whisked away from jail in a van and . later swimming in the surf before enjoying a meal with her family. But while Corby did not give an . interview, her sister Mercedes told how her younger sister had been . broken by her time in jail. Footage captured her driving away from prison on Feburary 10 when was released. She could be heard saying: 'Nice one, driver. Woo hoo!' The clip also shows Schapelle arriving at the Sentosa Seminyak resort, the luxury villa she is staying in as a parolee. She . is seen jumping up and down with excitement before a male voice is . heard saying, ‘You can take that thing off,’ referring to the scarf . across her face that perplexed viewers across Australia. She then removes the tartan veil, though keeps her hat on. Schapelle . is seen excitedly greeting her family, including sister Mercedes and . brother-in-law Wayan, and hugging her niece and nephew.","Claims she grabbed a knife and threatened to kill herself in front of officials .

"By . Richard  Shears . Scores of passengers miraculously avoided death or injury today when a powerful earthquake rocked New Zealand and sent a two-ton eagle sculpture promoting The Hobbit movie crashing down at Wellington airport. The 6.3 magniture earthquake rocked the centre of the country, damanging buildings and sending boulders rolling down hills up and down the country between Auckland in the north and Dunedin on the tip of the south island. The shudder was felt throughout most of the country but there were no immediate reports of serious injury or death. Scroll down to Video . The eagle has landed: One of two giant sculptures which were part of a promotion for The Hobbit lies on the floor at Wellington Airport . Hazard: Miraculously no passengers were injured or killed after the eagle toppled to the floor . Officials described the earthquake, 99 miles north-east of Wellington at a depth of 31 miles, as 'severe'. Walls fell and huge rocks rolled across roads during the one-minute-long earthquake - and authorities warned that a number of aftershocks were likely to follow with more damage expected. Most of the damage is believed to be in the Palmerston North area, north east of Wellington. Fires broke out, telephone lines and power poles came down and alarm bells sounding in numerous towns. Police inspector Mike Coleman, at the Wellington central command, said that windows had been smashed and crockery had been thrown around - 'the usual sort of movement with earthquakes.' Wellington Free Abulance service said that while there were no immediate call-outs to attend injuries, the service had gone into emergency management mode as a precaution . Karen Monk, who lives on a farm just north of the town of Masterton, told the New Zealand Herald that the quake was 'really violent'. She added: 'My baby daughter was in her cot asleep and I managed to leap across the hall and grab her and leap outside onto the lawn.' Ms Monk and the baby remained outside for about half an hour while aftershocks rolled through. Wipeout: Dozens of bottles of wine lie smashed on the floor in the small Wairarapa town of Eketahuna . A shake map released by the US Geological Survey shows the location and intensity of the quake . The cleanup: Staff members start to tidy up after the earthquake hit Eketahuna . Pam Lochore, wife of former All Black star Sir Brian Lochore, said photographs have tumbled from shelves in their Masterton home. The earthquake had also caused water in the pool to 'rock side to side' and a 'rugby ball went flying across the room.' One resident of Raumati South, Ms Leigh Nichols, described the earthquake as 'like a train going along the track. It was so noisy, everything was just rattling.' Office staff were evacuated from buildings and motorists were urged to drive with care in case roads had subsided or debris had spilled across roads. Reports later said that houses had suffered collapsed walls, fallen chimneys and broken windows in Ektahuna. Earthquakes are not uncommon in New Zealand, the worst in recent times being the Christchurch disaster of February 2011 which brought buildings crashing down in the city centre, killing 185 people.","6.3 magnitude quake hit centre of country earlier today .

"By . Richard  Shears . British former police community support officer Andrea Waldeck told an Indonesian court today that smuggling drugs into the country was the 'most stupid decision of my life.' The 43-year-old former PCSO with Gloucestershire Police had previously pleaded guilty to trafficking crystal meth, often referred to as 'ice', worth more than £3,000 into Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city, in April last year. Miss Waldeck blamed her 'state of mind' at the time which led to her bringing the 3lbs of ice into the country, resulting in her arrest when police raided her three-star hotel Surabaya hotel. Scroll down for video . Andrea Waldeck is given an update on proceedings during today's hearing in Surabaya . At an earlier hearing Miss Waldeck, who had worked with the Gloucestershire constabulary, clutched a Bible and twisted rosary beads through her fingers as she heard prosecutors demand that she be sent to jail for 16 years and be fined £100,000. But today her defence team argued that despite her admission of the crime - smuggling the drugs through customs in her underwear - the case had not been proved because of the duress she had suffered. The team was referring to Miss Waldeck's claim that an African friend in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, where she had been living after leaving the UK, had threatened her, telling her: 'I'm Nigerian. You know about Nigerians. We kill people.' Today the defence team said the threat, made by a man called  'Joe', meant that Miss Waldeck could not be deemed fully responsible by law. Family support: Waldeck's mother and brother observe proceedings during an earlier court hearing . Apology: Waldeck told the court she regretted her actions and said they were the result of 'the most stupid decision of my life' Standing before the three judges in a red prisoner's bib, Miss Waldeck then spoke in her own defence. She apologised to the court for the crime, explaining that her state of mind at the time had led to 'the most stupid decision of my life and one I regret the most.' Much of the six hour hearing was taken up with complex legal argument and when the court eventually adjourned, Miss Waldeck was told she would continue to be remanded in custody until the next hearing on January 15. It is then that the prosecution will have the opportunity of responding to the defence plea for leniency. Despite the prosecution having earlier asked for Miss Waldeck to be sent to prison for 16 years, there is no guarantee that she will receive that sentence. Observers said there was still a chance that she could be sentenced to death, as happened with British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, from Gloucester, who is now on death row in a Bali jail, despite the prosecution asking for a 15-year jail sentence. Waldeck waits for her hearing to commence as she paces around in a jail cell with fellow female prisoners . Waldeck is visited by her mother and brother in her cell before entering the courtroom for her hearing . Armed police escort Waldeck to her hearing in Surabaya earlier this month . Miss Waldeck has shown open remorse since her arrest. She said in an earlier Facebook message to friends: 'Your support means the world to me. I'm so very sorry I've disappointed you all.' Her court appearance today comes just four days after police from Guangzhou raided homes in the city of Lufeng and seized three tons of ice and made 182 arrests. Police said a massive drug operation had been operating in Lufeng, a notorious drug-producing area. While there is no suggestion that the drug operation was linked to Miss Waldeck's agreement to act as a drug mule on the flight from Guangzhou to Indonesia, police said that in the past three years, Lufeng - 370 miles from Guangzhou - had provided one third of the crystel meth nationwide. It has not been revealed whether the drugs seized in the Lufeng raid were for export or domestic consumption.","Andrea Waldeck, 43, had previously served with Gloucestershire Police .

"By . Richard  Shears . and Amanda Williams . The wife of a man who died after rescuing their two children from drowning in Australia has her husband 'died a hero'. Andrew Priestley, from Leicestershire, died in hospital after getting into difficulty at Burrill Beach - around 155 miles south of Sydney on Australia's east coast. He fought desperately to keep his two boys Matthew, 12, and Daniel, 10, afloat after they got caught in strong currents at the beauty spot. Andrew Priestley, from Leicestershire,  fought desperately to keep his two boys Matthew, 12, and Daniel, 10, afloat after they got caught in strong currents at Burrill Beach - around 155 miles south of Sydney on Australia's east coast. His wife Amanda (pictured) has called him a hero . But once they were rescued, he was unable to save himself. After entering the water and rescuing the children, it is believed Mr Priestley may have suffered a heart attack. He was later found floating face down in the water and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital . Mr Priestley, a businessman from Market Harborough, was on a three-week road trip from Sydney to Melbourne with his wife, Amanda, and their children. Mrs Priestley, 43, said she stayed on the beach with their daughter Amelia, eight, while her husband and sons went into the water. Matthew and Daniel were said to have screamed in panic as they were dragged under by strong rip currents. Mr Priestley fought his way across the waves and lifted his sons onto a surfboard, while others pulled them to safety. Mrs Priestley's father Terence Collins said: 'Amanda said that Andrew died saving the children. 'She said that he managed to lift them onto a surfboard and other people there pulled it onto the beach. But by the time they came back for Andrew he had been washed away by these terrible rip currents. His body was found face down in the water. He died a hero.' Mrs Priestley’s sister, Susan Collins, added: 'Andrew used all his energies to get the boys onto the surf board. He died a hero saving them.' Died: The 44-year-old man is believed to have suffered a heart attack when he dived into the water to help his sons at Burrill Beach, near the port of Ulladulla, south of Sydney . A . statement released by the Foreign Office on behalf of the family said . it was 'heartbreakingly impossible' to imagine life without him. The statement said: 'The family of Andrew are devastated about his death in Australia. He died after saving his children.

He said the family, who have been offered consulate support, had been on holiday when then incident occurred. Tributes were also paid by a football club in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, where Mr Priestley's two sons played. In a statement on their website, Borough Alliance FC said they would hold a minute's silence before their matches today.

"By . Richard  Shears . Taunted and tormented, a female orangutan is cruelly mocked by villagers who have captured her and turned her into an afternoon’s entertainment. Alone with no water or food, she is surrounded by a circle of jeering humans. When she tries to break free, to run back to the jungle in western Borneo where she lives with other members of her endangered species, a cable around her waist holds her back. This orangutan was mocked by villagers who captured her and turned her into an afternoon's entertainment . Alone and with no water or food, she was surrounded by a circle of jeering humans . She was rescued by a British animal charity she has been rescued and will soon be released into a safe area . The good news for this particular orangutan is that thanks to a British animal charity she has been rescued and will soon be released into a safe area. But her plight shows why environmentalists fear they have years of work ahead of them in educating remote villages about the need to protect, not capture or kill, these animals whose numbers are falling dramatically. About 100 years ago it was thought there were 315,000 orangutans in the wild but today there are less than 54,000 in Borneo and only around 6,000 on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The population has declined because of the spread of palm oil plantations, the products of which include soaps and perfumes that are sold in Western high street stores. The spread of humans, who chop down trees to make room for their villages, has also reduced their numbers. About 100 years ago it was thought there were 315,000 orangutans in the wild but today there are less than 54,000 in Borneo and only around 6,000 on the Indonesian island of Sumatra . The scene bordered on torture of a helpless animal in the remote Tempurkan village . One of the villagers thought it had all gone too far and contacted Argitoe Ranting, who works for the British charity International Animal Rescue . This orangutan had made her way to . remote Tempurkan village looking for food and was caught and pinned down . by six people on land cleared for a rice plantation. She was dragged back to the village and the degradation began. She could only sit as families left their huts and others rode in from other areas on their motorcycles to stare or laugh at the sad captive. The scene bordered on torture of a helpless animal. At one point, a pole was erected so she could clamber up – to the added amusement of the crowd. But one of the villagers thought it had all gone too far and decided the torment should stop. He contacted Argitoe Ranting, who works for the British charity International Animal Rescue. Mr Ranting found the orangutan tied up on the side of a road and called in a team to rescue her. They sedated her and then moved her to a rescue centre. The orangutan has been named Ael – Saint – and will be released into the wild when a safe area in the forest can be found for her. Meanwhile, the villagers have been told that catching and keeping an orangutan is against the law in Indonesia – as well as being cruel and degrading treatment of such a majestic wild animal.","Alone with no water, orangutan was surrounded by jeering humans .

"By . Richard  Shears . Crude: Jacintha Saldanha killed herself just days after being duped by Australian radio DJs . The chairman of the radio station behind the hoax 'royal call' that resulted in the death of duped nurse Jacintha Saldanha crudely brushed the incident off today by declaring to shareholders that 's*** happens'. At the annual meeting of shareholders . of Southern Cross Media - owners of Sydney radio station 2Day FM - in . Melbourne today, chairman Max Moore-Wilton tried to play down the . controversy with a crude, casual throw-away line. 'These incidents were unfortunate, no doubt about that,' he said. 'But in the immortal words of someone whose identity I cannot recall, s*** happens.' It was last December that presenters Mel Greig and Michael Christian called King Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. Mrs Saldanha failed to see through their poor . impersonations and transferred them through to another nurse who . revealed some details about her condition. Three days later Jacintha Saldanha was found hanged at her London accommodation. Only . two months ago, it emerged that in one of the three letters she left, . Mrs Saldanha directly accused the two Australian DJs of driving her to . her death. Australian DJs Mel Greig (right) and Michael Christian (left) were responsible for hoax calls to the hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge . She even said they should pay the mortgage for the Bristol home where her accountant husband Benedict Barboza, 49, and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14, still live. In . the handwritten note, addressed to her managers at the Edward VII . hospital, she said: ‘Please accept my apologies. I am truly sorry. Thank . you for all your support. Prank: The Australian DJs rang King Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness and tried to get information about her condition . ‘I . hold the Radio Australians Mel Greig and Michael Christian responsible . for this act. Please make them pay my mortgage. I am sorry. Jacintha.’ After the meeting he was asked whether he had any regrets about his comment. 'I think it was a one-sentence comment wasn't it?' he told Fairfax Media. 'I have no comment. I made a comment in one sentence. I am glad the media is so busy.' Shareholders were told that revenue from the company's metropolitan radio stations, which include the 2Day FM and Triple M networks, fell last year due due to scandals involving presenter Kyle Sandilands - who on one occasion called an editor a 'fat slag' - and what the company called 'the UK incident'. The company suspended all advertising on 2Day FM after the royal hoax scandal, but it did not prevent chief executive Rhys Holleran's total pay rising by more than $350,000 (£210,000)  to $1.66 million (£958,000) during the last financial year. The scandal also did not prevent one of the DJs, Mr Christian, winning a 'Top Jock' award - while his co-presenter, Miss Greig, remained in shock at the consequences of the hoax call and was unable to return to work. An inquest into the death of Miss Saldanha was adjourned last month after Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox asked the family to supply medical records that might provide evidence about her state of mind at the time of her death.","Chairman Max Moore-Wilton made comment at meeting of shareholders .

"By . Richard  Shears . A man has died defending his home from an intense wildfire that razed wooded hills near Australia's west coast city of Perth, destroying 49 houses. The 62-year-old man collapsed and died on the roof of his home in suburban Hovea on Perth's eastern fringe on Sunday. He was believed to be hosing water onto his roof to protect it against embers, state fire service spokesman Allen Gale said Monday. The house was not damaged, Gale said. Scroll down for video . Blaze: A firetruck next to woodland in the Stoneville area of Perth that has become an inferno . Catastrophe: The fire has turned 46 homes to ash . Erractic winds whipped up 20-meter (65-foot) flames. The fire destroyed 49 houses and badly damaged another home in a picturesque region known as the Perth Hills, where homes are scattered through eucalyptus and jarrah forests, Gale said. The destruction toll was revised up from 46 houses following the discovery of three dwellings that were burnt on Sunday, he said. Four people initially reported missing in Parkerville - the village where the fire started and where four homes burned down - were found unharmed, Gale said. The wildfire risk has been heightened by heat wave conditions on the west coast. Perth's temperature reached 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday, the city's hottest day in six years. About 275 firefighters on Monday continued to fight the blaze, which burned through about 350 hectares (865 acres) of woodlands and has been contained since Sunday night. The firefighters' battle to keep the fire within containment lines was helped by cooler conditions. Temperatures in the hills region peaked at 41 C (106 F) on Sunday, but a sea breeze pushed the forecast maximum down to less than 30 C (86 F) on Monday. Gale said there was nothing the team of 385 firefighters could have done to save more houses. 'When you have a fire front of the magnitude they had yesterday, it was unassailable,' Gale said. The service said two firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion. Some 500 people from the Perth Hills region gathered for a community meeting on Monday, when they were told that would probably not be able to return to their homes to check on any damage until Wednesday. Former firefighter Greg Dunston told Radio 6PR that he stayed behind to protect his home and also managed to save nighbouring houses by putting out spot fires. Emergency: Firefighters work to contain wildfires in the Stoneville area . 'We're on quite a slope, so the fire raced up the hill,' he said. Mundaring Shire president Helen Dullard said that knowing so many homes had been lost increased the devastation 'tremendously'. She added that to look at, the fire was 'very ugly - it was scary.' Insurance companies have declared the fire a catastrophic event. Response: Up to 275 firefighters were brought in to fight the blazes .","The fire erupted as the Western Australia city endured its hottest ever night .

"By . Richard  Shears . A British sea captain was behind bars on a remote island in Papua New Guinea last night after being arrested in connection with the sinking of one of his ships last year, in which 162 people drowned. Peter Sharp, originally from the Shetland Islands, was ordered to surrender his British passport before being locked up on the island of East New Britain where he has been charged with 162 counts of manslaughter by criminal negligence. He was also charged with sending an unseaworthy vessel, the 259 ton Rabaul Queen, to sea, before it sank off the coast of Morobe Province in February last year. Tragedy: 162 people drowned after the Rabaul Queen, owned by British national Peter Sharp, capsized off the coast of Morobe Province in February last year . Police said at the time that they did not know exactly how many people had died as it was believed there had been a number of children under the age of three on board whose names were not recorded on the ship's manifest. Mr Sharp, 69, who has lived in Papua New Guinea for a number of years, was arrested after a prolonged police investigation and a Commission of Inquiry into the sinking of the vessel, owned by his company, Rabaul Shipping. A four man police team, led by Detective Chief Inspector Ben Turi, arrived in East New Britain earlier this week and took Mr Sharp into custody. Liferafts from the Rabaul Queen are seen in the water following the disaster in February last year . Rescue: A helicopter hovers above life rafts from the stricken ship. Owner Peter sharp has been charged with 162 counts of manslaughter . Following a lengthy interview he was locked up in a police cell in the town of Kokono as his lawyer and family tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain bail for him. The Commission of Inquiry found in September last year that the Rabaul Queen was not seaworthy, unsafe and should never have departed on its final voyage. The commission found that weather and sea conditions at the time she ship capsized were gale force and it should not have been at sea. Tragic: The incident happened when the ferry was travelling between two different parts of Papua New Guinea . The inquiry found that Mr Sharp had demonstrated that he had little or no respect for people, including those in authority. Reports said that his 'gross disrespect' was reflected in the 'appalling and inhumane conditions' in which he was prepared to let passengers on the Rabaul Queen travel and might explain in part why he was prepared to compromise the safety of passengers on board his ships. New Guinea Islands Divisional Commander Anton Billie said today that Mr Sharp was 'innocent until proven guilty and the matter is now before the courts.'","Peter Sharp, 69, faces .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . The flags of St George are being unfurled, supermarkets are bombarding us with special offers on beer and crisps, and the usual  television  schedules are about to  be obliterated. In case you hadn’t noticed, the World Cup is about to kick off. But despite the relentless chatter and endless advertising onslaught, it seems the nation isn’t quite as behind the England team as you might expect. Uninterested? England fans at a pre-World Cup friendly - but not everyone is in the mood. A survey has found four in 10 English people don't care about the team's chances, and 30 per cent aren't supporting them at all . For a survey claims that four in ten people living in England couldn’t care less what happens to Wayne Rooney and his team-mates when they kick off their campaign on Saturday night. According to market researchers Mintel, 30 per cent go as far as to say they will not be supporting England, while a further 9 per cent say they do not care either way what happens to Roy Hodgson’s side. Older people are particularly turned off by the hype, with the over-65s the least likely to care whether the England team make it to the latter stages of the tournament or return home humiliated. The survey found the North West of England is the most patriotic area with two thirds saying they will be supporting the Three Lions. The North East ranks second and London third. Perhaps unsurprisingly, support for England tails off even further among those living in Wales and Scotland. North of the border, some 72 per cent of people have taken an ‘anyone but England’ approach to the tournament, while 5 per cent said they had no strong opinion. And in Wales 60 per cent of those surveyed said they didn’t care what happened to the English. Anticipation: England's Raheem Sterling and Peru's Yoshimar Yotun during a pre-tournament friendly . The research suggests that even those England-based fans who are actively supporting the team may have adopted second teams to follow during the tournament in case England crash out early – with some surprising choices. Mintel trends expert Richard Cope said: ‘Many bookies have England as only third favourites to emerge from Group D, so there might be an element of England fans hedging their bets in declaring their support for “second teams”.’ He added: ‘In Scotland, 24 per cent are supporting a team other than England, and Scottish supporters have traditionally embraced Germany and Argentina. ‘But we’re also seeing England supporters adopt these former footballing enemies as their second teams – and this is likely to be due to the fact that they have several Premiership stars in their ranks.’ The research suggests one reason for a reluctance to follow England is the poor behaviour of the fans, both at home and abroad. Families are predicted to splash out £335million in a World Cup spending spree that will include the latest supersize TVs, football shirts and party food and drink. New TVs will account for half of the spending at £170million, according to Mintel. John Lewis has already seen a 47 per cent rise in TV sales compared with last year. Figures suggest families will spend an extra £300 each on average as a consequence of the World Cup. Somewhere behind all those England flags is the home of patriotic football fan Tony Baddams. The 46-year-old spent weeks covering the entire front of his four-bedroom terraced property (right) with more than 300 flags, shirts and fluffy dice to cheer on the Three Lions. The decorations even cover his front door and windows – but the Chelsea fan says the lack of sunlight is worth it. Mr Baddams, from Southampton, said: ‘I just wanted to show my support for the lads.’ His wife Anita, a carer aged 44, hated the display at first but has now grown to love it. But neighbours still seem far from convinced. One said: ‘I think it is a bit scruffy.’","Researchers said 30% of nation will not be supporting England team at all .

Prince Harry was surrounded by heavy security in Sydney, where he is . representing the Queen at a review of naval ships on Sydney harbor. As the fourth in line to the throne remained . under heavy protection - including police commandos in rubber dinghies as . standard procedure  - alarming claims were made that Prince Harry was a . constant target for Taliban fighters while he was serving in Afghanistan. The Taliban insurgent, Qari Nasrullah, . made it clear that Prince Harry was not looked upon as the son of the Queen of . England. Prince Harry was the target of Taliban forces while serving in Afghanistan, it has been claimed. In Sydney today, the prince was met by Vice Admiral Ray Griggs, Chief of Navy, before embarking on the HMAS Leeuwin as they attend the 2013 International Fleet Review . Prince Harry and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott view Sydney Harbour as they participate in the the 2013 International Fleet Review . Taliban member Qari Bashir has claimed Prince Harry was a prime target in a new interview . 'As far as the Mujahideen were concerned, he . was just an ordinary soldier who was fighting for America,' Nasrullah told The Daily Mirror in a secret interview in Pakistan. 'This is how we view . him. 'He may well be a Prince in Britain, but to us he is merely a common soldier. 'There were many plans to capture him but - maybe it was his good luck - . he managed to escape.' During his first tour as an infantryman . Prince Harry had to be recalled for his own safety when it was leaked that . he was serving in Afghanistan. He completed his second tour as part of 662 .

This picture taken on November 1, 2012 shows Britain's Prince Harry at a mission briefing at the British controlled flight-line at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, where he was serving as an Apache helicopter pilot/gunner with 662 Sqd Army Air Corps. Ground . forces charged at the desert perimeter, firing rock-propelled grenades and . Soviet-make AK47 assault rifles. Although it is believed Harry was off duty at . the time, the battle continued for four hours resulting in the deaths of two US . servicemen and the destruction of several planes and helicopters. Nasrullah, his face covered by a scarf, asked . in the secret Mirror interview why the British people did not take notice of . the suffering of children in Kunar province as a result of NATO air strikes.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Food watchdogs have been accused of a cover-up after it emerged six in ten supermarket chickens carry a dangerous bug. The contamination is driving a food poisoning epidemic that hits at least 280,000 people a year. Official estimates suggest the bug, campylobacter – which causes stomach upsets, vomiting and diarrhoea – is responsible for more than 100 deaths each year. It costs the economy about £900million in treating the sick and lost days at work. Scroll down for video . Food watchdogs have been accused of a cover-up after it emerged six in ten supermarket chickens carry the dangerous bug campylobacter which hits at least 280,000 people a year (file photo) The survey results are a damning indictment of supermarkets, farmers and processors who are putting customers at risk every day of the week. The figures were published yesterday by the Food Standards Agency.  But it refuses to name the stores involved, following lobbying from retailers and Whitehall. Consumer groups and academics say the FSA and the Government are putting the commercial interests of big business ahead of public health. The figures demonstrate that retailers, producers and the FSA have failed to deliver on promises to clean up dirty chicken since the last major survey of campylobacter was published in 2009. Then, the contamination level was 65 per cent of all fresh whole chicken, while the latest tests put the figure at 59 per cent. Tests were carried out on 853 birds sold between February and April, with 16 per cent – around one in six – found to have the highest level of contamination. Even the outside of one in 20 packs of raw chicken was contaminated with campylobacter, suggesting that simply picking up a bird to check a price creates a risk. Official estimates suggest the bug, campylobacter - which causes stomach upsets, vomiting and diarrhoea - is responsible for more than 100 deaths each year . Until efforts to eradicate the bug are successful, families are being advised to handle chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, called for an end to the secrecy. ‘The FSA’s survey reveals unacceptably high levels of campylobacter and they must now publish the names of the retailers so consumers are aware of the best and worst performing shops,’ he said. Earlier this year, when it revealed plans for a series of surveys, the FSA announced that it would publish the names of the stores selling the contaminated chicken. It was hoped this would shame the retailers into action. However, this was overturned following lobbying from supermarkets and the British Retail Consortium, the organisation which represents them. Officials in the food and farming department Defra, which has close links to farmers and processors, also campaigned to keep the details secret. There are even suggestions that the Prime Minister’s office wanted to block the release of names. The FSA decision to keep the names secret went through only on the casting vote of its chairman, Tim Bennett (left), while Labour environment spokesman Maria Eagle (right) said the FSA must be transparent and put 'the interests of the consumer first' The FSA decision to keep the names secret went through only on the casting vote of its chairman, Tim Bennett, a former president of the National Farmers’ Union. Erik Millstone, professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, said the secrecy surrounding the sale of contaminated chicken is ‘deeply disappointing’. He said: ‘The FSA has failed to keep its promise to the British public. This means that consumers can no longer trust the FSA to put the interest of consumers ahead of those of the food industry.’ Tim Lang, professor of food policy at . City University, said the FSA had been ‘captured’ by industry interests. ‘This is a sad day for British food policy. A quarter of a century . after the British learned of the extent of contamination of poultry, we . are back again with unacceptable levels of food-borne pathogens. Then, . it was salmonella. Now, it’s campylobacter.’ Labour’s . environment spokesman Maria Eagle said: ‘The Government must restore . confidence in the food sector and ensure that the FSA is transparent and . puts the interests of the consumer first.’ FSA chief executive . Catherine Brown said it will publish a full survey with the names of . stores, but not until it has more information. The British Retail Consortium insisted much of the responsibility for tackling campylobacter should be passed to consumers, who can protect themselves by carefully handling and thoroughly cooking chicken. Its food director, Andrew Opie, said: ‘We’re working really hard right across our supply chain but sadly there just isn’t a magic bullet that will get rid of campylobacter because it occurs naturally in poultry.’ Recently, allegations of suspect practices were made about two of the UK’s biggest chicken suppliers, the 2 Sisters Food Group and Faccenda, which supply supermarkets and restaurant chains. Industry insiders claimed, for example, that chicken which fell on to the floor at two 2 Sisters factories was routinely put back on to the production line. The FSA investigated and declared the plants involved were operating within acceptable standards. A Government spokesperson said: ‘As long as the public continue to follow long standing advice on preparing and cooking chicken, campylobacter poses minimal risk to them. Our top priority is the safety of the public and we want people to feel reassured the food they buy is safe. ‘Previous figures have shown around two thirds of poultry to be carrying this bacteria and we continue to work closely with the Food Standards Agency, retailers, processors and farmers to tackle campylobacter in poultry.’","Bug, campylobacter, causes stomach upsets, vomiting and diarrhoea .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of Wonga, Errol Damelin (pictured), over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers . Police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of Wonga, Errol Damelin, over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers. Mr Damelin stepped down from the payday loan giant two weeks ago as the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority(FCA), prepared to issue a damning judgment on Wonga’s treatment of customers. The South African businessman founded Wonga in 2007 and was chief executive at the time the company invented two law firms and sent threatening letters to 45,000 customers who were behind on repayments. Despite this, he has walked away from the company with a personal fortune estimated at more than £34million and without suffering any sanction. The FCA has ordered Wonga to pay compensation of some £2.6million to the customers involved, which is pocket money to the wealthy company and works out at flat rate of just £50 each. But that has left consumer groups and MPs demanding to know why Mr Damelin and Wonga have not been investigated under a series of possible criminal offences. Earlier this week, sources at the FCA indicated that the City of London Police were asked to investigate Wonga’s activities by its predecessor, the Office of Fair Trading(OFT), last year and they decided not to take any action. However, this has been denied by the police, while Wonga says the company and its executives were never contacted by officers. There are a number of potential offences which Wonga may have committed including a breach of The Solicitors Act of 1974, which makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor. There is also the Administration of Justice Act, which make it a crime to harass debtors, as well as the Fraud Act and the Theft Act. Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group said: ‘Clearly there are a very large number of victims.  Each one has been mugged by Wonga. ‘It seems to me that no-one – not the OFT, the Financial Services Authority, not the FCA or the police have focussed on the effect upon the victims and the sheer scale of what has gone on.‘ . Investigations should be carried out. Apart from who knew what was going on - who came up with the idea?  Who . approved it?  Who put it into action? ‘Of course, Mr Damelin as the . chief executive and the man running the company at the time should be . investigated. If action is not taken then it will undermine confidence . in the regulatory process once again.’ Wonga has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers by sending letters from fake law firms . Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, Mark Field, said there appear to be grounds for urgent police action. He said: ‘I support this industry, but Wonga isn’t doing itself any favours with this type of sharp practice and it’s a matter of urgency for police attention. Wonga is its own worst enemy on this and this could be the tip of the iceberg.’ Labour MP John Mann has called for the Treasury Select Committee to investigate the payday loan industry and the apparent inability of City watchdogs to fine Wonga for historic offences. ‘The idea that a company can send thousands are letters to customers from imaginary law firms and the regulator not able to fine them is something I and the majority of people in the UK will find appalling,’ he said. Labour MP, Andy McDonald, told MPs in the House of Commons yesterday there was a good case for investigating the directors and removing their right to hold a credit licence. Labour has been keen to play up the fact that a major donor to the Conservative party also holds a huge stake in Wonga, which is said to be worth more than £380million. Adrian Beecroft, who has donated more than £500,000 to the Conservatives since 2006, is also the chairman of Dawn Capital, which has made a fortune from investing in Wonga. Labour MP, Andy Sawford, suggested the only way to make Wonga suffer would be to apply the same interest rates it uses for customers to the £2.6million the company has been told to repay. Using this calculation, he suggested the company would have to hand back £203 trillion. Speaking during the weekly Commons business statement, Mr Sawford said: ‘Can we have emergency legislation on compensation and compound interest to make Wonga pay out not £2.6 million compensation for unfair practice but at their own outrageous interest rates of 5,853per cent, make them pay £203 trillion? ‘Perhaps then they would understand the misery they cause?’ Mr Damelin, 44, has made no comment on the Wonga fiasco since details were released earlier this week. Wonga claimed the businessman, who was educated at Cape Town University, had departed in what it called an ‘orderly exit from the company’ that would allow him to work on new business ventures. The fiercely private individual spilt from his wife Julie, the mother of the couple’s three young children, last year after 15 years of marriage in what was described as an amicable break. Wonga has apologised for the letters and insists that all the managers who were in place at the time they were sent between 2008 and 2010 have since left the business. Asked whether Mr Damelin had suffered any sanction for his part in the fiasco, the company said: ‘The historic debt collection letters are Wonga’s responsibility, and so we won’t be commenting on particular individuals. ‘We provided information on the letters to the OFT in 2011, and since then have been working with them and our current regulator the FCA on a resolution for customers. No-one from the company has been interviewed by the police on this matter.’","Errol Damelin stepped down from the payday loan giant two weeks ago .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Aldi has unveiled its new back to school range, which is says is the nation's cheapest . Its growing success is all down to under-cutting rivals and now Aldi has done it again – this time with school uniforms. The German discount retailer has unveiled its new back to school range, which it says is the country’s cheapest. Parents can pick up an entire uniform for just £4. The move could start a back-to-school price war before the summer holidays have even begun. The range goes on sale next Thursday, July 24, and is expected to fly out of stores. Trousers and skirts cost £1.50 each, a sweater or polo shirt is just £1.25 and shirts and blouses wil go for £1.25. The range also extends to PE kits, padded coats, shoes, and even £6.95 football boots. The price tags dramatically undercut the major supermarkets, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, which have prided themselves as champions of cost-conscious parents. They have won big sales by beating mainstream clothing retailers of school uniforms, such as Marks & Spencer and specialist outfitters. With the average cost of a full uniform said to range from £156 for primary schools to £285 for secondary schools in some areas, the supermarket offerings have been extraordinarily popular  with parents. Aldi said the equivalent items in its £4 uniform would cost £6.75 at Tesco, £7.33 at Sainsbury’s and £7.50 at  Asda. However, Sainsbury’s disputes this, saying that it charges £6.17 for the same three items. Unlike other retailers, Aldi has a flat price range across all sizes from ages four to 11. A . spokesman said the clothing was made in Bangladesh, adding: ‘We promote . workplace practices and conditions that are safe, fair and legal for . all those involved in making our products.’ The . Aldi uniform is likely to appeal to the parents of fast-growing . primary-school age children as generic grey, black and navy items are . accepted at most schools. However not all will be able to stock up. Many head teachers demand that . uniforms are specific to their schools with particular badges, colours . or added logos and many schools have exclusive deals with specialist . suppliers which mean uniforms can only be bought from one store. Daisy . Craydon, a mother-of-two who writes for parenting publication . UKMums.TV, says she was pleasantly surprised by a sample of the new Aldi . uniform. The 29-year-old from Northampton said: . 'I was really impressed with it. The first thing that struck me was the . low price but the high quality - especially the feel of the material. The Aldi Specialbuy Back to School uniform - which costs just £4 for a sweater, two polo shirts and bottoms. The range, available for four to 11-year-olds, undercuts other supermarkets by up to 47 per cent . The range includes this unisex sweater (left) that comes in a number of colours and costs just £1.25. Parents will also be able to buy two polo shirts (right) for £1.25 when the range launches at the end of next month . Thrifty Aldi shoppers may also buy a pair of trousers or a skirt for just £1.50 . 'It . feels like it will be really good if the children fall over in the . playground - it won't just rip as easily as other materials do. 'Most mums I know buy school uniforms from supermarkets now and I would usually go to Tesco or Sainsburys. 'But the offer from Aldi will keep mums going back to Aldi, and I would definitely buy another uniform from there in future.' Tony . Baines, managing director for corporate buying at Aldi, said: 'The run . up to the new term can be a stressful time for families. A unisex short sleeved shirt (left) will be priced at £1.99 each and a girls knitted cardigan (right) just £2.79 . Aldi has unveiled its new back to school range with parents able to pick up an entire uniform for £4 . 'As a result, we were keen to offer . parents the opportunity to stock up on superior school uniforms and . accessories ahead of the new term without breaking the bank. 'We . are therefore delighted to provide our customers with a fantastic . quality school uniform range at the lowest price available in any . supermarket.' The Back to School range will be available in Aldi stores nationwide from July 24.

"[authoR] . It was the food of kings, but now venison is enjoying a remarkable renaissance on the dinner tables of middle Britain. Sales of venison as steaks, burgers and sausages are rising sharply, not least because it is seen as a healthier and lower fat alternative to beef. Data from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel showed that venison sales have rocketed by 413 per cent year on year - from £1.2million in June 2013 to £6.4million last month. Available in all good supermarkets: Venison stew and venison burgers . While venison has long been available at upmarket stores such as Harrods or Fortnum & Mason, it is now sold across high street chains from Marks & Spencer to festive ranges from the budget grocers Lidl and Aldi. The term venison comes from the Latin verb ‘venor’ meaning to hunt or pursue and it entered the English language via the Normans who invaded Britain in 1066. The Normans introduced the concept of royal forests which were set aside for the aristocracy and particularly kings for the hunting of animals such as deer, hare and fowl. Venison was the choice of the Tudors, most particularly, Henry VIII, but it is now becoming a barbecue favourite for the masses. Venison, mashed potato and Chanterelle mushrooms - a meal for a king or a peasant . Tesco rolled out a seven-strong Chef's Selection range including venison burgers, meatballs and steaks from supplier Highland Game across the country in April. These include venison sausages, which come in at £3 for a pack weighing 300g; venison steaks with a whisky jus at £6.99 for a 350g pack; and a pack of four venison burgers for £4, which is the same price as the equivalent ‘Finest’ beef burgers. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘While venison has been widely regarded as the sole preserve of the rich and particularly the country set, the meat is now finding favour with a much wider audience especially in the form of burgers and sausages. ‘Besides being extremely moist and juicy to eat, venison is also very healthy having 30 per cent more iron and being 50 per cent leaner than beef.’ Rival Sainsbury's is planning to its own new venison lines under the prestige Taste The Difference brand this autumn, while a Venison Wellington is to be one of the key lines in Asda's Christmas range. Asda, which is sourcing its Venison Wellington from Northern Ireland supplier Finnebrogue, said the launch reflected the increasing quality of its Christmas range and said that shoppers were looking for a 'wow factor.' Asda said: ‘Finnebrogue has put itself on the map and are bringing venison to the fore but in an easy format.’ No longer a royal preserve: Venison served with mustard and bacon strips . The Downpatrick-based supplier, which also make the retailer's Extra Special sausage range, has ramped up production following a £3 million expansion of its facility in January. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's has increased the distribution of its venison lines which include sausages, burgers and diced steak with a sauce. Its market share of venison sales had been 33.4per cent in the past 12 weeks --up from 19.6per cent in the same period a year ago. A spokesman said: ‘We have seen a growing customer demand for the protein, which is why our range now covers added-value venison.’","Venison sales have rocketed by 413 per cent year on year - from £1.2million in June 2013 to £6.4million last month .

The unnamed woman  drove during the night from Hamilton, then travelled north to Auckland before continuing on to . the east coast. She was eventually found slumped over the steering wheel in the driveway of her former home near . Tauranga at 4.55am. She had been on the road for . five hours and had travelled 186 miles. Bizarre: A woman who was unconscious after taking sleeping pills managed to 'sleep drive' nearly 200 miles around New Zealand. This is a file picture of Auckland, where she travelled to at one point . Police officers admitted they were astonished that she was able to drive without being involved in an accident. A friend of the unnamed woman called police shortly after midnight to warn them that she had taken sleeping pills and had driven away from her Hamilton home. The friend was alarmed because the woman had previously driven off while asleep 10 months ago and had ended up in her previous home on the east coast with no recollection of the night's events. Senior Sergeant Dave Litton of Hamilton Police said that during the woman's sleep drive she had sent text messages, leaving those who had received them in no doubt that she was half asleep. What they didn't realise was that she was actually at the wheel of her silver Toyota hatchback car at the time. Police around the north island were alerted to watch out for the car and although her mobile phone was on patrol vehicles were unable to pinpoint the woman's exact location, as she was still driving. On one occasion police were able to track the car, through the mobile phone, to Otara in the south of Auckland, at around 2am but by the time officers arrived the vehicle had gone. 'While all this was going on, police were scanning any reports of unusual or concerning driving as we attempted to find the Toyota and prevent a potential tragedy,' Sgt Litton told the New Zealand Herald. The car was eventually found in the driveway of her former home near Tauranga, on the east coast. 'The woman's cousin found her asleep, slumped over the wheel,' said Sgt Litton. When woken, she had absolutely no recollection of the events overnight. 'We have sought an urgent order forbidding her to drive and to seek medical advice on her suitability to remain holding her drivers licence. 'While her being found safe and well is a relief for everyone involved, the potential for tragedy was huge and we're urging people suffering medical conditions to be open and honest with their doctors and seek advice on the medication they are prescribed.'","Unnamed woman travelled from Hamilton to Auckland and then east coast .

Hurry up and drink your sprouts. The thought may make many go a bit green about the gills, but if you can’t stand Brussels sprouts on your plate at Christmas then how about trying them as a refreshing juice instead? Marks & Spencer is to combine the much-maligned vegetable with apple and pear for a sweet and tasty drink that adds a healthy element to the usual festive binge. The juice adds up to two of the five daily portions of fruit and vegetables that are recommended for a healthy diet. Together with a sprout-based coleslaw, it is among many innovations that are being introduced by M&S for its festive food collection this year – not all of them for the more virtuous diner. Following the successful launch of its Fish and Chip Pie, the chain will be selling an indulgent Christmas dinner in a pie this year – complete with turkey, stuffing, pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce. And for those who want a bite-size version of Christmas, the party food range includes Christmas dinner on a stick. A team of 40-strong product developers at M&S began working on the range in September last year and have flown to New York, Barcelona and Paris to find the latest trends and ingredients. Innovative new products include a Christmas cake liqueur and an edible cheese board made from crackers. There is also a gin flavoured with tea and dressed with gold flakes, which M&S is calling the G&Tea.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . The cost of running a home in the North of England is £3,000 cheaper than London and the South. Research reveals the cost of living in the South carries a hefty premium – not least because housing is so much more expensive. Experts looked at mortgage and rent repayments alongside energy and water bills, household insurance,  council tax and broadband charges to create a cost of living league. It's cheaper up north: The cost of running a home is cheapest in the north of England, followed by northern Scotland, according to research by the price comparison website MoneySuperMarket.com . Unsurprisingly, the most expensive area was London at an average of £11,536, ahead of the South East at £11,317 and the South West at £10,955. At the other end of the scale was Northern England at £8,521. The figures suggest that while much of the wealth may be based in London and the Home Counties, many ordinary families in the South face real pressure to cover their essential bills. Meanwhile, they show those working in the public sector, such as teachers and nurses – where national pay rates apply – can enjoy a higher quality of life in the North than their counterparts in the South. Chancellor George Osborne has flirted with the idea of introducing regional pay in the public sector to reflect the differences in living costs, but he has faced fierce opposition from the trade unions. The figures were compiled by price comparison website MoneySuperMarket.com. Spokesman Clare Francis said: ‘Mortgage and rent payments are naturally the biggest expenditure for people, and for Londoners this is typically around £7,164 per year. Ideal: The research suggests Newcastle and Gateshead (pictured) are among the cheapest cities in Britain . 'That is a stark contrast to those living in South Wales and the North where it costs people £3,000 less to keep a roof over their heads.’ Council tax is the second biggest bill, with those in the South East, at an average of £2,492, paying the most, while families in the North of Scotland get away with just £1,421. Water bills average £489 across the UK, but households in the South West pay almost double that, with an average of £811 before one-off rebates. Despite being among the cheapest places to live in the UK, the North of Scotland is the most expensive area for energy bills with average gas and electricity costs of £1,383 per year. By comparison, families in the East Midlands pay  an average of £1,297. Only Cheshire in the North has higher essential bills than the average for the region. However, the well-heeled Cheshire set – which includes millionaire footballers – are better able to cope than most. Miss Francis said: ‘With the exception of Cheshire, anyone living or looking to move anywhere south of the Midlands will find they are being hit hardest.’","Cost of living in northern England is £8,521 compared to £11,536 in London .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . It is a new retail giant that promises to fix everything from a  broken mobile phone to a  leaking dishwasher. The merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse has created a £3.8billion technology goliath. Bosses claim it will operate like a household ‘emergency’ service, while continuing to sell electronics. The Carphone Warehouse and Dixons have announced a merger to create a £3.8billion retail giant that will also specialise in fixing every gadget and home appliance . They say the deal is a response to a technical revolution that will allow smartphones to become the remote control for the home, performing a range of tasks such as switching on the central heating and receiving alerts when milk is going off in the fridge. Consequently, they argue it is only sensible to bring these elements together under one roof. The deal has triggered suspicions that the newly merged company will cut costs by closing stores and sacking staff where there are outlets close to each other in town centres. However, the group claims the new business, which will be called Dixons Carphone and employs 43,000 people across Europe, will end up with around 900 more. It is unclear whether the store names will change. Company bosses say merger is in response to technology revolution that will lead to smartphones becoming remote controls for the home . Under one scenario, the firm might charge a monthly fee to ensure all the household devices are working properly. Carphone boss Andrew Harrison, who will be the deputy chief executive of the merged group, said he envisaged a ‘nationwide fleet of people to be able to go and solve things’. He added: ‘It may be that we know before they do. ‘It may be that we have someone turning up at your house to tell you your boiler’s broken or your internet connectivity’s not working as it should be. ‘What seems outlandish today will become absolutely ubiquitous in the next few years.’ Mr Harrison insisted the deal reflected major changes in the way technology is used in the home. ‘This is a merger that is ahead of the curve and is thinking about how the world changes for our customers,’ he said. He added that as people’s homes became ‘smarter’ the business will help to sell heating, lighting, and security and fitness systems, on top of its present lines of electrical products. Some customers, however, may struggle with the new concept, given the reputation of staff at Dixons. In the past, at least, they have been ridiculed for a lack of knowledge and a hard-sell approach. The merger aims to tap into a growing market for household devices connected to the internet via wifi. The number of such gadgets in each home is predicted to rise from a current average of four to 20 in the next few years. The merger will also provide greater muscle to tackle the threat to traditional retailers posed by specialist web firms such as Amazon. But City analyst Louise Cooper said there was ‘likely to be much scepticism’. In a withering put-down, she added: ‘Two past-their-sell-by-date retailers merging does not an Amazon make.’ Sebastian James of Dixons, who will become the chief executive of the merged group, responded by pointing out the contrast with Amazon, which bizarrely claims to make little or no profit in the UK despite generating billions in sales. He said: ‘We do make profits … and pay tax’. The merger is expected to deliver combined yearly savings of £80million, although there will be restructuring costs of £55million to £60million and extra investment of £70million to £80million. The chairman will be Carphone founder Charles Dunstone, who said: ‘We have a deep respect for each other and we see the merger of these two great companies as an opportunity to bring our skills together for the consumer  and create a new retailer for the digital age.'","New company will be called Dixons Carphone and have 43,000 staff .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . V presenter Stephen Fry is among the first to make the shift . Britain is getting a new national web address of ‘.uk’ from today in what is being described as the biggest shake-up in the internet for 30 years. The change means businesses and individuals can choose to drop the familiar ‘.co.uk’ and ‘.com’ suffixes from their web addresses in favour of the short and simple ‘.uk’. Just as Germany has a ‘.de’ domain name and France has its own ‘.fr’, so the British will be able to demonstrate their national affiliation with ‘.uk’. TV presenter Stephen Fry is among the first to make the shift, while both small start-up companies and major household names are set to follow suit. Among the other first adopters are the tech start-up Lowdownapp, which is switching from ‘.co.uk’, and the independent craft lager company Saint Lager, which is changing from a ‘.com’ to ‘enjoysaint.uk’. The change is being overseen by Nominet, which is a private, not-for-profit business that is responsible for the smooth and secure running of the .uk internet infrastructure. The introduction of ‘.uk’ is one of a number of new domain name options that have become available with a major shake-up in the web address system, which include ‘.london’, ‘.bbc’, ‘.cymru’ and ‘.company’. Nominet is rolling out the world’s largest welcome sign – reading ‘welcometothe.uk’ – at Heathrow airport to mark what it claims is the biggest change to the UK internet infrastructure since it began. Visible from as high as 35,000 feet, and measuring nearly 10,000 square feet, the welcome sign is positioned on the approach to the main runway at London Heathrow airport, to greet those arriving. Some 40 per cent larger than the ‘Hollywood’ letters, and hundreds of times the size of the traditional British welcome signs that frequent motorways up and down the country, the welcometothe.uk sign took ten men over eight hours to put in place. Research by Nominet found three quarters of British internet users prefer sites ending in ‘.uk’ when searching or buying online. Some 93 per cent preferred the short and simple ‘.uk’ to other options. Nominet’s chief operating officer, Eleanor Bradley, said: ‘The new ‘.uk’ is for people who want a short, memorable domain with a popular and trusted ending. We know this combination appeals to our tech-savvy, digitally-engaged population. Will amazon be among the major companies that changes its domain name from amazon,co.uk to amazon.uk? ‘When asked if they wanted ‘.uk’ to be an option alongside. co.uk, 72 per cent of businesses questioned said yes. ‘We’re delighted that Stephen Fry has chosen .uk, given that he’s known for being an early digital adopter’ More than ten million existing UK domain holders will be offered first choice on the shorter equivalent of their current address, with five years to decide whether they want to use it in addition to, or instead of, the domain they already have. People can sign up for the new ‘.uk’ domains through one of a number of domain name registrars, alongside existing domains such as .co.uk or .org.uk. The wholesale price is the same as for a ‘.co.uk’ at £5 for two years. Domain names are sold through domain registrars, who set a higher retail price to individuals and businesses.","Germany has a .de and .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Takeaways are selling lamb dishes containing unidentified meats, raising fears that flesh from rats, dogs and cats could be in our curries and kebabs. Investigators have been analysing fast food all over Britain and found that lamb had routinely been replaced with pork, beef, chicken, turkey and what could be vermin or pets, it was revealed today. The studies – one by the Food Standards . Agency and another by consumer group Which? – come more than a year . after the supermarket horsemeat scandal and suggest food fraud is still . rife on the high street. The Which? analysis of 60 lamb dishes found 29 were 'suspect', 17 contained different meats, seven contained no lamb at all and five had meat that could not be identified. Some takeaways are routinely selling 'lamb' curries containing no lamb, according to two major studies . British favourite: The kebab is a takeaway staple in the UK, but analysis has found that some contained unidentified meats . Lamb dishes are particularly vulnerable to fraud because the meat is expensive, meaning takeaways might replace it with poor quality, cheaper cuts of beef, chicken and turkey. The FSA, which is responsible for food hygiene and safety in the UK, looked at council surveys of 145 lamb takeaway meals sold across the country between July and December last year. Of these 43 (30 per cent) contained other types of meat, such as beef and chicken, as well as lamb, or no lamb at all. Almost one in five meals contained only beef. The separate Which? research tested 30 takeaway lamb curries and 30 minced lamb kebabs from restaurants in Birmingham and London. It found 24 dishes (40 per cent) had a mixture of meats or no lamb. Seven, or more than one in ten, contained only beef. In five of the dishes sampled, the meat could not be identified . Most worryingly, the meat in five of the samples could not be identified. One explanation is that it was overcooked or re-cooked, but there is a possibility it was from an animal that is not normally eaten in the UK. The findings will be especially upsetting to many families of Hindu or Sikh faith, who do not eat beef for religious reasons. Professor Chris Elliott, director of the Institute for Global Food Security who was appointed by the Government to come up with a series of recommendations to tackle food fraud in response to the horsemeat scandal, said: ‘The survey results come as no great surprise to me. Whenever issues about food contamination and adulteration are looked for in a serious way they are found. ‘Without rigorous monitoring programmes in place cheats will always try to take advantage of consumers.We need to develop systems in the UK that deter fraud.’ Andrew Rhodes, the FSA’s chief operating officer, insisted the watchdog is taking action to crack down on food fraud. In response to the findings, the FSA has threatened the businesses involved with fines of up to £5,000. It has also asked local councils to launch a major sampling programme of lamb dishes across 300 takeaways to bring about prosecutions of rogue traders. Mr Rhodes said: ‘The recurring nature of the problem shows there needs to be a renewed effort to tackle it. The testing we have announced today will focus the efforts of enforcement officers and raise awareness among food businesses of the action they face for defrauding consumers.’","Studies find some takeaways selling lamb dishes with other types of meat .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Budget supermarket Lidl’s march into Middle England has stalled amid accusations it will lower the tone and complaints of snobbery from ‘toffee-nosed twits’. Residents in the wealthy London commuter belt town of Berkhamsted, which has its own castle ruins, are taking up the cudgels over whether to welcome the discount store. The town already has a Waitrose and Tesco Metro, while Marks & Spencer has won permission to open one of its ‘Simply Food’ convenience stores without any sign of controversy. Scroll down for video . Petitions have been signed both for and against the budget supermarket setting up a store in the town . Yet more than 100 people have signed a petition opposing the Lidl plan for a new 1,200 square metre store incorporating 30 flats above, with some complaining that it will ‘lower the tone’. Ranged against them is Germany’s second biggest supermarket chain, and more than 370 locals who have signed a petition supporting the scheme. The rhetoric in the battle of the online petitions is distinctly earthy with accusations of snobbery and claims opponents are nothing more than ‘stuck up, toffee nosed twits’. Lidl is making a concerted effort to move into Middle England – as is its German rival Aldi – by snapping up sites in locations where homes cost more than £1million. The staunchly Middle England commuter town already has a Waitrose, Tesco and will soon have a M&S . It claims new outlets in Dorking and Sevenoaks have been already been a great success. It also plans to open a new 1,200 square metre store just 100 metres from the banks of the River Thames, close to Richmond Bridge, in south west London. The company has introduced more fresh produce, gourmet food and wine and it also won a number of blind taste test awards, beating the best own label products that the major supermarkets, have to offer. The woman behind the petition opposing Lidl in Berkhamsted, Cathie George, insists the town does not have the roads and services to support a new supermarket and the 30 flats above. She said: ‘Our town is becoming overcrowded with new homes and no extra infrastructure to support them. ‘Berkhamsted does not need another supermarket, budget or otherwise. What it needs is new schools, doctors’ surgeries and other services that a community expects its governing bodies to provide.’ Other supporters of her petitions complained it would lead to overdevelopment of the main high street leading to congestion, while many felt it did not match Berkhamsted’s Middle England brand. One wrote simply: ‘Don’t want to lower the tone of the town.’ Another said: ’ Personally don’t think it fits in Berkhamsted branding.’ A third complained: ‘We are a Historic Market Town keep it that way! And yes Berko is pricey but we have a good looking town!’ Another wrote: ‘I think our traditional high streets should be protected against these poxy low budget corporations that wipe out local trade.’ One contributor joked: ‘One good thing about Lidl coming to Berkhamsted: it’ll keep the riff-raff away from Waitrose.’ Resident, John Waller, 70, who supports the Lidl scheme, which should create 40 jobs, said there was no fuss when it was announced that M&S would be opening a Simply Food store in the town.He described people opposing the Lidl as ‘snobs’ and added: ‘They are a lot of stuck-up, toffee-nosed twits.’ It appears from the online petition supporting the scheme, that a greater number of local residents support this view. One wrote: ‘I bet most or if not all the people that signed the petition are on over £50,000 a year. There are a lot of people that welcome Lidl to the town. We can’t all afford to shop in Waitrose. You are all cnobs if you don’t want to shop there for little Oliver’s , Nathan’s or Cuthbert’s lunch then don’t.’ Another said: ‘Well said John Waller. I am sure they would welcome another Waitrose but don’t want Berko to be known as a Lidl town.’ A third supporter wrote: ‘There may be good reasons to criticise Lidl but let’s face, the only reason these moaners are trying to stop this is because a low-budget shop will lower the tone of the area and bring their precious house prices tumbling down. Bring it on, I say!’ Lidl is enjoying enormous success in the UK with some 600 outlets and sales growing at more than 17per cent a year as it takes customers from the big four – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.Its ‘Deluxe’ range is particularly designed to win middle class shoppers. At Christmas, the range included a £5.99 cooked lobster, fine cooked meats, including a serrano ham for £39.99, and quality continental cheeses. The firm recently held a consultation day where Berkhamsted residents were shown the plan and given a chance to comment. It said 73per cent of some 400 individual comments recorded were in favour of the scheme. A spokesman said: ‘We have seen great success from opening stores in particularly affluent areas such as Dorking and Sevenoaks, which shows that Lidl has developed an increasingly broad appeal to the British people.’","100 residents in Berkhamsted have signed a petition to stop the store .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Barclays has developed a wristband that will allow wearers to pay for a morning coffee as well as their daily commute. Wearers swipe the bands, which can be worn 24 hours a day, over a terminal at a shop or pay point on the bus or station platform to make a purchase. The bPay bands are part of a wider revolution in wearable technology, which will allow people to negotiate daily life without using cash. Wearers swipe the bands, which can be worn 24 hours a day, over a terminal at a shop or pay point on the bus or station platform to make a purchase of they can be used as here to get access to a gig . All the major tech giants, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed or are working on smart watches, which will have a range of functions, from monitoring heart rate to giving directions. Significantly, they are also expected to become virtual wallets that allow people to negotiate their day without the need for money or cards. The bPay bands are effectively loaded with money by users from their bank accounts which can then be spent on small purchases up to a single transaction value of £20 by swiping them over a terminal. They can also replace conventional plastic cards by allowing people to make purchases much more quickly than normal because users do not need to use a four digit PIN. The rubberised and waterproof bands, which contain a computer chip and micro-aerial to communicate with terminals, have the security benefit that they are less likely to be lost or stolen than a wallet or purse. The bPay bands have been trialled to the public at public events such as the British Summer Time Music Festival and London Pride, where they can be used to gain entry and buy food and drink. However, they are now moving into the mainstream so that they can be used at any one of around 300,000 till terminals – many in coffee shops and newsagents - that already work with contactless debit cards. The bPay bands have been trialled to the public at public events such as the British Summer Time Music Festival and London Pride, where they can be used to gain entry and buy food and drink . It will be possible to pay for journeys on all buses, tubes and trains inside London by swiping them across terminals from later this year. Other towns and cities are expected to follow suit. A Barclays . spokesman said: ‘Just imagine a typical day in the near future. You . leave the house, hop on the train and head to the gym. After your . workout, you grab a coffee and go to the office. The . money or information you need for every stage of that journey will be . integrated into a single device like bPay band – from your travel card . to your gym membership to the money for your coffee and lunch. ‘It’s a time that isn’t quite here yet, but it’s not far away. Innovations like bPay band are bringing it closer every day.’ Barclays introduced the first credit . card in the UK, the Barclaycard in 1966, while the company then released . the first contactless debit cards, which allow payments via swiping at . terminals rather than PIN numbers, in 2007. As the country’s biggest credit card provider with more than 10 million accounts it is in a particularly powerful position to change the way people spend their money. Barclaycard chief executive, Valerie Soranno Keating, said it is working with Transport for London, retailers and consumers to win acceptance of the technology. ‘We’re the only financial institution in the UK that has both sides of the equation; we can actually create the tipping point,’ she said. Contactless: Barclaycard chief executive, Valerie Soranno Keating, said that the company is working with Transport for London, retailers and consumers to win acceptance of the technology . The technology that works with contactless cards and wrist bands can also be built into other products such as mobile phones, key fobs and rings. The banking industry is keen for people to switch away from using cash because it is much more expensive for them to handle, transport and count real money than virtual electronic payments. Consequently, the quicker they can convert people to new forms of payment the more money they can save. The net result of these efforts is that cash is expected to account for less than half of transactions for the first time this year, after falling to 53 per cent in 2013. There is an added benefit for the banks because they charge a small fee to retailers every time a transaction is made – a bill that will inevitably end up at the door of consumers.","The bPay bands are loaded .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . House prices in London are rising more than 20 per cent a year, fuelling fears of a dangerous bubble. Some boroughs in the capital have seen prices increase almost £100,000 in just one year, with the surge also pushing up prices across other parts of the South East, according to figures from the Land Registry. The average house in the capital now costs £414,356, an annual rise of 13.8 per cent. Boom: Prices have risen more than 20 per cent in the last year in some areas of London (file photo) The boom is pricing many people out of the housing market altogether and forcing others to take on huge mortgages – which could lead to soaring repayments once interest rates rise. The price of an average home in Hackney, east London, has risen by 21.5 per cent in a year to £528,737 – an increase of £93,500. Elsewhere in the capital, the average house value has risen 20.1 per cent in Waltham Forest and 17.7 per cent in Islington. The highest house prices in the country are in Kensington and Chelsea, where the average home is now worth £1.24million – a rise of 14.8 per cent – fuelled by wealthy foreign buyers. The London boom is having an effect on prices in other parts of the South East, with Hertfordshire, Surrey and Reading all seeing increases of around 6 per cent. Growth: The biggest rises are unsurprisingly in and around London. Rising: Prices for flat and maisonettes rose more than any other house type. However, the picture is very different in parts of the North East and Wales, where prices have fallen in the past year. The huge variations across the country mean the national increase in house prices stands at 5.3 per cent, with the average home in England and Wales costing £170,000. Earlier this week, the Bank of England expressed concerns that growing numbers of people are taking on supersize mortgages to get on to the property ladder. Nationally, around one in ten borrow more than four times their income to buy a home, with the figure in London rising to around one in five. In a speech to the Housing London Symposium on Wednesday, Prince Charles voiced fears that the housing bubble could price young people out of London completely, and destroy their dreams of home-ownership. Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, warned that the Bank of England may not be able to prevent a dangerous boom and bust. ‘Whether they have the appetite or the ability to prevent such a scenario, while keeping interest rates low to support the wider recovery, remains to be seen,’ he said. Martin Stewart, director of independent mortgage broker London Money, said: ‘House prices in London have become detached from reality. ‘Wealthy overseas buyers continue to use prime London properties as a hedge for their capital. This is driving prices up and cutting many aspiring Londoners, or London residents out.’","Prices in one borough, Hackney, rose 21.5% to £528,737 in just a year .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Lives could be put at risk due to cuts in food safety inspections and testing, according to the expert leading the horsemeat scandal inquiry. Hundreds of trading standards are being lost as part of local council cuts, while public analyst laboratories, which conduct food safety tests, are being shut down. The cuts come at a time when food fraud, as demonstrated by the horsemeat scandal, is a rising and posing a threat to the health of consumers. Food hygiene lab tests such as this could be axed as a result of council cuts to trading standards departments, according to food hygiene expert, Professor Chris Elliott (file image) Trading standards officers are involved in policing the cleanliness of food outlets and takeaways as well as ensuring food is what it claims to be on a label or menu. It is claimed that cuts in some London boroughs mean that just one trading standards officer is responsible for monitoring thousands of food businesses. The Government appointed Professor Chris Elliott, who heads the Institute for Global Food Security, in Belfast, to lead the independent review into last year’s scandal where horsemeat was passed off as beef in burgers and ready meals. He is concerned about anticipated cuts of 40per cent to the UK Trading Standards Service, which could mean the number of officers falls from a high of 3,000 in 2009 to around 1,900 by 2015. Prof Elliott said: ‘What we have to be careful of is that the budget cutting gets to a point where the integrity of our supply chains, the safety of the food that people eat, gets compromised to such a point that people start to die. ‘I certainly hope that it doesn’t happen and all the indications are at the minute that the food industry is stepping up to the mark. ‘They’re doing more checking and testing; but the food industry can’t do it on their own.  What we need are strong regulators and well-resourced regulators.’ Prof Elliott says the Food Standards Agency should be given new powers to tackle fraud in the food industry . His concerns echo those of Andy Foster, from the Trading Standards Institute, who said: ‘You take money out of sampling, you take money out of inspection, you take money out of the consumer protection system. 'You will get increased levels of fraudulent activity and you make the consumer protection regime that’s designed to deal with it much more impotent – and that’s a big concern. ‘When you have some authorities – like some in London – operating on one trading standards officer, how on earth can they possibly deal with all their demands, from fraudulent activity?’ Prof Elliott has recommended that the Food Standards Agency be given new powers to tackle fraud through a Food Crime Unit. Speaking on the release of his interim review in December, he said: ‘The UK food industry is currently too vulnerable to criminals wishing to perpetrate fraud. The professor was appointed to lead a review into food safety after the horsemeat scandal (file image) ‘Not enough evidence is collected about food crime and we don’t yet know the extent of how this global problem affects the UK food and drink market, worth £188billion. ‘Estimates of the level of criminality vary, so further investigation needs to be a priority. ‘We need a culture within businesses involved in supplying food that focusses on depriving those who seek to deceive consumers. ‘Government, and in particular a more robust Food Standards Agency has a major role to play partnering these efforts.’ The gaps in consumer protection will be highlighted in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight. 'We have to be careful of budget cutting getting to a point where the safety of the food that people eat gets compromised to a point where people start to die' Professor Chris Elliott, food safety expert . The FSA’s chief operating officer, Andrew Rhodes, tells the programme that Prof Elliott makes a valid point. ‘He is right to be concerned about the level of trading standards officers keeping food safe. There has been a reduction in the number of officers. There has been a reduction in the amount of sampling,’ he said. However, Mr Rhodes said a ‘very strong’ network of food safety checks does still exist. ‘It’s increasingly risk-based, it is being helped by better intelligence and that will be one of the keys to unlocking some of the issues that we face,’ he said. The food and farming department Defra, insisted Britain’s food is safe. A spokesman said: ‘Professor Elliott’s interim review recognises that UK consumers have access to some of the safest food in the world we want to keep it that way. ‘In the last year, we have taken action to prevent food crime, including increasing unannounced inspections of meat cutting plants and boosting funding to £2 million to support local authorities’ food sampling programme.’ * Food: What’s Really in your Trolley?

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . and Lucy Crossley . Britain's biggest supermarket Tesco has sparked a price war over milk, by slashing prices to just £1 for a four pint carton . Britain's biggest supermarket Tesco has sparked a price war over milk, by slashing prices to just £1 for a four pint carton. The new lower price undercuts rivals Sainsbury's and Morrisons by 39p and makes it as cheap as Asda, with the chain using milk as a key weapon to win back customers who have deserted to rivals. Tonight the chain's website was proudly proclaiming its cut-price milk, displaying the new price on its homepage along with the slogan 'Prices down and staying down'. Reducing the price of milk is part of a . wider set of cuts on food essentials by the supermarket, including some to the price of fruit and vegetables, . which form a package claimed to deliver savings of £200million. The . reductions are being financed by a cut in Tesco's profit margin and are . part of a shift from short term promotions to permanently lower prices. Tesco . is taking drastic action to win back shoppers and market share after . many people switched away from the UK’s biggest grocer to budget chains . like Aldi and Lidl. Asda . already sells milk at the low price of £1 for four pints, however the . move by Tesco will put pressure on Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and the Co-op, . to follow suit. Just last week Tesco's chief executive Philip Clarke admitted the chain had failed to help customers during the economic downturn, and announced price cuts on food essentials, as well as a Fuel Save scheme enabling club card holders to save on the price of petrol. He told investors: ‘The least affluent customers and middle income families are being forced to make choices.’ Mr Clarke added: ‘Businesses which don’t change with the times don’t succeed and . we did not change enough, not enough for our customers. But now we have . changed.’ Reducing the price of milk is part of a wider set of cuts on food essentials by the supermarket, including some to the price of fruit and vegetables, which form a package claimed to deliver savings of £200million .

Tesco £1 (minimum 5 per pack) Asda £1 (600g) Waitrose £2 (minimum 6 per pack) Sainsbury's £1.50 (minimum 6 per pack) Morrisons 99p (minimum 5 per pack) Mr Clarke also said that the company will do . away with ‘frivolous’ price promotions to a regime of permanent lower . prices on food essentials bought every week. He . said: ‘Prices must get better and must be more stable. Frivolous . promotions must end and trusted ones should be in place and that will . start now.’ The UK managing director, Chris Bush, . said price cuts on everyday essential foods have been brought forward . specifically to match the low figures at firms like Aldi and Lidl. Addressing the growth of Aldi and Lidl, Mr Clarke told The Telegraph: . 'You can’t ignore them. No retailer can. You have got to have sharper . prices and better quality. But you can’t just be them, because you are . not them.' Tesco claims its . reduction on milk, plus others on carrots, tomatoes, onions, peppers and . cucumbers, will save many customers £100 a year. However, the . National Farmers’ Union (NFU) fears Tesco's aggressive initiative to . slash the price of milk will come at the expense of its struggling . members. Any . resulting dairy price war could drive down the figure that the nation’s . dairy farmers get for their milk, cheese, butter and cream. Farmers fear the . move sends out the wrong signal by portraying milk as a cheap commodity . food, rather than a high quality and important food worthy of a strong . price. The supermarket ran . into a similar furore with farmers in 2008 when it began selling . standard fresh roasting chickens for just £1.99 each – a saving of . £1.31. The chain said the . temporary deal would help shoppers on a budget, however farmers then, as . now, warned it was devaluing an important food produced to high . standards. Tonight the chain's website was proudly proclaiming its cut-price milk, displaying the new price on its homepage along with the slogan 'Prices down and staying down' The store gets its milk from some 700 . farmers who are members of the Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group (TSDG). The . reduction on shelves will not affect them because they price they get . is based on a formula that gives them enough to cover the cost of . production plus a premium. NFU dairy board chairman Mansel Raymond said Tesco was devaluing milk, and called on other retailers to resist a price war on milk and dairy foods . The NFU fears the reduction will fuel a general drive towards price cuts that will affect a wider group of dairy farmers. Its . dairy board chairman, Mansel Raymond, said: ‘What on earth are we doing . devaluing milk? This sends the completely the wrong message. ‘I would have expected more leadership from Tesco.’ Mr Raymond called on other retailers to resist a price war on milk and dairy foods. Dairy . farmers get paid about 17p a pint for milk at the farm gate. For many . this means they are producing milk at a loss, which has forced a number . out of business. Tesco . insisted the milk price cut is both fair to shoppers and farmers. Its . commercial director, John Scouler, said: ‘We care about our milk and . where it comes from, which is why we set up the TSDG. ‘We . promise that our farmers will always be paid a fair and independently . agreed price for their milk, so they can invest in the future of their . farms and provide higher welfare standards for their cows. ‘When our customers buy their milk at Tesco, they can be confident that it’s responsibly sourced and at a fair price for all.'","Price represents a cut of 39p and is part of a plan to win back customers .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Marks & Spencer is to offer a mass market ‘no fees’ current account backed by a £100 gift card sweetener in a move that threatens to break up the big bank monopoly. Independent experts argue the account offers far better value than most of those from the mainstream banks – RBS-Natwest, Lloyds, Barclays and Santander. Benefits include an end to many of the hidden fees which make a nonsense of the claim by the current giants to offer ‘free banking’. The 'no-fee' bank account is just another in the frequent ventures into other sales mediums by the high street chain . The development poses the biggest threat yet to the dominant finance giants which have an appalling record of rip-offs, bad advice and huge bonuses for fat cat executives. At the same time, Tesco and Virgin Money, are also to launch new mass market current accounts in a move which, could, deliver better value and service. All have the necessary financial muscle and customer service expertise to pose a serious challenge to the major banks. They can also take advantage of a new bank switching regime, which came into effect at the end of last year makes it much easier for people to switch their bank in seven working days . Personal finance expert, Andrew Hagger, of Moneycomms.co.uk, said: ‘I think this deal has the potential to drive a lot of new custom from account holders with the big banks who have until now been sitting on the fence, not sure where to switch to for a better deal. ‘This latest account is simple and transparent and has many positive features that should appeal to a wide range of consumers.’ The Marks & Spencer brand has been branching out in recent years, with hits like the 'Your M&S' taking off . The account comes with a £500 overdraft facility of which the first £100 is interest and fee free. This is a very useful safety net to avoid being hit with big charges when an account dips into the red. Currently, most of the major banks have a much smaller overdraft buffer of around £20 before penalty charges and interest fees are triggered. PUGH ON...Marks & Spencer's latest move into the financial sector . The interest rate for overdrafts above the £100 mark is 15.9per cent AER, which may appear high when the Bank of England base rate is 0.5per cent but is actually one of the most competitive in the market. In another key benefit, there are no unauthorised overdraft charges or fees for returning unpaid cheques or standing orders. Historically, people can find a small overdraft and debt can balloon into a huge figure because of the penalty charges for bouncing payments like bills. Most banks impose a charge of 2-3per cent when people use their debit card abroad to make purchases or take money out of a cash machine. There is also an extra transaction fee, which can be £1.50, for making a cash machine withdrawal. The M&S Bank will impose a 2.75per cent fee in these circumstances, but there will be no additional transaction fee for a cash withdrawal overseas. Mr Hagger said: ‘The icing on the cake is that you’ll also receive a £100 M&S gift card if you transfer your bank account using the current account switch service. ‘It looks like a good all round package from a trusted brand with no hidden nasties and is likely to prove popular.’ British high street retailer Marks and Spencer announced on that in 2013 that sales rose in its financial year, despite challenging conditions on the high street . No interest is paid on credit balances sitting in the current account, however people can earn reward points at the rate of one pence in the pound for spending in M&S stores. These are paid quarterly to customers in the form of M&S vouchers. There is no requirement to pay in a minimum sum of money each month, however customers must move direct debits and standing orders to the new account using the M&S switching service and close their existing one. The account will be backed up with seven days a week banking in 29 M&S stores nationwide and a call centre operating around the clock. David Black of Consumer Intelligence, who surveys financial products, said the simplicity of the new account will appeal to many people. ‘At a time when the many different overdraft tariffs and structures in place make overdraft cost comparisons a nightmare for consumers it is a consumer friendly feature to see a competitive and straightforward overdraft rate that doesn’t charge fees,’ he said. Marks & Spencer started as a primarily clothes-based store, but since it began it has been going from change to change, and now more resembles a supermarket-esque store that offers everything . ‘This is a good deal for those who regularly shop at M&S and its competitive overdraft rate coupled with no insistence upon any minimum monthly funding requirement will also broaden its appeal. The M&S Bank already offers two current accounts which carry a monthly fee, however the new one will be its first for the mass market without a charge. Its chief executive, Colin  Kersley, said: ‘We launched M&S Bank in September 2012  on the foundations of M&S Money, which was established 29-years’ ago. ‘Our  Premium  Current Accounts, developed specifically for the regular M&S shopper, have proven popular with this audience and following the launch of the Current Account Switch Service, which has made switching faster and easier, we want to offer the same transparent banking and great service to a broader audience with the launch of the M&S Current Account.’ The new M&S Current Account will be available in the summer, starting with existing customers before rolling-out to others. If you're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching, there are plenty of incentives to move.This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are. Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit. First Direct pays . £100 to new customers who switch to its First Account.

Now, he has delivered his take on the Easter Egg in a limited edition creation that comes with a surprise nest of tiny eggs on edible paper in the middle. Only 8,000 of the £20 hand-crafted eggs have been made for the Heston range sold through Waitrose. Inventive: Heston Blumenthal has delivered his take on the Easter Egg in a limited edition creation that comes with a surprise nest of tiny eggs on edible paper in the middle . Sales of mass market Easter Eggs have been falling in recent years as the number given to children are rationed against concerns about obesity and the price. However, Waitrose insists there is a market for premium creations with good ingredients, rather than the cheaper options with are heavy on vegetable fat and sugar. Heston said: ‘Shoppers will open the packaging to find a dark chocolate velveteen egg, which has been hand sprayed with chocolate to give an unusual velvet effect, lightly coating the 65per cent dark chocolate shell beneath. ‘When you crack it open you discover six mandarin ganache chocolate filled speckled hen eggs on a nest of vanilla flavour edible shredded paper. ‘The citrusy notes of the chocolate eggs against a light backdrop of vanilla in the shredded paper combine in perfect harmony.’ Festive treat: The Heston from Waitrose range was launched in 2010 and his Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding has been a sell-out success for the last four years . Chris Moore, Buyer at Waitrose said: ‘Premium Easter Eggs are rising in popularity, so it was definitely the time to introduce a Heston from Waitrose egg. ‘We've been working with Heston for over a year to create an egg that will really stand out from the crowd. There's nothing else quite like it.’ The Heston from Waitrose range was launched in 2010 and his Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding has been a sell-out success for the last four years.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . An ultrafast internet service able to download an entire music album in just four seconds is launched today as a new front is opened in Britain’s pay TV and broadband war. The 152Mb service from Virgin Media, who use sprint star Usain Bolt as brand ambassador, is some 23 times faster than the service available over the old copper telephone wires. As a result it can download a high definition movie in four minutes, rather than up to 90 minutes, which it can take some households. Slow internet speeds can slash the value of a home as broadband becomes more of a necessity . Welcoming: The arrival of ultrafast broadband was welcomed by Culture Secretary, Maria Miller . The arrival of ultrafast broadband was welcomed by Culture Secretary, Maria Miller, who said: ‘Families are now downloading films, streaming music and playing games through phones, laptops, tablets and consoles. ‘Higher speeds will enable the whole family to use the internet at the same time.’ Virgin is using free speed upgrades as its key weapon in a fierce battle for customers with BT, Sky, TalkTalk and others. The high speeds are made possible because Virgin has its own growing spiders web of fibre optic cables that crisscross the country. BT, which is rolling out its own fibre cables, is focussing on building its reputation as a pay TV broadcaster, mainly through buying up high profile sport, including Premier League Football, the Champions League and rugby. It is using the appeal of these channels, plus new HD offerings from Discovery, TLC, Animal Planet, and Eurosport, as a lever to get people to sign up for its premium broadband services. Speed: The 152Mb service from Virgin Media, who use sprint star Usain Bolt as brand ambassador, is 23 times faster than the service available over the old copper telephone wires . While Sky already holds a vast roster of high profile sports and film channels which are used to tempt customers to buy its broadband services. Virgin claims to have the fastest broadband network, however the huge popularity of these services means it still slows down at peak evening times. Peak internet use by its customers has grown 55 per cent in the past year and by almost 1,000per cent  since the company’s launch in 2007. Customers who currently pay £15.50 a month for its 30Mb service will get a free upgrade to 50Mb. Line rental takes the cost up by another £15.99 a month. Those who pay £20.50 a month for 60Mb will be moved up to 100MB, and those who pay £28 for 100 or 120Mb will be moved up to 152Mb. Sporting: BT, which is rolling out its own fibre cables, is focussing on building its reputation as a pay TV broadcaster, mainly through buying up high profile sport, including Premier League Football . While the speed upgrades are free, Virgin customers who want the fastest service will still be paying a substantial £527.88 a year including line rental. The upgrades will begin this month in areas such as Aldershot, Maidstone, Colchester, Leicester, and Glenrothes, Scotland, before being rolled out to other customers over the next 12 months. Chief executive Tom Mockridge said: ‘We’re supercharging our incredible network to ensure customers can make the most of the online world. Overwhelmingly people tell us the internet is a force for good. From daily life to the bigger aspects of society, culture and economic growth, digital is making a significant, positive difference to people’s lives.’ The launch of the high speed services comes at the same time as the company is revealing a new system of parental controls – Web Safe - to block pornography and other adult material. The free service allows the account holder to restrict access to types of potentially age-inappropriate websites. It works across all devices connected to the family’s home internet service. All new customers will be asked if they want Web Safe turned on when the service is activated. Existing customers will get pop-up messages when they log on asking if want to install the safeguards.","New service is 23 times faster than that available on old telephone wires .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Removed: Harrods has been caught by the Italians selling 'fake' Tuscan extra virgin olive oil, and has had to remove the bottles from its shelves . Harrods has been caught by the Italians selling 'fake' Tuscan extra virgin olive oil. The Knightsbridge store has had to remove bottles from shelves in response to an effort by the Italian food industry to protect the name and heritage of its famous brands. The move is part of a wider crackdown in Britain and across Europe targeting retailers and manufacturers selling food which is not what it claims to be on the label. The issue of fake and counterfeit food has leapt to the top of the political agenda following the horsemeat scandal of a year ago where horse was passed off as beef. Olive oil is among a number of premium food products which has been particularly susceptible to fakery, however it is unusual for a store like Harrods to be caught out. Previously, there have been problems with fake Basmati rice, ordinary meat and produce described as organic, fish being mis-labelled and counterfeit big brand drinks, such as vodka. The problem with the Harrods brand 'Tuscan Extra Virgin Olive Oil', which sells for £12.95 for a 500ml bottle, first came to light during a search of the store's website. Italian government officials then visited London, bought a bottle and submitted a report to the officials at the food and farming department DEFRA, which is responsible for policing food authenticity. It appears that the olive oil may well have originated in Tuscany, however it is not allowed to be labelled as Tuscan olive oil unless the whole manufacturing process, including growing, pressing and bottling, happens in the region. Stefano Vaccari, the inspector who uncovered the false Tuscan olive oil, said: 'Labels like that suggest the product's Tuscanness but it was bottled in the UK, as in fact it said on the label, and this contravenes the product protocol laid down by the European Community'. Several months ago, Mr Vaccari discovered fake San Daniele ham in the UK and had it removed from the shelves. Italy's newly appointed agriculture minister, Maurizio Martina, said: 'Protecting and promoting genuine Italian products around the world is an absolute priority for this government, and a strategic mission for the Italian economy. 'Defending designations of origin and Italy's heritage of food excellence is the battlefield where, on a daily basis, we deploy the finest supervisory forces available to the ministry. This result is further confirmation of the importance of European laws in this area, and of our ability to demand their proper implementation on EC territory.' Harrods insisted the oil used was 100per cent from Tuscan olives, but said it had fallen foul of EU labelling rules because it was  bottled in the UK. It said: ‘Harrods Extra Virgin Olive oil is made using only the finest olives from the Maremma region in Tuscany. This product was bottled in the UK, which was displayed on the label, however it was brought to our attention that in order for the product to be labelled ‘Tuscan’ the bottling process must also take place in Tuscany. We are investigating this oversight with our supplier. ‘The product was immediately removed from our shelves once the issue came to our attention last week. We are now looking to have the bottling process done in Tuscany, and will ensure all the relevant certification is receipted prior to the product going back on sale.’ Issues: Previously, there have been problems with fake Basmati rice, ordinary meat and produce described as organic, fish being mis-labelled and counterfeit big brand drinks .","Olive oil is among a number of products susceptible to fakery .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Amazon is set to take on the likes of Sky, BT and Netflix with the launch of a new paid-for TV package. Technically, the service isn't brand new - instead Amazon is rebranding its LoveFilm Instant streaming service as Prime Instant Video. This service will be combined with the retailer's current Prime delivery service, as well as access to Amazon's Kindle library, for £79 a year. From Wednesday, viewers in the UK will be able to subscribe to Prime Instant Video, pictured. The service combines LoveFilm TV streaming, Prime delivery service and access to the Kindle library - for £79 a year. The price is 35 per cent cheaper than if LoveFilm and the next-day delivery service were bought separately . LoveFilm Instant currently costs £5.99 a month - or £71.88 a year - and offers online streaming of thousands of titles across games consoles, mobile devices and computers. To add DVD rentals to this package increases the subscription price to £7.99 a month. Amazon Prime costs £49 a year for unlimited one-day delivery on millions of items as well as thousands of free Kindle downloads.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Confession: Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke has admitted the firm  failed to change fast enough to help customers during the economic downturn . Tesco has admitted it failed to help customers during the economic downturn as it announced it will cut prices on everyday food essentials by some £200million. It is also introducing a ‘Fuel Save’ scheme to cut living costs where holders of its Clubcard will be able to earn savings of 2p-20p a litre on petrol based on spending. Britain’s biggest supermarket has also pledged to improve quality and bring forward a refurbishment of hundreds of its ‘big box’ stores. It will spend millions developing its website which is now generating food sales of £2.5billion a year and a trading profit of £127million. This will involve opening hundreds of new ‘click and collect’ points for food and other web purchases in stations and other locations. The moves come as the company tries to turn around a slump in sales and market share with shoppers deserting to cheaper budget rivals – Aldi and Lidl – as well as Waitrose. Chief executive Philip Clarke told investors that the company had failed to change fast enough to help the ‘squeezed middle’ and low income households during the financial crisis. ‘It has been tough for consumers and it’s been tough for the company. Our headline results are not where we want them to be,’ he said. ‘I have not seen such a level and sustained pressure on consumers in my 40 years. The squeeze continues. There are signs of confidence in the UK economy but consumers are not yet seeing that being translated into spending power. ‘The least affluent customers and middle income families are being forced to make choices.’ He added: ‘Businesses which don’t change with the times don’t succeed and we did not change enough, not enough for our customers. But now we have changed.’ Cuts: It comes as Tesco has announced it will cut prices on everyday food essentials by some £200million . Mr Clarke said the giant, which takes around 30p in the £1 of all spending on groceries, had wrongly become locked into a mindset that ‘big is best’. He said the firm’s bosses now accept this is not automatically the case. In fact, sales through its big stores were down by 3.1per cent in the crucial Christmas period. As a result, it has decided to dramatically cut back on building new stores and will, instead, divert cash into major refurbishments. The success of the price cuts initiative will depend on whether customers trust the store to deliver . This will include installing coffee shops, family restaurants and bakery shops into many of its biggest large stores, using the brands, Harris & Hoole, Giraffe and Euphorium. Prototype stores in Watford, Purley and Coventry, which also have Tesco F+F fashion boutiques, pharmacies and opticians, will be used as the templates for the new look interiors. The company opened some 2.5million square feet of new floor space in this country in 2012-13, however that will come down to just 700,000 in 2014/15. Most of this new space will be in convenience stores as people switch away from one big weekly shop to making several trips. Mr Clarke said the company will do away with ‘frivolous’ price promotions to a regime of permanent lower prices on food essentials bought every week. He said: ‘Prices must get better and must be more stable. Frivolous promotions must end and trusted ones should be in place and that will start now.’ The success of the price cut initiative will depend on whether customers trust the store to deliver. The firm promised reductions of £500m in the ‘Big Price Drop’ in 2011, however subsequent surveys found many of the reductions were not what they seemed. Mr Clarke said he had he regretted the way that promotion was implemented, saying: ‘It was not executed well.’ He insisted the company has now undergone a fundamental change in philosophy, adding: ‘People will not be fooled and we are going to deliver what we have said.’ Competition: Shoppers are increasingly deserting Tesco in favour of budget rivals Aldi (pictured) and Lidl . The UK managing director, Chris Bush, said price cuts on everyday essential foods have been brought forward specifically to match the low figures at firms like Aldi and Lidl. The national Fuel Save scheme, which will be a permanent money-saving measure, has proved popular during trials in Wales and Norwich. Customers who spend £20 earn a discount of 1p a litre on fuel at Tesco petrol stations. Drivers can choose to save up their discount over several shops to the point that they might earn a saving of as much as 20p a litre.","Philip Clarke admits Tesco failed to help customers during financial crisis .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Apple has slumped from second to 14th in a list of Britain’s favourite brands, while Facebook has dropped out of the top 20 completely. A new measure of the nation’s favourites has seen people turn away from the American tech brands, while British Airways has made it to the top spot for the first time. BA dropped its famous slogan ‘The World’s Favourite Airline’ in 2011, however it can now be labelled the UK’s favourite based on the evidence of a study published today. Struggle: Apple's slump from second to 14th in a list of Britain's favourite brands suggests the company has struggled to maintain its momentum since the death of co-founder and chief executive Steve Jobs in 2011 . The 2014 Superbrands league table is produced from a combination of nominations from a panel of independent experts and the votes of some 2,900 consumers. The latest results confirm that Apple has struggled to maintain its momentum since the death of co-founder and chief executive Steve Jobs in 2011. Recent new products have tended to be incremental improvements on previous designs, such as the thinner and lighter iPad Air, rather than revolutionary. That could change this year with the company and its British design chief, Sir Jonathan Ive, thought to be about to unveil the Apple iWatch and an Apple brand TV. Facebook has suffered because of concerns that it has moved from a simple social network to a corporate machine, where people’s likes and online exchanges are mined to allow them to be targeted with advertising. Its growth rates and have stalled and its future appears to be tied to an ability to use its vast wealth to hoover up any smaller companies that might pose a threat. Flying high: A new measure of the nation's favourites has seen people turn away from the American tech brands, while British Airways has made it to the top spot for the first time . Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook has suffered because of concerns that it has moved from a simple social network to a corporate machine, where people¿s likes and online exchanges are mined to allow them to be targeted with advertising .

The trend seems to have affected Microsoft, which has also slipped down the league from third to sixth place, while Google dropped one position to seventh. Also dropping out of the top 20 this year are Disney, Hilton, BP and Dulux. Surprisingly, Lego, which is the world’s most popular toy and now at the centre of a hugely successful film, is omitted from the top 20, after making 15th place a year ago. However, there is good news for Gillette, Cadbury, Andrex, Nike and Shell, which find themselves among the elite brands in a survey that has been running since 1995. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of The Centre for Brands Analysis and Chairman of the Superbrands Council said: ‘Apple and the other tech giants have suffered, with Apple particularly struggling to meet arguably unrealistic high expectations. ‘It is increasingly clear that in the . short-term at least Apple is struggling to maintain its enviable . innovation record in the eyes of consumers, while failing to inspire . individuals without its hugely influential leader, the late Steve Jobs. ‘Apple’s reputation is taking a hit while, the fall of its US peers suggests a growing lethargy among consumers towards the . American tech giants in general.’ Surprising: Lego, which is the world¿s most popular toy and now at the centre of a hugely successful film, is omitted from the top 20, after making 15th place a year ago . He said BA, which moved from fourth to first, had won people over with its new slogan, ‘To Fly, To Serve’, which was adopted in 2011 and a deliberate policy of highlighting its ‘Britishness’ and history. Mr Cheliotis said: ‘British Airways has always performed well in the survey but over the last two years its reputation has climbed to new heights, partly through the cementing of its successful ‘To Fly. To Serve ’ positioning and the residual goodwill from its effective 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games association.’ The success of the airline came at the expense of Rolex, which moved down to second after several years in the top spot.","'World's Favourite Airline' tops the 2014 Superbrands league table .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Burberry is to stop using toxic chemicals in the manufacture of its clothing after residues were found in some children’s products. The British designer label took the decision following tests by Greenpeace which found suspect chemicals in a shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham. Tests commissioned by the campaigning group revealed the presence of hazardous chemicals, including hormone disrupting substances, in children’s clothes made by 12 brands such as Disney, Adidas and Primark. Decision: Burberry is to stop using toxic chemicals in the manufacture of its clothing after suspect chemicals were found in a shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham . Many of these chemicals are now widespread in the environment, following years of discharges into global waterways from clothing factories. Ilze Smit, Detox campaigner at Greenpeace International said: ‘Burberry’s Detox commitment to rid us of these hazardous little monsters represents a new chapter in the story of toxic-free fashion. ‘In taking this landmark step, Burberry has listened to their customers’ demands and joins the ranks of brands acting on behalf of parents everywhere to give this toxic nightmare the happy ending it deserves.’ She added: ‘Burberry’s move raises the bar for the luxury sector. With the Fashion Weeks coming up, brands like Gucci, Versace and Louis Vuitton risk getting left behind. ‘From budget to luxury, we have a right to demand our clothes are free from hazardous chemicals and big brands have a responsibility to do something about it.’ The Daily Mail revealed last week how a £175 Burberry shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham in a fashion shoot for Vogue magazine has been found to be contaminated with toxic chemicals. Contaminated: The Daily Mail revealed last week how a £175 Burberry shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham in a fashion shoot for Vogue magazine has been found to be contaminated with toxic chemicals . tests: The shirt was tested as part of the Greenpeace Detox campaign investigation and was found to contain a relatively high level - 780 mg/kg ¿ of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) Eleven-year-old Romeo, who is the second of David and Victoria Beckham’s four children, was hired by Burberry last year to front a high profile marketing campaign. Following his designer mother into the fashion world, he was hand-picked by Burberry’s chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey. The campaign saw him wearing a purple metallic shirt alongside models Edie Campbell and Cara Delavingne as part of the Spring/Summer 2013 collection in a photo-shoot by the renowned Mario Testino. The shirt was tested as part of the Greenpeace Detox campaign investigation and was found to contain a relatively high level - 780 mg/kg – of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs). NPEs are man-made chemicals that are widely used as surfactants or detergents by textiles manufacturers during the manufacture of the cloth. Usage: NPEs are man-made chemicals that are widely used as surfactants or detergents by textiles manufacturers during the manufacture of the cloth . Once released to the environment, NPEs degrade to nonylphenols (NP), which are known to be toxic and act as hormone disrupters. They will accumulate in the body over time. There is no evidence that the levels of chemicals found would cause immediate harm to children wearing them, however Greenpeace argues they should be removed on a precautionary basis . The £175 shirt was made in Tunisia and purchased in the UK from the firm’s online store. Graham Thompson, of Greenpeace, said: ‘The Mail’s reporting on this issue showed that even the super-rich can’t avoid exposure to hazardous chemicals without industry-wide action. ‘The industry know this, and everybody wants to do the right thing, but nobody wants to lead. Burberry have broken through that corporate inertia, they have a plan, it’s a plan which meets Greenpeace’s hopes, and it’s a plan which makes them industry leaders.’ Burberry has announced an action plan to begin removing suspect chemicals with immediate effect in a process that will take place between now and 2020. It said: ‘Burberry’s long-term sustainability programme recognises the urgent need for eliminating industrial releases of all hazardous chemicals. ‘Burberry Group will work with other companies in the apparel sector and other brands we sell, as well as material suppliers, the broader chemical industry, NGOs and other stakeholders to achieve this goal.’","Label took the decision after tests by Greenpeace found suspect chemicals in a £175 shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham in a Vogue magazine shoot .

New material released by the Marks & Spencer Archive gives a fascinating insight into how lingerie has moved from being functional, through comfortable, to the sort of skimpy patches of cloth that might make a pole dancer blush. Racy: Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley is the face and body of M&S' current glamorous lingerie campaign . Demure: M&S's first attempt at bra design was white and functional . A lingerie collection by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is one of the few success stories for the M&S clothing range of recent years – and she certainly wears it well. However, generations of women of all shapes and sizes, not least Margaret Thatcher, have come to rely on M&S bras and knickers. M&S first began selling bras in 1926 with a simple, unstructured, white bra with delicate ribbon straps, while the only adornment was a tiny pink rose at the V of the cleavage. It was designed to suit the drop-waisted flapper style fashions that were the rage in the 1920s, as seen recently in The Great Gatsby and the latest series of Downton Abbey. The demure creation marked the start of a new chapter in M&S’ history, which subsequently became famed for the quality and technology packed in to its lingerie. The first uplift bras were introduced in 1932 under the slogan ‘A perfect figure guaranteed’, while the resourceful store made use of parachute silk in the 1940s to ensure no sagging in the morale of the nation’s women. Bizarrely, until the 1950s most bra retailers failed to recognise that women came in different shapes and sizes and produced bras in just one cup size. In 1951, M&S took the bold stance of introducing three - small, medium, large – and by 1953 the chain was selling some 125,000 a week. Glamorous: Different sizes first arrived in the 1950s and bras could be bought in small, medium and large . Advanced: The first nylon smalls arrived in the 1960s, as did the first wash-and-wear styles . 1970s style:  Cup sizes were introduced at the beginning of the decade as was the bikini knicker . The idea of the bra as a fashion statement emerged in the 1950s and M&S began offering a range with embroidered shoulder straps, which might be occasionally peak out from beneath a dress, in 1955. Further innovation brought the first front-fastening bras in 1958. Advances in technology and the arrival of man-made fibres like nylon in the swinging 1960s allowed new innovations. In 1960, a lightweight range of easy to wash and dry bras, suspender belts and panty girdles became available. And in 1965, the first sheer nylon bra was introduced. As England were winning the World Cup in 1966 M&S was winning its own high street battle with luxury bras including lace option in white, pink and blue. The range outsold all others. While 1969 brought relief to women struggling with ill-fitting bras with the introduction of cup sizes A,B,C,D & DD. Daring: Knitted nylon and fine knitted cotton meant that more delicate, racier styles could be introduced . Cheap chic: The first ever 99p bra was launched at M&S in 1978 . The 1970s may not be renowned for its trend-setting fashions and style, however there was a revolution going on in stores and underwear drawers. The hot summer of 1976 coincided with the launch of matching tiny bra and bikini brief sets in knitted nylon or fine knitted cotton, while 1978 brought the 99p bra, a front fastening plunge option made from nylon. The idea of putting lingerie on display was something most retailers shied away from for decades, fearing embarrassment among customers, particularly men who were wandering through. In took until 1984 for M&S to start displaying its ‘Feathers’ range on hangers rather than the traditional boxed packs on shelves. The 1990s was dominated by the launch of practical designs. There was the first ‘mum to be’ collection, washable underwired bras and the first silk options which could be put in a washing machine. Practical: While the 1970s saw glamour increase, M&S always kept a more practical selection in stock . Inspiration: Modern smalls such as those by Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley take inspiration from the '20s . The first T-shirt bra arrived in 1997, a time when fitness work-outs and jogging became part of the daily routine for millions of women. In 2000, the M&S Secret Support range was introduced and went on to win the Queens Award for Innovation. The technology was fitted to T-shirts, tops and swimwear and allowed women to go without a bra at all. Today, the new collection by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley consists of luxury lingerie sets and takes just a little inspiration from the time when M&S sold its first bras with 1920s inspired rose prints. The 26-year-old British model and actress has proved to have something of a Midas touch with any products she is associated with, whether it is M&S or Burberry. At the same time, any prudishness that restricted the promotion, advertising and display of lingerie in the past has gone for good. The chain now promotes its ranges with video posters, moving billboards, that show the young actress turning and posing in front of a mirror wearing very little but a pout. The lingerie sold by the chain through the years is being displayed at the store’s Marks in Time exhibition in Leeds ahead of Valentine’s Day.","M&S sold its first bra, a white and functional affair, in 1926 .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Legal action against three men who took tomatoes, mushrooms, cakes and cheese from a supermarket’s dustbins has been dropped by prosecutors. The men were arrested in October after climbing over a wall at an Iceland store in London’s Kentish Town to look for waste food. They are among a growing group of ‘skippers’ or ‘freegans’ who patrol the bins behind stores and cafes looking for thrown-away food that is good enough to eat. Arrested: But Paul May (pictured) and his friends Jason Chan and William James will not be prosecuted after taking £33 worth of tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese and Mr Kipling cakes from a bin outside an Iceland store . Police caught them as they left the area . with a holdall and trolley containing about £33 worth of tomatoes, . mushrooms, cheese and Mr Kipling cakes. Officers returned the items to the Iceland store. The men claim they were held in a police cell for 19 hours before being released. After being arrested for burglary, the three men were charged under the 1824 Vagrancy Act, which was introduced to deal with beggars, including penniless soldiers discharged following the Napoleonic wars. Initially, the Metropolitan Police and CPS decided to pursue the prosecution of the three men, Paul May, aged 35, Jason Chan and William James, who live in a squat in north London. The CPS told the men’s solicitors: ‘We feel there is significant public interest in prosecuting these three individuals.’ However, last night the decision was over-ruled by a senior CPS lawyer following a review of the case and the intervention of Iceland’s boss, Malcolm Walker. Mr Walker used Twitter to say he knew nothing about the arrests or prosecution, which involved a store next to a police station. Intervention: The decision to prosecute was over-ruled by a senior CPS lawyer following a review of the case and the intervention of Iceland's boss, Malcolm Walker (pictured) He asked executives to challenge the CPS over why it was necessary to take the three men to court. The CPS’s decision came on the same day the British Retail Consortium was hosting an event at the Houses of Parliament to announce a new initiative by supermarkets to cut food waste. Freeganism is the practice of reclaiming food that has been thrown out by supermarkets, coffee shops and restaurants. The act of getting the food is known as ‘skipping’ or ‘bin diving’ in the UK and ‘dumpster diving’ in the USA. Speaking before the U-turn by the CPS, BRC’s director general, Helen Dickinson, said people taking food in these circumstances should be prosecuted. ‘I think there are laws and regulations out there and it is important that everyone in the country is aware of what they are and complies with them,’ she said. Wasted: Tesco revealed it generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste at its stores and distribution centres in the first six months of last year alone . But yesterday the chief crown prosecutor for London, Baljit Ubhey, said: ‘In reconsidering this case, we have had particular regard to the seriousness of the alleged offence and the level of harm done. 'Both of these factors weigh against a prosecution. Additionally, further representations received today from Iceland Foods have affected our assessment of the public interest in prosecuting.’ An Iceland spokesman said: ‘We sympathise with those who are struggling to meet their food bills and do our utmost to help.’ Figures from the Government’s waste reduction advisory body, Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), show that 15million tonnes of food are discarded every year in the UK. Tesco revealed it generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste at its stores and distribution centres in the first six months of last year alone. Now other leading retailers, including Asda, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, have announced they will also publish regular updates on the amount of food they throw out.","Men arrested after climbing over a wall at an Iceland to look for waste food .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Centrica chairman Rick Haythornthwaite said criticism of prices and profits is stopping firms commissioning the power stations the country needs . British Gas bosses triggered anger yesterday after warning that the lights will go out if politicians and families continue to attack energy price rises and profits. Parent company Centrica’s chairman raised the prospect of blackouts within two years unless there is an end to ‘hostilities’. Consumer groups and MPs insisted the public would not be threatened into falling silent as they struggle to cover the cost of heat and light. The row came as Centrica revealed profits of £2.7billion for 2013, down 2 per cent on the year before. British Gas, the nation’s biggest energy supplier with some 15.2million accounts, made a £571million profit, a fall of 6 per cent. It came against an exodus of 460,000 customers after the company put up prices by an average of 9.2 per cent in November, taking the annual average bill close to £1,500. Executives are furious that both David Cameron and Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey actively encouraged families to switch to cheaper rivals. Mr Davey has also suggested that some British Gas profit margins are too high and the company may have to be broken up. Labour is threatening a 20 month price freeze if it wins the 2015 General Election, which would be a hammer blow to income and profits. British Gas and the other ‘big six’ suppliers came under fire for putting up prices ahead of the winter, turning the screw on customers suffering a five-year cost of living squeeze. But Centrica chairman Rick Haythornthwaite said criticism of prices and profits is stopping firms commissioning the power stations the country needs. ‘I think it is immensely damaging, not just for Centrica, but for the nation,’ Mr Haythornthwaite said. British Gas, the nation¿s biggest energy supplier with some 15.2million accounts . British Gas and the other ¿big six¿ suppliers came under fire for putting up prices ahead of the winter, turning the screw on customers suffering a five-year cost of living squeeze . ‘I think the reputation of Britain as a place in which to invest is under threat and the time to correct that is now, not after the 2015 election, by which time the possibility of the lights going out in Britain will be looming much larger. ‘And I don’t see this as the figment of a scaremonger’s imagination. I think right now we’ve got to restart collaborative, constructive dialogue around these key issues. We cannot afford to wait. Hostilities have got to cease.’ Oxford-educated Mr Haythornthwaite, 56, has earned the name ‘Slick Rick’ in City circles from his time in senior roles at businesses including BP and Mastercard. At Network Rail, where he was chairman, he was criticised for allegedly presiding over a ‘gravy train’ of executive pay excess. The National Pensioners Convention said energy consumers would not be threatened or pressured into keeping quiet about profits and prices. Spokesman Neil Duncan-Jordan said: ‘Consumers will only stop criticising and complaining about the big six energy companies when they start to treat customers fairly, rather than seeing us as a cash cow.’ Labour MP John Robertson, a member of the Commons Energy Select Committee, described Mr Haythornthwaite’s comments as ‘ridiculous’. He said: ‘We need to keep shining the spotlight on well-above inflation price rises and the raking in of millions in profits.’ Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said the fact that British Gas was still making healthy profits despite customers leaving was further evidence the energy market is broken.Centrica bosses argue that the decision by politicians from all parties to target British Gas is unfair. The firm’s shares have plunged by more than a fifth since Labour’s price freeze pledge in the autumn, with the stock driven down further by suggestions the business could be broken up. Wholesale gas prices have fallen in recent months, but Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw said it was too early to say what will happen to bills. He even suggested the criticism from politicians means energy firms have to pay more to attract the best executives.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Almost £400million was wiped off the value of Sainsbury’s shares at one . point yesterday after chief executive Justin King announced he is . stepping down. Mr King, who has spent a decade at the supermarket’s . helm, is credited with taking Sainsbury’s from strength to strength, . despite the cost of living crisis that has hurt customers. He is . considered a retail success story and is now much sought-after, with . speculation linking him with top jobs ranging from M&S to Formula 1. Supermarket sweep: Justin King is to step down as Sainsbury's chief executive in July after 10 years in the job . During . his tenure, the store’s profits have almost trebled to £756million, . while sales have increased by 59 per cent. At the same time the number . of customers visiting stores has risen by around ten million a week. Recent . success has been built around an expansion of the ‘Local’ convenience . stores and promotions such as ‘Feed Your Family for a Fiver’. Mr . King, who was raised in Solihull, West Midlands, joined Sainsbury’s in . March 2004 from Marks & Spencer, where he was head of the retail . group’s food department. The 52-year-old father of two enjoys the . limelight and a flamboyant approach to public relations, which means . always being ready to fight Sainsbury’s corner in TV and radio . interviews. During his tenure, he has masterminded a successful . commercial partnership with Jamie Oliver and, more recently, David . Beckham. He also made great play of a decision to ditch his Maserati . Quattroporte, an £80,000 sports car, in favour of a ‘green’ Lexus . limousine, at £88,000, for his commute to London. The Manchester . United fan, who lives near Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has listed his . recreations as coaching a village football team and sailing. News of . the departure of Mr King, who will step down in July, saw the firm’s . share price drop by 5.8 per cent at one stage, taking the firm’s market . value down by some £395million to £6.38billion. At the end of the . day’s trading shares were down by 2.3 per cent, equating to a fall in . value of £156million. This drop signalled some concerns about the . future  of the UK’s joint second-largest supermarket. Sainsbury’s grew sales by 3.1 per cent in . the 12 weeks to January 5, Kantar said, ahead of the 2.9 per cent . market growth maintaining its market share of 17.1 per cent. Coupe de Ville: Incoming Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe will be paid a salary of £900,000 . Its market . share is under threat from the budget chains Aldi and Lidl on one side . and supermarket rivals Waitrose and Marks & Spencer on the other. At . the same time, there is pressure from the likes of Tesco and Asda – and . now Morrisons. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: . ‘Supermarket retailing is getting a bit tougher and it’s understandable . [King] wants to go out on a high note.’ Mr King has not lined up another . job but said he felt young enough to take another ‘big one’, although a . non-compete deal rules him out of taking a role with a rival grocery . chain for 12 months. He said: ‘There’s plenty of energy left in the old . dog yet. I’m sure the right opportunity will come along and I’ll know . what it is when I see it.’ Mr King is being replaced by the firm’s . commercial director, Mike Coupe, 53, a former director of Big Food Group . and Iceland, who has been at Sainsbury’s for ten years. Analyst Clive . Black said: . ‘Coupe represents continuity for Sainsbury’s, something that . may reassure investors who will naturally be a little disconcerted by . change.’ By alex brummer city editor . Charismatic: Justin King and Fireman Sam at a promotional event in 2012 . In the grey world of Britain’s corporate elite, Justin King stands apart from the crowd. He is the supermarket boss with the market stall-holder’s gift of the gab, and an orange perma-tan and head of lustrous chestnut locks that look more suited to a daytime television presenter. Gregarious and with tremendous self-confidence, he is the opposite of his former great rival, the taciturn and now retired Tesco chief, Sir Terry Leahy. Behind King’s love of showmanship and the limelight is an extremely sharp brain that is able to respond to any question about his business with rapid-fire facts and figures. Over his ten years at the helm, he has turned around a failing family-controlled enterprise. His great achievement was to reposition Sainsbury’s as a favourite place to shop for aspirational families who might otherwise be seduced by rival Waitrose, with its more upmarket image. The value placed on King was reflected in the sharp fall yesterday in the Sainsbury’s share price following news of his departure. In 2004 he took over a dispirited company that had been pummelled by falling market share under the stewardship of David Sainsbury (the last family member at the helm) and wasteful investment decisions taken by Sainsbury’s successor Sir Peter Davis, who was ignominiously ejected from his job. King moved rapidly to turn the business around. Part of his whirlwind approach involved cleverly anticipating people’s preference for smaller convenience stores that were within walking distance of their homes and widening choice to include clothing. The result was spectacular, with profits tripling during his decade in charge – from £254million to £756million in the last full financial year – comfortably outdistancing King’s former employers, M&S. The group moved from a standing start to become the seventh-largest clothing retailer in the UK and launched its own fashion brand ‘Tu’. King has an instinctive nose for the . nation’s food habits. Apart from emphasising the supermarket’s ‘quality’ image through its Taste the Difference range, he hired the nation’s . favourite television chef Jamie Oliver to promote its image and . products. Justin King with chef Jamie Oliver who he hired to promote Sainsbury's image and products . But perhaps his greatest achievement was to exploit technology in harness with attractive promotions in a way that entrenched customer loyalty. For example, check-out tills were designed to automatically ‘price-match’ items with those of rival supermarket so that shoppers could see that the prices they were paying at Sainsbury’s were cheaper (or if not, they got a voucher to use the next time they shopped at the store). This was a revolutionary piece of marketing. Ahead of his rivals, King seized the possibilities of online shopping and Sainsbury’s now does £1billion of its annual sales of £25.6billion on the net. Politically, he is not shy of expressing his forthright views: putting up a good case for lower taxes during an appearance on BBC1’s Question Time. However, he was also tackled by the audience over high levels of boardroom pay. King notoriously claimed that his own £900,000 salary (40 times the average Sainsbury’s employee) was modest. Lord of the isles: Under King's tenure, check-out tills were designed to automatically 'price-match' items with those of rival supermarket so that shoppers could see that the prices they were paying . In fact, his total annual remuneration (including pension contributions, share options and benefits) was £2.6million. He also became embroiled in the horse meat scandal. At first, King claimed Sainsbury’s had not mislabelled any meat but then had to remove meat burgers from shelves after concern that they might have become contaminated. Whoever takes over from grammar school-educated King will have a tough task. Sainsbury’s Christmas sales figures showed some of the momentum he had built up – to gain a 17 per cent share of the market – was fading. The invasion of German-owned Aldi and Lidl will be a formidable challenge for those now charge if they are to replicate the savvy, showmanship and success of King Justin.","Justin King to depart after the supermarket group's AGM on July 9 .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . The German-owned energy giant Npower received the highest number of customer complaints . Customer complaints against German-owned energy giant Npower have soared by 25per cent, confirming it as Britain’s worst supplier. The company, which imposed the highest price rise this winter, is generating 253.1 complaints per 100,000 customers. That is around eight times more than the best-performing energy company SSE, where the complaints ratio is just 38.3. The figures suggest that the company is not only causing real hardship with it high prices, but adding to the woe by failing customers on service. The company had a particular problem with providing accurate bills on time to customers following the installation of a new computer system. Npower has been at the centre of a series of controversies in recent months, not least over a decision to raise prices by 10.4per cent before the winter. It has also announced that hundreds of jobs will be exported to India and thousands of call centre workers are to be transferred to outside third party companies. The 25per cent rise in complaints was seen during the July to September 2013 period compared to the previous three months. The figures are compiled by the official customer body, Consumer Focus. Its director of energy services, Audrey Gallacher, described Npower’s performance as ‘very disappointing’. She said: ‘While Npower has acknowledged and apologised for its poor billing systems and agreed to pay vulnerable customers who have been disadvantaged, its deterioration in performance is still wholly unacceptable and the company must address the failure of its systems, processes and customer service to put things right. ‘Energy companies have repeatedly said they want to rebuild consumer trust. 'Good customer service and complaints handling are key ingredients to achieving this and suppliers still have a long way to go. 'Along with price, good service is important to customers.’ The company apologised for customers' inconveniences and promised 'none' would lose out financially as a result of customer service problems . Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: ‘Rising energy bills are eating into people’s already stretched budgets, often consuming money that could have been spent on other daily essentials like food. ‘With people paying such a high price to have a warm home or keep the lights on the service provided by energy companies should be exemplary, but all too often we’re finding that’s not the case. ‘The findings from Consumer Futures should serve as a stark reminder to energy firms that there is much more for them to do in order to improve service and increase consumer trust.’ Npower’s Roger Hattam said many of the problems surrounded the installation of a new billing system. He said: ‘I know that we’ve let many of our domestic customers down and I want to apologise personally for this and promise that they will not lose out financially as a direct result of these issues. ‘We’re working on these issues as top priority and, while we still have a long way to go, we’re making good progress. 'Our customers deserve to get the best service possible and this is my commitment to them. ‘As part of our commitment to be open and honest with our customers, we have added web pages on npower.com so customers can find out more about our system issues.’ If you are not happy with your energy provider, it is worth thinking about switching to another company.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . A supermarket price war is inevitable if the ‘big four’ supermarkets are to take on the threat posed by budget rivals, according to a leading City expert. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have been losing market share to the fast growing discount chains, Aldi and Lidl. David Cumming, who is responsible for investing billions of pounds of pension funds cash, says they will have to slash prices if they are to stop the loss of customers becoming a stampede. The more established UK supermarket chains might be losing out to the super-cheap German mega-stores, who can offer interesting brands at much lower prices, and have an emphasis on bulk goods . ‘Investors know a price war is coming,’ said Mr Cumming, who is the head of global equities at Standard Life. Christmas was a difficult period, particularly for Tesco and Morrisons, where sales were down on a year ago, which will hit profits. By contrast, sales at Aldi are growing at more than 30per cent a year, while the figure at Lidl is up by more than 15per cent on the back of a concerted attempt to attract squeezed middle income families. Both are part of extremely wealthy German-owned multi-national chains, which have ambitious plans to open hundreds of new stores over the next five years. Mr Cumming said the mainstream supermarkets have, to date, ducked the challenge presented by Aldi and Lidl, but this will have to change. ‘Morrisons, Tesco, Asda and, to some extent, Sainsbury’s are all losing customers at an increasingly rapid pace to the discounters, mainly Aldi and Lidl,’ he said. ‘That is simply because of the perception that a shopping at Lidl and Aldi is about 20 per cent cheaper for a similar quality. They have got to do something about it. The perception is that the more established brands are more expensive when it comes to name brands, and don't offer enough obscure brands . ‘The problem is that Morrisons and Tesco have not yet had the courage to stand up and fight against the discounters. They are ducking the challenge.’ Morrisons is understood to be planning to sell the freehold to a number of stores in order to raise money that can be invested in more convenience stores and pushing ahead with the roll-out of its online grocery business. Asda has recently announced a series of price cuts, with some products reduced to 50p, in a rather tentative effort to respond to the challenge of the budget chains. Tesco has promised to match the reductions of its rivals under its ‘Price Promise’ regime, while it has also offered customers savings on petrol. But, Mr Cumming suggested a much more radical approach is needed with genuine and deep price cuts that will, initially at least, hit profit margins. He said: ‘If they are relatively expensive – and the customers know it – they need a price reset, or price war, whatever you want to call it, before they can move forward in terms of sales. ‘Investors know a price war is coming, hence the low rating placed on Tesco and Morrisons’ shares. ‘It is the pricing that is the problem. They have got to reset pricing…to deal with the discounters. ‘Aldi and Lidl are growing shares at double digit while the majors are losing market share and they have to do something about it.’ (Left) Asda has always touted itself as a cheaper supermarket chain when compared with shops like Sainsbury's (right) and Tesco . The cost of living squeeze of the past five years, where prices have risen faster than incomes, has led to a permanent change in shopping habits. People are buying less food from the mid-range supermarkets. Many are going to discounters for most items and then buying treats from the likes of Waitrose and Marks & Spencer. Mr Cumming said: ‘They (Aldi and Lidl) are only around 10per cent of the total market, but they are growing at around 20per cent. They are significantly cheaper than the competition and they are putting more space down. ‘Unless, Tesco and Morrisons deal with Aldi and Lidl they will become an increasing threat. They are taking market share and they are stopping those companies growing. ‘Price is going to be an issue for all the food retailers.’ Research by retail analysts Kantar found that over half the population shopped for something in Aldi or Lidl ahead of Christmas, which was a first. Edward Garner, of Kantar, told the BBC’s Today programme: ‘The threat of the discounters is very real for the middle ground of the market.’ Aldi has used its success in a series of awards and blind taste testing competitions to promote the theme it is selling high quality food at budget prices. It has been able to beat own-label foods from the major supermarkets and even defeat much more expensive luxury products. Tesco (left) run the risk of losing business if they can't match up to the trends that the German mega-stores are presenting and even Morrisons (right) which was set up as a cheap alternative to the more 'high-market' branded stores like Sainsbury's faces losses . For example,  its ‘Specially Selected Luxury Mince Pies’ at £1.69 for six – 28p each – were chosen as the best by consumer group Which?. A Lidl product came second. Both were better than pies sold by Harrods and Fortnum & Mason, which cost eight times more. Its £3.89 Connoisseur Christmas Pudding came top in a blind taste test by the Good Housekeeping Institute, while its Specially Selected Luxury Champagne Christmas Pudding was runner up. Both beat the best that Harrods, Heston Blumenthal and the major supermarkets had to offer. The ranges at the budget chains have been extended to include dry aged fillet steaks at £5 each, together with frozen lobster and caviar. Both have a very strong reputation for selling high quality wine and spirits. The mainstream supermarkets have recently made a stab at undermining the success of Aldi and Lidl. Asda’s chief merchandising officer for food, Barry Williams, recently said: ‘With hundreds of products at 50p, we’re even making the pound shop and Aldi look expensive.’ The Sainsbury’s chief, Justin King, suggested the budget rivals may be misleading shoppers by highlighting a few premium products and claiming these represent the quality of the whole range.","A price war is coming, according to experts in supermarket economics .

Savings: For the first time, more than half the country is now shopping at a discount retailer such as  Aldi or Lidl as the nation economises ahead of Christmas . If you have been searching for ways to save cash on your supermarket shopping, it seems you’re not alone. For the first time, more than half the country is now shopping at a discount retailer such as Aldi or Lidl as the nation economises ahead of Christmas. Some 50.1 per cent of us have bought groceries from one or both of the stores on at least one occasion in the past 12 weeks. And the market share of these budget retailers is rising at the same time as the big four – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – are losing customers. Aldi and Lidl’s success comes on the back of their concerted effort to target middle Britain with high-quality food, wine and spirits at discount prices. Their efforts have been boosted by a clutch of awards in blind taste tests, which have seen budget options outdo products from high-end retailers such as Fortnum & Mason and Harrods. The latest figures were compiled by analysts Kantar Worldpanel and cover the 12 weeks up to December 8. Their report said: ‘Some 50.1 per cent of all British households stepped into a discount retailer compared with 46.1 per cent a year ago.’ Their analysis also revealed that Aldi’s sales are up by 30.6 per cent in a year, taking its national market share up . from 3.2per cent to 4per cent. Sales at Lidl are up 15.5per cent, so . increasing its market share from 2.8per cent to 3.1per cent. By . contrast, Tesco’s share of grocery sales is down from 30.6per cent to . 29.9per cent; Asda from 17.3per cent to 16.9per cent; Sainsbury’s from . 17per cent to 16.8per cent; and Morrisons from 11.9per cent to 11.6per . cent. Bargains: Aldi and Lidl¿s success comes on the back of their concerted effort to target middle Britain with high-quality food, wine and spirits at discount prices . Kantar’s Chris . Longbottom said: ‘Both Aldi and Lidl have continued to record . double-digit growth and are successfully broadening their shopper base . with half of all British households visiting one of them during the . latest period.’ At the . other end of the market, Waitrose posted an annual sales growth of . 6.7per cent. Mr Longbottom said: ‘Based on past patterns, it is likely to . further boost its market share over the busy Christmas period, as is . Iceland which traditionally performs well with its party food offering.'","More than half the country is shopping at discount retailer for the first time .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Rip-off penalty charges imposed by payday loan giants on borrowers who miss a repayment may be illegal, it has emerged. Under the law, any charges imposed in these circumstances should reflect the actual administration cost of pursuing the payment. A maximum figure of £12 is used by some payday loan companies and most credit card firms. 'Illegal' charges: Rip-off penalty charges imposed by payday loan giants on borrowers who miss a repayment may be illegal, it has emerged. Leading payday lender Wonga (above) has the highest default fees at £30 . However, ten of 17 leading payday lenders have default fees of £20 or more, and four charged £25 and above, with Wonga topping the table at £30. Legal experts at the consumer group Which? claim the penalty charges imposed by many of the firms are excessive and therefore illegal. It has written to the highest charging firms warning them that its legal advice is that the fees are unlawful under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UTCCRs). High charges are one of the biggest factors that tip borrowers into a spiral of debt with small loans suddenly ballooning in size. Concern: High charges are one of the biggest factors that tip borrowers into a spiral of debt (file picture) Previous Which? research has found that more than half of payday loan users – 56per cent - had incurred charges for missed or bounced credit repayments over 12 months. One in five said they had been hit with ‘unexpected charges’. In 2006, the Office of Fair Trading found that penalty charges for credit cards should be no more than £12, unless there are exceptional factors. Which? has been calling for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to introduce a cap on the level that firms can charge in default fees, as part of plan to put a cap on the total cost of credit from January 2015. Accusation: Which? Executive director Richard Lloyd, said: 'We believe payday lenders are exploiting borrowers with excessive fees' Research by the organisation found that half – 48per cent - of payday loan users took out credit it turned out they could not  afford to repay. Executive director at the group, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘We believe payday lenders are exploiting borrowers with excessive fees which can push them even further into debt. ‘If they cannot justify why these charges are so high and refuse to cut them, we would look to take further steps to protect vulnerable consumers. The regulator must also take action to ensure all fees are fair, proportionate and only reflect lenders’ costs.’ Which? recently launched its ‘Clean up Credit’ campaign which calls for the FCA to clamp down on excessive charges and irresponsible lending, and to make sure borrowers are being treated fairly whatever form of credit they’re using. Wonga said its £30 penalty fee has been independently assessed by outside business consultants as a fair reflection of its admin costs. A spokesman said: ‘We charge a one-off default fee of £30 on late repayments that reflects the additional costs we incur in collecting these loans. This charge has been independently assessed as reflecting these expenses. ‘As with all our costs, we are completely transparent about our default fee and it’s clear to customers when they apply for a loan, and at least three further times before their repayment date. ‘On the rare occasions where customers can’t repay, we always encourage them to get in touch with us so we can do everything we can to agree an affordable repayment plan, including freezing interest and charges.’","Rip-off penalty charges on payday loans are 'illegal', it has been revealed .

"Figures . By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Figures such as Mary Seacole will have a greater chance of being chosen to appear on bank notes under a new selection regime unveiled by the Bank of England . More women and significant black figures will appear on bank notes under a new selection regime unveiled by the Bank of England. Figures such as Mary Seacole, the suffragettes, National Trust founder Octavia Hill or biophysicist Rosalind Franklin will have a greater chance of being chosen. The decision is a victory for campaigners, including Labour MP, Stella Creasy, who were subjected to threats and a vile hate campaign via Twitter after arguing for a greater place for women on the notes. In another change, the Bank has decided that it may be possible for a small group of people to feature on the notes under a decision to open up the selection process to public nominations. Details emerged as the Bank of England confirmed a switch to longer lasting plastic bank notes from 2016 onwards with the introduction of a new £5 featuring the image of Sir Winston Churchill. A new £10 note will arrive in 2017 using a controversial portrayal of Jane Austen. The decision to draw up new rules follows pressure on the new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, to include more women. A group called the The Women’s Room, had launched a campaign to change the selection process, which they said was secretive, prejudiced, sexist and potentially illegal. They were particularly critical of the decision to select Churchill to replace social reformer Elizabeth Fry on the new £5 notes. The bank said the new selection procedure will be based on principles ‘which are inclusive and positively state what the Bank intends to achieve through the depiction of characters on banknotes’. It said the process would ‘draw more . heavily on input from the public and on independent experts, and ensure . that decision-makers consider the equality implications of choices’. The . Bank added there would be an effort to make sure that future choices . ‘cumulatively reflect the diverse nature of British society’. Details emerged as the Bank of England confirmed a switch to longer lasting plastic bank notes from 2016 onwards with the introduction of a new £5 featuring the image of Sir Winston Churchill . In simple terms this means that the process is more likely to push for the selection of women and people from the ethnic minorities. Caroline Criado-Perez, co-founder of The Women’s Room, was subjected to astonishing abuse for simply advocating a greater place for women on banknotes. The abusive tweets began the day it was announced that author Jane Austen would appear on the newly designed £10 note. She reported them to the police after receiving ‘about 50 abusive tweets an hour for about 12 hours’ and said she had ‘stumbled into a nest of men who co-ordinate attacks on women’.","Figures such as Mary Seacole will have a greater chance of being chosen .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Must-have gadgets that filled British homes in the Sixties and Seventies are making a comeback. Retailers say a combination of a fondness for retro-chic and the effects of austerity have seen a boom in sales of the Teasmade and the Hostess trolley. SodaStream fizzy drink makers are also enjoying a revival, joining electric heated rollers, electric carving knifes and electric blankets on Christmas lists. Then: The idea of the Teasmade was something of a hi-tech marvel when it hit popular culture in the late 1960s and through in to the 1970s . Now: Sales of quieter, modern versions of the Teasmade, such as this £54.95 Swan STM100 are booming . Popular: Sales of heated rollers are on the rise . Sales of heated trolleys, designed to . keep food warm at dinner parties, are rising as more people eat at home . rather than busting the family budget on dining out. Increased . thriftiness is also behind the renewed popularity of SodaStreams, which . save families money by letting them make fizzy drinks at a fraction of . the supermarket price. Tea-makers . that combine an alarm clock, kettle and teapot to deliver a freshly . brewed cuppa appeal to workers too busy to fit a sit-down breakfast into . their morning routine. The . original idea for an automated tea-maker dates back to 1891 but . Teasmades did not become a fixture on wedding lists and in many bedrooms . until the 1960s. Although . sales declined in the 1980s, one found its way into Downing Street when . John Major was Prime Minister in the 1990s. The design has undergone a . makeover since the 1970s, when 300,000 a year were sold. The most famous brand, Goblin, has been taken over by Swan. John . Lewis says sales of the £54.95 Swan STM100, said to be quieter than the . old-fashioned Teasmade, are up by around 20 per cent on this time last . year. Will Jones, . electricals buyer at John Lewis, said: ‘The classic Teasmade has done . well because it is quite a quaint, almost comical, product. ‘The resurgence in popularity is a combination of the appreciation of the invention but also building a nostalgic concept.’ Retro: Sodastreams, which allow families to make their own fizzy water and drinks as a cheaper alternative to the real thing, are doing well . Suzanne . Hothersall, commercial director of Crosslee, which manufactures Hostess . trolleys, said sales are up between 30 and 40 per cent this Christmas. ‘Television . programmes like Come Dine With Me mean that people are noticing how . important the way they serve food is,’ she said. ‘In the last few years . we have seen more of a focus on entertaining at home.’ Fiona . Hope, managing director at SodaStream UK, said: ‘People tend to look to . brands which remind them of happy childhood experiences, but that also . meet the demands of modern-day living practically and efficiently. ‘Many . may have had a SodaStream in the family when they were a child and are . looking to replicate the experience with their own children.’ Popular: Television programmes such as Come Down With Me, which featured Robert Englund, Sally Morgan, Nicola McLean and Alex Reid in one episode, are thought to be behind the rise in gadgets geared towards entertaining at home . By CLAIRE GODWIN . Today my day began, as it does every morning, at precisely 7am when my husband handed me a mug of scalding-hot tea. No, I’m not lucky enough to have a spouse so devoted he’ll go downstairs in the cold and dark to put on the kettle. I have a Teasmade. Until recently, this was my embarrassing little secret. Tea-makers were old-fashioned, owned by pensioners, not young(ish) professionals. But now it appears that I am at the vanguard of a new trend. Still working: A typical 1950'S bedside Teasmade and alarm . I wasn’t always such a convert, even though my grandparents had a Goblin Teasmade, with its characteristic art deco-style square kettle and pot. I have vivid memories of it sitting on a chair next to their bed, alongside the floral china cups and saucers – never mugs – they drank from. As a small child it was considered a treat to turn it on. Still, when my husband, Sam, announced he wanted one for his birthday six years ago – while we were still in our early 30s – I teased him mercilessly and refused to get him anything so fuddy-duddy. His parents had to buy it for him. But I soon got used to waking to the sound of a click followed by gentle bubbling as the water started to heat. The process would end about a minute later in a loud ‘whoosh’ as boiling water, pressurised by its own steam, shot from a kettle compartment into a teapot via a metal spout. Mugs had been primed with milk the evening before (it rarely goes off overnight) and, within seconds, tea was made. I started to take it for granted so when, about a year ago, our £50 Swan Teasmade stopped heating water properly I encouraged Sam to buy a replacement. Unable then to find another Teasmade, we’ve since been using a Breville hot drinks maker, priced around £60. There’s no teapot, and boiling water shoots straight into two cups, now ready with milk and a tea bag. While it produced a slightly ‘plasticky’ brew at the start, the tea now tastes fine, though Sam complains it produces far more steam. Still, there’s no chance of us returning to the bad old days of trudging downstairs and I wonder if we’ll end up with grandchildren who will be, as I was all those years ago, transfixed by the magic of a Teasmade.","John Lewis say sales of modern Teasmades up 20per cent on last year .

A judge has granted Casey Kasem's daughter a temporary restraining order preventing the famous radio host's wife from cremating his remains, but it's unclear where those remains are or whether they've already been disposed of. A lawyer for Kasem's daughter Kerri Kasem said on Friday that when he went to give a Tacoma funeral home a copy of the restraining order, he was informed it no longer had the remains. ‘They said they could not disclose where he had gone or where he would end up,’ said the lawyer, Scott Winship. Scroll down for video . Where is Casey? A lawyer for the DJ's daughter Kerri Kasem said on Friday that when he went to give a Tacoma funeral home a copy of the restraining order, he was informed it no longer had her father's remains . Tim Grant, funeral director at Gaffney Funeral Home & Cremation Services, confirmed on Friday that Kasem's body was no longer there. ‘I cannot discuss the actual arrangements themselves, but he's no longer in our care,’ he said. Kasem's wife of the past 34 years, Jean Kasem, filled out a death certificate dated July 15 listing an address in Jerusalem, Israel, according to a copy filed in Pierce County Superior Court. The document listed ‘removal from state’ as the intended means of disposing the remains, the Urgel Bourgie funeral home in Montreal as the place of disposition, and July 14 as the date of disposition. Mystery: According to Casey's death certificate, the radio icon's body was sent from the Gaffney Funeral home in Tacoma to a funeral home in Montreal, Canada on July 14. It also lists the cause of death as pending and an address for Jean Kasem in Jerusalem, Israel . Kerri Kasem, the daughter of radio personality Casey Kasem who died last month, has been granted a temporary restraining order preventing her step mom from cremating his remains . A man who answered the phone at Urgel Bourgie on Friday evening said it had disposed of no such remains and had no one by the name of Casey Kasem in its computer system. Teruyuki Olsen, a lawyer for Kasem's wife, refused to comment Friday or provide any information about what happened to Kasem's body. Kasem, the radio host of American Top 40 and voice of animated television characters like Scooby-Doo's sidekick Shaggy, died June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor. He was 82 and suffering from dementia, and his death followed a lengthy battle over his care between Jean Kasem and his three adult children from his first marriage. Kerri Kasem asked a Pierce County . Superior Court judge on Wednesday for authorization to seek an autopsy . on her father as well as a temporary restraining order to ensure his . body was held in cold storage and not cremated until that autopsy is . completed. Kasem's wife of the past 34 years, Jean Kasem, filled out a death certificate dated July 15 listing an address in Jerusalem, Israel . Judge Ronald Culpepper ordered Jean Kasem to ensure that the radio host's remains were preserved and that his body stayed at the Tacoma funeral home until the court decided on the autopsy petition following a July 25 hearing. Casey Kasem had suffered from a form of dementia, and his three adult children had fought a bitter legal battle with Jean, Kasem's second wife of 34 years, over control of his health care in his final months. His widow has accused the DJ's children of making a desperate grab for his life insurance following his death. Mrs Kasem accused Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could be cashed in. But Kerri hit back, saying that Jean hadn't had Casey's body flown out to L.A. for burial because she was trying to deflect attention from the imminent investigation into elderly abuse.","Kerry Kasem has been granted a temporary restraining order preventing the famous DJ's wife from cremating his remains .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Police receive 250 crime and fraud allegations a week connected to the online ‘small ads’ service Gumtree. After a young mother tried to sell her four-month-old baby on the website, it has now emerged that criminals are using Gumtree to target consumers. Many people turned to the site to find bargain Christmas presents and January is expected to see a surge in people using it to sell unwanted gifts. Criminal activity: Police receive 250 calls a week about scams on Gumtree, it has been revealed (file picture) But there are concerns that eBay-owned Gumtree does not require users to register or provide their name and address, allowing fraudsters to remain anonymous while preying on innocent victims. It was revealed in Saturday’s Daily Mail that a 20-year-old woman had tried to sell her son on Gumtree for £150,000. But growing evidence from court cases and police reports shows criminals use the site to: . How the fraudsters target victims . The company reports such crimes to the National Fraud Authority, which generates a crime reference number. But Gumtree then uses the Data Protection Act to refuse to provide the victim with any details. In theory, the National Fraud Authority vets the reports and passes details to police for investigation. But three in four victims never hear from the police. Shocking: Saturday's Daily Mail revealed a woman had tried to sell her son on Gumtree for £150,000 . The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau said there were 19,530 reports of fraud and cyber-crime in October alone. More than one in 20, 997, had a link to Gumtree – 249 a week or 32 a day. The more widely used eBay had a connection to 1,483 cases – almost 50 a day. But eBay guarantees customers will get their goods or money back when there is a fraud. There is no such protection for Gumtree users. Citizens Advice called for Gumtree to require all users to set up accounts with verifiable names and addresses to combat the crimewave. Gillian Guy, of the charity, said: ‘It’s not enough for these websites to say “it wasn’t me” when things go wrong. Online marketplaces need to take more responsibility for what goes on in their name, by being more transparent and strengthening protections for consumers.’ Gumtree said the safety of its users is a ‘top priority’, but a spokesman added: ‘As with any form of classifieds listing... it is impossible to prevent crime completely.’ The firm claimed the number of fraud cases is less than half the 249 a week suggested by police figures.","Criminals are using Gumtree to target consumers, it has been revealed .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Regardless of how slowly some weeks crawl by, and irrespective of how others whizz past, 4069 of them is all you have - if you make it to the average life expectancy of 78 that is. Lifestyle blog WaitButWhy has plotted the life of an average American week-by-week, using data from the latest US census, and confronts us with the salient truth that the vast majority of our lives will be spent on one focus: work. From the day we step into Elementary school as a fresh-faced five-year-old, to our retirement at the national average age of 62, we will spend almost 3,000 weeks - 73per cent of our lives - learning or working; and only 1,095 weeks being an infant or retired. Drowning: Americans will spend almost 3,000 weeks - 73per cent of our lives - learning or working, and only 1,095 weeks being an infant or retired . Our learning and working lives are of course, punctuated by a series of major milestones as we stagger towards a jungle of inevitable responsibilities. First up, driving; which becomes legal when you are 15 - or under certain circumstances in South Dakota, as young as 13 - followed a few years later by a bevy of new perks. By the time you are 18 - 939 weeks into your life - the government believes you have learned enough along your way to enable you to smoke cigarettes, fight in a war, vote, and be legally tried as an adult. You can also purchase a shotgun or rifle. A whole 156 weeks later, you can finally drink legally. Make the most of it: The majority of our lives are spent at school or at work, punctuated with key milestones such as learning to drive, graduating, having children, and getting divorced . When a woman reaches the age of 25 - 1,304 weeks into her life – she’s ready to birth a new one. Men wait a little longer, until they are 28, before becoming fathers. Couples are also getting married around the same age as they’re having babies - women at 26 and men at 28 - but a large number aren’t tying the knot until later, if at all. According to Pew research, just 20per cent of adults ages 18 to 29 are married today, compared with almost 60per cent in 1960. Half of those who do wed will end up getting divorced, and the average length they will stick it out before doing so is 417 weeks, or eight years. If we have made it all the way through college, we spent 17 years, or 887 weeks, being educated, to propel us into a 40-year-long career. And during the course of this career, most Americans will switch jobs every four and a half years. For Millennials - born between 1977 and 1997 - it's even less.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . GAP has triggered a furious backlash after it tweeted a promotional image of an extremely slender model sporting a shirt dress to its 431,000 followers. 'Dress up your days in pastel plaid. #since1969' the retailer captioned the image on Monday - linking to the $59.95 dress on its website, where it appears on a different and notably less thin model. 'Look at the size of her head in proportion to her cadaver like body. Shame on you!' tweeted one user in response to the image GAP tweeted. 'Seriously, @Gap? In what world do people look like this? Perhaps you could select models who represent regular gals & not a skeletor ghost,' tweeted another. Too thin? All-American retailer GAP has sparked a storm of criticism after it tweeted this image of a very slender model wearing a pastel plaid shirt dress (pictured) to its 431,000 followers on Monday . Different model: On GAP's website, the same . dress it tweeted (left) is worn by a slender but noticeably healthier . looking model (right) who is described by the retailer as wearing 'a . regular U.S. size S' Many users were quick to vent their disapproval, not only regarding the model's tiny frame, but the perceived state of her health. 'This picture is terrifying, looks like she needs a hamburger and some sunlight,' tweeted one. Other adjectives used to describe the notably pale model included 'clammy Amish morlock,' 'zombie,' and 'concentration camp inhabitant.' A few jumped to the model's defense, with one tweeting: 'Why is everyone so quick to call a skinny woman anorexic?' and another noting: 'It’s just as hurtful as telling a fat person to diet.' The single only non-heated response to the photo was from one user, who tweeted: 'Just so dreamy!' Disgust: Twitter users were quick to slam GAP's choice of model, labeling the image 'terrifying' and demanding the retailer use 'real women' in their ads . It is unclear why GAP opted to promote the dress on Twitter using a different model to the one used on their website; a redhead who is described as '5'10""/178 cm, waist 25""/64 cm, hips 35""/89 cm, wearing a regular U.S. size S.' 'Why is everyone so quick to call a skinny woman anorexic?'

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Sports Illustrated starlet Gigi Hadid has opened up about her on-again-off-again beau, Australian singer Cody Simpson, in a bid to set the record straight following months of speculation over their split. 'I love Cody to death and he loves me,' the blonde model told WWD. 'He needed his time to focus on his music and he’s the one who broke up with me. We’re still best friends and I’ll always respect him and support his career.' Since that interview, the couple briefly reignited their romance when Gigi, 19, joined Cody, 17, on his European tour this month. Only today, however, Cody told Australia's The Morning Show: 'It's complicated. I guess I'm on the market again.' Scroll down for video . On-off: Model Gigi Hadid, 19, said of her ex-boyfriend, singer Cody Simpson, 17, (pictured together in March), 'He needed his time to focus on his music and he's the one who broke up with me' Single girl: Despite a brief romantic reunion since that interview, Cody re-confirmed the split today, claiming 'I guess I'm on the market again,' which leaves Gigi (pictured on a shoot today) officially a free agent again . In the candid interview, the buxom model - whose mother is Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster - also dropped mentions of a few of her other A-list buddies. Gigi refers to bisexual model Ireland Baldwin as 'genuinely one of my best friends,' chiefly because Ireland understands both Gigi's Los Angeles and New York 'sides.' Kendall and Kylie Jenner are other close - albeit newer- friends, having met them the week before the May 5 Met Gala in New York, where she says they partied the night away at Rihanna's post-bash. And there are evidently no hard feelings between Gigi and new pal Kylie, despite the fact that Kylie has also previously dated Cody. 'It's funny,' she says of the cross-over. Small world: Gigi and Cody (pictured on tour two weeks ago during their latest liaison) have been in the throes of passion for a year, and Gigi happens to have found a new friend in Kylie Kardashian, a former ex of Cody's . Buddies: Gigi (second from right) is also close with her ex-boyfriend's singer pal Justin Bieber (center) and recently joined him on tour as one of the only girls on the tour bus, which she describes as 'gross' Then there is pop sensation Justin Bieber, 20; a close friend and tour-buddy of Cody's, who Gigi describes as 'a good friend.' 'I was on . the Bieber tour for two weeks. It’s gross. You have to get used to not showering' 'I was on the Bieber tour for two weeks,' she reveals. 'It was crazy but so fun. I’m like one of the guys on tour, on a bus with ten dudes. 'It’s gross. You have to get used to not showering. They’re like, “How do you look so glam?” I’m like, “Dry shampoo.”' Gigi strenuously denies recent rumors that she and Justin 'flirted' on his boat in Cannes, France, earlier this year but added: 'I think you have to pick your battles.'

As for her blossoming modeling career, Gigi is clearly at the top of her game; and she's been honing her skills for quite some time. The well-connected teen scored campaigns with Guess when she was a baby and then again as a child; claiming that the label's co-founder Paul Marciano decided she was going to be his 'next whatever' before she was even out of diapers. Her mother Yolanda yanked her out of the spotlight for the rest of her childhood and well into her teens, banning her from signing with her agency IMG until she was 17. 'She knew the industry was going to judge me,' Gigi says. BFF's: Gigi (left) describes fellow model Ireland Baldwin (right) as her 'best friend,' claiming she understands both Gigi's New York and Los Angeles 'sides' Friends in high places: Gigi is a firm favorite of industry heavyweight Carine Roitfeld (center right), who cast her on the cover of her magazine CR Fashion Book (left) In two short years, she has become a favorite face of former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld, who now heads up CR Fashion Book. 'I feel like I meet with Carine every week' 'I feel like I meet with Carine every week because I feel like I have a shoot with her all the time,' Gigi reveals. 'She really pushes me, she believes in me and we connect really well. 'Hopefully, my work ethic and stuff keeps me around her. I’m so grateful to have her.'

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Blake Lively has appeared in a quick-fire video interview with Vogue; in which viewers are treated to a five-minute rundown on seemingly everything there is to know about the blonde star. The refreshingly down-to-earth - albeit impeccably styled – 26-year-old actress answers a total of 73 questions, from which viewers discover that she loves to eat dessert, especially chocolate soufflé; identifies more as a man; and has herself an enviably adoring husband in actor Ryan Reynolds, 37. When asked to reveal one of the best things that had ever happened to her, the 26-year-old star replied: 'A video of all the people that have made an impact on my life, from my husband.' Scroll down for video . Lucky girl: Blake Lively has appeared in a Vogue video interview, in which she reveals that her adoring husband, Ryan Reynolds, once made her a video compilation of people who have had an impact on her life . In turn, the Gossip Girl star mentioned that she had planned a similar stunt, which involved an assortment of short stories from loved ones, as a surprise for Mr Reynolds, who she married in 2012. As part of the interview, an exceptionally lively Ms Lively was handed a tray of freshly baked cupcakes to decorate; a task she was clearly delighted to get into. Speaking of her tendency to spend 'too much' time in the kitchen of the Westchester, New York, home she shares with Mr Reynolds, she said, 'My husband has coined it ""The Blakery,""' adding that at times she is up until 4am baking cookies. Quick fire questions: Ms Lively admits she was 'nervous' about the interview but relished the chance to ice cupcakes (pictured) and jokingly revealed that Mr Reynold had coined their kitchen 'The Blakery' And when she's not whipping up calorific treats, she's chowing down on them too. Ms Lively listed 'cake,' 'chocolate souffle,' 'melted cheese,' mayonnaise,' and 'truffle pappardelle' as her favorite foods, and 'sea urchin,' as her least favorite. When asked if she usually baked cupcakes, Ms Lively deftly quipped: 'Yes. They are much better baked than raw.' Other bite-sized chunks of trivia reveal the star's affinity for pianos, Paris, puppies and the color pink - her prom dress was coral, she says - as well as a preference for hot chocolate over coffee and a disregard for Starbucks. We want your life: At one point, the actress proudly displayed her Christian Louboutin shoes, and later listed her favorite foods as 'cake,' 'chocolate souffle,' 'melted cheese,' mayonnaise,' and 'truffle pappardelle' Amusingly, she also admitted that she identifies more with the men in HBO's Sex and the City than any of the four main female characters. The snappy video follows a more in-depth interrogation from Vogue into the personal life of Ms Lively, as she covered the magazine's August issue. Speaking gushingly of Mr Reynolds - and hinting at the pitter-patter of tiny feet - she said: 'He’s going to be a great father and leader and patriarch - he’s so meant to be all of those things.' And she's off! Ms Lively also admitted that she identifies more with the men in HBO's Sex and the City than any of the four main female characters, as part of the five-minute one-take interview . She also discussed the launch of her much-anticipated new lifestyle website, Preserve, which covers, in her own words: 'People, stories, essays, videos and goods which hopefully inspire your home, your style and your tongue.' The domestic goddess revealed that she has been working on the project for the past two years, and now, with the help of a team of 12, she is finally ready to share the fruits of her labors with the world. She has already been likened to Martha Stewart in that much of her site's coverage is dedicated to food and crafts. But there is no competition between the two women. In fact Ms Stewart is a neighbor and friend, who fully supports Ms Lively's new endeavor. Finding love: Ms Lively and Mr Reynolds, who met while working together on the set of Green Lantern, pictured at the movie's Los Angeles premiere in 2011 . And as for comparisons to that other actress-turned-tastemaker, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ms Lively insists: '[I'm] not trying to show you the perfect life or the aspirational life. It’s real life. It’s the thing that blindsides you on an idle Tuesday that’s tragic but that also makes you who you are. 'It’s the thing that blindsides you on an idle Tuesday that’s tragic but that also makes you who you are' 'It’s not about me. And it’s not about watching my journey of learning how-to, it’s about me sharing that with you so we all sort of learn together.' Ms Lively has not quit acting altogether though. She plays the lead in The Age of Adaline, that tells the early 20th century tale of a 29-year-old woman who stops aging after an accident - due for release next year.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Forget feeling guilty over the amount of money you regularly shell out on beauty products - an industry worth a staggering $160billion - and consider the fact that financially, it might actually be worth it. According to a new compilation of landmark studies which examine the perks of being beautiful, a pretty face will earn you significantly more money over the course of your life - $230,000 more according to one estimate - and the dividends start paying early. In Vox's video, which illustrates the findings, advantages begin flooding during infancy, when we receive more attention from both strangers and our own parents the 'cuter' we are. Scroll down for video . Genetic Jackpot: A new Vivo video compiles decades of research into beauty and financial success, and proves it really does pay to be attractive, as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are no doubt familiar with (pictured) Looks count: Plenty of studies have found that hiring managers are more likely to consider attractive job applicants over less attractive ones, even when their credentials are identical . By the time we've hit school, teachers will form higher expectations for better-looking children; which may or may not contribute to attractive students getting slighter higher grades, and being more likely to get a college degree. Once we enter the job market, plenty of research exists to support the fact that hiring managers are more likely to consider attractive job applicants compared to unattractive applicants with exactly the same resumes. In this case, a Boo 2011 paper is cited. Choose a job in politics and again, your looks could determine your career. People can apparently predict election results purely based on a candidate's appearance, and there exists a well-established link between beauty and electoral success. Perhaps because, as a 2000 Langlois journal found, beautiful people are seen as more 'competent, kind and trustworthy.' Across all fields: Better looking politicians have been found to have better election odds (pictured, President Obama) and even NFL players (pictured, Tom Brady) earn higher if their faces are symmetrical . Is Beauty in the eye of the beholder? The methods researchers use to judge attractiveness vary, but many psychologists agree that facial symmetry is the primary determining factor . In fact, as far as most professional fields are concerned, employees with above average looks get above average pay across the board. In his 2011 book, Beauty Pays, economist Daniel Hamermesh - not mentioned in the video - calculated that very attractive people earn an average of $230,000 more over the course of a lifetime, compared to those less blessed in the looks department. Taller people earn more too; $789 more a year per inch to be exact, according to a Judge 2003 journal - and taller people tend to be smarter too. Perks: Taller people have also been found to earn more (left, Gisele Bundchen) and will 'hot convict' Jeremey Meeks (right) get a more lenient sentence for his crimes, as many attractive people do? Justice? When beautiful people end up in court, they can expect smaller fines, and win larger compensations, whichever side of the courtroom they find themselves . As for heavier women; their pay declines as their BMI increases, regardless of their career credentials. Even NFL quarterbacks make more cash the more symmetrical their faces are, according to a Berri 2001 study. In his book, Mr Hamermesh writes that according to his findings, people rated as 'very unattractive' are: 'Significantly and substantially more likely to have committed robbery, theft, or assault than were other youths.' But when beautiful people do end up in court, they can expect smaller fines, and win larger compensations, whichever side of the courtroom they find themselves, as the video demonstrates. In summary, whether you were lucky enough to be born beautiful, or you spend a fortune to up your attractiveness, being easy-on-the-eyes will almost always pay you back.","Economist Daniel Hamermesh calculates that attractive people earn an average of $230,000 more in one lifetime .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Yesterday, Lay's chips announced their four new wacky flavors, as voted for by consumers for its annual Do Us A Flavor contest. The bonkers range includes Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Kettle Cooked Wasabi Ginger, Wavy Mango Salsa, and most confoundingly of all, Cappuccino flavored chips. Femail were quick to get our greedy mits on all four of them, to see if we could predict which one would reign supreme. The line-up: For this year's Do Us A Flavor contest, Lay's have announced four new flavors - Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Kettle Cooked Wasabi Ginger, Wavy Mango Salso, and most confoundingly of all, Cappuccino . A quick glance at the facial expressions of our testers indicated that two flavors in particular were causing a bit of a raucous - and not in a good way. The Wavy Mango Salsa chips were wrong on every level; overpoweringly fruity, described by one staffer as 'like eating lip balm,' and loathed by everyone else who had the misfortune of trying them. Potentially even more horrific however, was the Cappuccino flavor, which amassed only two fans; both of whom were widely attacked by the rest of us for their ill-judgement. Losers: The Wavy Mango Salsa's fruity flavor (left) did not go down well with any of our testers, while the sickly sweet - caffeine-free - Cappuccino version (right) caused an uproar of disgust . 'It's sweet, but it's a chip! I hate it!' cried out one tester. 'I can't even put that in my mouth,' claimed another, upon giving the open bag a whiff. 'It's sweet, but it's a chip! I hate it!' Thick with the taste of cinnamon and more sugary than a traditionally savory snack should ever be, at least one tester spat theirs out. The Wasabi Ginger flavor divided us. Obviously if you are not a fan of wasabi, this is not the chip for you. But I found them to be tangy, citrussy and delicious - and probably the most innovate flavor pairing. Winners: The Wasabi Ginger chips were praised for their innovative balance of sushi-inspired flavors, while the Bacon Mac & Cheese chips were enjoyed by everyone for being the safest, least-peculiar of them all . Which makes the Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese flavor the winner of Femail's road test. Perhaps for being the safest option, it was praised for its reassuringly familiar smoky bacon taste, and found itself not a single hater. The person who invented the most popular flavor will win Lay's Do Us a Flavor contest, and bag themselves a whopping $1million. All four flavors will be hitting stores later this month and people can vote for their favorite online through October 18.","The four flavors are the finalists in Lay's' annual Do Us A Flavor contest .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Morning walk: Scientists in Chicago say people who get out and about in the morning are thinner than those who go outside later in the day . As ideas for losing weight go, this is certainly a bright one. Scientists say that people who get out and about in the morning are thinner than those who go outside later in the day. They believe that bright morning light helps synchronise the body clock, which then helps regulate metabolism. The US researchers gave 54 men and women wrist monitors that recorded details of their light exposure, sleep and exercise for a week. The volunteers also kept a diary of all the food they ate. Crunching the results revealed that those who were exposed to bright light before noon were lighter than others – even when exercise, diet and sleep were taken into account. The researchers, from Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said that the timing, intensity and duration of the light were all important. They say it would be hard to get enough light indoors and recommended we get out, even on a cloudy day. Just 20 to 30 minutes is enough. The study’s senior author Dr Phyllis Zee said: ‘Light is the most potent agent to synchronise your internal body clock that regulates circadian rhythms, which in turn also regulate energy balance. ‘If a person doesn’t get sufficient light at the appropriate time of day, it could de-synchronise your internal body clock, which is known to alter metabolism and can lead to weight gain. ‘The message is that you should get more bright light between 8am and noon.’ Take a break: Researchers recommend that office workers take the chance to go outside during their lunch hour . Exposure: The results revealed that those who were exposed to bright light before noon were lighter than others ¿ even when exercise, diet and sleep were taken into account . Researcher Dr Kathryn Reid said: ‘Just like people are trying to get more sleep to help them lose weight, perhaps manipulating light is another way to lose weight.’ She recommends that office workers take the chance to go outside during their breaks and that lighting is improved in schools and work places. The journal PLoS ONE reports that isn’t entirely clear how bright morning light keeps us trim but it is known that light affects metabolism and feelings of hunger and satiety.","Researchers believe the morning light helps synchronise the body clock .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A 40-year-old mother-of two-has scored herself the prized position of an NFL cheerleader, beating out competitors half her age to join the New Orleans Saintsations. Kriste Lewis, from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease 14 years ago, and as she approached her 40th birthday in April, she decided it was now or never if she wished to tick this lifelong dream off her bucket list. 'Today is the day, not tomorrow,' she told the Hattiesburg American. 'Wear your best shoes. Don’t save that bottle of wine... I know that I will be on dialysis and in need of a transplant, but I could be killed in a car wreck tomorrow.' Scroll down for video . She made it! Kriste Lewis (pictured), a 40-year-old mother-of-two, has become the oldest New Orleans Saintsations cheerleader in the team's history, and achieved a lifelong dream just in time for her birthday . Stiff competition: Mrs Lewis (left) has a degenerative kidney disease which means she will one day need dialysis and a transplant - one of the reasons she worked so hard to beat out other hopefuls half her age . The feisty dancer, who appeared on ABC's Good Morning America this morning with her husband Tim, and sons Jake 14, and Rob, 11, trained hard for six months ahead of the try-outs; an experience she would have been happy to settle with as a birthday present to herself on its own. Mrs Lewis did not disclose her age during the first round of nerve-wracking auditions in April, and she held on to her husband's motto 'focus and fun' to keep her eye on the prize. She impressed the judges strictly based on her dancing abilities alone, and two rounds later, it was unanimously decided that she should make the team. Impressed the judges: The feisty cheerleader trained for six months ahead of the auditions, and didn't disclose her age until she had cleared the nerve-wracking first round . Energetic: Mrs Lewis works part time as a fitness instructor, but says she had forgotten just how much she loves to dance . 'I had honestly forgotten how much I loved to dance,' Mrs Lewis, who works part-time as a fitness instructor, admits. 'I told my husband, ""Please remind me after this audition to not stop dancing.""' 'I had honestly forgotten how much I loved to dance' 'It's just amazing to watch her,' Mr Lewis told ABC. 'I'm especially proud that she made it, and she's just the best mom that a child could ever have,' echoed Rob. ABC News | ABC Sports News .

Mrs Lewis joins 35 other women in the new team, some as young as 19, and most in their early to mid-20s. 'It’s a family,' Mrs Lewis told the Hattiesburg American. 'It’s like I have 35 little sisters. They are such sweet girls. All of the girls are so intelligent and they are so kind and well-rounded.' She will have to wait until September for the defining moment when she cheers her first Saints game, a team she has been a lifelong fan of, and an honor she never expected to experience. 'If I died tomorrow, I’m good. I’m a happy girl. It’s been a blast' 'I can’t even fathom what it’s going to be like to walk out on that field in the Superdome with all those Saints fans,' she said. 'I hope I don’t pass out. If I died tomorrow, I’m good. I’m a happy girl. It’s been a blast.' Mrs Lewis isn't far behind the oldest NFL cheerleader in history; Laura Vikmanis, now 45. Mrs Vikmanis is a cheerleader for the Cincinnati Ben-Gals, who was also 40 when she made it to the team. She has since written a book, entitled It's Not About The Pom-Poms, and New Line Cinema is currently making a film about her life.","Kriste Lewis joins 35 other women on the New Orleans Saintsations team, some as young as 19, and most in their early to mid-20s .

Named Aquazzura x Olivia Palmero, it consists of six styles - including over-the-knee boots and snakeskin pumps - and will hit 12 global retailers in September, ranging in price between $600 and $1,625. 'Everything is so expensive these days,' Ms Palermo, 28, aptly stated to WWD. 'And you still want to have things that you can find and have quality and the design aesthetic and be happy.' Style icon: Olivia Palmero, pictured last month wearing a pair of Aquazzura heels, has collaborated on a six-piece shoe collection for the Italian label, which will cost between $600 and $1,625 . Ms Palermo, who tied the knot with dishy model Johannes Huebl, also 28, last month, has long been a fan of the Florence-based label's elaborate footwear. 'Olivia basically has been our unofficial ambassador,' said Aquazzura designer Edgardo Osorio. 'She’s always wearing the shoes. 'We’re friends and we were talking more than a year ago about a small capsule that would be Olivia’s eye and aesthetic but with the Aquazzura style.' One pair of jewel-encrusted stilettos was inspired by a vintage Victorian necklace belonging to Ms Palermo, and the collection also includes gladiator sandals, pumps, and a suede bootie, according to the publication. Label Devotee: Ms Palmero's feet are often seen decked out in Aquazzura's fine shoes, as seen last November (left) and with her brand new husband Johannes Huebl (right) Saks Fifth Avenue will stock the Fall collection, as will Lane Crawford, Tsum and Holt Renfrew; while Net-A-Porter will be the only online retailer to sell them. It's not the newlywed socialite's first foray into the arena of designer collaborations. In 2010, she launched a jewelry line with Roberta Freymann, and the following year, she was invited by Stuart Weitzman to design a shoe for charity. 'Olivia basically has been our unofficial ambassador. She’s always wearing the shoes' Last month, she designed a capsule collection of sunglasses for Westward Leaning, retailing for $210 a pair. If her apparent Midas touch with Westward Leaning's wares is anything to go by, her Aquazzura collaboration is likely to be a storming success. 'No other person... has the kind of conversion power that Olivia has,' Westward Leaning's co-founder Robert Denning said last month. 'When Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez broke up, he left wearing the pair of sunglasses we’d gifted Selena. 'I thought it would lead to a huge spike in sales, but didn’t move the dial at all.'","The six-piece collection will hit 12 global retailers in September, including Net-A-Porter .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Scientists may have hit on the secret behind Usain Bolt’s success on the track – his perfect knees. A study of Jamaican youngsters found those whose legs, and particularly knees, match in size grow up to be the best sprinters. The finding could help explain why athletes from the Caribbean island dominate international 100m and 200m races – the distances Bolt specialises in. Perfectly formed: Scientists say the secret of Usain Bolt's success might be his symmetrical knees . The theory may seem bizarre, but many scientists believe perfectly paired body parts are a sign of good genes and good health. Previous studies have linked symmetrical bodies and faces with everything from good looks to fertility. The . latest study, which started in 1996, involved almost 300 Jamaican . schoolchildren whose bodies were measured from the age of eight. When they reached 22, they were asked to undergo more tests, including two sprint races, with just over half  taking part. The study of Jamaican youngsters found those whose legs, and particularly knees, match in size grow up to be the keenest and best sprinters . The . results showed that those with the most symmetrical legs – and in . particular knees – as children were more likely to agree to race. Significantly they clocked up faster times than the other young men and . women. Northumbria . University researcher John Manning said his results could help explain . the success of six-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt – whose 100m world . record is 9.58 seconds – and his teammates, but added more research is . needed to back up his symmetry theory. He . told the Independent: ‘We need to... look at international level . sprinters and add some genetic tests. Also more data on Caucasians will . help to further clarify the issue.’ Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, he . added that symmetrical knees could also be a sign of general healthy . development of the body. Other . theories behind Jamaicans’ sprinting success include higher numbers of . ‘speed genes’ and fast-twitch muscle fibres that provide the explosive . power needed for sprinting. Professor Manning said:  ‘We found that participants with symmetric legs in 1996, particularly knees, tended to volunteer for the sprints and they tended to run the fastest when tested in 2010. ‘There was some evidence that these Jamaican children had substantially more symmetry in their legs than UK children. ‘So we think our results inform the debate as to why Jamaicans tend to win gold medals in sprinting.’ Other theories behind Jamaicans’ sprinting success include higher numbers of ‘speed genes’ and fast-twitch muscle fibres the provide the explosive power needed for sprinting. Professor Manning said that more research is needed to back up his symmetry theory. He told the Independent: ‘We need to…look at international level sprinters and add some genetic tests. ‘Also more data on Caucasians will help to further clarify the issue.’ He added that symmetrical knees and legs may not only be conductive to speed.  They may also be a sign of general healthy development of the body. Professor Manning said: ‘It may be the simple explanation is that symmetric knees are more efficient during sprinting. Jamaican sprinter Asafa Powell. Research also suggests that Jamaican children's legs tend to be more symmetrical than those of their English counterparts . ‘However, for me, the most likely explanation concerns the nature of developmental stability. ‘People have a genetic instruction to develop symmetrically across most of the body. However, it is very difficult to maintain symmetry in, for example limbs, particularly if one is a rapidly growing child. ‘We initially measured these children when they were about 8 years old, and their knee symmetry at 8 years predicted their sprinting speed years later. ‘This suggests that symmetry can only be achieved and maintained by individuals with ""good genes"". Such genes are likely to influence one's physiology and hence one's running speed.’","Study of Jamaican youngsters found .

"By . Associated Press . An estimated 161 US soldiers have committed suicide so far this year. Suicides among active-duty military have increased somewhat so far this year compared with the same period last year, but Pentagon officials say they are encouraged that more service members are seeking help through hotlines and other aid programs. Pentagon documents show there were 161 confirmed or suspected suicides as of July 14, compared with 154 during the same time frame in 2013. The uptick was among the Air Force and Navy, while soldiers and Marine suicides went down. The documents were obtained by The Associated Press. Tragic: Pentagon documents show there were 161 confirmed or suspected suicides as of July 14 . While the 2014 numbers are likely to change over time as each death is investigated, the slight increase this year is a reversal in the sharp decline in active-duty suicides last year, compared with 2012. According to the final report released Tuesday, active-duty suicides dropped by nearly 19 percent in 2013, compared with the previous year, going from 319 to 259. Suicides among National Guard and Reserve members increased by about 8 percent, going from 203 to 220. The AP reported preliminary 2013 numbers in April. Jacqueline Garrick, director of the Defense Department's suicide prevention office, said in an interview Tuesday that while there is always a concern when officials see the number start to go up again, it's still too early to tell because things could change. She also noted that while often military suicides spike in the summer months, this year the number has gone down in the last month or so. Alarmed by the steady increase in suicides over the past decade, military officials in recent years beefed up the number of programs and behavioral health specialists available for troops. Data hasn't found a definitive link between suicides and service members who deploy to warzones, and officials say that more often the deaths are tied to familiar, societal problems such as financial or job stress and marriage and relationship issues. Garrick said service members are increasingly using the help programs. For example, she said there has been a 25 percent increase in the calls to the military crisis line. And a website for troops — www.vets4warriors.com — saw a 500 percent increase in visitors after a suicide prevention program linked to it was publicized in late May. 'Whenever we see people reaching out for help,' said Garrick, 'That's a win.' She added, 'We're happy when we see one person getting help. We're happy to see that one person who needed us, found us and we were there for them.' According to the 2014 data, there have been 70 confirmed and suspected suicides by Army soldiers; 34 by airmen, 21 by Marines and 36 by sailors . Garrick and other military leaders said that increasingly they have found that programs are more successful at the unit level, and when service members can reach out — even anonymously — to their peers for help. According to the 2014 data, there have been 70 confirmed and suspected suicides by Army soldiers; 34 by airmen, 21 by Marines and 36 by sailors. In the same time frame last year, there were 81 suicides by soldiers, 24 by airmen, 25 by Marines and 24 by sailors. The total number for 2014 so far — 161 — is still sharply lower than the 200 reported by this time in 2012. Military officials struggle to explain the increase in suicides among Guard and Reserve. But officials have noted that the citizen soldiers are generally scattered across the United States, often in small or remote rural communities. Many members of the National Guard and Reserve report for training about one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer. They also often don't have quick access to military medical or mental health services that may be on bases far from their homes. That means the outreach effort by the armed services to address the increase in suicides may not always get to reservists in need — particularly those who don't actively seek help.","Pentagon documents show there were 161 confirmed or suspected suicides as of July 14, compared with 154 during the same time frame in 2013 .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Jackie Siegel, billionaire star of the infamous Queen of Versailles documentary, has shared a horrifying photo of her face following a laser skin treatment. Mrs Siegel, a 48-year-old mother-of-eight based in Orlando, Florida, arranged the procedure as a special treat for herself, to 'celebrate' the end of a long-running lawsuit her husband David Siegel has been embroiled in, but had a severe allergic reaction to the laser. 'Siegel freaked when she saw her face, and went back to the doc, who assured her everything was okay,' reports TMZ. 'She says it took a long, painful week for the swelling to go down, but her face did return to normal.' Ouch! Jackie Siegel, 48, has shared a selfie showing the severe allergic reaction she suffered from a recent skin laser procedure, after which her doctor assured her that everything would 'be okay' After: Mrs Siegel arranged the procedure as a special treat for herself, to 'celebrate' the end of a lawsuit her husband David Siegel has been embroiled in, and fortunately the swelling subsided after a week (pictured) The photo shows Mrs Siegel's aggressively red face covered in blotches and peeling skin reaching from her décolletage to her forehead, and upon closer inspection, her 79-year-old husband pottering around half-nude in the background. The former Miss Florida beauty queen also released a selfie of her face after the reaction had calmed down, in which her skin is pink, plump and almost entirely wrinkle free. It's been a challenging few years for the Siegel family. They achieved widespread fame in 2012 following the critical acclaim of Queen of Versailles; a documentary that followed them as they embarked on building the largest house in America. Reality star: Mrs Siegel (pictured), her husband, and their brood of eight, achieved widespread fame in 2012 following their documentary, which followed them as they embarked on building the largest house in America . Under construction: Midway through filming however, the credit crunch hit, leading them to try and sell the $100million Florida mansion (pictured). The house remains unfinished and unsold two years on . Now that looks familiar: The results of Mrs Siegel's mishap do not look dissimilar to those of Samantha Jones' character in Sex and the City (pictured) after she underwent a chemical peel . Things took a turn, however, when the economy crashed and Mr Siegel, billionaire founder of timeshare company Westgate Resorts, had something of a financial nightmare on his hands. He was then forced to list the 13-bedroom, 11-kitchen, 30-bathroom, 90,000-square-foot mansion for sale; all of which appeared in the documentary. The Siegel couple, whose eight children range in age from seven to 20, did not end up with the sort of fame they had been hoping for, and subsequently launched a lawsuit against the documentary's filmmakers for 'defamation' over their 'riches-to-rags' portrayal. Ultimately, the Siegel camp lost, and two years on, their $100million mega mansion is still unfinished and unsold. Mrs Siegel, perhaps on a mission to throw the family into a more positive light next time around, signed a development deal in March with NBC for a new reality TV show. 'I hope they will just let me be me and let me do my own thing,' she told the Orlando Sentinel earlier this month.

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama didn't get three minutes into a speech this morning in Kansas City, Missouri, before being interrupted by a heckler. Obama had just launched into a story about his dining experience the evening before when a woman in the balcony area of the venue began shouting at him. 'I'm sorry, what are you hollering about?' he asked.'Jesus is the God of Israel. He is fully God,' she responded.'I believe in God. Thanks for the prayer. Amen. Thank you,' Obama told the woman as she was escorted out of the theater. Scroll down for video . 'Jesus is the God of Israel. He is fully God': A woman yells at President Barack Obama during his speech on the economy this afternoon at the Uptown Theater in Kansas City, Missouri . The woman was eventually escorted out of the theater by police . But not before the president could respond to her. 'I believe in God,' he told her . After the yelling had subsided Obama attempted to return to his story, but he was quickly interrupted a group of attendees chanting, 'We love you!' Eventually, the president got back on topic: his visit to famed Kansas City barbeque joint Arthur Bryant's. 'I just want to be on record, though, because people have been asking me this question.  I deal with a lot of tough issues -- I am not going to decide who makes the best barbecue in Kansas City,' Obama said to laughter from the audience. Obama said 'Bryant’s barbecue was tasty,' and he 'did plow through it pretty good' but he hadn't eaten at enough of city's barbeque restaurants to hand out the honor. 'So I’m going to have to try some other barbecue the next time I come in,' he told the audience. The president was explaining that he was in Kansas City not only for its world famous barbeque, but to meet with people who wrote him letters when he was interrupted yet again by an audience member who told him: 'I wrote you, too!' 'Well, you know what, if I had known, I would have had you over for dinner, too,' the president said, to laughter. Obama went on to explain that every night he reads a sample of 10 letters from Americans. 'And folks tell me their stories -- they tell me their worries and their hopes and their hardships, their successes,' he said. 'Some say I’m doing a good job. But other people say, “You’re an idiot.” ' Obama said he didn't mind reading hate mail, though, because 'this is how I know that I’m getting a good sample of letters.' President Barack Obama tries a sample of roasted coffee from Ethiopia at Parkville Coffee during a surprise stop this afternoon . Afterward, the president took a stroll along Main Street, where shook hands with Parkville residents while drinking an iced tea . The president met with four of the letter writers last night at Arthur Bryant's, including a man named Victor Fugate, who introduced the president today ahead of his speech at Kansas City's Uptown Theater. The White House says Fugate wrote Obama in January of 2012 to thank him for the student loan assistance he received from the federal government as part of the Obama administration's Income Based Repayment Plan. According to the White House, Fugate is also a beneficiary of Obamacare, having enrolled in an exchange after he lost his job. 'I am thankful for the Affordable Care Act. That's probably the biggest reason that I wrote a letter to the president,' he told attendees of Obama's speech today. As far as his dinner with the president last night is concerned, Fugate said: 'If the First Lady is watching, it was a beautiful salad.' Obama actually had a half slab of ribs. He would have also had a side of cole slaw, but by the time the president arrived at the restaurant, it had run out for the day. 'You've got to have some coleslaw around here, don't you?' Obama playfully told the cashier. 'You're out of it? You didn't save any for me?' 'Come on, man, I thought you were going to hook me up.' The president didn't indulge in any more BBQ before leaving the Kansas City area today, but he did stop by a coffee shop in Parkville, Missouri, where he purchased an iced tea and refills for the small business' six patrons. An employee offered Obama a tea with lavender, but he declined. 'I'm not confident enough to order that,' he said, according to a reporter present.","The president is in Kansas City, Missouri, to meet with letter writers and give a speech on the economy .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Older women are putting themselves at risk by failing to attend smear tests it has been revealed. File image . Older women are putting their lives at risk by failing to go for regular smear tests, cancer charities warned last night. Latest figures show that the proportion of women screened for early signs of cervical cancer drops from the age of 55 – and around a quarter aged 50 to 64 skip the five-minute check. These women are up to six times more likely to develop the disease than those who attend all their appointments, Cancer Research UK said yesterday. It said regular smear tests were vitally important for older women – and urged them to attend all of their appointments. In England, women can have smear tests on the NHS every three years between the ages of 25 and 49 and then every five years until 65. Smear tests pick up cells in the cervix, or lining of the womb, that could become cancerous and are credited with saving up to 5,000 lives a year in the UK. However, the proportion of women going for the checks falls from the age of 55. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) show that in 2013, some 82 per cent of women aged 50 to 54 had been recently tested. This dropped to 76 per cent among 55 to 59-year-olds and to 73 per cent among 60 to 64-year-olds. There is particular concern that rates of screening among 60 to 64-year-olds are at a 16-year-low. Yet the number of cases in this age group is at its highest for a decade. With most cases of cervical cancer triggered by the sexually transmitted disease HPV, some older women may believe they are protected because they have been in a long-term relationship. However, cervical cancer can still strike in old age and those in monogamous relationships may be at risk from HPV caught years earlier. Although the bulk of the 3,000 cases a year occur in younger women, cervical cancer is more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage and to be deadly in older women. The issue has been thrown into the spotlight by a study of all women aged 65 to 83 diagnosed with cervical cancer in England over a five-year period. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London found that women who did not go for a smear in their 50s or 60s were four times as likely to develop cervical cancer as those who had regular checks, the journal PLOS Medicine reports. And those who did not attend were six times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than those who had three smear tests that produced negative results. Smear tests collect cells from the cervix of womb lining that could be cancerous, like those shown here . Researcher Peter Sasieni said: ‘Screening may not be pleasant but it is quick and relatively painless and often prevents an aggressive cancer later in life.’ He added that as cervical cancer takes a long time to develop, the protection offered by regular smear tests in later life can extend into a woman’s 80s. This means that as the population ages, the NHS should consider extending the upper age limit for smear tests. He estimates that giving women one final smear test at the age of 70 could prevent up to 200 cases of cervical cancer and save 100 lives a year. Jessica Kirby, of Cancer Research UK, which funded the study, said: ‘These results provide reassurance that there is a real benefit to women over 50 having cervical cancer screening. ‘Screening can pick up abnormal cells that could develop into cervical cancer if left alone. Removing these cells prevents cancer from developing.’ Robert Music, chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ‘Cervical cancer can be a slow-developing disease and you only need to be sexually active once in your lifetime to be at risk.’ There are around 1,000 deaths a year from cervical cancer.","Figures show fewer women over 55 are being screened for cervical cancer .

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama met with the leaders of the three Central American countries at the forefront of the illegal immigration debate this afternoon. Obama held a joint meeting with Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and El Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren to discuss their 'shared responsibility' to promote 'safe, legal, and orderly migration' to the America, according to the White House. Vice President Joe Biden, who met with Molina and Ceren last month in Guatemala, also attended today's meeting at the White House. Neither Obama nor the Central American leaders took questions from the press after the meeting, but Honduras' Hernandez said on Thursday that he planned to ask Obama to do more to clear up 'the ambiguity' surrounding the country's immigration laws, including the president's Deferred Action for childhood arrivals program, and to step up law enforcement efforts to shut down drug smugglers and cartels. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, now back from his fundraising trip to the West Coast, met with Central American leaders at the White House today to discuss the ongoing immigration crisis. Obama met with: President Salvador Sanchez Ceren of El Salvador, left, President Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, second left, and President Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras,right . A Texas Parks and Wildlife Warden stands next to a 30 caliber rifle as he patrols the Rio Grande River along the U.S.-Mexico border. Texas has increased the number of law enforcement personnel it has at the border in response to the surge in illegal immigrant children crossing the border . 'Here we have to say that the coyotes, the smugglers, who are very much a part of organized crime networks, perversely have sought to exploit those ambiguities and peddle a mistaken, a totally wrong interpretation to the parents of these children in saying, ""You can get your kids in the U.S., we can do it for you,"" 'Hernandez said in remarks yesterday to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, according to the New York Times. 'Those coyotes, those smugglers are nothing other than the human face of an enormous criminal monster that has one foot firmly in the camp of the drug lords and in Central America,' Hernandez continued. The 'second foot is here in the United States under American jurisdiction.' The White . House said after today's meeting that Obama made it 'clear' to the . Central American presidents that children who come to America without the . proper documentation will eventually be sent home. During the meeting today Obama also brought up the possibility of a pilot program that would set up screening centers inside Honduras so that children would know before they left the country whether or not they qualify for refugee status in the U.S. 'There may be some narrow circumstances in which there is humanitarian reason to allow them status. If that's the case better to apply in country rather than take a very dangerous journey up to Texas to make those same claims,' Obama said in brief remarks Friday after the meeting. 'But I think it’s important to recognize that that would not necessarily accommodate a large number of additional migrants,' he added. 'What's more important is to find solutions prevent smugglers from making money that ensure greater security in Central America. ' White House officials said Thursday that program would not make changes to current refugee statutes, which most Honduran children do not qualify for currently. It would merely establish a process within the children's home country through which they can determine their immigration status before they make the 1,000 mile journey across the Mexico to the U.S. The number of unaccompanied minors making the 1,000 mile trek across the U.S. to Mexico has skyrocketed since Obama enacted his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program last year . Guatemalan . President Molina said Thursday at a press conference in Washington that . he would like the U.S. to extend any agreement it makes with Honduras . or El Salvador to his country, as well. 'We expect that the solution to this problem also is equal for the three countries,' he said. All three Central American countries are considered among the top five most dangerous in the world by the United Nations and each sees thousands of young people leave for the U.S. each year. As of the end of May, U.S. Border Patrol and Customs had logged a record 13,244 apprehensions of unaccompanied Honduran minors, 11,449 Guatemalan children and 9,835 El Salvadorian youths at the border since the close of the last fiscal year. That represents a more than 100 percent increase in the number of Honduran children who illegally entered the U.S. last year and an increase of more than 50 percent in El Salvadorian minors in the same time period. Apprehensions of Guatemalan youth ticked up the least. The number of unaccompanied Mexican minors trying to enter the county illegally has declined this year, but it still remains high. Since October, 11,550 young Mexicans have been apprehended at the border compared with 17,219 last year. Obama spoke with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on the phone last night. The White House says Obama applauded Nieto during their conversation for stepping up security along the country's border with Guatemala and Belize. Nieto announced last week that his country would open five new outposts on its southern border and crack down on people riding the the rails north. Already, Mexico has doubled the number of children it apprehends at its border each day, but the country is only catching a small portion of unaccompanied minors compared to the number that show up on the U.S.'s doorstep every day. The White House says Obama also reminded Nieto on the call that neither his immigration reform legislation nor his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program includes amnesty for newly arriving illegal immigrant children. Guatemala President Otto Perez Molina, left, and Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez said yesterday at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event yesterday that as part of its 'shared responsibility' for the situation at the border, the U.S. need to clear up 'ambiguities' in its immigration process . Obama's meetings with Central American leaders in Washington this afternoon comes a day after they met with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. House Speaker John Boehner said the GOP's meeting with Hernandez and Molina was 'constructive' and their 'visit to Washington is further evidence of how seriously they are taking this situation. 'I impressed upon them how important it is we all work together to end this crisis and reunite these children with their families in their home countries. 'We continue to discuss our options with our colleagues, and remain firm in our commitment to find common ground and provide humanitarian relief,' he said in a statement. Republicans met on Capitol Hill this morning to discuss a $1.5 billion bill to provide emergency funding to government agencies that handle immigration. President Obama has requested $3.7 billion, but neither Republicans nor Democrats have proposed plans to give him the full amount. Senate Democrats are considering a bill that would appropriate $2.7 billion toward the issue. It's unlikely that the House would take up the Senate bill, as the more conservative members have expressed dissatisfaction with the amount their caucus is willing to give the president. But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi today expressed hope that two chambers can pass a bill with 'bipartisan cooperation' that includes funding for most of the proposals outlined in Obama's original request. A major sticking point between the two parties' bills is that Republicans' legislation includes changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the U.S. to give children migrating to the U.S. who are not from Canada or Mexico due process before they can be repatriated. The president and his administration support changes to the bill that would give the Department of Homeland Security the ability to give Central American children the option of voluntarily bypassing the court system and returning home once they've been notified of their rights. Pelosi has said in the past that while she did not support changes to the bill, she would be open to them if it meant that Congress would fund the president's emergency spending package before Congress leaves for recess at the end of next week. The Democratic leader is now hedging on her willingness to accept Republican-issued changes to the law, saying today that the funding request and reforms to immigration policies are two different things entirely. 'There's no reason why they have to be tied,' she said. Pressed on whether she would vote for a package that included reforms to the 2008 law Pelosi told reporters: 'I can't answer that.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Vice President Joe Biden was heckled by a group of immigration reform activists during a speech he gave this evening to a gathering of progressives. Midway through Biden's remarks to the roughly 3,000 attendees of the annual Netroots Nation conference, protestors began chanting, 'Stop deporting our families,' at the Obama administration official. 'Let's take these one issue at a time, OK,' Biden angrily shouted at the hecklers, who interrupted him as he was talking about the prevalence of sexual assault on campus. 'I respect your view, and I share your view, but let me take these issues one . . .'Biden tried to say moments later but was cut off by the protesters' chanting. Scroll down for video . Vice President Joe Biden's speech to progressive activists attending the Netroots Nation conference in Detroit, Michigan, this evening was interrupted by immigration reform activists who were upset with the government for deporting illegal immigrants . As they were escorted out the event, the activists encouraged the audience to cheer for their cause. When attendees near the protestors began to clap, Biden joined in. 'You should clap for those young people,' the vice president said, 'because if you were a member of a family... you should clap for them.' With the speaker's permission, the entire audience began to clap wildly for the hecklers. 'Can you imagine the pain, the anxiety, of coming home every day and wondering whether or not you're mother or father will still be there?' Biden asked the audience. 'Can you imagine, can you imagine what it must feel like?' Once the clapping had died down, Biden returned to his original remarks. A few minutes later he returned to the topic of immigration, arguing that having compassion is the 'moral' thing to do. 'The constant flow of immigration, from the founding of our country, has been the primary source of our ability to constantly remake ourselves as a nation.' This was the first time the Vice President had given remarks at the annual conference, held this year Detroit, Michigan. Biden and other Democratic presidential candidates were invited to participate in a candidate forum at the gathering in 2007 but then-Senator Biden declined to attend. Biden spoke this year on behalf of the White House. In the past the president has addressed the conference via video, but Netroots spokeswoman Mary Rickles said he would not be giving remarks of any kind this year. During his trip to Detroit, Biden also met with students who participate in an accelerated learning program that trains workers for information technology . In introducing Biden, Netroots Nation board member Arshad Hasan praised the Vice President for putting gay marriage on the table in 2012 by admitting during an appearance on Meet the Press that he supported giving same-sex couples the same marital rights as heterosexual couples. 'We give Barack Obama credit for changing the dialogue on marriage equality around the country,' Hasan said. 'I give Joe Biden credit for changing the dialogue in the White House.' Biden said he was 'flattered' by the laudatory introduction, however, his comments on Meet the Press were not planned. 'But when I get asked a direct question, I give a direct answer,' he said. 'There's not a way on God's green earth that I can sit there and be asked a question about the civil rights issue of our day and remain silent. It would have been a lie of who I am.' Biden assured activists that even though President Barack Obama had not yet publicly throw his support behind the cause at the time of the incident, 'the president fully agreed with me.' 'It was a tactical difference possibly within the White House as to how it went, but you know, enough is enough.' Biden revealed that when he came back from his television interview and went to see the president, Obama gave him a big hug as soon as he entered the room and told him, ' ""You said two things that you weren't gonna to change if I brought you on. One was you weren't gonna wear any funny hats and two, you weren't going to change your brain."" ' The Vice President said the real credit on this issue goes to the LGBT community for having the 'courage to come out.' 'I didn't free the LGBT community,' he said. ""What you all did, what they did, was free every straight woman and straight man in this country. 'It used to be that the vast majority of the American people who were not at all homophobic felt intimidated if they stood up,' Biden claimed, but now many Americans across the country feel comfortable saying they support same-sex marriage. 'It's made America better all across the board. So I say thank you to the gay community,' Biden said.","The Vice President tried to talk over the protesters but quickly gave up .

"A grinning, chuckling Kathleen Sebelius stood alongside President Barack Obama on Friday morning, accepting praise that has eluded her throughout Obamacare's troubled early months. Only 10 days ago, the president ignored her as he took a victory lap when the Affordable Care Act's signup numbers crested above 7 million. But he had kind words for the health insurance warrior in her final public appearance as a federal government employee. She told him 'in early March' that she would leave shortly after the April 1 insurance open-enrollment deadline. But on March 31, she told The Huffington Post that she would remain on the job until November. Now that she's no longer Obama's ham-fisted insurance surrogate, plagued with 'oops' moments in one congressional hearing after another, it's smiles all around. Sebelius and her team 'got the job done' with Obamacare, he said of the manager who bungled the most ambitious health initiative in U.S. history, and 'the final score speaks for itself.' Scroll down for video . Suddenly friendly: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius accepted congratulations from the president and vice president during her final White House appearance, although Obama snubbed her last week when Obamacare enrollment numbers looked promising for the first time . New HHS Secretary nominee Syliva Burwell, who now heads the Office of Management and Budget, beamed as she accepted praise from the boss and applause from a partisan crowd . On Friday Sebelius called her job helming HHS 'the opportunity of a lifetime.' The president praised her for 'five years of extraordinary service to our country.' 'I will miss her advice, I will miss her friendship, I will miss her wit,' he said. Even her farewell speech had its panic moment. 'A page is missing,' Sebelius said before improvising the end of her remarks. Obama's well-wishes included moments of Obamacare crescendo, but equal time for other liberal identity-politics totems. She 'has been here through the long fight to pass the ACA,' Obama said. 'She helped guide its implementation even when it got rough.' But Sebelius, Obama said, had also 'reduced racial and ethnic disparities' in Americans' well-being, and was 'a tireless advocate for women's health.' Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, was nominated to take her place. Obama appeared with the outgoing and incoming HHS secretaries in the White House Rose Garden, shortly before jetting off for fundraisers, and a speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, in New York City. Sebelius' replacement is Sylvia . Mathews Burwell, a long-time Democratic operative whose political career . has come in two acts with a lengthy intermission. Burwell . served in the Clinton White House as deputy to then-budget director . Jack Lew, who would later become Obama's treasury secretary. She was . briefly ensnared in an investigation into the suicide death of Deputy . White House counsel Vince Foster. As . Secret Service agents scoured Foster's office for clues about why he . took his life, Burwell briefly sifted through a 'burn bag' containing . classified documents that she wasn't supposed to see. After . a stint as deputy chief of staff during the Monica Lewinsky crisis, she . went to the private sector, first at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and later at the top of the Walmart foundation, the . mega-retail chain's charitable arm – only to succumb again to . Washington's lure. The U.S. Senate confirmed her last year to run OMB, by a 96-0 margin. Oops! 'A page is missing,' Sebelius said, skipping a portion of her speech in the final cock-up of her time at HHS . Lean forward: Obama hopes to wipe the Obamacare slate clean with a new quarterback, but Senate Republicans will likely turn her confirmation hearing into an license to fish for new information about the unpopular policy . The timing of Sebelius' departure was designed to allow her to leave with a scrap of honor, coming just a week after Obama announced that his administration had exceeded its target of 7 million enrollees after months of fiasco. Obama brought past and future HHS secretaries to a Rose Garden event attended by officials including Shaun Donovan, Gina McCarthy, Anthony Foxx, Tom Vilsack, John Kerry, Valerie Jarrett, Jeff Zients, Tina Tchen and Shailagh Murray . She 'has been here through the long fight to pass the Affordable Care Act,' Obama gushed. 'She helped guide its implementation even when it got rough. She's got bumps. I've got bumps, and bruises.' The White House aims for her resignation to soften the constant barrage of controversies connected with the president's flagship policy. Republicans were quick to pounce Thursday, confounding those hopes. 'Kathleen Sebelius had a supremely difficult job implementing a law as unpopular and unwieldy as Obamacare,' House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa said in a statement. 'Her tenure as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services may be at an end, but Americans will be dealing with the repercussions of the president's health law for a very long time.' On the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol, minority leader Mitch McConnell called it 'fitting that nearly one year after the primary legislative architect of Obamacare predicted it would be a train wreck that the government official most responsible for overseeing it reportedly is resigning.' 'Regardless of the administration’s public explanation for the Secretary’s exit, Obamacare has been a rolling disaster and her resignation is cold comfort to the millions of Americans who were deceived about what it would mean for them and their families.' The train-wreck reference was a nod to former Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, now Obama's ambassador to China, who warned Sebelius on April 17, 2013 that the Affordable Care Act was headed for the rocks. 'I just see a huge train wreck coming down,"" he said then. 'You and I have discussed this many times, and I don't see any results yet.' Dela vu: 13 months ago Obama introduced Sylvia Burwell in the East Room of the White House as him new budget director . The Affordable Care Act has been fraught . with trouble since its official rollout in October. Its website . crashed, cost estimates quickly rose, and public dissatisfaction has . dogged the initiative for more than two years. The . October 1 online unveiling was nothing short of disastrous, with even . liberal commentators and Democrats in Congress conceding that the . government's effort was not ready for prime time. Contractors' efforts . were incompatible, data servers were inadequate, and payment systems . linked to the website were yet to be built on launch day. Kathleen Sebelius joined the Obama administration in April 2009 as a figure unknown to Americans in 49 states. She had been  governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009, and that state;s insurance commissioner for eight years before that. Her only national platform prior to Obama's election came in 2008 when, as a former chair of the Democratic Governors Association, she was tapped to deliver her party's response to President George W. Bush's final State of the Union address. She wasn't expected to play a role in the new administration until former Sen. Tom Daschle, a South Dakota politician who had once been Senate Majority Leader, withdrew his candidacy for the top HHS job following a tax scandal. He had failed to pay taxes on more than $83,000 in earnings in 2007, and claimed tax deductions for nearly $15,000 of donations to charities that didn't meet the IRS's tax-deductibility standards. Sebelius hasn't said where she will go after she leaves the president's cabinet. Her three immediate predecessors have found life after government as a law partner (Tommy Thompson), a university professor (Donna Shalala) and a think-tank chief (Mike Leavitt). None of them, however, presided over a program that, like Obamacare, was controversial, partisan and fraught with failure from the beginning. Sebelius . presided over all of it, producing misgivings across the U.S. capital . that she was up to the task. She has, however, been the administration's . designated spear-catcher, attracting slings and arrows from both houses . of Congress and the public at every turn. The . president raised eyebrows nationwide on April 1 when he failed to . acknowledge her contribution to the program's recent . momentum during a high-profile Rose Garden victory speech. Sebelius, who has served in Obama's cabinet for five years, was not there alongside him but sat, unnoticed, in the front row. As the White House shifted from shame to fist-pumping, Sebelius continued to attract scorn. She said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday that more . than 7.5 million Americans had chosen health insurance plans through the . Obamacare system. She could not, however, answer a question from Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch about how many subscribers were . uninsured before the law took effect. Additionally, . she hasn't provided Congress with answers about how many Obamacare enrollees have paid premiums, a . necessary step to become formally enrolled in insurance plans. A recent McKinsey and Company study estimated that no more than 1 million Americans both lacked insurance before the rollout and have paid money into the system. Although Democrats will likely have more than enough votes to confirm Burwell as HHS secretary, more than a half-dozen liberals facing difficult re-election fights will be forced to moderate their enthusiasm. Public hearings could become a spectacle of Republicans demanding internal documents and the White House claiming executive privilege. At the least, the confirmation process will bring to the surface once again conservatives' objections to Obama's new insurance model. 'The president doesn't need more Obamacare controversy so close to November,' a senior aide to a Senate Republican told MailOnline shortly after the announcement of Sebelius' departure. 'And if Republicans object too much to Burwell, the Democrats will trot out the ""war on women"" narrative even more. We don't need that in an election year.'","'I will miss her advice, I will miss her friendship, I will miss her wit,' Obama said as his outgoing HHS secretary grinned and laughed .

"By . Francesca Chambers . A Democratic Congressman annoyed with House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa trolled his Republican colleague today with a sarcastic suggestion he build a 'truth pond' in the hearing room to more effectively ferret out witches. 'It is clearly obvious that witches can only be found by dunking them in water,' Rep. Tony Cardenas said in a press release announcing his request. 'If they float they’re a witch. If they don’t, installing a pool will allow us to retrieve the non-witch before he or she drowns.' Cardenas made the recommendation after Issa and other Republicans on Oversight voted this morning to rebuke a White House official for refusing to comply a subpoena to appear before the committee. Rep. Tony Cardenas, pictured here are an Oversight committee last year, mocked committee chairman Darrell Issa today for engaging in what Democrats are characterizing as a partisan witch hunt . Issa has been trying to get the aide - White House Director of the Office of Political Strategy & Outreach David Simas - to talk to committee members under oath so they can probe him about the work he does for the president. Republicans on the committee are concerned that Simas may be breaking a federal law called the Hatch Act by engaging in political activity in his official capacity as a presidential adviser. At the advice of White House Counsel  W. Neil Eggleston, Simas is declining to testify. Eggleston assets that high-ranking White House aides have 'absolute immunity' and cannot be made to appear before Congress. Issa . said today that it's imperative that Simas give on-the-record . statements about his role at the White House so 'committee members and . the American people an opportunity to hear from . the head of an office that has, under several previous administrations, . misused public resources for political purposes.' 'We have an absolute right and obligation' to investigate this matter, the California congressman claimed, arguing that the subpoena is 'consistent with our requirement to do oversight even without a predicate of wrongdoing.' 'This is not alleging a scandal at any level,' Issa said in remarks during the committee hearing, as reported by Roll Call. 'We are accusing neither the president nor this four-person office of . any wrongdoing.' Issa's rejection of Democrats' request that he end his quest to interview Simas under oath widened a riff between the Republican Congressman and his colleagues across the aisle. Democrats say Issa, a Republican, is wrong to haul individuals before the committee whom he doesn't know to have committed wrongdoing . In his press release mocking Issa today, Cardenas recommended the above ground pool be named the 'Senator Joseph R. McCarthy Memorial Truth Pond' in honor of a Republican lawmaker who gained notoriety in the 1950s with claims that Communism was afoot at the highest levels of government. He also called for a plaque to be installed next to it with a quote from former head counsel for the United States Army, Joseph N. Welch, who once said to McCarthy, 'Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have . you left no sense of decency?' In extra snarky bit at the end, the press release said 'the pool will be available for . staff and member recreation when committee “hearings” are not being . held.' 'Like the Chairman, I am interested in effective government oversight and . reform,' Cardenas said. 'This pool will allow that to take place, wasting far fewer . taxpayer dollars in the process.'","Rep.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new U.S. study has found the earlier women start to diet the more likely they are to suffer long-term health problems . The earlier a woman starts to diet, the more prone she will be to health problems such as eating disorders and alcohol misuse, scientists have warned. A study at Florida State University followed 1,340 students for 10 years and found cultural pressures to stay thin affect women of all ages. Some began to watch their weight and actively diet at the age of three, while others started to follow a calorie-controlled programme at the age of 26. Researchers noted the earlier a woman started to diet, the more likely they were to suffer long-term health consquences. Psychology professor Pamela Keel, who led the team, said: 'Younger age of dieting predicts greater problems 10 years out from college.' She said it is not completely clear why dieting at an early age may have such an effect on health later in life. One . possible reason was 'there is already something different' about women . who start dieting at an early age in terms of their social environment . or genetic make-up. The findings, presented at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behaviour, revealed those factors can stay with a woman for life, increasing the risk of resorting to extreme dieting or other unhealthy behaviours later in life. Eating disorders are often driven by social, psychological and biological factors, said Professor Keel. She said discouraging weight loss diets in young girls may reduce risk for eating, alcohol and weight-related problems in adulthood. Public health initiatives should promote behaviours that increase wellness in girls such as increasing activity, decreasing leisure time watching TV and on computers and consuming more fruits and vegetables. Such interventions could be necessary as early as primary school to support girls before they enter puberty - a time when their bodies will naturally experience rapid growth, weight gain and an increase in body fat. The Florida State University study found women were more prone to suffering eating disorders, obesity and alcohol misuse .","Study at Florida State University studied 1,340 female students for 10 years .

"By . Francesca Chambers . White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said today he believes there's a 'possibility' that House Republicans will try to impeach the president. The Huffington Post reports that Pfeiffer told attendees of a Christian Science Monitor breakfast that recent events, including the House's lawsuit against Obama, suggests the idea is not as far-fetched as it may seem. 'I think a lot of people in this town laugh that off,' Pfeiffer said. 'I . would not discount that possibility.' Scroll down for video . White House Senior Dan Pfeiffer, pictured here on Meet the Press in March, said today that he thinks House Republicans' lawsuit against the president could open the door to impeachment . 'I think that Speaker [John] Boehner, by . going down this path of this lawsuit, has opened the door to Republicans . possibly considering impeachment at some point in the future,' he continued. Citing former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's calls for Congress to impeach the president and recent polls that show majority of Republicans agree with her, Pfeiffer concluded that the House may yet draw up articles of impeachment against the president. 'I think impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied . about by the recent Republican vice presidential nominee and others in a . very unserious way,' Pfeiffer said. 'And no one has even made any . allegation of anything that would be within six universes from what is . generally considered in that space.' That said, Pfeiffer predicted that the president's plans to bypass Congress and unilaterally act on immigration could rankle Republicans enough to jump start the process. 'The president acting on immigration . reform will certainly up the likelihood that they would contemplate . impeachment,' he said, according to Reuters, adding it would be 'foolish' not to consider it a prospect. House Speaker Republican John Boehner, center, walks to a House Republican conference meeting on immigration issues, on Capitol Hill this morning. Boehner's office accused Pfeiffer of not being serious about addressing the immigration crisis after it learned of his comments on impeachment . A handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill have talked about impeaching the president such as retiring Rep. Steve Stockman, who sent his colleagues in Congress a book on 'The Case for Removing Barack Obama from Office' last fall. But no one in party leadership has even winked in the direction of impeachment. Boehner has vehemently denied that the House's lawsuit is a gateway to impeachment. And a spokeman for Boehner characterized Pfeiffer's comments this morning as disingenuous. 'We have a humanitarian crisis at our border, and the White House is . making matters worse with inattention and mixed signals,' Boehner aide Michael Steel told the Huffington Post, referring the more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors who have entered the country illegally since last October. 'It is telling, . and sad, that a senior White House official is focused on political . games, rather than helping these kids and securing the border,' Steel added.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A 15-year-old is pain free and walking after sacrificing her leg, to save her life. Kelsey Buckley from Seacroft in Leeds, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011. After doctors removed part of her leg, replacing the bone with a metal prosthesis, the teenager was plagued by infections. Kelsey was given a choice as medics revealed she had the option to have her leg amputated, or risk losing her life. Kelsey Buckley opted to have her left leg amputated at the thigh, left after doctors warned her she could die after being diagnosed with bone cancer. She is now pain free and learning to walk with a prosthesis, right . Refusing to dwell on her situation, the teen is now pain free and has started walking with a prosthesis. She said: 'I was heartbroken to hear doctors say ""lose your leg or your life.’ 'But after everything I had been through it was an easy decision to make. 'I’m finally pain free and can start living my life again.' Kelsey was first diagnosed with osteosarcoma, bone cancer, in 2011 after she noticing a lump on her leg. In 2012, at just 12 years old she underwent chemotherapy, before having her tibia removed and replaced with a metal prosthesis at Birmingham Orthepaedic Hospital. But her leg often became infected - leaving her in excruciating pain. Medics eventually told Kelsey, an amputation was the only way to solve the problem. Kelsey’s mother, Kim, 41, said: 'She is amazing, despite being so young she has dealt with it all so well. 'She smiled through gruelling rounds of chemotherapy. 'It was horrific watching my little girl in so much pain due to infections. Throughout it all she was so brave. 'I’d say, ""Kelsey, don’t die"" and she’d reply ""I won’t leave you"". 'She’d say ""what are you crying for, it’s only cancer"".' After . watching her daughter go through so much pain, Kim said it was a . ‘relief’ to be told by doctors that she needed an amputation. Kelsey, pictured with her twin sister Kara, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, bone cancer, in 2011 after she noticing a lump on her leg . After rounds of chemotherapy doctors removed Kelsey's tibia, replacing it with a metal prosthesis. But the teenager suffered multiple infections leading doctors to conclude amputation was the only option . Kelsey made the brave decision to have the amputation and underwent the operation last summer- and the teen hasn’t looked back since. She said: 'Once my infected leg had gone I could finally get on with my life. 'I don’t let anything get me down for too long. I got up and out of bed just a few hours after surgery.

'After everything I had been through it was an easy decision to make' - Kelsey Buckley . Kara said: 'My sister is my inspiration, we are so close so when she was going through cancer it was so hard. 'It’s amazing how happy she has been through her whole cancer journey, we are all so pleased she’s finally able to start enjoying life again.' Kelsey is now able to enjoy swimming and would love to try ice skating. She said: 'I don’t use my false leg as I prefer to just get around on my crutches. 'I’ve gone back to school full time too, my friends have been really supportive which helps massively.' Ms Buckley added: 'Since the amputation Kelsey has regained her appetite after her weight plummeted, I’m so proud. 'We are so lucky to be referred so quickly by our GP, sometimes people don’t get diagnosed until after six months. 'At that point it’s much harder to cure.' Kelsey, pictured left in hospital during treatment, and right after the amputation, said: 'After everything I had been through it was an easy decision to make' Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust chief executive officer said: 'One can only imagine the terror and disbelief which went through Kelsey’s mind when doctors told her “your leg or your life”. 'Primary bone cancer is a cruel and degrading disease which affects 600 people in the UK and Ireland every year.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new mother straining to hear her baby let out his first cry instead heard doctors declaring the newborn dead, eight minutes after he was born. Nikkita Pereira said she struggled to breathe herself, believing she had lost her first child. But moments later Ziah 'came back to life', gasping his first breath and letting out a cry. Miss Pereira said: 'Just as I was about to give up, a miracle happened - Ziah drew a deep breath and burst into tears. Nikkita Pereira said she heard medics at The Royal Free Hospital in London declare her newborn son Ziah dead just eight minutes after his birth by emergency C-section. But moments later her son took his first gasp for breath, bursting into tears . 'I . felt the blood rush through my veins as it hit me that my boy wasn’t . dead. When I heard him cry it felt like I was breathing again.' Miss Pereira, 22, was thrilled when she discovered she was pregnant with her first child in June 2011. The expectant mother started making plans to have a natural birth at home. But in February 2012, she was taken to hospital after experiencing complications during the early stages of labour. After 28 hours, doctors were forced to carry out an emergency Caesarean section, detecting baby Ziah's heartbeat was fading. As medics removed him from the womb, they discovered the newborn was not breathing. A terrifying eight minutes passed before Miss Pereira claims she heard doctors declare her son dead. 'The silence was deafening as doctors spent eight minutes frantically trying to get him to breathe. 'Then I heard the doctor announce his time of death as 11.02am. 'I felt as if my own heart stopped . that very instant too, I was completely crushed. It’s difficult to . express in words how painful it was - I couldn’t bare the thought that . I’d never get to know my son.' But a split second later, Ziah miraculously burst into tears. Medics delivered Ziah by emergency C-section in February 2012 after detecting his heartbeat was fading because the umbilical cord became caught around his neck .

London, said: 'Now, there’s not a day that goes by where I don’t thank . my lucky stars for Ziah. 'He’s two-and-a-half now and every day feels like a miracle.' Miss Pereira and her partner Neil Buchanan, 26, had always planned to have a natural birth. She said: 'When I fell pregnant I was elated - I couldn’t wait to become a mum and made plans for a perfect natural birth. 'I hoped to go through labour without any painkilling drugs, but when I started feeling contractions I could tell something was wrong. 'Just as I was about to give up, a miracle happened - Ziah drew a deep breath and burst into tears. When I heard him cry it was like I was breathing again' - Nikkita Pereira . 'After 20 hours of contractions I was . still only dilated by two centimetres so my mum took me to hospital in a . taxi where I was hooked up to a monitor for observation. 'Doctors . quickly discovered that my son’s heartbeat was fading with every . contraction and before I knew it there were around 20 people in the room . talking about an emergency Caesarean. 'The umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck in the womb. Doctors had just minutes to get him out alive. Newborn Ziah was rushed to the neonatal unit where he spent the next eight days.

The spokesperson said: 'After the delivery of the baby in question on February 19, 2012, five inflation breaths were needed for resuscitation. He required oxygen.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A 23-year-old who was confined to her bed for nine years has taken her first three steps towards independence. Jessica Taylor, from Rochester in Kent, fell ill at the age of 14, after contracting a deadly virus. It attacked her immune system, leaving the teenager with Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) - a long-term disabling condition. Sufferers struggle with bouts of fatigue, as well as muscular and joint pain, poor concentration and headaches. Scroll down for video . Jessica Taylor beams as she stands for the first time in nine years. The 23-year-old was diagnosed with ME at the age of 14, and has been confined to bed ever since . Jessica, pictured left with her sister Ruby and right with brother Tom, was diagnosed with ME when she was 14 years old. The condition causes bouts of fatigue, muscle and joint pain as well as headaches . Four of the nine years Jessica has been ill, have been spent in hospital . But today the former netball captain is celebrating taking her first few steps, spending nine years building up her strength. 'I had been pushing for this moment for nine years,' she said. 'I have spent almost a decade in bed, there have been times when I couldn't move and have been fed through a tube. 'Walking was just a dream but now it's a reality. As I stood up I realised I had grown by four inches.' Despite only taking three steps, Jessica is hopeful that she will continue to improve and get her life back on track. She said: 'I've missed out on all my teenage years, that's the hardest part of having this condition. 'Shopping with friends and clubbing until the early morning is something I could only dream of doing. 'But with my latest development, I'm hopeful that one day I'll lead a normal life.' Jessica who lives with her parents, Kate, 50, and Colin, 52, and sister, Ruby, 19, was an active teenager who loved socialising with friends before she was struck down with a viral infection. She said: 'Since that moment my life has been an emotional rollercoaster for me and my family. For two years Jessica (pictured in an ambulance) had to be fed through a tube and for 18 months she was unable to speak. She was also sensitive to light and sound so had to wear sunglasses and ear protectors . Jessica (pictured in hospital) has been in bed for so long she has developed severe osteoporosis and was told she has 'the bones of a 100-year-old'. The condition means she could break her back or a hip just by sitting up . Myalgic encephalomyelitis is a chronic condition that causes persistent fatigue that is not improved by sleep or rest. Myalgic means muscle pain and encephalomyelitis means inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The . condition can cause long-term illness and disability but many sufferers . - particularly children and young people - improve over time. It is estimated to affect about 250,000 people in the UK and is more common in women than men. It usually develops in the early 20s to mid-40s but children can also be affected - usually between the ages of 13 and 15. Most cases of ME are mild or moderate but up to one in four people with the condition have severe symptoms. Aside from exhaustion, other symptoms include muscle pain, nausea, a sore throat, dizziness and sensitivity to light and sound. It . is not known what causes it but it could be linked to a viral . infection, an immune system problem, a hormone imbalance or a . psychological problem. There . is no cure but treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy . and medication to control pain and sleeping problems. Source: NHS Choices . 'It was a shock for everyone, I had gone from being an outgoing person to not being able to get out of bed. 'Everything changed, now the slightest infection can leave me fighting for my life.' Jessica has been tube fed for weeks on end after being too weak to even lift her own head. But now after being able to take a few steps unaided, Jessica's future looks bright. She said: 'I heard of many miracle stories whereby people walk again but I never thought it would happen it me. 'I'm so proud of myself and all the hard work I put in to make my dream a reality.' Jessica spent sixteen weeks in the Burrswood Centre, where staff specialise in helping those with ME. There she underwent a treatment programme including leg physio and hydrotherapy.. She said: 'It was exhausting trying to build my muscles back up. 'It was all so worthwhile when I saw the look on my parents faces when I stood up and was able to take those few steps. 'They were so happy. Now I've managed to get out of bed the key is to keep on building up my muscles so I can walk for longer.' Despite her ordeal, Jessica has always tried to help others living with ME. Recently she launched her own website, Share a Star, to help children and young adults battling illness. After leaving hospital Jessica required round-the-clock care and has a carer for 12 hours a day . Jessica, pictured with her mother, Kate, was so weak and unused to sitting up that just being in a chair causes her to feel dizzy and nauseous . Jessica said: 'I set up the charity from my bed to help those in a similiar position to myself. 'I wanted to help others feel special, it also gave me something positive to focus on.' Living with ME means Jessica's future is uncertain but she said she refuses to let it get her down. She said: 'It's amazing that I have been able to walk after nine years, hopefully things will just keep getting better from here.' Tony Britton from the ME Association said: 'This is a lovely story and we wish Jessica Taylor all the best in her recovery. 'But ME affects about 250,000 children and adults in the UK - many of whom can only hope and pray that they too will one day be able to receive the same kind of attention that she received through her stay at this private hospital. 'For vast numbers of severe sufferers, though, the reality is that they languish disbelieved and untreated because the NHS doesn't provide the care and understanding that people with this illness need to overcome its worst effects. 'They remain isolated and cut off from the rest of society because they are often too ill to leave their homes, they become bed bound and - in the worst cases - need to be fed by tube. 'Researchers are beginning get to grips with the causes of M.E., which can affect all bodily systems. The day when there are widely available treatments and perhaps even a cure can't come too soon.' Jessica (pictured on her 21st birthday with her sister, Ruby, and brother, Tom) said:  'I think my illness made my sister miss out on a lot of her childhood - the illness affects the whole family'","Jessica Taylor was diagnosed with ME at the age of 14 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Children are reaching puberty five years earlier than a century ago as obesity interrupts hormonal changes in the body, a study has found. The onset of puberty in girls was 14.6 years in 1920, compared to 10.5 in 2010, researchers have found. While in boys, sexual maturity consistently occurred around a year later than their female peers. The scientists behind the study at Plymouth University found the childhood obesity epidemic could be to blame as weight gain causes harmful changes to a child's hormone levels, allowing puberty to happen earlier. A new study has found a link between obesity and  the declining age of puberty, especially in girls . Past studies have suggested early puberty could increase a child's chance of suffering cancer and other serious health problems later in life. The team studied hormone levels in 347 schoolchildren aged five to 15 years old. They . found a child who is heavier at five tends to have lower levels of a . protein called sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and reaches puberty . sooner. The tendency was more striking in girls than boys, the team noted. The study focused on the role of SHBG, in children. SHBG binds to the sex hormones androgen and oestrogen and while levels are initially high in childhood, they decline significantly before puberty, to allow sexual maturity to happen. Researchers have suggested that hormonal disturbances associated with weight gain - combined with inflammation - could be the biological mechanism that explains the link between obesity and the declining age of puberty. Lead researcher, Professor . Jonathan Pinkney, at Plymouth . University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, said: 'There are . critical windows early in life which the die is cast for our long term . health. Scientists found hormonal changes and inflammation as a result of being overweight affect levels of a protein SHBG, causing puberty earlier . 'We . know that weight gain often begins early and we wanted to investigate . how early weight gain might be linked to earlier puberty. 'Here we have found compelling evidence that hormonal effects of . obesity, and associated inflammation, affect levels of SHBG and hence . the age when puberty commences. 'As . a higher proportion of youngsters around the world have become obese, the age of puberty dropped. We now know that the relation between . these issues is more than coincidental. 'These findings have significant implications for children’s development and public health around the world. 'Reduction . in the age of puberty, as a result of early weight gain, expedites . physical and psychosocial development at a younger age, and this . potentially means an earlier ability to reproduce as well as poorer long . term adult health. 'The observed effects on puberty are another reason to take action against childhood obesity.' The findings also open a debate about the role of the worldwide obesity epidemic in the general lowering of the age of puberty. The . World Health Organization recognises childhood obesity as one of the . most serious global health challenges for the 21st century. Figures from . the UK’s National Child Measurement Programme 2012/13 show that almost a . third of 10 to 11 year olds and more than a fifth of four to five year olds . were either obese or overweight. Worryingly, . as well as now identified as contributing to the lowering age of . puberty, obesity in childhood also increases the risk of heart disease . and diabetes in later life. The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.","Study at Plymouth University studied school children aged five to 15 years .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Nursery nurse Donna Turner has been refused the chance to have her dead husband’s baby because NHS bosses said it would make her a single parent. Mrs Turner last night told how she had been refused IVF treatment using sperm taken from her husband of only eight months. Surgeons had even reversed Paul Turner’s vasectomy as he lay dying from bowel cancer, just months after the couple married, so the sperm could be harvested and frozen to fulfil the couple’s desperate wish to have a baby. Donna Turner has been denied the chance to have her dead husband Paul's baby, after NHS bosses refused her £3,500 IVF treatment, on the grounds she is now single . Mrs Turner said NHS staff had turned her down for IVF treatment because, as a widow, she was officially single. The 32-year-old married Mr Turner, 39, in April 2012, but just eight months later he died. Having already discussed names for their unborn child, Mr Turner’s dying wish was for his wife to have it using his frozen sperm. However, just months after his death, Mrs Turner was denied the £3,500 treatment by her local NHS commissioning group. Still wearing his wedding ring on a chain around her neck, Mrs Turner said: ‘I wanted his child more than anything. I promised him on his death bed. ‘For the names, it was going to be Paignton-Louise for a girl and Tommy for a boy. Eight months after the couple married in April 2012, Mr Turner died after being diagnosed with bowel cancer. While on his deathbed, the 39-year-old asked doctors to reverse his vasectomy and harvest his sperm so his wife could undergo IVF . Local clinical commissioning groups across the UK decide whether to fund IVF on the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has a set of guidelines on treatment for fertility problems. It recommends up to three IVF cycles should be available on the NHS if: . The woman is aged between 23 and 39 at the time of treatment and: . Women aged 40-42 who have not conceived after two years of regular, unprotected sex or after 12 cycles of artificial insemination should be offered one IVF cycle if the following criteria are met: . Implementation of the guidance by CCGs varies as it is not mandatory.Additional criteria, used by some CCGs, includes: . Source: NHS Choices . ‘Then the Clinical Commissioning Group refused to fund me. They told me the policy means they can only give the treatment to couples, so because I’m a widow living on my own I’m not allowed to have the treatment. It’s crazy. I would have a husband if he hadn’t died. ‘I’m not single, I’m widowed.’ The decision has left Mrs Turner, of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, trying to save up for the treatment, but she says that could take years. ‘All I was asking them for was one little bit of help,’ she said. ‘I feel really angry because they’re letting women have boob jobs and tummy tucks on the NHS but won’t help someone like me. ‘I didn’t ask to be a widow. I would either be pregnant or have the baby by now if Paul had been here. ‘I look at pregnant people now and I think “why is that not me?” It should have been me pushing a pram now or with a bump.’ The couple met on New Year’s Day 2010, and Mr Turner proposed the following New Year’s Eve. They married in Milton Keynes in April 2012, but just five months later, Mr Turner was diagnosed with bowel cancer and, despite originally being told he could have more than 18 months to live, he died in January 2013. Mrs Turner said: ‘As he was  slipping away I held his hand and told him I loved him and I promised him I would have the child  and take them to Devon like  we planned. ‘On the last breath I saw a little tear roll down his face and then he was gone.’ Mrs Turner’s mother, Lee Payne, 56, said the experience had been incredibly difficult for  the family. She said: ‘My daughter hasn’t chosen to be in this situation. She always wanted to be a mum and have a child with the husband she loves, the man of her dreams. ‘He brought some life into our house and children loved him, he was like the Pied Piper. Nobody ever said a bad word about him. ‘When they turned her down for the IVF like that, I was so upset and angry. ‘I couldn’t help my daughter to save her husband but this is one thing I can try to do for her.’ Milton Keynes Clinical Commissioning Group associate director Janet Corbett said its policy of not commissioning IVF for single parents was in line with other CCGs in the East Midlands. Miss Corbett added: ‘The policy is for use when a couple have a medical reason for being unable to conceive a child.’ Josie Cunningham from Leeds, had a boob job on the NHS to boost her confidence . The number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £52.5million. Many . of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the . increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses. In one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life. The . former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it . emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job at the same NHS Trust . that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to . walk. She later claimed her . breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she . found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction. And . barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was . given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the . £5,000 procedure. He now . says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, . including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and . jaw reshaped. The obesity . epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of . liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in . ten years. The cost in the . most recent year will have been up to £9.6million, according to NHS . Choices which says the operation costs between £1,500 and £5,000. There . has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid . surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £19.9million. This operation is . supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision. And 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £34.1million. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not . based on strict medical needs.’ The figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail. It also showed that up to . £20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, £5.8million on . tummy tucks and £5.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have . declined over the past decade. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told a Westminster lunch: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.’ Roger . Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘There are two types of . cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort . where someone is just trying to look better. 'We . agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer . affordable on the NHS. In fact, it is amazing it was ever considered . affordable at all.’","Eight months after Donna and Paul Turner married, he died of bowel cancer .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A mother diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant and her daughter born with life-threatening heart defects have both survived - despite the medical odds stacked against them. Riki Graves was eight weeks pregnant, when on her 38th birthday, doctors told her a lump she had found in her breast was cancerous. Reeling from her diagnosis, the mother-of-two was dealt a devastating blow at her 20-week scan - her daughter would be born with a heart defect. Doctors warned Mrs Graves and her husband Chris their unborn child might not even survive pregnancy. When Riki Graves was eight weeks pregnant, doctors dealt her the devastating diagnosis - a lump she had found in her breast was cancerous. Then at her 20-week scan the 38-year-old was told her unborn daughter Juliana had serious heart defects and might not survive the pregnancy . But on April 9 Juliana, left with her mother and right, now,  was delivered by C-section at hospital in Texas . Immediately doctors whisked the newborn off to examine her, but told Mrs Graves and her husband Chris, that their daughter's heart was too malformed and weak to withstand the operation she needed. Juliana was placed on the heart transplant list when she was just days old . But on April 9, a month before her due date, tiny Juliana was delivered by C-section. Recalling the moment she learned of her daughter's condition, Mrs Graves told abc.com she was sobbing so hard she could barely make it home. As soon as she heard her daughter's heartbeat, the 38-year-old knew there was something wrong. Instead of hearing a strong beat, as she had with her first child, Juliana's heartbeat sounded 'squishy'. She said: 'She was safe as long as she was inside me because my heart could pump for her, but her heart was getting worse and worse.' Mrs Graves was told as soon as her daughter was born, surgeons would have to whisk the newborn off to the operating theatre. Meanwhile the 38-year-old was set to undergo radiation therapy, following a lumpectomy while she was pregnant. But when Juliana arrived, specialist Dr William Dreyer who co-ordinates cardiac transplants at Texas Children's Hospital, examined the newborn, only to conclude her heart was inoperable, having been too malformed and weak to withstand the surgery. The couple kept hoping for a new heart, but doctors had warned them it was unlikely a suitable organ would be found in time. On April 26, five days after Juliana joined the transplant list, her father Chris received a phone call at 4.30am - an organ had been found . Mrs Graves added: 'That was basically him telling you your baby’s not going to survive in a nice way. 'We were devastated' Juliana was added to the heart transplant waiting list on April 21. But medics were realistic, telling Mrs Graves it was unlikely a new heart would be found in time to save her new daughter. 'There were days when I just sat down and cried by her bedside,' Mrs Graves said. 'We didn’t think we were going to get a heart. I would just tell her to fight for us and be strong. We were doing everything we can and that we loved her.' At 4.30am on April 26, Mrs Graves's husband's phone rang - there daughter was getting her heart. 'I was floored,' she added.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Surgeons have designed a new operation which they hope could prevent the development of arthritis and extend sporting careers. The procedure, which is currently being trialled at Southampton General Hospital, involves coating damaged cartilage with stem cells, taken from a patient’s own hip, and surgical glue. If successful, it will regenerate the remaining tissue and create a permanent 'like-for-like' replacement for the first time. Surgeons at University Hospital Southampton have pioneered a new operation to treat knee injuries, which they hope will extend sporting careers. Argentinian striker Luis Suarez had an operation to remove his damaged meniscus, part of the cartilage in the knee, prior to the World Cup . Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue . that covers the surface of joints and enables bones to slide over one . another while reducing friction and acting as a shock absorber. Damage to the tissue in the knee is common and occurs mainly following sudden twists or direct blows, such as falls or heavy tackles playing sports such as football and rugby, but can also develop over time through gradual wear and tear. Around 10,000 people a year in the UK suffer cartilage damage serious enough to require treatment due to pain, 'locking' and reduced flexibility. If left untreated, it can progress to arthritis and severely impair leg movement. Argentinian footballer Luis Suarez had an operation to remove damaged meniscus, a type of cartilage, from his left knee. Patients who undergo the Abicus operation first have the cartilage cut and tidied and undergo a technique called microfracture. This involves trimming any remaining damaged tissue and drilling holes in the bone beneath the defect via keyhole surgery. The cartilage tissue is then coated with a substance made up of bone marrow cells, platelet gel and hyaluronic acid. During . the 30-minute procedure, the bone marrow sample is spun in a centrifuge . in the operating theatre to give a concentrated amount of the patient’s . own stem cells. These . cells are then mixed with the gel and acid to create a 'glue' substance . which is placed over the cartilage defect and allowed to set. The . controversial Liverpool striker, 27, felt pain in his knee during . training with his international squad in Montevideo in May. Other . sports stars known to have suffered knee injuries include rugby player . Jonny Wilkinson, as well as footballers Paul Gascoigne, Alan Shearer and . Ronaldo. The new surgical technique is known as Abicus  - Autologous Bone Marrow Implantation of Cells University Hospital Southampton. Gorav Datta, a consultant orthopaedic . surgeon at Southampton General Hospital and lead researcher, said: 'The development of this technique and the study we . are conducting could revolutionise the treatment of common cartilage . injury by creating a like-for-like, identical cartilage replacement for . the first time. 'So far, . treatments developed to combat the long-term problems associated with . cartilage damage have had varied outcomes, resulting in knee pain for . many people in older age and shortened careers for many amateur and . professional sports players.' Mr Datta added: 'At present, although . the removal of damaged cartilage and microfracture surgery can provide a . short-term solution, the chances, particularly for sports players, of . developing arthritis in later life or requiring ongoing treatment remain . high.' Currently, the most commonly used . procedure to repair the injury - microfracture - involves trimming any . remaining damaged tissue and drilling holes in the bone beneath the . defect via keyhole surgery to promote bleeding and scar tissue to work . as a substitute. The procedure involves involves coating damaged cartilage with stem cells, taken from a patient's own hip. If successful it will then regenerate creating a permanent replacement. Right, shows an image of inflamed cartilage in a knee joint . However, . the technique has variable results, with studies in the U.S. suggesting . the procedure offers only a short term benefit (the first 24 months . after surgery), and does not lead to the formation of new cartilage. Patients who undergo the Abicus operation have the cartilage cut and tidied and undergo microfracture, but their cartilage tissue is then coated with a substance made up of bone marrow cells, platelet gel and hyaluronic acid. During the 30-minute procedure, the bone marrow sample is spun in a centrifuge in the operating theatre to give a concentrated amount of the patient’s own stem cells. These cells are then mixed with the gel and acid to create a 'glue' substance which is placed over the cartilage defect and allowed to set. The study at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust will compare the results of 40 patients aged between 18 and 65 years, half of whom will undergo Abicus and half microfracture alone.","Surgeons at the University Hospital Southampton have designed the new procedure to coat damaged cartilage with stem cells taken from the hip .

"By . Lizzie Parry . When Lisa Reid was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, doctors warned she may never be able to have another child. The mother-of-one was told she had a rare form of the disease leaving medics no option but to remove her right ovary and fallopian tube. Specialists warned the procedure would affect the 29-year-old's fertility, making it unlikely she would ever have a sibling for her six-year-old son Jack. But a year on and Miss Reid and her fiance Thomas Duffy were delighted when they discovered she was expecting another baby. When Lisa Reid was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer, doctors warned her she would be unlikely to conceive another child, a sibling for her six-year-old son Jack. But a year on and Miss Reid and her fiance Thomas Duffy are delighted she is nine weeks pregnant . She is nine weeks pregnant and next month will tie the knot with Mr Duffy, 28, an accountant. Miss Reid, from Westerhope in Newcastle, said: 'My life is so much better and I’m completely content and happy. 'It’s strange to think that this time last year I had been diagnosed with cancer, it feels like it didn’t happen to me and it’s someone else who had it. 'I’m living life to the full and feel very lucky at how things are now.' The mother-of-one’s ordeal began last July when she started to suffer crippling stomach pains and huge swelling to her abdomen. Her condition became so serious she struggled to fit behind the steering wheel of her car, as her stomach bloated. Doctors initially put Miss Reid's condition down to a gastric bug, hernia or gall stones. But tests and scans revealed she had a 20cm Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour growing on one of her ovaries. The medical team caring for her, told the mother-of-one she would have to undergo a three-hour operation to remove the cancer, followed by nine weeks of intense chemotherapy. The 29-year-old had an ovary and fallopian tube removed to treat her cancer, and was given the 'all clear' in December. She is set to marry her fiance next month and said they are 'delighted' to be looking forward to welcoming their new arrival . Each year around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK. Of those cases, it is estimated less than 0.5 per cent are the type of tumour that Miss Reid was diagnosed with. She said: 'It turned my life upside down. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours are so rare that there is little known about this form of cancer. Each . year, around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK, . and it is estimated that less than 0.5 per cent of these are . Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour (SLCT). The cancer is a rare ovarian tumour that belongs to the group of sex-cord stromal tumours. Most . are confined to the ovaries and usually develop in younger women . affecting those under the age of 30, however, the cancer is known to . develop in all ages. Treatment for SLCT usually involves surgery to remove the affected ovary. It is estimated that as high as 75 per cent of tumours are detected early and tend to develop in only one ovary. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be required following an operation to remove the tumour. It . is believed that SLCT has similar symptoms to that of ovarian cancer, . these include increased abdominal size; persistent pelvic and abdominal . pain; feeling full quickly and feeling nauseous. 'I . felt totally shocked by the diagnosis and it knocked me back like a . giant wave, but I dealt with it better than I thought I would.' Doctors feared the cancer may have spread, warning her they may have to perform a hysterectomy, and even remove part of her bowel to ensure the cancer was contained. But fortunately the drastic step was not necessary, but Miss Reid was still advised her chances of conceiving another child were significantly reduced. She said: 'At the time the thought of having a hysterectomy did not bother me as I was so focused on being ill that I didn’t care, but I would be devastated now if I had needed a hysterectomy. 'With having only one ovary it was expected that it would be difficult for me to have any more children and chemotherapy also affects the menstrual cycle so my chances of having another child were low. 'I’m so excited and happy to be pregnant and getting married. I’m looking to the future and everything I have ever wanted I have got now.' Miss Reid is regularly monitored by experts to check that the cancer has not returned. On her birthday in December she was given the 'all clear'. 'I feel really lucky that I’ve had so much support from those around me,' she said. 'I feel like the old me again, only with a different outlook on life.' At the weekend Miss Reid took part in Newcastle’s Cancer Research UK Race for Life for the first time with her mother, who has done it in for seven years in memory of her mother who died of lung cancer aged 67 and her best friend who died of skin cancer aged 42.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A pregnant mother is set to become the youngest woman in Britain to give birth to two sets of twins - aged just 21. Annie Gladstone had her first pair four years ago and will now make the record books after falling pregnant with another set. Miss Gladstone and fiance Rich Porter, 26, conceived naturally but said they cannot understand their fertility as neither of their families has a history of twins. The full-time mother, who turns 22 at the end of September, will become the youngest woman in Britain to have two sets of twins when they arrive on or around September 11. Pregnant Annie Gladstone is set to become the youngest in the UK to have two sets of twins when she gives birth to two baby girls in September. She is already mother to four-year-old twins Lillie and Jayden . After discovering she was pregnant in January, Miss Gladstone and her fiance Rich Porter were told at their 12-week scan that they were expecting twins again . Royal College of Midwives says it has not heard of anyone in the UK having two sets of twins at such an early age. Miss Gladstone said: 'When the nurse told us we were shocked. You could have heard a pin drop. 'It took about a minute for me to begin breathing, and Rich’s face went so pale. 'But after the initial shock, of course we are delighted. We’ve been told we’re having girls, so Rich and Jayden are definitely about to get very outnumbered at home. 'They say your second baby is easier to cope with than your first, but since our first and second came at the same time, we’re hoping babies three and four are a breeze. 'As far as I know, I’m the youngest mum in Britain to have two sets of twins. I’m delighted.' Miss Gladstone said she always wanted another baby after Lillie and Jayden were born in April 2011 so was delighted when she realised in January she was pregnant again. But the couple's joy turned to shock when they were told at their 12-week scan that they were expecting two new arrivals. The couple said they were shocked to discover they were expecting twins again, as neither family has a history of twins . When the new arrivals - both girls - arrive on or around September 11, Miss Gladstone said her husband-to-be and son Jayden will be well and truly outnumbered . The couple, from Farnborough, say neither of them are from big families, and neither family has a history of twins. Miss Gladstone has an older brother and a younger sister, while Mr Porter, who works as a warehouse manager, has an older sister. She said: 'Obviously when I fell pregnant at 17 we weren’t using fertility treatment, and I wasn’t this time either. I always wanted kids. We both did. 'It was a right shock when we were told Annie was carrying twins. My face dropped' - Rich Porter . 'But we never wanted a big family. Last year I said to Rich that I wanted another baby, and then we’d stop. I guess good things come in twos.' But her second pregnancy is taking its toll on Miss Gladstone. She is suffering from chronic SPD - Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction - pelvic pain caused by the stress carrying to babies. For the last part of her pregnancy, the 21-year-old will be forced to use crutches to get around. She said: 'SPD is horrible. I’m in constant pain and it’s making looking after Jayden and Lillie so much harder. 'But it should go away once the babies are born, so I’ll have them to tire me out instead.' Her husband-to-be, said: 'It was a right shock when we were told Annie was carrying twins. My face dropped. 'At first, the doctor said they might be triplets, but thankfully that didn’t turn out to be the case. As long as they are healthy, that’s all that matters.

'I’ll always work as much and as hard as I can to support my family - I can’t understand why other fathers wouldn’t. 'I’m excited. I just hope we don’t have any more.' Jacque Gerrard, director for England at the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'I have been a midwife for over 30 years and have never seen someone at such a young age have two sets of twins in succession like this. 'As a mother of twins myself I know what she is going through and I wish her well in her pregnancy. 'Women having twins and multiple births are monitored closely throughout the pregnancy particularly when it is a teenage pregnancy. 'The experience gained with her first set of twins will be helpful when she gives birth second time round. 'The important point is that she gets the right levels of support from the midwives and local maternity services throughout the pregnancy and also postnatally along with support from her partner and family. 'Midwives are very skilled at supporting women with multiple pregnancy but do so in partnership with obstetricians.'","Annie Gladstone and fiance Rich Porter have no family history of twins .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new mother today faces an anxious wait to discover if the cancer which ravaged her body during pregnancy has passed to her son in the womb. On Thursday Dani Maloney's six-month-old son Jayden will have tests at Birmingham Children's Hospital to discover if he has the disease. His 26-year-old mother has been given just weeks to live, after being diagnosed with skin cancer after giving birth to her son. In extremely rare cases it is possible for leukaemia and melanoma cancer cells to pass from mother to her unborn child . Mother-of-two Dani Maloney, 26, today faces an anxious wait to discover if the skin cancer which ravaged her body while pregnant was passed to her son Jayden . In 2009 British scientists identified the first case in Japan, where a mother was diagnosed with leukaemia after giving birth. Eleven months later her daughter was diagnosed with the same disease and subsequent genetic tests revealed the baby girl had cancer cells at birth, and that they were passed from her mother. Miss Maloney urged people who suspect they might have skin cancer to seek medical help. She said: 'I want people to know how important it is to have any mole or skin blemish they’re concerned about checked-out. 'And don’t be afraid to challenge doctors, don’t be afraid to ask for a second opinion, and a third.' The mother-of-two has started to compile memory boxes for Jayden and his older sister Amina, three. Miss Maloney insists she raised her concerns with doctors last year, having spotted an mole growing in size on her leg. She claims doctors told her it was due to skin pigmentation changes that are common during pregnancy. While pregnant, Miss Maloney claims she raised her concerns over a mole growing abnormally on her leg, pictured. But she claims doctors told her it was skin pigmentation, which is common during pregnancy. Hospital bosses said Miss Maloney was sent letters referring her to a skin specialist in November but failed to attend appointments in December and January . Although extremely rare it is possible for cancer cells to pass from mother to unborn child, studies have shown. On Thursday, Jayden now six months old, right and left with his sister Amina, three, will undergo tests at Birmingham Children's Hospital to establish if he has the disease which is killing his mother . Birmingham's City Hospital said they sent out letters referring Miss Maloney to a skin specialist in November. But the 26-year-old claims she was living temporarily at an address in Aston, and never received the letters. 'It upsets me because I won't see my kids grow up. I won't be there on that first day of school. I won't be playing games with them at birthday parties' - Dani Maloney . After giving birth to Jayden on January 14, a nurse at City Hospital cleaned and dressed a wound on Miss Maloney's leg. But by that time the cancer was already spreading through her body. She was referred to Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope Hospital six weeks ago gasping for breath, with suspected pneumonia. Doctors admitted Miss Maloney to intensive care as her condition worsened. A week ago she returned home after doctors dealt the devastating blow that she has less than two months to live. 'I didn’t take it well, I didn’t take it well at all,' she said. '""Why me?"" I ask that all the time.' Miss Maloney is now confined to her home, having been told her skin cannot be exposed to sunlight. Miss Maloney, pictured with Jayden, her daughter Amina and her sister Tara, has been given just two months to live after she was rushed to hospital six weeks ago with suspected pneumonia. There doctors diagnosed her with skin cancer . Pregnant women can transmit cancer to their unborn babies, though it is extremely rare. In 2009 British scientists discovered a mother with leukaemia passed the blood disease to her daughter in the womb. Normally a child's immune system would recognise and destroy any invasive cancer cells. There are known to be only a handful of cases of mothers and babies sharing the same cancer. Of the 30 past cases in 2009, most were leukaemia or melanoma - the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Professor Mel Greaves, who led the study at the Institute of Cancer Resarch said the risks to an unborn baby is extremely low. They investigated a case in Japan in which a 28-year-old was diagnosed with leukaemia shortly after she gave birth. Eleven months later her daughter was also diagnosed with the disease. The child was in remission in 2009, having had treatment for a year-and-a-half. Genetic tests revealed the child had cancer cells at birth, and that they came from her mother. Closer investigation revealed the child's leukaemia cells were missing a vital piece of DNA, which would have flagged them up as 'intruders' to her immune system. Without this her system was unable to target and destroy the cancer cells, allowing the disease to develop. The researchers said the same mutation could allow melanoma cancer cells to pass from mother to baby. But they believe it is unlikely other cancers can be passed on this way. She said her days are spent crafting items for her children's memory boxes and planning her own funeral as well as her children's christenings. She said: 'I'll wear a pink tracksuit, pink trainers and a Birmingham City top and I want the club crest on my coffin. 'I want colour - I don't want black. 'It upsets me because I won’t see my kids grow up. I won’t be there on that first day at school. 'I won’t be playing games with them at birthday parties. 'I want them to remember me, to be happy, to do well, to go to university. 'I want them to make me proud.' Macmillan nurses are helping the mother-of-two place pictures, letters, videos and arm bands in her children's memory boxes. 'The notes say I love them and I will always be there for them. 'I’ve told them never to forget me,' she said. Miss Maloney's aunt Tina Adams, 48, said: 'My neice went into hospital with a chest infection. Then we were told it was terminal skin cancer. Every single day brings worse news. 'She was a typical dizzy 26-year-old, but yesterday Dani told me she looked in the mirror and the person looking back wasn’t her. 'That broke my heart. Dani should not be dying.' Dr Roger Stedman, Medical Director at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear about Dani’s situation and wholeheartedly back her call for anyone who has concerns about a suspicious mole or skin blemish to seek advice at the earliest opportunity. 'As part of her antenatal care a rapid access referral was made in November for Dani to see a specialist at our skin centre in December and January, but unfortunately she failed to attend on both occasions and her GP was informed.'","Dani Maloney was diagnosed with skin cancer after giving birth to her son .

"By . Lizzie Parry . She fell victim to a silent illness, an eating disorder which took her to the brink of death. Ally Stableford was so weak she could no longer walk, too exhausted through malnutrition. Yet when the size eight teenager looked into the mirror all she saw was a 'fat' person staring back - a creation of her imagination, warped by anorexia. Now 26, the mental health student has beaten the devastating illness, standing defiantly, a healthy size 10. Scroll down for video . Ally Stableford, now 26, has beaten anorexia after battling the illness since she was nine years old. She was so thin at one point (left) she could barely walk . For Miss Stableford, the turning point came when she was admitted to hospital twice, so malnourished doctors feared she was on the brink of succumbing to the eating disorder. At nine years old anorexia reared its ugly head, slowly taking a hold over Miss Stableford's life. She was embarrassed to eat in front of friends and started to skip meals. Years later, in 2007 when Miss Stableford left home bound for university, the illness which had lurked in the background for more than a decade took hold. In four months she lost three stone, leaving her only able to wear children's clothes and struggling to walk to lectures. Her condition was so severe doctors admitted her to hospital, concerned the illness might claim her life. Miss Stableford, who had to drop out of her first degree, said: 'I had covered the mirror up in my room because when I looked at myself I just saw a fat person looking back at me.' The mental health student, who is now a healthy size 10, said her wake up call came when studying for her first degree, which she had to abandon, she became so weak she was unable to walk. She was then hospitalised twice as doctors feared she was on the brink of death . 'In . hospital I started on food supplement drinks to build up to eating . solid foods again as I had been surviving off soup for over two months. 'I remember having to eat my first meal which was Weetabix and I was physically shaking because I was so scared to eat it. 'I also had to be weaned back into looking at myself in the mirror because I was so scared of the reflection I would see. Miss Stableford first noticed she had problems with food when she was at primary school. She was too embarrassed to eat her lunch in front of her class mates and when teachers told her parents they became worried and tried to make sure she ate. Miss Stableford said: 'I was really self-conscious eating in front of people so I stopped eating my dinner at school. 'I started to miss breakfast and try my best to eat as little as I could for my tea. 'When the school told my mum and dad they would literally sit and watch me eat my tea to make sure I was having it. When Ally Stableford looked in the mirror, the size eight student saw a 'fat person' staring back, a figment of her imagination warped by her illness . 'I kept the disorder at bay for a while but by high school I was counting calories again. 'I associated confidence and popularity with being thin and even though I was already a size 8-10 I just thought that if I was thinner I would be more confident.' The now 26-year-old, from Leyland in . Lancashire, was unable to walk to university because she was so weak, . and so turned to a university counsellor for help. She was admitted to the eating disorder unit at Cheadle Royal Hospital and began the gruelling process of learning to eat again. Miss Stableford, said: 'When I struggled to walk into university to go to a lecture I knew I needed help. 'I was absolutely petrified because I knew it would mean having to face up to everything that I had been doing. It was when Miss Stableford moved away from home in 2007 to start her first year of university that her illness took over. She was eating so few calories her body muscle was wasting away leaving her unable to walk to lectures. 'I . just fell into a dark hole of self-destruction,' she said, now in her . third year at the University of Central Lancashire studying mental . health. 'When my mum and dad would come and visit me they would do a food shop for me and I would just throw it out once they had left. 'I became really isolated because I would avoid going anywhere or be around anyone who was eating food. 'If . the students in my dorm were cooking I would just shut myself in my . room because the thought of the food they were eating would just repulse . me.' At 19, Miss . Stableford was dressing in children’s clothes and her destructive food . routine became so bad her body was unable to keep itself warm. Her . body started to sprout Lanugo hair, a soft, fine white hair that grows . mainly on the arms and chest of anorexic sufferers approaching . emaciation, to try and insulate itself. She said: 'I was constantly freezing and my lips would actually turn blue. 'I’d also have bruises all over my body because my body was so weak and I would faint quite a lot. 'My thoughts weren’t my own anymore and were just taken over by the constant battle to lose weight.' Miss Stableford was in hospital for nine months and was readmitted a year later after falling back into her old eating habits. She . managed to put two stone back on in hospital and has since gained more . weight, determined not to slip back into her destructive routine. But after two stays in hospital the now 26-year-old has beaten the illness, and enjoys indulging in a range of different foods, especially an Indian takeaway . She said: 'I am no longer scared of food and actually enjoy eating it, especially a good Indian meal. 'I still have some body image issues but I have a good friend and family network around me and my confidence has grown a lot. 'Anorexia is such a secretive illness so the best thing you can do is talk to someone and reach out for help sooner rather than later.' Anorexia is a compulsive mental illness which makes the sufferer obsessed with losing weight or staying thin. Often sufferers have a distorted view of their body and think they’re heavier than they are causing physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms. The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence suggest that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and 46 per cent recover fully.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A year ago Amy Howarth was given just six months to live. Last April doctors told the then 19-year-old her clumsiness was more sinister, diagnosing her with a brain tumour. The cancerous mass had attached itself to the major nerves, leaving medics to conclude Miss Howarth had just months to live. But the brave 20-year-old has fought to survive, and is 'enjoying every single day'. A year ago Amy Howarth, 20, pictured left before diagnosis and right, now, was given just six months to live after doctors diagnosed her with an aggressive brain tumour. The then 19-year-old had put her symptoms down to clumsiness, never suspecting it was anything more sinister . Miss Howarth, from Nottingham, now aims to make it to her 21st birthday in September. She said: 'When this happened my whole world came crashing down. 'I was independent and everything but now I know I could go at any time. 'Now I don’t take anything for granted - I live for today and if I’m still here tomorrow, that’s a bonus.' Miss Howarth was diagnosed with the tumour in April 2013. She said: 'It all happened so fast. Just before my diagnosis, I was in the kitchen and dropped my purse and just couldn’t pick it up. 'Then I kept walking into doors but I just didn’t think anything of it. 'I thought I was just being clumsy but my mum said I had to go to the doctor.' She has faced intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy but while extending her life, it has drained her energy and she has ballooned from a size 10 to a size 28. From the time of her diagnosis last . April to last July, she had gained nine stone - the result of steroids . she was taking as part of her treatment. 'You do get the odd person that stops and stares but I just stare back at them,' she said.

Miss Howarth, pictured right, with her mother Jo on her 16th birthday . 'If they’ve got a problem why don’t they just come and ask instead of staring at my wheelchair?' Miss Howarth can no longer go out on her own, but thanks to Rainbow Hospice in Loughborough, Leicestershire, she can go shopping and walk her six-month old British bulldog, Roxy. She said: 'The staff really keep me going. 'They mean I’m still independent there and that’s vital to me. They are not just workers to me, they’re so much more.' Her mother Jo, 53, also praised Rainbow for the help they give her daughter. She said: 'When we got the diagnosis it really hit us for six. 'She’s been fighting and fighting and we keep setting her goals and we really want her to see her 21st birthday. 'Ever since the diagnosis we’ve tried to keep her active and Rainbows has really helped.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . A six-year-old has been dubbed 'catgirl' after a rare skin disease left her with soft . black fur covering her back. Zhao Xinrui's parents noticed a small patch of discoloured skin on her back about a year ago. As the condition progressed, her horrified mother abandoned her daughter and husband, fleeing the village of Changshan near Luzhou City in southwest China's Sichuan province. Zhao's grandmother, Zhao Henghui, said: 'Doctors told us it was just a birthmark - even when it started spreading - but now it covers half her body.' Zhao Xinrui's parents first noticed a small patch of discoloured skin on their daughter's back around a year ago. Since then soft black fur has grown to cover her entire back and is starting the cover her arms and face . In order to make sure Zhao Xinrui was admitted to the family's local kindergarten, teachers told the other children she had a mole. But she now requires urgent treatment to remove the hair, which covers her entire back and is starting to grow on her arms and face. 'The poor girl - it breaks our hearts to see her suffer like this,' said her father Zhao Lai, 45. He said his wife had abandoned him and his daughter and that he was trying to look after her together with his parents. The three of them had been trying to raise money to pay for treatment.

'Despite the fact that we saved ever since we heard she would need it.' In an interview with local TV, the youngster said her biggest ambition was to be cured so that she could wear summer clothes and even a swimming costume like her pals. The media coverage has inspired some members of the public to donate money and it is now hoped the youngster will be able to get the operation she needs.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new study has found eating probiotics could help lower blood pressure, protecting against heart disease and stroke . Eating probiotics regularly could help lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. The live micro-organisms naturally occur in the gut but are also commonly found in yoghurt and dietary supplements. Researchers at the Griffith Health Institute and School of Medicine in Australia examined data from nine trials involving more than 540 participants. They found consuming the live bacteria lowered people's blood pressure levels - particularly in those with higher readings. Probiotics with multiple species of bacteria also worked better than those containing a single type of bacterium. Lead author Dr Jing Sun, said: 'The small collection of studies we looked at suggest . regular consumption of probiotics can be part of a healthy lifestyle to . help reduce high blood pressure, as well as maintain healthy blood . pressure levels. 'This includes probiotics in yoghurt, fermented and sour milk and cheese, and probiotic supplements.' Despite the benefits identified in consuming probiotics, the study found taking the supplements for less than eight weeks did not affect blood pressure. Dr Sun added: 'We believe . probiotics might help lower blood pressure by having other positive . effects on health, including improving cholesterol, reducing blood glucose and insulin . resistance; and by helping to regulate the hormone system that regulates . blood pressure and fluid balance. 'The studies looking at probiotics and blood pressure tend to be small. 'Moreover, . two studies had a short duration of three to four weeks of probiotic . consumption, which might have affected the overall results of the . analysis.' She said . additional studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend . probiotics for high blood pressure control and prevention. The study was published in the journal Hypertension. Commenting on the research, Victoria Taylor, Senior Dietitian at . the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Having high blood pressure puts you . at greater risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attack and . stroke, so it’s vital we do all we can to keep our levels in check. 'While . this is an interesting review of the research in this area, it’s too . soon to start recommending probiotics for lowering blood pressure. 'With . only a handful of studies involving a limited number of participants and . conducted for only short periods, we need more research to confirm the . findings seen here. 'In the . meantime, there are a number of well-established lifestyle changes . that we can make to keep our blood pressure healthy. 'Eating less salt, . more fruit and vegetables and being physically active and maintaining a . healthy body weight are all tried and tested ways to do this.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . Nicola Woolley lost 11st following gastric bypass surgery. But she was left with unsightly folds of excess skin around her tummy and waist . A morbidly obese grandmother who shed 11 stone has been awarded a six-figure settlement after botched surgery to remove unsightly folds of excess skin left her in agonising pain. Nicola Woolley was warned she would not live to see her grandchildren grow up, after ballooning to 26st. The 45-year-old was delighted to drop eight dress sizes. But following her gastric bypass, the community care worker was left with mounds of sagging skin around her abdomen and waist. The NHS agreed to a further operation to remove the excess skin. But Mrs Woolley's delight soon turned to despair, when surgeons removed too much skin causing an infection to ravage her body leaving her in constant pain. The grandmother-of-four, from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, said: 'I decided to start losing weight as I knew that my health was starting to suffer and it was important to me to see my grandchildren grow up. 'I underwent the surgery on the advice of my doctor and was living a healthy lifestyle. 'But when you lose a lot of weight you end up with a lot of excess skin, so I was put forward for an operation to remove it. 'I was told the procedure was simple and never imagined anything could go wrong - never mind be left in constant agony with horrific scars. 'My main motivation throughout this whole ordeal was the thought of being able to play with my grandchildren. 'But I'm now in a situation which is even worse than before. It’s a living nightmare. 'I feel embarrassed by my body, I look horrendous and the scarring is beyond what I could have imagined in my worst nightmares. 'However the worst part is the pain. I can’t stand or sit down without extreme pain so playing with my . grandchildren is impossible. 'Doctors . have told me there is nothing they can do to help me so I am going to . have to suffer with this for the rest of my life. I’m devastated.' Mrs Woolley has since received a six-figure pay out from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. She was admitted to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in August 2007 for a gastric bypass operation, having reached 26st. It was a success, allowing the community care worker to shed 15st. But in January 2009, plagued by the unsightly skin left in the wake of the weight-loss surgery, doctors advised Mrs Woolley she would need a lower body lift and tummy tuck. She went into the operating theatre on August 18, 2009. Following surgery to remove the excess skin, Mrs Woolley suffered an infection which caused severe blisters and chronic agonising pain . Twelve operations later and Mrs Woolley said she is still suffering agonising pain in her buttocks and lower back, causing her difficulty standing or sitting. Doctors have said there is nothing more they can do for the grandmother-of-four . But after waking up and findings severe blisters and deeply bruised . skin on her behind, she was immediately concerned. Days . after the procedure, she began to feel worse and was diagnosed with . epidermolysis - a skin condition which results in serious blistering of . the skin. Despite her . condition failing to improve, she was discharged ten days later, only to be readmitted the next day after her wounds began to ooze and . her temperature soared. Mrs Woolley was taken into surgery and underwent two operations to remove ‘undermined areas’ from the first procedure - consisting of two huge sections of dead tissue from her buttocks. But this failed to solve . the problem - leading to a further nine operations including multiple skin . grafts, fluid drainage and tummy tucks. Mrs Woolley was warned she would not live to see her grandchildren grow up after ballooning to 26st, pictured . Twelve operations later and Mrs Woolley . said she is still suffering agonising pain in her buttocks and lower . back, causing her difficulty standing or sitting. She said: 'I thought I was doing the right thing by losing the weight as I wanted to be healthier so I could play with my grandchildren. 'But now I am in a much worse situation than before. 'The doctors had scheduled in future operations for the removal of excess skin on my arms and thighs, but I just can’t have any more surgery as I am worried about the consequences.' Mrs Woolley instructed law firm Slater & Gordon to launch legal action against Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. She said: 'My life has been turned upside down since the operation. There are so many things I used to take for granted that I simply can’t do anymore. 'The settlement will allow me to make alterations to my house and prepare for a future with the horrendous injuries I will now have to live with for the rest of my life.' Iona Meeres-Young, clinical negligence lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'Nicola will be in lifelong pain. 'This compensation will allow her to fund a comprehensive and coordinated program of pain management and psychological support.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new Australian study has found mixing alcohol with energy drinks increased revellers' appetite to binge drink . Mixing energy drinks with alcohol increases a person's urge to down more booze, leaving them at risk of assault, serious injury and one night stands, experts have today warned. A new study has examined the effects of mixing high-caffeine soft drinks with vodka. And the findings show revellers' appetite for alcohol was boosted when compared to other soft drink mixers. Australian scientists said the increased desire to binge drink leaves people at risk of dangerous levels of intoxication, which may leave them susceptible to alcohol-related injuries, attacks and one night stands. The research found those who drank caffeinated cocktails had a 'stronger desire to keep drinking than if they drank alcohol on its own'. It noted the effect was noticeable even when the mix of energy drink and a spirit was diluted with fruit juice. But the experts warned there may be added cause for concern because the restrictions on volunteers drinking in experiments mean the problem could be much worse out of the lab in pubs and clubs. Psychologist Peter Miller, associate professor of psychology at Deakin University in Melbourne said: 'A greater urge to drink has substantial implications when we think about the nature of drinking episodes. 'As people become intoxicated, even at low levels, they show less inhibitions and are likely to drink more in a cycle of greater intoxication. 'Of course, the drunker you get, the more likely you are to get injured, be a victim or perpetrator of an assault, or even drive home while drunk, let alone making bad choices about the people you associate with and possible sexual behaviour.' The study saw 46 women and 29 men drink either a cocktail containing 60 ml of vodka and a market-leading energy drink or the same measure with soda water instead. Both cocktails were mixed with 200 ml of a fruit drink in the random experiment that compared their urges before and afterwards with questionnaires and a breath alcohol concentration (BAC) test. Co-leader of the study Rebecca McKetin, a fellow at the Australian National University's Centre for Research on Ageing, Health and Well-being, said: 'We found that when people drink alcohol and energy drinks that they have a stronger desire to keep drinking than if they drank alcohol on its own. 'This would mean that someone who drinks alcohol and energy drinks would want to keep drinking more than their friends who don't.' Their results are published in the online journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. She added: 'What we can't say is whether this translates into people drinking more. 'Obviously . other factors would play a role there - people can over-ride their . desires and many things play into a decision about whether someone would . keep drinking or not. 'However, . if it did translate into greater alcohol consumption, we would expect . to see people who drink alcohol and energy drinks drinking more than . their peers who don't.' The study comes after other similar research indicated a link between energy cocktails to binge drinking in young people. The researchers warned cocktails containing energy drinks could leave people more susceptible to attacks, serious injury and one night stands, by encouraging their appetite for alcohol and resulting in dangerous levels of intoxication. File picture . Ms McKetin said: 'A number of studies show that young adults who mix alcohol with energy drinks have higher levels of alcohol consumption than their peers who don't mix energy drinks with alcohol, and some studies suggest that this practice increases the risk of binge drinking. 'However, it may simply be the case that people who drink more often are more likely to drink alcohol and energy drinks among other things. 'Yet if it is the case that energy drinks increase binge drinking, the popularity of alcohol and energy drinks could exacerbate alcohol-related harms among young people, particularly harms related to intoxication, such as car accidents and injuries from fights or falls.' 'As people become intoxicated, even at . low levels, they show less inhibitions and are likely to drink more in a . cycle of greater intoxication' - Psychologist Peter Miller . Other research conducted in Australia indicated that the risk of harm increased generally when people were drinking energy drinks. The scientists referred to Lithuania, where laws have been introduced banning the sale of energy drinks to under-18s. They called for governments to do more in creating policy that helps to avoid the potential bad effects of widespread over-consumption of the energy drink cocktails. They also warned that their study was not a true reflection of the impact binge drinking had outside the laboratory due to regulations. Professor Miller said: '[It's] worth noting that the very low levels of alcohol and energy drinks used in these types of experiments are due to the restraints of ethics committees, yet people are using far more than this on average out on the street. 'This difference between what is acceptable in a strictly controlled and monitored experiment versus unregulated pubs and clubs tells us about the worrying degree to which unsafe behaviour is occurring and the need for regulators to act.' Gavin Partington, British Soft Drinks Association director general, said: 'The authors acknowledge that this study does not establish a link between energy drink consumption and increased alcohol consumption. 'However, anybody drinking alcohol should do so in moderation, whether or not it’s mixed with an energy drink.'","Study found revellers' appetite for alcohol was boosted when they mixed energy drinks with vodka, compared with soft drinks .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Food supplements which trick the body into thinking the stomach is full could combat Britain's spiraling obesity crisis. Scientists in London believe capsules could replicate the effects of gastric bypass surgery, by telling the body it is satisfied. They hope the treatment, which could be available on the NHS in the next five years, could save thousands of people going through the irreversible operation. The breakthrough could pave the way for revolutionary new treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes, predict the researchers, from Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. Scientists at Barts and the London School of Medicine and Queen Mary University in London believe special food supplements which trick the body into thinking the stomach is full could save thousands of patients from going through irreversible gastric bypass operations, helping to combat the obesity crisis . The study, funded by the charity Bowel and Cancer Research and the Wellcome Trust, discovered the lower intestine could be targeted by special food supplements which trick the body in to thinking the stomach is full. Lead researcher Professor Ashley Blackshaw, said the difference between obese and lean people is that overweight people ignore the signals from the small intestine telling the brain the body is full. He said: 'At the moment, obese patients undergo gastric bypass surgery where they are essentially re-plumbed - undigested food bypasses the small intestine and is shunted straight to the lower bowel where it causes the release of hormones which suppress the appetite and help with the release of insulin. 'That makes the patient feel full and stops even the hungriest individual from eating. 'We believe it’s possible to trick the digestive system into behaving as if a bypass has taken place by administering specific food supplements which release strong stimuli in the same area of the lower bowel. 'It’s a bit like sending a special food parcel straight to the body’s emergency exit, and when it gets there, all the alarms go off.' Bypass surgery is currently among the most effective treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The procedure is known to improve blood sugar levels and help patients lose weight quickly. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has just produced new draft guidelines suggesting its use could be expanded in the NHS to tackle an epidemic of type 2 diabetes. But surgical treatments have drawbacks, including irreversibility and cost. Researchers hope the new treatment for obesity, and type 2 diabetes, could be available on the NHS in the next five years. Stock image . 'What we are doing is targeting the area . of the gut where that sense of feeling full begins with a capsule . containing naturally occurring food supplements,' said Professor . Blackshaw. 'By refining those high-energy supplements and formulating them to target the lower bowel, we expect to develop a successful weight loss and anti-diabetic strategy before, and possibly in place of, bypass surgery. 'We are pursuing the opportunity to intervene directly with fatty acid, amino acid and protein sensing pathways of the lower bowel to modify endocrine responses. There has been a marked increase in . obesity in the UK. In 1993, 15 per cent of the population were obese. In . 2011, levels rose to 25 per cent. At . the same time, weight-loss surgery has increased 30-fold in the last . decade. More than 8,000 operations take place annually on the NHS, and . many more through private clinics. Also called bariatric surgery, it is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously overweight. It is only available on the NHS to treat people when all other treatment, including lifestyle changes, have not worked. Privately the a gastric band operation costs between £5,000 and £8,000, while gastric bypass surgery costs up to £15,000. 'It’s a totally novel idea, and we’re . very excited at the results so far. We are hopeful that the treatment . will be widely available in NHS hospitals in the next five years.' He added that the only predicted side-effect is nausea which could be easily controlled. Experiments were carried out on human tissue at the National Centre for Bowel Research and Surgical Innovation in Whitechapel. The next step is to find funding for substantial clinical trials. Gastric bypass surgery is irreversible and patients have to take supplements for the rest of their lives. Deborah Gilbert, Chief Executive of Bowel & Cancer Research, hailed the new research as a significant step. She said: 'We are delighted that such a significant piece of work has been supported with our funding. 'This is leading edge science, and as a result it can be difficult to find the financial support to push boundaries in this way. 'Not only could Professor Blackshaw’s work have a major impact on the growing problem of obesity and type 2 diabetes, but with the link with weight and bowel cancer clearly established, it could have even wider implications.' The study was published in GUT, the international journal of gastroenterology and hepatology.","Special supplements could trick the body into thinking the stomach is full .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A schoolboy with a rare condition could be killed just by eating toast for breakfast or snacking on a packet of crisps. Josh Guild suffers Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - a painful genetic condition which means eating hard foods can be extremely painful. The condition means the 11-year-old's mouth, throat and oesophagus are very tender, which can cause him to choke. As a result Josh has to avoid hard foods, including crisps, toast and meat, living on a diet of chips, with the hard edges peeled off, as well as cakes and sweet treats. Josh Guild, 11, suffers the rare condition Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a painful genetic condition which causes blisters to form on his skin and in his throat, mouth and oesophagus. It means he cannot eat a number of hard foods, including crisps and toast. He has created his own cook book, Josh's Easy Bites, for other children battling the incurable condition . To help other youngsters battling the condition, Josh, from Polesworth in Warwickshire, has compiled a cook book - Josh's Easy Bites. It is full of recipe ideas using soft foods, which protect his oesophagus. Josh said: 'I can’t eat the same food as my friends - stuff like crisps and sandwiches with crusts on - as it’s really painful. 'But the book is full of fun meals that I can make and eat - lots of sponge cakes and sweets - it’s brilliant. 'My favourite is the airplane cake which is covered in lovely soft icing so it stays moist.' Josh’s Easy Bites is full of recipes for mint crème sweets, sausage plaits and even soft versions of shortbread to avoid the points. It has been in the pipeline for two years and has been a family effort, with Josh's mother Toni, 37, father Simon, 42, and grandmother Val helping. His parents, who are both nurses, start work at 6am every day so Josh's grandmother gets him ready for school, making him breakfast. She said: 'Josh doesn’t eat the same food as us, which makes meal times extremely difficult. 'He can’t eat crisps, toast or even jam with seeds in as they’re too rough and pointy for him to eat without him being in agony. 'He . loves chips, but we have to cut off the pointy bits and basically leave . the soft potato inside and he loves sponge cakes and ready-to-roll . icing. Josh compiled the recipes with the help of his parents Toni and Simon and his grandmother Val, pictured with the 11-year-old. They include tasty ideas for a Sausage Plait and Peppermint Creams . Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a group of genetic disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile. In some cases, as with Josh Guild, other internal membranes and organs are also affected. Blisters, open wounds and sores form as a result of the slightest touch, rub or trauma. Excessive blistering can create scar tissue which can cause fingers and toes to fuse together. In extreme cases it can lead to skin cancer. While some cases of EB can be fatal in infancy, others are severely life-limiting. The charity DEBRA estimates there are more than 5,000 people in the UK with the condition and more than 500,000 sufferers across the world. There is currently no known cure for EB.DEBRA will help launch Josh's book when he appears on TV later this month. Source: DEBRA . 'The recipe book has been brilliant as he can learn what’s safe for him to eat and he gets to be involved in the cooking - when it isn’t too painful. 'After 11 years of being worried that what he will eat can make him choke, it has left him very nervous, so it’s good to educate him.' To ensure Josh gets all the nutrients he needs, he is fed through a tube direct to his stomach overnight. As with other types of EB, the slightest bit of friction on Josh’s hands or arms can cause the blisters or his skin to peel off. The blisters often have to be drained - a painful procedure which can take several hours - so good nutrition is vital for the schoolboy to get vital nutrients to aid his constant healing. Val said: 'Just standing and walking a few steps can be agony for Josh, but he copes really well. 'He’s been born with it so we’ve learnt how to deal with it by changing dressings constantly.' Mrs Guild, said: 'We try to tell him he must live his life with EB - not let EB live his life. 'It’s easy for us to say, but he really does. 'He gets frustrated at times, but he has a remarkable outlook on life.'","Josh Guild suffers Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - a painful genetic condition .

"By . Lizzie Parry . At first glance, these pictures appear to show a normal hand. But a closer inspection reveals a clever prosthetic in the place of the thumb. The silicone digit is the work of a German company, who specialise in individually-tailored prosthetics to meet the unique needs of people who lose fingers, hands, toes, feet or legs. The work is the brainchild of designers Alex Stamos and Christoph Braun, of Stamos and Braun Prosthesenwerk. At first glance, this picture appears to show a normal hand. But a closer inspection reveals there is a prosthetic digit in the place of the thumb, so life-like it is almost impossible to spot . The silicone prosthesis is the work of German company Stamos Braun Prothesenwerk, who aim to create individual designs tailored to each patient . Mr Braun said the ethos behind their designs is creating silicone prosthetic works of art. He said his partner started working with silicone 14 years ago, while he joined five years ago. Mr Braun, who has 18 years experience creating traditional prosthetics, told MailOnline: 'Individuality comes first. For every person and his or her needs are unique, and so are the restorations. 'Here each restoration is a small work of art. 'Alex does more of the individual silicone work while I build the prosthetic under the glove. 'We started our own business six months ago in Dresden, Germany with our special image and special prosthetics. 'We thought we need to make something special. We like to show people that a prosthetic doesn't need to look old and ugly. 'We like to give a good feeling to the patients. It is bad enough that they have lost something. 'So if we are able to make them happy with something cool, it feels good to everybody.' The prostheses vary in the time they take to craft, depending on the type of limb required and the level of customisation needed . The company, which also creates artistic prosthetics, left, was started by Alex Stamos and Christoph Braun, right, six months ago in Dresden, Germany . Christoph Braun, who has 18 years experience creating traditional prosthetics, said: 'Individuality comes first. For every person and his or her needs are unique, and so are the restorations' He said each prosthetic is individually designed and tailored to ensure the right skin colour is match and the prosthetic is as comfortable as possible. As a result the time it takes to create each prosthetic varies, case by case. 'If we only have a little thumb we can make it in one to two days,' he told MailOnline. 'But if we make an individual silicone cover for the whole arm or leg it will take us up to one week. 'And it also depends on the stump situation, sensitivity, the healing process and the wishes of the patient.' He said it is the finer details that make the difference, with finger and toenails crafted from acrylic, the same material used in beauty salons create fake nail extensions. Mr Braun admitted while the prosthetics they create are more realistic, they do not function as well as those with built-in bionics. But he said they allow people to live their day-to-day lives normally, and even allow musicians to continue playing their instruments. The prosthetics range in cost from £1,460 to £5,000 depending on the type of prosthetic and the time it takes to craft the false limb.","Silicone prostheses are work of Alex Stamos and Christoph Braun .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A 7ft young man struck with a rare illness which meant he never stopped growing has died of a massive heart attack despite his mother's desperate attempts to save his life. Robert Smith was a prisoner in his home in the months before his death, bound the same condition thought to have afflicted Joseph Merrick, famously dubbed the Elephant Man in the late 19th century. The 24-year-old was diagnosed with proteus syndrome, a rare illness which causes the abnormal growth of a person's bones, skin and head. Robert passed away at his home in Walsoken, near Wisbech in Cambridgeshire despite his mother Rita's frantic attempts to save her only son. Robert Smith, 24, has died at his home in Cambridgeshire, having suffered a massive heart attack despite his mother Rita's desperate attempts to save his life . Robert defied the medical odds . stacked against him. His mother was warned he would not live . beyond a month when he was born four weeks early. Mrs Smith, 66, said: 'I can’t believe he has gone. Robert suffered a cardiac arrest and he just couldn’t breathe. 'I was on my own with him at the time - and I’m absolutely devastated. I don’t know what I’ll do without him.' Robert, grew to weigh 19 stone, had size 16 feet and a 40-inch inside leg. Standing at more than 7ft, he was one of the tallest men in the UK. He suffered sight and hearing problems, and underwent a staggering 74 operations in his life time. The 24-year-old also suffered gigantism, which meant he never stopped growing and also suffered hydrocephalus - a build-up of fluid on the brain - and epilepsy. Three years ago he suffered meningitis, which left him unconscious for seven weeks and unable to walk. In the three years since the illness struck, Robert had only ventured out of his home four times, at 19 stone he was too heavy for his mother to push in his wheelchair. 'Robert had not been able to walk since . suffering from meningitis three years ago, when he was unconscious for . seven weeks,' said Mrs Smith. Robert, pictured at nine years old, suffered from proteus syndrome, which meant his bones never stopped growing. In the last months of his life he became a prisoner in his own home, having outgrown his wheelchair . Robert with one of his favourite toys when he was five. In his lifetime he underwent a staggering 74 operations. He was also diagnosed with gigantism, which means at 7ft he never stopped growing, along with hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain) and epilepsy . Proteus syndrome, thought to affect only a few hundred people worldwide, results in bone overgrowth. The word 'Proteus' comes from the name of the ancient Greek god of change. This overgrowth is usually asymmetrical, so corresponding body parts are not affected in the same way. Robert, for example, has 21 more bones in his hand than he should - and, as a result, suffers a great deal of pain. More men are affected than women and the cause is unknown. The syndrome became more widely known when it was determined that Joseph Merrick (the patient depicted in the play and film 'The Elephant Man') had severe Proteus syndrome rather than Neurofibromatosis, as had been suggested previously. Last November friends and family launched a campaign to buy Robert a motorised wheelchair. Within weeks more than £10,000 was donated by people from across the country, touched by the 24-year-old's plight. Mrs Smith, her son’s main carer, said at the time: 'I am so grateful to the organisers of Robert Smith Fundraising. 'It has restored my faith in people.' During . the course of his operations, Robert had a titanium plate fitted in his . head to make room for three shunts to drain the fluid accumulating on . his brain. He was born a . month prematurely at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, . Norfolk. It was immediately clear the newborn was seriously ill. 'Robert . was born by Caesarean section and doctors said he would only live for a . month,' said Mrs Smith. He was being treated at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, for hydrocephalus when he started fitting. Robert's mother Rita, 66, his main carer, said: 'I can¿t believe he has gone. I was on my own with him at the time - and I¿m absolutely devastated. I don¿t know what I¿ll do without him' By the age of two the toddler had eight shunts draining fluid from his brain. He had a titanium plate inserted into his head and was diagnosed with proteus syndrome at 16 years old. At . the time of his death Robert had been looking forward to his first trip . out in his new motorised wheelchair, with his sister Marie Louise. His mother, who suffers osteoporosis, arthritis, high cholesterol and a high blood pressure, said: 'Robert . couldn’t wait to go to our local Asda store in Wisbech to buy DVDs and . CDs and chocolate caramel sweets. 'It’s been tough but I wouldn’t change Robert for the world as he was such a gentle giant and very loving.' The . dedicated mother-of-two turned her living room into a bedroom for her . son, and slept in the same room catching what sleep she could in a . recliner chair. Her only brief respite came when a carer sat with her son for three hours each week. Proteus syndrome, thought to affect 120 people worldwide, results in bone . overgrowth. This overgrowth is usually asymmetrical, so corresponding body parts are not affected in the same way.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A woman has donated a kidney to a complete stranger in order to save her sister's life as part of a organ donation exchange. Roseann Mcgee stepped in to help her sibling, offering to donate her organ to a stranger 'swapping' it to ensure her sister received a healthy organ. When the 45-year-old from Peebles in Scotland discovered her sister Lisa, 42, was suffering kidney failure, she immediately offered to be a living donor. But tests revealed she was not a perfect match for her sibling. Roseann Mcgee, right, saved the life of her younger sister Lisa Mcgee, left, donating one of her kidneys to a complete stranger as part of a kidney exchange, to ensure her sibling received a healthy new organ . Determined to help, Roseann agreed to take part in a kidney exchange, donating one of her organs to a complete stranger in return for a healthy kidney for her sister. When doctors found a healthy donor organ for Lisa Mcgee, the exchange programme dictated she could only recieve the organ if Roseann would donate hers to someone else. Roseann said: 'The whole experience was really rewarding, I would do anything for my sister - I just wish I could’ve saved her myself but unfortunately my kidney wasn’t a match. 'I was already willing to give up my kidney to save a life so it made perfect sense to still donate it even if it wasn’t to save my own sister - instead I’ve saved the life of someone else’s sister, mother or daughter. 'As soon as Lisa’s donor was being operated on I was given the thumbs up and doctors began operating on me - like a huge domino effect.' While Roseann shares the same blood group as her sister, the siblings' tissue is not compatible, meaning Lisa's body would reject the kidney. To take part in the kidney exchange the sisters submitted both their details to a central bank system, collating information on donors from across the UK. The search found two possible matches to allow Lisa to receive her kidney. After suffering severe headaches in 2009, tests revealed Lisa, pictured in hospital having dialysis, was suffering kidney failure. Doctors revealed her organs had shut down after being destroyed by the tonsillitis virus, which she had suffered 20 years previously . Lisa, 42, pictured in hospital after her operation, said: 'I finally have some energy and I owe it all to my generous donor and of course my courageous big sister' Paired or pooled donation is when a living kidney donor and recipient are incompatible with each other. While they do not match, it is possible for them to be matched with another donor and recipient in the same situation. The donor kidneys can then be 'exchanged' or 'swapped'. The recipient receives a kidney from a stranger and the donor gives their healthy organ to another stranger. When two pairs are involved in the donation chain it is known as a paired donation. When more than two pairs take part it is a pooled donation. Any donor and recipient pair who are considering a living kidney donation, is eligible for the scheme. To find out more or to register as an organ donor visit the Organ Donor Register here. Ms Mcgee said: 'Last summer I got a call from the hospital saying there was a possible match. 'The . altruistic donor said they would donate their kidney if I was still . willing to be a live donor - of course I was - anything to save my baby . sister. 'The donor . stipulated that the process was to be done through paired exchange in . order to create a domino effect so several people would be able to . benefit. 'After all my . kidney tests came back okay me and Lisa saw a consultant doctor to make . sure I was not being forced into this operation, not getting any . financial gain and to make sure I was in sound mind to go through this . process. 'We were both in the same hospital and when Lisa’s donor had started the procedure it was all go for me too. 'The pain was much higher than I anticipated but it was all worth it to save my beautiful sisters life.' Lisa first fell ill in January 2009, complaining of severe headaches. Her sister said: 'My family have always been really close and my sister is more like my best friend - we’ve always shared everything. As soon as she discovered her sister was severely ill and needed a transplant, Roseann, left, offered to donate her kidney to Lisa. But tests revealed the siblings were not the perfect match, meaning Lisa's body would reject Roseann's kidney . The sisters, pictured with their brother as children, signed up to the kidney exchange. The process required Roseann to donate her kidney to a stranger to enable Lisa to receive an organ from another stranger . 'Lisa started telling me about these . violent headaches she’d been having but typical Lisa brushed it off and . said they were from playing her new iPod too loud. 'I advised her to get it checked out being the worried big sister and eventually she went to see the doctor. 'He . checked her blood pressure mainly but again twice after by a machine as . he could tell something wasn’t right - her BP was off the scale - it . was so high that it wasn’t giving a reading.' The doctor phoned for an ambulance straight away and the family rushed to be by Lisa’s side. Medics later revealed Lisa could have died at any point due to her high blood pressure. Tests eventually revealed she was in renal failure, her kidneys shutting down. 'I finally have some energy and I owe it all to my generous donor and of course my big courageous sister' - Lisa Mcgee . 'I remember feeling completely overwhelmed and I was absolutely heart broken when I found out,' said Roseann. 'She was made to change everything about her life, she had to give up work and she was given up to 20 different drugs a day. 'It was gut-wrenching to see her in so much pain and looking more and more ill when there was nothing I could do about it. 'Just in time for Christmas Lisa’s was struggling to function on her own so it was time for a dialysis. 'Three months later she was put onto the transplant list and me, my brother and our parents were all tested hoping we would be suitable donors. 'My parents were both not suitable after both previously being treated for cancer. 'Our brother was her best chance but he had a successful career in the army and could be called for active service at any time. 'I prayed to be a match but due to her unusual high level of antibodies they would just fight mine - just usual sisterly stuff.' Lisa . and Roseann were then introduced to the idea of the kidney exchange, . raising Lisa's chances of receiving a healthy new organ. Lisa, pictured after having her head shaved for charity, has raised more than £4,000 for Kidney Research UK after undergoing her transplant operation . Matches were found and Roseann was able to donate one of her kidneys to a stranger, so another stranger could save her sister. Following their transplant operations, Lisa was in hospital for six weeks, battling to stop her body rejecting her new organ. Lisa said: 'I was finally allowed home at Christmas and I have such a new lease for life - I finally have some energy and I owe it all to my generous donor and of course my big courageous sister. 'I’m now fully on the mend and have recently done some fundraising of my own to give something back and I have now raised an incredible £4,000 after shaving my hair off for Kidney Research UK. 'Eventually doctors discovered the cause of my kidney failure - when she I was younger I had tonsillitis and the infection had stayed in my body which eventually destroyed my kidneys over a 20-year period. 'Both me and Roseann are now encouraging everyone to consider the kidney exchange program and becoming a live donor as it can save someone’s life. 'It’s not something you really think about until you find yourself in the position our family was faced with - it’s the most precious gift you can give.'","Lisa Mcgee, 42, was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2009 .

Vulnerable patients are to be given control of taxpayers' money to fund their own treatment under new plans to save money and keep them out of hospitals, the head of the NHS said. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens told the Guardian that from April the elderly, disabled children, the mentally ill and those with learning difficulties will be able to control budgets to spend on carers, physiotherapists and psychotherapy sessions. The paper reported that most patients on the scheme are likely to get more than £1,000 from health service and local government coffers, with some with complex requirements receiving larger sums, though they will all retain the right to free GP and hospital care. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has revealed plans for vulnerable patients to be given control of taxpayers' money to fund their own treatment to save money and keep them out of hospitals . Mr Stevens said more than five million people could be using the system by 2018, funded by 'billions' of pounds of public money. He wants to use it to improve the quality of care the four groups receive, which is currently fragmented and has been hit badly by local authority funding cuts. He said: 'We are going to set out the biggest offer to bring health and social care together that there's been since 1948 - a new option for combining them at the level of the individual.' Patients would not receive money directly under the plan, but would be able to control how it is spent after agreeing a care plan with their doctors. Mr Stevens took over the £189,900 post as head of the health service in April, replacing Sir David Nicholson. He will outline his plan in a speech to the Local Government Association conference in Bournemouth today. The plans provoked widespread support from charities but experts urged the Government to ensure patients' are armed with the right information to make the right decisions for their needs. A spokesman for the Alzheimer's Society welcomed the news. He said: 'Pooling health care personal budgets is a massive step forward for integrated health and care for people living with dementia. From April the elderly, disabled children, the mentally ill and those with learning difficulties will be able to control budgets to spend on carers, physiotherapists and psychotherapy sessions . 'The current system is fragmented, in many cases not user-friendly and often failing to need the needs and expectations of an ageing population. 'Managing health and social care in silos is simply letting people with dementia down. ‘For this ambition to become a reality we need to fix the structural problems of the system. 'One in three people over the age of 65 will develop dementia so their needs must be at the core of the NHS and social care system.’ And Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, added: 'Personal budgets will empower patients and give people more control of their options in health and social care. 'However, in order for these reforms to be truly effective, it's critical the Government provides quality information and advice so people can make the right decisions for their needs.'","NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens revealed plans today .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation. The tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller. The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation . Theropods, meaning ‘beast-footed’, were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. 'These bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs,' said co-author Darren Naish, a palaeontologist at the University of Southampton. 'Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs,' added lead author Associate Professor Michael Lee, from the University of Adelaide. 'Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly. The study, which 'weighed' hundreds of dinosaurs, suggests that shrinking may have helped the group that became birds continue exploiting new ecological niches. This evolutionary tree shows major events in dinosaur body size evolution . The branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller. In this artist's impression, early birds (Longirostravis) preen one of their large theropod relatives, Yutyrannus.  Both species lived 120 million years ago in what is now northern China . The feathered dinosaur Microraptor pounces on a nest of primitive birds, named Sinornis.  Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities . The first birds evolved after the feathers of a group of dinosaurs received a burst of colour, a recent study shows. Research . has found that, as well as giving birds their appearance, the pigment . chemicals in feathers readied their dinosaur ancestors for flight. These same chemicals may have helped change the metabolism of early birds so they could stay in the air during flight. The study focused on small, meat-eating maniraptorans, which lived 150 million years ago and had many early vestiges of birds. Scientists . compared the hair, skin, fuzz and feathers of living land vertebrates . including birds, mammals and reptiles with fossil specimens of ancient . lizards, turtles, dinosaurs and pterosaurs. They . were surprised to discover maniraptorans and living mammals and birds . shared the evolutionary development of variety in the shapes and sizes . of melanosomes - chemicals that provide the colour in tissues, hairs and . feathers. ‘Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.' Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree. They used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches. The study found that the dinosaurs most closely related to birds are all small, and many of them - such as the aptly named Microraptor - had some ability to climb and glide. It concluded the branch of dinosaurs leading to birds was more evolutionary innovative than other dinosaur lineages. 'Birds out-shrank and out-evolved their dinosaurian ancestors, surviving where their larger, less evolvable relatives could not,' said Professor Lee. The research follows a separate study which also concluded that shrinking may have helped the group that became birds continue exploiting new ecological niches. An international team, led by scientists at Oxford University and the Royal Ontario Museum estimated the body mass of 426 dinosaur species based on the thickness of their leg bones. The team found that dinosaurs showed rapid rates of body size evolution shortly after they appeared around 220 million years ago. However, these soon slowed and only the evolutionary line leading to birds continued to change size at this rates. This continued to happen for 170 million years, producing new ecological diversity not seen in other dinosaurs. On the left a ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) hovers above the tooth of a massive dinosaurian predecessor. On the right, a broad-billed hummingbird (Cynanthus latirostris) in front of a tooth of a massive dinosaurian predecessor (the 6-tonne Carcharodontosaurus) Archaeopteryx, the first bird, was a small dinosaur weighing only 2.2lbs (1kg). Small size might have been key to the evolutionary success of birds. This line kept experimenting with different, often radically smaller, body sizes - enabling new body 'designs' and adaptations to arise more rapidly . ‘What we found was striking,’ said Dr David Evans at the Royal Ontario Museum. ‘Dinosaur body size evolved very rapidly in early forms, likely associated with the invasion of new ecological niches. In general, rates slowed down as these lineages continued to diversify. ‘But it’s the sustained high rates of evolution in the feathered maniraptoran (a theropod) dinosaur lineage that led to birds – the second great evolutionary radiation of dinosaurs.’ This evolutionary line kept experimenting with different, often radically smaller, body sizes - enabling new body ‘designs’ and adaptations to arise more rapidly than among larger dinosaurs. Other dinosaur groups failed to do this, got locked into narrow ecological niches, and ultimately became extinct. Tyrannosaurus rex weighed 7 tonnes and was the largest land predator of all time. Dinosaur groups that failed to change in size got locked into narrow ecological niches, and ultimately went extinct . Dinosaurs evolved into a huge range of shapes and sizes over 170 million years. small body size might have been key to maintaining evolutionary potential in birds, which broke the lower body size limit of around 2.2lb (1kg) seen in other dinosaurs .","Theropods, ancestors of birds, were only dinosaurs that got smaller .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Health experts have today warned of a rising tide of dengue fever cases in England, as infected travellers jumped 60 per cent in a year. More people are returning from infected areas of the world, bringing the viral illness home with them. Public Health England (PHE) said cases soared by 58 per cent from 2012 to 2013. Last year there were 541 cases reported in people returning from dengue-affected countries across the world. Public Health England has warned of a rise in the number of travellers returning to England with dengue fever, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes . That number is compared to 343 cases in 2012. A PHE spokesman said most cases were reported in travellers who had visited India and Thailand. But officials have also noted an increase in cases associated with travel to Barbados last year. Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. Symptoms of include a severe flu-like illness, fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, nausea and vomiting. PHE also said the number of chikungunya fever cases have risen from 15 in 2012 to 24 in 2013. It is a viral illness with similar symptoms to dengue fever but joint pain may be a more prominent symptom. Most patients make a full recovery but in some cases joint pain and arthritis can persist for several months or even years. Dr Jane Jones, travel and migrant health expert at PHE, said: 'Dengue fever and chikungunya are unpleasant viral illnesses that are transmitted by day-biting mosquitoes. 'As there is no specific preventive medicine or vaccination against dengue fever or chikungunya, prevention relies on avoiding mosquito bites particularly around dusk and dawn when the day biting mosquitoes are most active.' The number of cases has risen by 60 per cent from 2012 to 2013. A Public Health England spokesman said most travellers have contracted the illness in India and Thailand, but increasing numbers were associated with travel to Barbados (pictured) last year . Dengue fever (pictured is a computer generated image of the virus) is spread by mosquitoes . Dengue is a common viral infection spread by mosquitoes. It is common in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Symptoms include: . Dengue is spread by infected mosquitoes. An infected human is bitten by the mosquito, the infected mosquito then bites another human and the cycle continues. The condition is widespread in areas with a high mosquito populations. Dengue usually clears up by itself within two to three weeks. There are no specific medications to treat the disease but symptoms can be managed using paracetamol. A number of people will go on to suffer a more serious form of the illness, known as 'severe dengue'. It is a potentially fatal complication which can lead to shock, bleeding and organ damage.","Public Health England said cases have risen by 58% from 2012 to 2013 .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The Bahamas may owe its origins to iron-rich dust blown over from the Sahara desert. This dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate, the core building block of the Bahama Islands, a study has found. Over the last 100 million years the carbonate has formed into the Great Bahama Bank, a 2.8 mile-thick (4.5 kilometre) platform located in the western Atlantic Ocean. A satellite image of the Great Bahama Bank is shown on the left. On the right is the distribution of insoluble material in the sediments and collection sites re shown. The insoluble material (shown in red) is derived from atmospheric dust . Without this dust, the Bahamas wouldn’t exist, scientists say, and we would instead have a wide open ocean with a slight underwater bump on sonar. Researchers from the University of Miami analysed concentrations of two trace elements characteristic of atmospheric dust – iron and manganese – from 270 seafloor samples from the Bahamas. The team found that the highest concentrations of elements occurred to the west of Andros Island, an area which has the largest concentration of whitings. The Sahara is the major source of mineral dust, which is blown by persistent winds across Africa's 3.5-million square mile desert . The Sahara is the major source of mineral dust, which is blown by persistent winds across Africa's 3.5-million square mile desert. This dust subsequently spreads across the Mediterranean, where it is the origin of rain dust. These winds, which lift mineral-rich sand into the atmosphere, also travel the nearly 5,000 mile (8,000 km) north west journey towards the U.S. and Caribbean. Here, the dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate, the core building block of the Bahama Islands. Whitings are white sediment-laden bodies of water produced by cyanobacteria, which obtained their energy through photosynthesis. 'Cyanobacteria needs 10 times more iron than other photosynthesisers because they fix atmospheric nitrogen,' said Professor Swart, lead author of the study. 'This process draws down the carbon dioxide and induces the precipitation of calcium carbonate, thus causing the whiting.’ They claim the dust particles blown into the Bahamas' waters and directly onto the islands provide the nutrients necessary to fuel cyanobacteria blooms. This is in turn, produce carbonate whitings in the surrounding waters. The dust is blown by persistent winds across Africa's 3.5-million square mile Sahara Desert lifts mineral-rich sand into the atmosphere. It then travels the nearly 5,000 mile (8,000km) northwest journey towards the U.S. and Caribbean.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A cancer survivor has given birth to a baby boy after her first pregnancy was found to be a vicious tumour invading her womb. Lizzie Scoble and her then partner Neil were delighted when they discovered they were expecting their first child in 2010. But the couple's excitement was crushed when doctors told them the unborn baby they so desperately wanted, was nothing more than a mass of cells. And in a cruel twist of fate, the mass of cells - known as a molar pregnancy - developed into an aggressive form of cancer. Lizzie Scoble, pictured on her wedding day with husband Neil, gave birth to their son Azriel after her first pregnancy two years earlier, turned out to be a vicious cancerous tumour invading her womb . Baby Azriel was born in March 2012, after his mother Mrs Scoble beat her cancer with rounds of gruelling chemotherapy, that medics feared would leave her infertile . Mrs Scoble, from Bodmin in Cornwall, was immediately referred for rounds of chemotherapy to help treat the tumour. Remarkably, despite fears the gruelling treatment could have damaged the 40-year-old's fertility, Mrs Scoble discovered she was pregnant eight months after being declared cancer free. She said: 'When I discovered that I wasn't actually pregnant I just couldn't comprehend it. 'I remember realising that I wasn't going to be a mum anymore, and it felt like I was grieving for the child that I never had. 'I felt like I'd failed in so many ways and then to know I hadn't even been carrying a baby in the first place was awful. 'Then to be told that the cells had turn into cancer was almost too much to handle. 'It was particularly agressive so I had to be given chemotherapy that could affect my fertility. 'I lost all my hair and it was such a difficult time. 'But as soon as the chemotherapy was over and I was declared cancer free, I knew I still wanted to be a mum. 'I fell pregnant eight months later with Azriel - it was a scary time but he was totally worth it, I couldn't be happier.' Recalling finding out her first pregnancy was nothing more than a mass of cells, Mrs Scoble said: 'I remember realising that I wasn't going to be a mum anymore, and it felt like I was grieving for the child that I never had' Mrs Scoble found out she was expecting what she thought would be the couple's first child in January 2010. The 40-year-old, said: 'I was just beaming when I found out I was expecting. We had started telling people and going to baby shops to look at what to buy. 'I'd said that it might be nice to have a girl or even twins as I'm an identical twin. It was all so exciting.' But a month into her pregnancy, Mrs Scoble noticed she was bleeding slightly and was referred to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital for a scan. 'After everything that we went through, it's like we've finally got our happy ending' - Cancer survivor, Lizzie Scoble . 'I thought the scan would be the first time I heard the baby's heart beat, but I couldn't have been more wrong,' she said. 'I was told that they could see the amniotic sac but they couldn't see the baby. It was such a shock - I just didn't understand. 'At first they said it might just be that they were scanning too early, and to come back a few days later. 'But when I went back they confirmed it - the pregnancy wasn't viable. 'I burst into tears as they told me they needed to remove the mass of cells, and that afternoon I was taken for surgery. 'I woke up 40 minutes later feeling empty. A doctor explained that there was no sign of a baby in the amniotic sac, and I hadn't been pregnant at all.' But the couple's grief was compounded when days after doctors removed the mass of cells - known as a molar pregnancy - they discovered Mrs Scoble, 40, had cancer. Her twin sister shaved her hair (left) as gruelling rounds of chemotherapy began to take their toll on her body . Eight months after being given the all-clear Mrs Scoble gave birth to baby Azriel, and four months later she married her husband Neil. She said: 'After everything that we went through, it's like we've finally got our happy ending' Ruth Bender-Atik from the Miscarriage . Association said: 'A molar pregnancy is one where an abnormal . fertilised egg implants in the womb. 'The . cells of the placenta grow very quickly and prevent it developing . further, but the placenta keeps growing and pregnancy hormone levels . continue to rise, so you will still have a positive pregnancy test . result. 'A molar pregnancy . is often only diagnosed after the miscarriage has happened, during . routine examination of the pregnancy tissue. 'There . is a very small chance that the molar cells can spread rapidly and . become cancerous and so all women with molar pregnancy are referred for . specialist follow-up. 'If a cancer (called choriocarcinoma) does develop, the treatment is extremely effective. 'The . diagnosis of molar pregnancy can be very confusing, upsetting and . frightening. 'It can be difficult to understand what has happened and . very upsetting to realise that the beginnings of your pregnancy never . developed properly into the baby you thought you were carrying many . weeks later. 'Many women . and their partners are very frightened by the risk of cancer and you are . likely to need lots of care and reassurance during your follow-up. 'We suggest that you read our leaflet Molar pregnancy (Hydatidiform mole). 'It . clearly explains molar pregnancy and the follow-up process and also . includes comments from women who have had this kind of pregnancy loss. 'You . might also find it helpful to use our forum, where you can share your . thoughts and feelings with others who have had a molar pregnancy.' It was only when Mrs Scoble was recovering at home that a letter from the hospital revealed there was a chance the mass of cells could become cancerous. Two days later, Charing Cross Hospital - a hospital that specalises in treating molar pregnancy - called to confirm she would need to monitor the levels of hormone pregnancy in her blood. However, the levels did not return to normal, indicating that Mrs Scoble had cancer. 'I was home alone when I got the call,' she said. 'I'd gone from an expectant mum to a cancer patient - it was unbelievable. 'Neil was a fantastic support and assured me that we'd beat it. 'But it was a long struggle - the initial chemotherapy dose was too mild and the cancer remained present. 'I was put on a higher dosage where I lost my hair and felt constantly sick. It could also have affected my fertility, the idea that I might never be a mother was horrific. 'Luckily the chemo worked and I was declared cancer free four months later.' Doctors recommended the couple wait six months before trying for a baby again. And to their delight, Mrs Scoble discovered she was pregnant almost immediately. She said: 'When I fell pregnant again it felt like the nightmare was over. But once again everything went down hill - it turned out that I'd had an ectopic pregnancy. 'There was no link between that and the molar, but they had to remove one of my fallopian tubes. 'Finally, six weeks later I fell pregnant, and this time it seemed to be plain sailing. 'I didn't have any morning sickness or tiredness. I finally felt happy again.' Mrs Scoble gave birth to the couple's son Azriel in March 2012, and four months later she married her husband Neil. 'After everything that we went through, it's like we've finally got our happy ending,' she said. 'Azriel is full of life and an absolute miracle - we're over the moon.'","Lizzie Scoble and then partner Neil were overjoyed at first pregnancy in 2010 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Twin brothers who suffered a rare condition which meant they shared the same placenta and blood supply, were saved when doctors performed laser surgery in the womb. Nathaniel and Joshua Cavalier had a condition known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which resulted in an unequal flow of blood from their mother Verena's placenta. The condition - which can be fatal - was diagnosed when their mother went for a 21-week scan at Southend Hospital. The 32-year-old, from Rayleigh in Essex, was rushed to London's King's College Hospital where she underwent pioneering laser surgery the same day. Verena Cavalier's twin boys Nathaniel and Joshua were born in February after doctors performed life-saving laser surgery on the boys while they were still in the womb . A critical operation - with just a 33 per cent chance of both the twins surviving - was carried out in December. Doctors inserted a camera and fibre optic laser down a tiny endoscope into Verena's womb. The laser then sealed off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the boys received a more equal supply of blood. The operation was a resounding success and the boys were born on February 12 by Caesarian section at Southend Hospital. Nathaniel weighed 3.12lbs and his brother Joshua weighed in at just 3.1lbs. But if the brothers' start in life was not enough, they have also had to fight blood poisoning and meningitis since their birth. This week Mrs Cavalier and her husband Paul, 41, celebrated their sons' four-month 'birthday'. Language teacher Mrs Cavalier, said they feel very lucky their boys survived. She said: 'I was very lucky because the condition can develop very rapidly and I wasn't due another scan for a week, but my consultant said she would do it early as she was going on holiday.' Doctors at King's College Hospital did an ultrasound to confirm the condition. And just an an hour later Professor Kypros Nicolaides performed the surgery. But because events had moved so quickly, Mrs Cavalier only just had time to call her husband to let him know she was being operated on. She said: 'One minute I was at Southend Hospital and the next I was on the train. Joshua (pictured) and his brother Nathaniel, have also fought blood poisoning and meningitis since they were born on February 12. They were diagnosed with the rare condition twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome when their mother had a 21-week scan at Southend Hospital . Doctors at King's College Hospital in London performed the life-saving surgery on Nathaniel (pictured) and his brother Joshua (pictured right with their mother Mrs Cavalier) 'My husband was at work so I had to make the decisions myself. He got there just as they started the surgery. 'It was an awful decision to have to make, but there was no time to lose. The longer we waited, the higher the chance the babies could die or be brain damaged.' The crucial operation was carried out under a local anaesthetic meaning the expectant mother was fully aware of what was happening to her and her babies. She said: 'They had a camera attached to the laser with a monitor nearby. 'I could see what they were doing. I could see a little hand moving about and I prayed the babies wouldn't move and get caught by the laser. 'It took 45 minutes and then I was sent to recover in a quiet room. Another scan showed the babies were both well and I was allowed to go home.' Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in twins who share a placenta, . when there is an unequal flow of blood between the two babies. Too much blood in one twin will put a strain on his heart and cause him to produce more urine to get rid of the excess fluid. The other twin will not grow as well and may have little or no amniotic fluid around him. The condition can be serious if it is left untreated. It is rectified using a harmless laser beam, which seals off some of . the blood vessels between babies and makes the blood flow more equal. Despite its success, the couple were left on tenterhooks knowing that the odds were against both boys surviving. Mrs Cavalier, a German and Latin teacher, then had to face a 20 per cent chance of a miscarriage during the following six weeks. She said: 'I had two miscarriages before, so I was convinced I would lose them. 'I went back to work because I didn't want to sit at home and panic.' At 29 weeks her waters broke but she did not go into labour for another two weeks, giving the twins 'vital extra time'. She was also given cortisone in that time to help the babies' lungs develop. Both had to overcome a potentially fatal infection of the stomach and blood poisoning but survived. They then went home on March 9 but had to return to Southend Hospital after catching bacterial meningitis. However, the boys came through once again and now weigh in at 8.3lbs and 6.10lbs respectively - the size that many babies are actually born at. Mrs Cavalier, who also has a daughter, two-year-old Magdalena, added: 'We owe Professor Nicolaides so much. Without him, we wouldn't have our boys. We would have lost them. 'We are really grateful to Southend Hospital neonatal unit as well. They were all wonderful there. 'The boys are four months old now. People ask me how old they are and are very surprised when I tell them.' Professor Nicolaides added: 'The boys were delivered by emergency caesarean section and were quite poorly after they were born. 'I am so pleased they are now both healthy and happy and their parents can enjoy watching them grow up.'","At her 21-week scan Verena Cavalier was told her twin sons had a rare condition known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome .

Ms Shotwell added that she wants to do the same thing for space travel that planes are currently doing for air travel by creating ‘rapid and reusable’ rockets. The comments follow owner Elon Musk’s announcement that SpaceX is making ‘progress’ towards establishing a colony on the red planet by 2020 with tickets to cost $500,000 (£296,900). Musk has previously said he created SpaceX for the sole reason of developing rocket technology to get people to Mars. Billionaire Elon Musk, pictured left with Nasa's Charles Boden, has announced his SpaceX firm is making 'progress' towards establishing a colony on the red planet by 2020 - and expects to sell tickets for $500,000 (£296,900) a trip . Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, wants to help establish a colony of up to 80,000 people on the planet, but admitted he’d like to start small, with a group of 10 people, and build the colony from there. He ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket, fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane, to reach the red planet in six years. It would need to be much heavier than SpaceX’s current rockets, including the Falcon Heavy that is currently in development and is expected to launch by the end of this year. SpaceX has a $1.6bn contract with Nasa for a series of future supply missions and this will be used to test his technology further. Musk ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane to reach the red planet - and he aims to get there three years before the Mars One colony arrive . He wants to help establish a colony of up to 80,000 people on the planet, but admitted he’d like to start small, with a group of 10 people, and build the colony from there. ‘At Mars, you can start a self-sustaining civilisation and grow it into something really big,’ Musk said. ‘I think we're making some progress in that direction - not as fast as I'd like.’ SpaceX also recently released a video of its Falcon 9 rocket making a soft ocean splashdown, describing the reusability test a success. The rocket was the first stage of a Falcon 9 that launched on 14 July, which took six Orbcomm satellites into orbit. An on-board camera captured the descent, and the data gathered during the trip by SpaceX will improve the landing on upcoming flights. This test confirms that the Falcon 9 booster is able consistently to re-enter from space at hypersonic velocity, restart main engines twice, deploy landing legs and touch down at near zero velocity,’ SpaceX said in a news release. Later this year SpaceX plans to attempt to land one of its Falcon 9 rockets on a floating barge. The ultimate goal is to build reusable rockets that can return from space. Pictured is the Grasshopper test rocket, which SpaceX has been using to perform 'hops' up to low altitudes and practice landing on solid ground . Its ultimate goal is to make the rockets reusable and have them touch down on land.

Mars One was set up by Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp who plans to take 40 people to the planet with training starting in 2018, and the first passengers arriving in 2023. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has grand plans for his space agency. With help from Nasa he has grown the company significantly in a decade.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . There was a time when a picture was worth a thousand words. With emails and texts littered with emojis, anyone could convey what they were feeling without ever having to type a single word. But now a new form of self-expression is sweeping social media – and it’s all thanks to the ever-expressive animated GIF. A GIF- short for graphical interchange format - is a bitmap image format that supports short animations. One of the front runners of the GIF trend is the Relay messaging app, which allows anyone to search a library for GIFs that reflect their state of mind. The GIFs are placed into categories such as 'bored', 'hungover', 'grumpy', 'happy' and 'excited' and users can send their chosen mini-movie to other Relay users. For instance, if a user wants to show their excitement, GIFs such as a dancing Kermit the frog appear in the search results. One of the front runners of the GIF trend is the Relay messaging app (pictured) which allows anyone to search a library for GIFs that reflect their state of mind . Once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts, how to properly say GIF has been debated since it was invented in 1987. Most people pronounce GIF with a hard G. But Steve Wilhite, the inventor of the widely used web illustration, last year declared it should be pronounced 'JIF,' A Tumblr dedicated to the question exists, although it comes to no solid conclusion. There's also a Youtube video on the subject. Even the U.S. president has taken a stand. When the White House debuted its own Tumblr page in April, it posted a graph of what to expect on its new microblog. Among the offerings was ‘Animated GIFs (Hard “G”)’. As well as pre-created GIFs, anyone can search through YouTube videos and other web content to find exactly the correct animation that reflects their feelings. Users can even create their own GIFs by tapping the '+' button while in a chat room, and then pressing the camera icon. Whether it be a winking Benedict or a frowning baby, the GIFs can be placed in a ‘favourites’ file so they can be used at the touch of a button. Web pages are shown with a preview image and headline to reveal what the image or GIF about so that users don’t have to see URLs. If users happen to be on the app at the same time, they can see if a contact is looking at a GIF and talk about what’s being viewed. The free app, created by Toronto-based Relay, is available on both iOS and Android devices.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . People suffering from schizophrenia can often hear imaginary voices so terrifying that they are left traumatised. One American patient described the voices as ‘like torturing people, to take their eye out with a fork, or cut someone's head and drink their blood.’ A study has now found that these voices can be shaped by culture, with Western cultures experiencing far more disturbing psychotic episodes. People suffering from schizophrenia can often hear imaginary voices so terrifying that they are left traumatised.One American patient described the voices as ‘like torturing people, to take their eye out with a fork, or cut someone's head and drink their blood’ Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder that can cause people to hear 'voices' that other people don't hear. It affects about one per cent of the global population over the age of 18. Many people in Western cultures have reported hearing voices claiming other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts or plotting to kill them. In Africa and India, however, these hallucinatory voices appear as harmless and even playful, according to the study by Stanford University in California. While there's no cure for schizophrenia, this study suggests that therapies urging patients to develop relationships with their imaginary voices could prove useful. As part of the study, Professor Tanya Luhrmann interviewed 60 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia; 20 each in San Mateo, California; Accra, Ghana; and Chennai, India. Overall, there were 31 women and 29 men with an average age of 34, who were asked about their relationship with the imaginary voices. As part of the study, Professor Tanya Luhrmann interviewed 60 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia; 20 each in San Mateo, California; Accra, Ghana; and Chennai, India . While many of the African and Indian subjects registered largely positive experiences with their voices, not one American did. Instead, the U.S. subjects were more likely to report experiences as violent and hateful . African and Indians registered largely positive experiences with their voices, but not one American did. In America, the voices were an intrusion and a threat to one's private world – the voices could not be controlled. However, in India and Africa, the subjects were not as troubled by the voices – they seemed on one level to make sense. The Americans mostly did not know who spoke to them and they seemed to have less personal relationships with their voices. But among the Indians in Chennai, more than half heard voices of kin or family members commanding them to do tasks. Several Indians also heard  the voices as playful, as manifesting spirits or magic, and even as entertaining. The difference may be down to the fact that Europeans and Americans tend to see themselves as individuals motivated by a sense of self identity, said Professor Luhrmann. Whereas outside the West, people imagine the mind and self as interwoven with others and defined through relationships. For instance, they spoke of their voices as a call to battle or war – 'the warfare of everyone just yelling.' The Americans mostly did not know who spoke to them and they seemed to have less personal relationships with their voices, according to Professor Luhrmann. But among the Indians in Chennai, more than half heard voices of kin or family members commanding them to do tasks. 'They talk as if elder people advising younger people,' one subject said. That contrasts to the Americans, only two of whom heard family members. The Indians also heard fewer threatening voices than the Americans – several heard the voices as playful, as manifesting spirits or magic, and even as entertaining. Finally, not as many of them described the voices in terms of a medical or psychiatric problem, as all of the Americans did. In Accra, Ghana, where the culture accepts that disembodied spirits can talk, few subjects described voices in brain disease terms. When people talked about their voices, 10 of them called the experience predominantly positive; 16 of them reported hearing God audibly. 'Mostly, the voices are good,' one participant remarked. The difference may be down to the fact that Europeans and Americans tend to see themselves as individuals motivated by a sense of self identity, said Professor Luhrmann. Whereas outside the West, people imagine the mind and self as interwoven with others and defined through relationships. In America, the voices were an intrusion and a threat to one's private world – the voices could not be controlled. Professor Tanya Luhrmann (pictured) said the results suggests that therapies urging patients to develop relationships with their hallucinated voices could prove useful . However, in India and Africa, the subjects were not as troubled by the voices – they seemed on one level to make sense in a more relational world. Still, differences existed between the participants in India and Africa; the former's voice-hearing experience emphasised playfulness and sex, whereas the latter more often involved the voice of God. 'The difference seems to be that the Chennai and Accra participants were more comfortable interpreting their voices as relationships and not as the sign of a violated mind,' the researchers wrote. The research, Professor Luhrmann observed, suggests that the 'harsh, violent voices so common in the West may not be an inevitable feature of schizophrenia.' The findings may be clinically significant, according to the researchers and adds to research that shows specific therapies may alter what patients hear their voices say. 'Our hunch is that the way people think about thinking changes the way they pay attention to the unusual experiences associated with sleep and awareness, and that as a result, people will have different spiritual experiences, as well as different patterns of psychiatric experience,' Professor Luhrmann said. The Americans mostly did not know who spoke to them and they seemed to have less personal relationships with their voices. But among the Indians in Chennai, more than half heard voices of kin or family members commanding them to do tasks .","Scientists came to the conclusion after speaking with 60 schizophrenics .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Apple's latest sales results have failed to meet expectations with the group’s iPad sales plummeting by nine per cent. The iPhone maker reported sales of $37.4 billion (£21.9 billion) in its third quarter ending June, falling short of expectations for about $38 billion (£22.3 billion). The Cupertino-based company also revealed that only 13.2 million iPads were sold in the last three months, compared to 16.3 million in the previous quarter. The Cupertino-based company also revealed that only 13.2 million iPads (iPad Mini with Retina display pictured left and iPad Air pictured right) were sold in the last quarter, compared to 16.3 million in the previous quarter . The results have triggered fears that iPad sales are set to get worse once Apple launches its rumoured, large-screen iPhone this autumn. Chief executive Tim Cook put the poor figures down to 'market softness' in some regions, but added a turnaround might come from Apple's recently announced deal with IBM. The deal involves businesses being be able to buy iOS devices equipped with IBM-enhanced enterprise software. Despite poor iPad sales, the iPhone (iPhone 5S pictured) continued to do well with 35.2 million handsets sold in the past three months – an increase of 13 per cent, following a strong performance in China . Despite poor iPad sales, the iPhone continued to do well with 35.2 million handsets sold in the past three months – an increase of 13 per cent, caused by a strong performance in China. Cook told analysts on a conference call that Apple's Chinese performance was 'honestly surprising.' Lower-cost phones sold in China by up-and-coming rivals such as Xiaomi appeared to be grabbing market share mainly from other companies, chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri added. 'We have a really good runway in front of us with China Mobile,' Mr Maestri said, referring to Apple's main carrier partner in the world's number two economy. ‘Given our numbers in China, it would seem their success is coming from other Android devices.' Mac desktop computers were the most popular product by the group in terms of growth, with 4.4 million sold, providing a year-on-year increase of 18 per cent. Overall, the company’s quarterly profit rose 12 per cent to $7.75 billion (£4.55 billion). Apple posted a smaller-than-expected six per cent rise in quarterly revenue, but revenue surged 28 per cent in greater China despite stiff competition. Despite a surprisingly robust Chinese market, Apple continues to struggle in the more saturated, developed regions of the United States and Europe - its two largest markets. The group iPhone typically sales tail off in the quarters before a new smartphone launch, as potential buyers hold off. Figures also revealed a 36 per cent jump in research and development spending compared with the prior year, suggesting significant new products are on the horizon. Customers are now eagerly anticipating the launch of the possible iPhone 6 – if that is what it will be called – in the next few months. Chief Executive Tim Cook (pictured) told analysts that Apple's Chinese performance was 'honestly surprising' Analysts expect the company to introduce two iPhone versions this autumn, including a 5.5-inch model that thrusts Apple into the market for larger-sized phones popularised by rival Samsung and HTC. But whether Apple can again produce a revolutionary new product, something it has been criticised for not doing since the iPad in 2010, remains the central question for investors. Many expect Apple to make a play for the wearable device market with a smartwatch, dubbed iWatch or iTime. Although smartwatches are a relatively new tech trend, Apple was working on a version as far back as 2011, according to its latest patent. The files detail a wristband fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen device. The shape and size of the device in the patent images resembles a sixth-generation iPod Nano and in one design, the word iTime is written on its face. Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the end of 2013. Last year the firm was awarded a patent for the name 'iWatch', but it’s still unclear what Apple’s much-rumoured wristband will be called. The latest patent was filed almost three years ago to the day, on 20 July 2011. Called ‘Wrist-worn electronic device and methods therefor’, the patent said: ‘An electronic wristband to be worn on a wrist of a user, comprising a central portion having a receptacle area configured to receive and electrically connect to a mobile electronic device, the mobile electronic device including a display and being independently useable, and at least one band portion coupled to the central portion.’ Put more simply, this means the device could be used in its own right, even when not connected to the wristband.

The eruption, which began on Sunday, wasn’t serious enough to trigger an evacuation of the mountain villages nearby. It did, however, cause a temporary closure of two air space corridors in Catania - the busiest airport on Sicily and one of the most frequently used within Italy. Mount Etna has erupted spewing plumes of volcanic ash that disrupted flights into and out of the Italian city of Catania. The eruption, which began on Sunday, wasn’t serious enough to trigger an evacuation of the mountain villages nearby . The stunning pyrotechnic display was the first of the year, with much of the activity coming from a region in the south-east side of the volcano. The latest update from Volcano Discovery says: 'There are no significant variations in activity have occurred during the past days. Small lava flows are being fed by the new fissure vent at the eastern base of the North East crater.' Mount Etna stands almost 11,000ft (3.4km) above sea level, looming over the whole Italian island of Sicily. It has been active for thousands of years, although its first eruption of modern times was thought to be in 475 BC. It is so well-known it was written about by the Ancient Roman poet Virgil, who called its eruptions a 'roar of frightful rain'.

The latest update from Volcano Discovery claims: 'There are no significant variations in activity have occurred during the past days.

Effectively a weather radar for ash, the Avoid system has been supported by easyJet and should reduce the chances of a repeat of the Icelandic volcanic ash-cloud crisis of spring 2010. Created by Dr Fred Prata of Nicarnica Aviation, the system utilises infra-red technology fitted to aircraft to supply images to pilots. This will enable themto see an ash cloud up to 60 miles ahead of the aircraft and at altitudes between 5,000ft and 50,000ft, to help avoid ash clouds. Eruptions are rarely dangerous, but they can kill. Etna's most deadly moment came in 1669, when a series of blasts killed 20,000 people and destroyed the town of Catania. But farmers stayed in the area because the constant eruptions made the ground fertile. In 1992, Etna posed another serious threat when lava streams headed towards Zafferana, a town of 7,000 people. In a spectacular operation, Italian and U.S. soldiers used controlled explosions to divert the flow. Etna's blasts are known as Strombolian eruptions - caused when gas bubbles in molten magma accumulate underground and rise to the surface. These pockets of molten earth then burst in a fiery show, sending plumes of lava and ash hundreds of feet into the air. Volcanic ash clouds can pose problems for aircraft. The immense ash clouds that erupted from Iceland’s Eyjafjallajoekull volcano in 2010 caused chaos for the airline industry. No one really knew if it would be safe to fly, and technology to accurately detect the plumes of ash had yet to be developed. Since then, a number of ash detection systems have been created to make flying around volcanic sites safer.

The reconstruction pieced together previously unrecognised skeletons from the Nýřany Basin to create the skull features of the Late Carboniferous Gephyrostegus bohemicus. This was a small animal of generally lizard-like build that lived 308 million years ago. It is the earliest example of a reptile and could explain the origin of amniotes.

Amniotes are a group of back-boned creatures that includes turtles, lizards, birds, dinosaurs and mammals. The study was undertaken by experts from Comenius University in Bratislava alongside a UK team which included the Natural History Museum in London and the University of Lincoln. Their aim was to provide an analysis of early tetrapod relationships incorporating their new observations of the Gephyrostegus. Pictured is the Gephyrostegus bohemicus reconstruction of skull.  This was a small animal of generally lizard-like build that lived 308 million years ago . Gephyrostegus was a small animal around 8.7 inches (22cm) in length. It had a generally lizard-like build with large eyes and a large number of small, pointed teeth, indicating it was an active hunter . Their analysis used skeletal traits across a sample of early tetrapod groups to identify the likely features of the Gephyrostegus. Gephyrostegus was a small animal around 8.7 inches (22cm) in length. It had a generally lizard-like build with large eyes and a large number of small, pointed teeth, indicating it was an active hunter. Remains have been found in Nyran, Czech Republic, dating from around 308 million years ago, . This places it in the upper Carboniferous period - a time when amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates, of which one branch would eventually evolve into reptiles, the first fully terrestrial vertebrates. Dr Marcello Ruta, from the School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, was one of the authors and produced a series of intricate hand-drawn recreations of the cranial structure of Gephyrostegus. ‘Gephyrostegus has always been an elusive beast,’ he said. ‘Several researchers have long considered the possibility that the superficially reptile-like features of this animal might tell us something about amniote ancestry. ‘But Gephyrostegus also shows some much generalised skeletal features that make the issue of its origin even more problematic.’ The new study shows that Gephyrostegus is closely related to another group of Eurasiatic and North American tetrapods called seymouriamorphs. ‘We found some interesting new cranial features in Gephyrostegus that helped us establish this link,’ said Dr Ruta. ‘Staring at specimens for a long time down a microscope and trying to make sense of their anatomy may be frustrating and tiring at times, but always immensely rewarding.’ Dr Marcello Ruta, from the School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, was one of the authors and produced a series of intricate hand-drawn recreations of the cranial structure of Gephyrostegus.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Parkinson's experts have been noticing a remarkable phenomenon – some of their patients have developed impressive creative talents. The link between Parkinson’s and artistic abilities was brought to the attention of the world two years ago by Professor Rivka Inzelberg of Tel Aviv University in Israel. Now she has completed the first empirical study to verify a link between Parkinson’s disease and creativity, which the study suggests may be down to drugs used to treat the disease. Parkinson's experts have been noticing a remarkable phenomenon – some of their patients have developed impressive creative talents . Professor Inzelberg first noticed the trend in her own Sheba Medical Centre clinic when the usual holiday presents from patients - typically chocolates or similar gifts took a surprising turn. ‘Instead, patients starting bringing us art they had made themselves,’ she said. Bringing together case studies from around the world, Professor Inzelberg examined the details of each patient to uncover a common underlying factor – all were being treated by similar drugs. Drugs to increase the activity of dopamine in the brain are taken to help treat motor symptoms in Parkinson’s patients such as tremors and muscle rigidity (left). This can also increase a patient's creative powers. On the right is a painting by one of Professor Inzelberg's patients . These were either synthetic precursors of dopamine or dopamine receptor agonists, which increase the amount of dopamine activity in the brain. Parkinson’s is a degenerative condition that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die, causing a lack of the chemical dopamine; this, in turn, interferes with movement and co-ordination. When Nikki Baudains was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, one of the few positive things that seemed to come out of it was a new burst of creativity. While previously the closest she’d come to being an artist was face-painting children at fetes, two years ago - a few months after starting a new medication - she had a burning desire to paint. Suddenly, art dominated her life; she produced thousands of canvases - some 2,000 in the past 18 months alone - and exhibited near her home in Jersey. Like many other Parkinson’s sufferers, Nikki’s obsessive behaviour was a side-effect of her medication. For Nikki, 48, her obsession has come at a high cost. While she held down a job as a nursery nurse, she started spending up to 12 hours a day working on her pictures. But while hers was expressed creatively, there have been other examples of Parkinson’s patients developing more troubling behaviour, such as gambling or sex addictions. Those affected find themselves trapped in an almost impossible situation: their compulsions are caused by medication, but they can’t stop taking it because it would leave them unable to function physically. While the cause is not clear it’s thought genetic and environmental factors, such as exposure to pesticides and herbicides, may play a part, although this has not been proven. Drugs to increase the activity of dopamine in the brain are taken to help treat motor symptoms in Parkinson’s patients such as tremors and muscle rigidity. But it's also involved in the brain's ‘reward system’ – the area Professor Inzelberg predicts is associated with increasing creativity. Dopamine and artistry have long been connected, she points out, citing the example of the Vincent Van Gogh, who suffered from psychosis. It's possible that his creativity was the result of this psychosis, thought to be caused by a spontaneous spiking of dopamine levels in the brain. There are seemingly no limits to the types of artistic work for which patients develop talents, observes Professor Inzelberg. Cases include an architect who began to draw and paint human figures after treatment, and a patient who, after treatment, became a prize-winning poet though he had never been involved in the arts before. It's possible that these patients are expressing latent talents they never had the courage to demonstrate before, she suggests. Professor Inzelberg’s latest research, which looks at clear evidence that creativity might be due to obsessive tendencies, was published this week in the journal Annals of Neurology. According to James Hamblin writing in The Atlantic, Professor Inzelberg concluded there was no relationship between the creativity she had been noticing and any degree of compulsive behaviour. The patients with Parkinson’s disease did significantly better than their unafflicted peers in terms of verbal and visual creativity and novel thinking. ‘These results support a genuine change in neuropsychological processes underlying creativity,’ the Annals study concluded. Professor Rivka Inzelberg of Tel Aviv University has completed the first empirical study to verify a link between Parkinson’s disease and creativity, which the study suggests may be down to drugs used to treat the disease .","Tel Aviv University has confirmed link between Parkinson’s and creativity .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Many of us take to Twitter and Facebook to share our excitement when we have good news. But bad news is different. Whether it be a break up, job loss or illness, a phone call is still our preferred choice of communication. Now a recent study has found, despite the popularity of social media, we still deliberately choose traditional forms of communication when our news will have a negative impact. When experiencing negative events, people could justify interrupting their friends and preferred using the telephone, a more intrusive medium. 'You often hear people say when the phone rings, it's bad news,' Professor Toma says. 'Our data support that' This could be down to the fact that sharing bad news on social media makes us feel worse, while sharing good news gives us a high as it makes the event feel more 'real'. The study, conducted by the researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, involved looking at the sharing habits of 300 undergraduate students at the university. All participants kept a daily journal to document how they shared their emotions, how they shared it and how they felt when the incident occurred. The study found that 70 per cent of all social sharing was through social media, texting or phone calls, and in person. Social sharing is very widespread, says study author Catalina Toma, an assistant professor of communication arts. 'It's almost like the event is not even real until you tell somebody,' she says . Participants shared positive news across several forms of media, such as through texts or Twitter, because the information spreads quickly, and gets a response quickly. Next time you're in a bad mood, don’t turn to Facebook to cheer you up. Research has revealed that the longer you spend procrastinating on the social networking site, the more miserable you will become. This is because we recognise we're wasting our time on the site, and this lowers our self-esteem. The research contradicts Facebook’s own controversial study, published last month, which revealed posts on the site can have a positive and negative effect. For the more recent experiment, a total of 300 English and German-speaking participants were asked by researchers from the University of Innsbruck to take two tests to see how Facebook affected their mood. In the first, they were asked how much time they had spent on Facebook that day, before being asked to rate their mood. The second study asked some of the participants to spend 20 minutes on Facebook doing typical things such as checking their news feed and updating their status. A second group browsed the web, but did not use social networks, while a third was given no instructions. All three groups were asked to rate how ‘meaningful’ their overall experience had been. The findings revealed that in both experiments, people said they felt worse about themselves after using Facebook, because they did not feel it was a good use of their time. When it came to bad news, participants preferred calling instead of posting their feelings for the world to see. Social sharing is very widespread, says study author Catalina Toma, an assistant professor of communication arts. 'It's almost like the event is not even real until you tell somebody,' she says. The study found that participants strategically chose the media that could meet their psychological needs. When experiencing positive events, people preferred to share via texting and Twitter, because both media are easily accessible from smartphones and are nonintrusive in that friends don't have to reply immediately. When experiencing negative events, people could justify interrupting their friends and preferred using the telephone, a more intrusive medium. 'You often hear people say when the phone rings, it's bad news,' Professor Toma says. 'Our data support that.' The researchers also found that social sharing via media enhanced the emotional tone of the event. Sharing a positive event increased its impact, an effect known as capitalisation. 'Telling somebody makes you even happier,' Professor Toma says. But if you feel sad because you had a lousy trip to the dentist or a fight with your spouse and post something about it on Facebook, you will not feel better. Regardless of which form of media people in the study used to share bad news, they felt worse - though sharing by telephone had the smallest negative effect . 'When something positive happens, you want to tell it right away,' Professor Toma says. 'Examining how people share their important personal events through new media and how they feel as a result of it is a golden opportunity to learn how humans work.'","Study found people prefer to use the phone when they have bad news .

A massive wildfire that have been raging for a week in Washington state has destroyed more than 370 square miles of dry timber and grasslands and left a trail of destruction including dead cattle and hundreds of displaced people. Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers estimates that 150 homes have been destroyed, but suspects that number could be higher. His deputies haven't been able to search parts of the county where homes are spread miles apart. Ten people remained unaccounted for as of Sunday, though Rogers said that could reflect outages of phone service. Scroll down for video .

No serious injuries have been reported, but hundreds of people have been forced to evacuate in several towns and rural areas in north-central Washington. There are nearly 1,400 firefighters battling the flames, assisted by more than 100 fire engines, helicopters dropping buckets of water and planes spreading flame retardant. The wildfire finally showed some sign of calming on Sunday, the first time since it was triggered by lightning strikes six days ago that it showed any sign of abatement, local officials said. ‘It's the first time in four days I've seen blue sky,’ said Rogers, who drove to the town of Twisp on Sunday to survey the damage. ‘Every day, when you got up, it was nothing but smoke.

By early Sunday, the fire was still burning over 280,000 acres in Washington’s Methow Valley, about 120 miles northeast of Seattle, but its perimeters were not expanding. ‘It seems to be calming down a whole lot,’ said Rogers. ‘The weather is definitely a help. It's cooled down a whole lot. It's also burning out in some areas.’ Cooler temperatures and lighter winds are forecast to helping firefighters in wildfire-stricken north-central Washington in the coming days. While Sunday's weather has slight improvements on the hot temperatures and gusty winds that have fueled the wildfires, the forecast for Monday and Tuesday calls for lighter winds and temperatures, said Spokane-based National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Koch. ‘Overall, it looks like the weather scenario is improving,’ Koch said.

Okanogan County Public Utility District officials told KREM that fully restoring power to the area could take weeks. Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday about 50 fires were burning in Washington, which has been wracked by hot, dry weather, gusting winds and lightning.

The Supreme Court unanimously voted 9–0 against state-sponsored segregation on May 17 1954 and stated that 'separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.' The decision overturned the Plessy v Ferguson decision of 1896, but it took decades for education authorities throughout the U.S. to honor the judgment. The photograph has added poignancy because when the first lady - then simply Michelle Robinson - was 11 years old in Chicago in 1975 she was one of the first to attend the city’s first racially integrated school for high achievers, reports the New York Times. The Supreme Court unanimously voted 9¿0 against state-sponsored segregation on May 17 1954 and stated that 'separate educational facilities are inherently unequal' After she toured the historic site in May, Mrs. Obama delivered a speech to the graduating classes of Topeka's high schools. 'I believe that all of you - our soon-to-be-graduates - you all are the living, breathing legacy of this case,' she said. 'Not only are you beautiful and handsome and talented and smart, but you represent all colors and cultures and faiths here tonight. You come from all walks of life, and you’ve taken so many different paths to reach this moment. 'Maybe your ancestors have been here in Kansas for centuries. Or maybe, like mine, they came to this country in chains. 'That’s why we’re celebrating here tonight,' she continued, 'because the fact is that your experience here in Topeka would have been unimaginable back in 1954, when Brown v.

"By . David Mccormack . The African-American actor who claims he was detained and questioned because of racial profiling while shopping at the flagship Manhattan branch of Macy’s last June has reached an undisclosed settlement with the retailer and the City of New York. Rob Brown, who stared in the HBO series Treme and movies such as Finding Forrest and Don Juan, was detained for 45 minutes on June 8, 2013 after buying a $1,300 watch for his mother. The Brooklyn-raised Brown, 30, said three white, plainclothes NYPD detectives quickly descended upon him and that he was handcuffed and paraded around the store until they realized their mistake and let him go. Rob Brown had claimed he was detained and questioned because of racial profiling while shopping at the flagship Manhattan branch of Macy's last June . In a 42-page federal lawsuit filed last November, Brown charged that Macy's security ‘policies and practices have left... customers of color feeling victimized, humiliated, traumatized.’ In a second federal lawsuit against the NYPD, he leveled similar charges in a New York class action over the alleged ‘shop and frisk’ approach taken by cops against minority customers. The NYPD is ‘continuing to enforce, encourage and sanction policies’ against customers at high-end retail stores ‘merely because of the color of their skin,’ the 31-page suit charged. Brown has now reached a settlement ‘in principle’ in his twin actions against the department store and the city, according to Manhattan Federal Judge Lorna Schofield. Macy's emphatically denied racially profiling Brown, but a spokesperson confirmed that it had settled 'in principle' with Brown after he brought a lawsuit against them . ‘The court has been informed that the parties have reached a settlement in principle,’ wrote Schofield in court papers. The actor had accused Macy’s and the city of false imprisonment, negligent training and civil rights allegations, reports the New York Post. He was seeking unspecified damages and a court order forcing Macy’s and the NYPD to stop the alleged practice of targeting minorities who shop at high-end stores. ‘The lawsuits by various plaintiffs who alleged racial profiling by Macy's have been settled in principle,’ said a spokesperson for Macy’s. Details of the settlement are still being finalized and Brown can refile his lawsuits within 60 days if the settlement falls apart. Brown’s lawsuit had cited legal action brought by 14 other minority members based on incidents at other branches. Brown stared as trumpter Delmond Lambreaux in HBO series Treme between 2010 and 2013 . ‘The specific, racially motivated abuses… constitute an on-going pattern and practice that has occurred and is continuing to occur in Macy's stores throughout the United States,’ the court papers alleged. ‘The disturbing truth is that Mr. Brown's harrowing ordeal was not an isolated event at Macy's, but is just one example of Macy's relentless and unlawful pattern and practice of ... disproportionately targeting its shoppers of color.’ Macy's emphatically denied racially profiling Brown, and insisted they were not involved in either the detention or questioning of Brown. The actor said that he was accused of using a fake credit card to buy his mom a $1,300 silver Movado watch with gold trim on June 8. According to an earlier state lawsuit brought by Brown he alleged that one of the cops told him that ‘he could not afford to make such an expensive purchase.’","Rob Brown, 30, was stopped by three plainclothes NYPD detectives after he purchased a $1,300 watch at Macy's last June .

A spokesperson for the DJ’s daughter Kerri, said Kasem's children from his first marriage hope he will be buried at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California, as he wished. Kasem died June 15 at a hospital in Washington state. Danny Deraney said the celebrity's second wife, Jean Kasem, has the rights to his body but has not yet arranged for him to be buried. Scroll down for video . A month on from his death, the unburied body of legendary radio host Casey Kasem remains at a funeral home in Tacoma, Washington . Hospital spokesman Scott Thompson with St. Anthony Hospital said Kasem's wife collected his remains from the hospital after he died, but Thompson did not know what arrangements she made. A call to Jean Kasem's attorney was not immediately returned on Tuesday. Kerri Kasem told The View last month that the bitter feud between her siblings from her father's first marriage and their step-mother had deepened over what to do with the dead body. Miss Kasem said: 'I don't know what's going on with [Jean] and why she makes the decisions she does.'

Mrs Kasem . accused his daughter Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how . quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could . be cashed in. However, . Kerri hit back, saying that Jean hadn't had Casey body flown out to . L.A. for burial because she was trying to deflect attention from an . imminent investigation into elderly abuse. Kerri Kasem also told The View that she could not remember why the feud started. She said: 'If I knew I would tell you. I would try and make amends. I would say, ''I'm sorry Jean. What happened? ...Why do you hate us so much?''' The legendary DJ died on June 15 - Father's Day -  aged 82 from Parkinson's disease, dementia and sepsis. Kerri Kasem claimed Jean took him out of his rest home and moved him . around the U.S. at the end of his life to keep him away from his family. During the trip he developed a bedsore which contributed to his death, his children have claimed. Jean is now arguing that the whole saga is a ploy by his children to get their hands on his money. Dispute: Mike, Kerri, and Julie Kasem (left - right, with their father Casey second from right in 2003) argue that his wife removed him from a care home towards the end of his life, causing a bedsore which contributed to his death .

He . describes becoming sweaty and nauseous and was afraid he was having a . heart attack. Ambulance crews attended to one man on site before he was transferred to hospital. Tests at the hospital revealed he had more than 100 nanograms of THC in . his system, or about 20 times the legal driving limit. ‘I essentially ate 10 doses at once, never having THC in my system ever before,’ Mr Jones added. The Pot Pavilion was . a new attraction at Denver Fair this year and featured blue ribbon competitions for 'speed rolling' and stalls with 'pot-related merchandise' among other things.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists have turned to modern technology in a bid to solve a 100,000 murder mystery. Using 3D reconstruction, they discovered that a Stone Age child, who was buried in a cave in Israel, suffered a blow to the head, which would likely have led to personality changes and difficulty communicating. The experts say that they have found the oldest traumatic brain injury in south-western Asia, even if they have not proved whether the head trauma proved fatal. Using 3D reconstruction scientists discovered that a Stone Age child, who was buried in a cave in Israel 100,000 years ago, suffered a blow to the head, which would likely have led to personality changes and difficulty communicating. The damaged area is marked with an arrow . The 12 or 13-year-old child received a blow to the head around 100,000 years ago. Their skull is evidence of the oldest traumatic brain injury in south-western Asia. They had a broken piece of bone depressed in their skull that was surrounded by linear fractures, as the result of a potentially violent attack. Experts initially thought the child had a skull lesion that healed. But using 3D reconstruction they believe the child had brain damage. He or she may have experienced a change in personality as well as difficulty communicating and moving. Using digital imaging and 3D reconstruction, scientists from Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Université de Bordeaux and the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris, showed that the 12 or 13-year-old had a broken piece of bone depressed in their skull that was surrounded by linear fractures, as the result of a potentially violent attack. Experts who first examined the remains of the child, who died and was buried at Qafzeh Cave in Israel 100,000 years ago, initially thought that the child had a skull lesion that healed. But by using 3D reconstruction techniques, they were able to take a fresh look at inner bone lesions to determine the serious impact that the trauma would have had on the brain. ‘Three-dimensional imaging methods allowed us to better explore this lesion, which appeared as being a frontal bone depressed fracture, associated with brain damage,’ they wrote in the study. They also estimated the brain’s size to reconstruct what may have caused the damage. Experts who first examined the remains of the child who died and was buried at Qafzeh Cave, Israel (shown on the map) some 100,000 years ago, initially thought that the child had a skull lesion that healed. But now they think that he or she suffered brain damage from the blow . Qafzeh Cave is a rock shelter in the Lower Galilee of Israel near Nazareth. The site has evidence Holocene, Upper Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic occupations, making it important in the study of early humans. The oldest levels are around 100,000 years old and hearths, stone tools and other artefacts have been found. Animals bones indicate that people ate red deer and aurochs as well as snails. Human remains from the cave include seven adults, all of which appear to have been buried purposefully. ‘The endocranial volume, smaller than expected for dental age, supports the hypothesis of a growth delay due to the traumatic brain injury,’ they added. In doing this, the experts revealed that the type of fracture seen on the skull, usually occurs from a blow to the head, which could have been caused intentionally, but also by accident. Whatever the cause, it is likely that the child experienced a change in personality as well as difficulty communicating and moving, according to the study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE. Hélène Coqueugniot, of the university, told Science Daily: ‘Digital imaging and 3D reconstruction evidenced the oldest traumatic brain injury in a Palaeolithic child. ‘Post-traumatic neuropsychological disorders could have impaired social life of this individual who was buried, when a teenager, with a special ritual raising the question of compassion in Prehistory.’ The child’s remains were found with two deer antlers lying on the upper chest, indicating they were buried carefully. ‘This young individual benefited of a unique funerary practice among the south-western Asian burials dated to Middle Palaeolithic,’ the scientists wrote in the study. They hope that closer examination of the skull, as well as others found in the cave, can provide insights into the adaptation patterns and social behaviour of early nomadic hunter-gatherers. It likely that the child suffered brain damage, as a result of a broken piece of bone depressed in their skull, which was surrounded by linear fractures (pictured). He or she may have experienced a change in personality as well as difficulty communicating and moving, the scientists explained .","The skull was buried at Qafzeh Cave in Israel 100,000 years ago .

She sold the baby boy to a childless couple but he was rescued after neighbours raised the alarm. Beautiful: This is the new newborn baby sold for just £130 becuase his mum is too poor to keep him after  her husband left her eight months ago . Hard decision: Gauri Shah and her daughter sit together outside their house - her neighbours raised the alarm after she sold her 10 day old baby in Jalpaiguri in West Bengal . Poverty: Gauri Shah sits with her remaining three daughters at her modest home in India . The ten-day-old baby is now being cared for at a children’s home. His mother gave birth to him on May 25 but was uncertain how she could raise him alone so she sold the tot - who is yet to be named - to a childless couple seven days later. However, the news soon spread within the village and the local government quickly stepped in and rescued the child. But Mrs Shah refuses to take him back and the little baby was handed over to a children’s home. Her only source of income is the money her 70-year-old mother gets after a day begging for hours on the streets. She said that she feels no remorse about selling off her newborn baby, as she believes it was the best decision for her son and three daughters. She said: ‘My husband left me eight months ago with three daughters. We depend on whatever money my mother manages to collect. She had to borrow Rs 100 (£1) from our neighbour for my delivery. I have no money to raise my children, how will I take care of another? Lucky ones: These little children still have a home but the healthy boy born on May 25th was sold to a childless couple in her village . 'After I was discharged from the hospital, a childless couple approached me and asked me to give them my son for Rs13000. I accepted the offer, as I had no other option. I thought my son would live a better life with them.’ Mrs Shah said she would take back her son if the government helped her with some benefits. The state administration has now given her 60 days to think about whether she will accept the baby. After that the infant will be given away for adoption.","Gauri Shah, 32, lives in a slum near .

"By . Chris Kitching . A Cheshire mother is taking legal action against a UK tour operator after her young daughter became seriously ill and was hospitalized during a family holiday at a popular Spanish resort. Maria Dimelow, from Runcorn, said her 18-month-old daughter Amelia, who has Downs Syndrome, spent almost 48 hours in hospital when her family should have been enjoying a much needed getaway. The 42-year-old mum said she isn’t satisfied with the way Cosmos Holidays handled her situation after she and two of her children fell ill at Club Mac Alcudia on the Balearic island of Mallorca. Scroll down for video . Eighteen-month-old Amelia, centre, with eight-year-old brother Ryan and four-year-old sister Bethany . The hotel has been criticised in recent days after up to 50 holidaymakers claim they were struck down by a vomiting bug during their stay. Illness affected dozens of guests at Club Mac Alcudia and a second resort in Menorca in recent weeks, during the height of the season. Mother-of-two Emma Watkins, 32, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, had also recently spoken to Mail Online after her daughter Faye fell ill and was hospitalised during a stay at the Club Mac Alcudia. Mrs Dimelow shared her story after complaining to Cosmos. Speaking of how the hotel allegedly handled the problem, she said: ‘They’ve obviously done nothing about it. I want it to be known about what’s going on. People need to know what’s happening at this resort. ‘It’s not a recent thing that’s happened. It’s been going on for a while and they’re not doing anything about it.’ Mrs Dimelow, who provides full-time care for her 18-month-old daughter, told MailOnline Travel that her family was supposed to spend a full week at the all-inclusive family resort but their getaway was derailed just three days in. She believes she and her daughters, Amelia and four-year-old Bethany, fell ill after eating food at the resort because it was the only place where had meals and ‘loads’ of other guests were also suffering from symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea. Maria Dimelow says her daughter was 'severely dehydrated' when she was admitted to hospital . She said: ‘There were people running past you being sick. There were pools of sick all over the floor. ‘A little boy ran behind me throwing up and his mum was running behind him trying to catch it. The staff were just like, “Yeah, whatever”. They didn’t seem to care. ‘It’s not fair that people are saving to go on holiday and having it ruined by being stuck in hospital and being sick.’ She estimated that at least 40 to 50 people were ill, including Amelia, whose condition deteriorated to the point where she had to be taken to hospital. Mrs Dimelow said: ‘It was really severe. She was constantly being sick and she couldn’t even hold water down.’ She claims resort staff would not ring an ambulance. She said: ‘We had to take a taxi to the hospital and they said we had to pay for it ourselves.’ Caroline Kaye, a spokeswoman for the resort, said the hospital is a five- to 10-minute drive from the hotel, it is faster to travel there by taxi and in most cases an ambulance will not be dispatched for stomach-related issues. She said a representative from the tour operator normally accompanies an ill guest to hospital and pays for the taxi ride. The hotel apologised to the family, she added. Ruined holiday: Carl and Maria Dimelow aren't happy with the way they have been treated . In response to recent claims by holidaymakers, Club Mac Alcudia has released a statement denying suggestions that the illness was caused by poor food hygiene or cleanliness. The resort, which has an on-site doctor, said it took precautionary measures to contain a virus that affected 40 to 45 guests. Those measures included closing the pool and cleaning more frequently. The resort's statement reads: ‘An investigation highlighted that if the illness was due to food hygiene or cleanliness there would have been a much higher proportion of guests who would have taken ill. ‘This was a viral bug and whilst the hotel brought in additional hygiene assistance and external medical assistance (in line with our Health & Safety Guidelines), we were informed that this was not a cleanliness or food-hygiene issue.’ Mrs Dimelow claims that within five minutes of her daughter being admitted to hospital, a ‘severely dehydrated’ Amelia was put on an intravenous drip. Mrs Dimelow stayed at her daughter’s bedside while her husband Carl, a factory worker, Bethany and their eight-year-old son Ryan remained at the hotel. She said her husband and kids spent about £160 travelling between the resort and hospital, and they were forced to walk at one point because they ran out of money. Amelia was discharged from hospital after two days of treatment but she wasn’t her normal self, her mother said. ‘She wasn’t eating properly. To be honest, when we got out we just couldn’t wait to come home.’ The hospital stay was covered by an insurance policy the family purchased before the trip. Mrs Dimelow said she contacted Cosmos to get her family on an earlier flight home and was told a plane was leaving in a few hours but they would have to pay for the £80 cab ride to the airport. Because there was a short window to get to the airport, she declined and the family returned on a Saturday morning, one day ahead of schedule. Club Mac Alcudia says it took precautionary measures to contain a virus that affected 40 to 45 guests . But before they left they had to continue eating at the resort because they did not have enough money to pay for meals elsewhere. Mrs Dimelow said she is upset because Cosmos has not offered an apology and has not responded to an official complaint she filed a few weeks after she returned home, although she did speak to an employee in Mallorca and he  did not seem surprised. ‘He said, “It’s just a bug don’t worry about it”. He said it was worse the week before.’ Cosmos Holidays released a statement saying it acknowledged receipt of Mrs Dimelow’s email on the day it was sent and advised that it would carry out a thorough investigation and respond within 28 days. About three weeks later, Cosmos Holidays was contacted by Mrs Dimelow’s solicitor. The statement reads: ‘As this is now within legal proceedings, we cannot comment further.’ Looking back, Mrs Dimelow is ‘quite upset’ with resort staff who she claims refused to call an ambulance for her ill daughter, who was being treated to her first holiday abroad. She said: ‘They didn’t seem concerned. They initially suggested (she eat) digestive biscuits. What they’re meant to do, I don’t know.’ After Mrs Dimelow returned home, she filed a complaint with the hotel and was offered a £600 refund as ‘a gesture of good will’, but she turned it down. She said: ‘I thought that was a bit of an insult after what we had been through. It’s not even about the money it’s just about the fact that it’s disgusting how we’ve been treated.’ She admitted she would like to recover the entire cost of the £1,600 holiday. Club Mac Alcudia is one of two Spanish resorts where travellers have suffered from a vomiting bug recently . The family chose the resort after reading positive reviews on TripAdvisor and getting a recommendation from a travel agent..’ Mrs Dimelow has since contacted compensation firm Your Holiday Claims, which has received complaints from dozens of tourists who claim their holidays were ruined by sickness. Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘The continuing reports of illness at the Club Mac Alcudia are a serious concern. We have seen a large number of children, often requiring hospital treatment, affected by the outbreak. ‘Families are continuing to have their hard-earned holidays ruined by illness at the Club Mac Alcudia. We have been receiving enquiries since May 2014 and it is vital that action is taken to stop the spread of infection.’ She added: ‘It is of utmost importance that all tour operators and the hotel management take measures to ensure that illness does not continue and to protect the health of all hotel guests.’ Holidaymakers have also fallen ill at Stil Victoria Playa Hotel on the neighbouring island of Menorca . Club Mac Alcudia is one of two Spanish resorts where travellers have suffered from a vomiting bug. The exact number of people who have fallen ill is not clear, but visitors to both resorts believe it is more than 100. Earlier this week, two separate holidaymakers told MailOnline Travel that up to 80 guests became sick at Stil Victoria Playa Hotel on the neighbouring island of Menorca. Travellers who were ill are writing about their horror stories and giving the resorts poor reviews on TripAdvisor. A user named beffhukgs, from Bath, visited Club Mac Alcudia in July with his or her three young children and described the experience as ‘very disappointing’. In a review posted Thursday, the guest wrote: ‘Our whole party caught a sickness bug and spent half of the holiday in bed. ‘Which apparently has been doing the rounds in the complex for months.’ [sic] . However, beffhukgs’ critique was sandwiched between glowing reviews from holidaymakers who did not fall victim to the stomach bug. One review was written by a London mother, who says she plans to return to the resort, and another was posted by a Gateshead resident, who hailed the resort for providing ‘a memorable customer experience’.","Maria Dimelow isn't satisfied with the way her family was treated in Mallorca .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Dyeing your hair can be time consuming and expensive, not to mention damaging. So most women would welcome a new invention that could change their hair colour at home at the touch of a button. Scientists have taken the first step to making this possible and believe that a device similar in appearance to hair straighteners or flat irons, could be used to colour and even press a pattern into your hair in the future. An invention to dye for? Scientists have taken the first step to make it possible to change the colour of your hair by using an electronic device that looks like a flat iron, instead of dye - and it could work by printing a pattern onto strands of hair to reflect light in a specific way. An illustration of how  the device could work is pictured . The practice of hair dying for cosmetic purposes has been around for several hundred years. The Greeks and Romans used naturally occurring henna as a temporary hair dye while Arab authors described pastes made of slaked lime. While there are lots of hair dyes on the market, some people suffer adverse effects such as skin discolouration and allergic irritations, the authors said. They claim that some dyes can even lead to toxicity and cancer. To solve these potential problems they have created a technique using nano-scale diffraction gratings to imprint patterns on hair. Diffraction gratings occur in nature for colour generation and similar techniques are used in optics for colour separation. They have so far used a focused ion beam (FIB) to etch nano-scale diffraction gratings on individual strands of brown hair to artificially add colour to the hair strands through interference of light. The engineers used Archimedean spirals and hyperbola patterns to manipulate the colour of the hairs. This technology could be embedded in future consumer devices so we could colour our hair using a gadget like hair straighteners. Engineers at the University of New Mexico . and Los Alamos National Laboratories are researching the use of focused . ion beam technologies and the way they can be used to pattern different . materials, including hair. Professors of Mechanical Engineering, Bruce Lamartine and Zayd Leseman, are exploring a way to etch ‘diffraction gratings’ on individual hairs to reflect light in a specific way. The project began five years ago when Professor Lamartine had the idea for a way of colouring hair without chemicals using nanopatterns. Using a focused ion beam (FIB) – which are already used in the manufacture of electronics – the engineers created patterns on single strands of human hair that reflected specific bandwidths of light depending on how far apart the lines were and how wide and deep they were. They used patterns called Archimedean spirals and hyperbola patterns to achieve reflect light in a certain way so that it appeared to change colour. They tested their idea on black, brown and blonde hair, finding that the technique was most effective on brown hair. While using a million-dollar machine to ‘colour’ individual strands of hair is not practical for people covering up greys at home, the engineers think that with more research, a hair straightener-like device could be created to permanently change the colour of someone’s hair. It would work by etching the diffraction gratings into the hair and the colour would depend on the portion of the light spectrum that was reflected, according to the research, which was published in the Journal of Cosmetics, Dermatological Sciences and Applications. Users of the futuristic device could change ‘paddles’ on the device depending on what colour they wanted their hair to be and could even create patterns in it by changing the diffracted colour. Using a focused ion beam (FIB) the engineers created patterns on single strands of human hair that reflected specific bandwidths of light depending on how far apart the lines were and how wide and deep they were. They used patterns called Archimedean spirals (pictured left) and hyperbola patterns (right) Professor Leseman said: ‘That’s one way to do it, to make the pattern directly onto your hair...and that would be more of a permanent change until it grows out.’ ‘The other idea...is to actually develop some kind of conditioner - some kind of polymer coating for your hair. ‘Then when you do the patterning with your flat iron that’s specially developed for this polymer coating - maybe low heat - then you could actually pattern the conditioner or the polymer on your hair. ‘And then it would easily wash out if you wanted it to go away, so that’s not as permanent and as scary.’ As well as allowing people to have rainbow-hued hair without the damaging effects of using bleach, the technology could have more serious applications. It could be used as a security measure on credit card readers. It could also be used to identify friend from foe on the battlefield. Colour me beautiful: The engineers tested their idea on black, brown and blonde hair, finding that the technique was most effective on brown hair. Here it is possible to see the colours 'created' when the light is reflected using the minute patterns etched into a hair . ‘We talked about the possibility of an optical band pass and this would lead to identifying a friendly soldier if you can wear a pattern like this, possibly on an armour jacket,’ Professor Lamartine said. ‘The identification could change like the old style military code books. You could issue a new roll of tape with a different pattern on it once a month and you know that there’s a certain colour of laser which will return from that. If it is somebody else’s pattern, then you know you don’t have a friendly.’ The researchers say the technique of etching diffraction gratings on materials could be used to defend against potential terror attacks on civilian airplanes. Print specific diffraction gratings on a roll of polymer, attach it to the underside of a jetliner and the jet becomes invisible to the laser sights on missiles, they explained. The aeroplane would essentially become a ghost plane to terrorists. It could also be used to build more efficient injection engines in order to boost fuel efficiency in cars or even as a mechanism to filter viruses or bacteria from blood or other body fluids, they said.","Engineers at the University of New Mexico .

"By . Jack Crone . Peter Clague, newly appointed headmaster at Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire, has dismissed claims that he attacked his ex-wife . A newly appointed headmaster at one of Britain's leading public schools has been accused of brutally assaulting his ex-wife. Peter Clague, 48, is due to move from New Zealand to take up the position as head of Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire on September 1. A court hearing will take place later this month concerning the alleged attack, which is said to have taken place in September 2010. His ex-wife, Jeanne Jackman, claims Mr Clague ran at her, shook her by the shoulders and pushed her on to the stairs, causing her to fracture her tailbone. The incident, said to have taken place at the couple's former home in Greenhithe, Auckland, was not reported to police by Ms Jackman for more than two years. The time lapse meant authorities could only issue Mr Clague with a warning under New Zealand law, without pursuing criminal charges. Speaking in 2010, Ms Jackman heavily criticised the police's decision. She said: 'I believe this makes a mockery of calls to address domestic violence. 'Either we take the issue of domestic violence seriously in New Zealand, or we don't.' Following her statement, Ms Jackman decided to seek justice for the alleged assault by launching a private prosecution case against her ex-husband. The Massey University psychology lecturer also claims that Mr Clague was psychologically abusive towards her. Ex-wife:  Jeanne Jackman claims Mr Clague ran at her, shook her by the shoulders and pushed her on to the stairs causing her to fracture her tailbone during the 2010 incident . But her ex-husband has dismissed the allegations, arguing that Ms Jackman invented them because she was 'angry over a break-up.' Mr Clague has already pleaded not guilty to the assault. Speaking two years ago, after court papers were submitted, he said: 'My career is on the whim of a woman who is angry over a break-up. 'Principals don't come back from false allegations like this.' Leading public school: The establishment charges £31,000 a year in fees and caters for 1,260 pupils . Bromsgrove School is a £31,000-a-year boarding school which caters for 1,260 pupils in its senior and preparatory school, pre-preparatory and nursery - with children aged between 2-18. In 2010, it was rated as 'outstanding' in an Ofsted report. The school's governing body has vowed to stand by Mr Clague. The Chairman of Governors, Stewart Towe, said: 'Bromsgrove School governors are wholly satisfied with the integrity of Peter Clague and followed due diligence in the appointment process. 'The governors are very much looking forward to welcoming the new headmaster and working with him to further develop the school's success.' The school's Chairman of Governors, Stewart Towe, has issued a statement supporting Mr Clague . Past students at the 460-year-old school include award-winning actor Trevor Eve, poet Alfred Edward Housman, musician John Ilsley, and former head of the CBI Lord Digby Jones . When  Mr Clague landed the job in the UK, Philippa Fee, Chairman of the Board at Kristin School, where he was working, paid tribute to his contribution. Speaking from the school in Auckland, she said he was 'pivotal in establishing a positive and happy culture'. After being unveiled as Bromsgrove's new headmaster last year, a school spokesman said: 'Peter Clague's appointment was the unanimous choice of the selection panel and the governing body are thrilled that he has accepted.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The mystery of how life flourished on Earth could soon be solved by rocks on the moon, according to scientists. A team of physicists have simulated the conditions of chunks of rock smashing into the moon to discover whether any microscopic fossils could survive. They say that just one finding on the lunar surface could offer experts a glimpse of how ancient life on our own planet formed. The truth is out there: Finding fossilised algae from Earth on the lunar surface, which travelled there by meteorite, (illustrated) could offer scientists a glimpse of ancient life on our planet - and some experts believe it may be possible to find such evidence with a lot of searching . A number of meteorites discovered on Earth were created by impacts on the moon and Mars, and suggest that cosmic bodies regularly throw rock debris at each other. With this in mind, scientists wanted to test whether similar fossils could be discovered intact on the satellite. Professor Mark Burchell from the University of Kent led the experiment to examine whether microscopic diatoms - a type of algae - could withstand a trip from Earth to the moon, New Scientist reported. Powdered rock containing fossils was added to water and then frozen to make an artificial meteoroid. Scientists then used a gas-powered gun to fire it into a water at speeds of 500 metres per second and 5km a second, replicating the impact of a body of rock hurtling through space before hitting the moon, according to the study, which was published in the journal, Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A. Mark Burchell, of the University of Kent, has led an experiment to examine of microscopic diatoms could withstand a trip to the moon from Earth and thinks that they could. Raw diatoms are pictured (a and b), fossilised versions that were shot (c and d) and fossilized versions without the impact (e and f) While none of the fossils in the homemade meteoroid survived the impact in one piece, reserahcers did find that some tiny fragments of the fossils were identifiable. This, they say, could mean minute fossil remains may lay hidden on the moon inside meteorites. Professor Burchell told the publication that the fact they found anything at all is promising and that he hopes fragments on the moon may be better preserved than those on Earth, as the satellite is less geologically active. He said: 'There is a good chance even if you found fragments, there would be things you have not seen before. He added that if these fragments could be dated, they would offer information about early life on Earth. However, while rock samples have been collected by lunar missions, no-one has found an Earth meteorite on the moon. It would be harder for a chunk of rock to travel from Earth to the moon because of our planet’s dense atmosphere and high gravity, but ‘not impossible’, according to Christian Koeberl, of the University of Vienna. Scientists think there is a change of finding rock on the moon that contains fossils and Kieren Torres Howard at the City University of New York said that discovering them would be amazing and 'we should hurry back to the moon'. An image of the Earth taken from the moon is pictured . This is an illustration of the two asteroids colliding between Jupiter and Mars 470 years ago . Scientists are currently examining a meteorite found in a quarry in Sweden to unravel why Earth thrived in the Ordovician period, 470 million years ago. The fossilised space rock is thought to be the remains of one of two asteroids that crashed between Jupiter and Mars, the debris of which later bombarded Earth and kick started the variation of life. While other space rocks have been found at the site, this one could prove to be the 'missing link' and could reveal more about the evolution of life on Earth. It is thought that the meteorite is one of many that bombarded our planet over 500 million years ago, when a small asteroid crashed into a larger one between Jupiter and Mars. This impact resulted in the creation of many fragments that eventually bombarded Earth 470 million years ago. These fragments are known as L chrondrites, and they are the second most common type of meteorite on the planet. It's believed these impacts may have kick started the resurgence of biodiversity on planet Earth, when life became more varied and complex. This occurred during the Ordovician period, prior to which biodiversity had gone through a lull. However, while the meteorites are thought to be the remains of the larger asteroid, scientists had been puzzled as to why there was no sign of the smaller asteroid. Now they think the sample in Sweden could belong to smaller rock, adding weight to the scientific theory.","Physicists at the University of Kent simulated whether it is possible for fossils to survive the impact of hitting the moon .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The days of smartphones and laptops running out of battery after a few hours could be over thanks to a new breakthrough. Scientists have at last created pure lithium batteries, which in time could last four times longer than those currently powering smartphones and other gadgets. The ‘Holy Grail’ discovery could revolutionise technology from electric cars to consumer devices like MP3 players, which all demand power storage. The days of smartphones and laptops running out of battery after a few hours and needing constant recharging (pictured) could be over thanks to a new breakthrough. Scientists have at last created pure lithium batteries, which in time could last four times longer than those currently powering smartphones and other gadgets . Currently, owners of gadgets using the lithium ion batteries face the constant frustration of having to frequently recharge devices to make sure they do not run out of battery after a matter of hours. This is because while small, the batteries are power-hungry. But after years of research, engineers at Stanford University, California, believe they have worked out how to keep them the same size, while boosting their longevity. To do this, they have made the battery's anode out of lithium too, according to the research, which is published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. All batteries have three basic components: an electrolyte to provide electrons, an anode to discharge those electrons and a cathode to receive them. The 'Holy Grail' discovery could revolutionise technology from electric cars to consumer devices. An electric car's  lithium ion battery is pictured . Today, we have lithium ion batteries, but the lithium is in the electrolyte and not in the anode. Scientists have been working for years to produce an anode of pure lithium, because it would be cheap, small and be a huge boost to battery efficiency. But many have failed because the lithium didn’t survive the process. The engineers managed to create a lithium anode by inventing a film made from carbon nanospheres to protect the anode and stop it from cracking when it expands. The nanospheres create a surface resembling a honeycomb to make a flexible, uniform and non-reactive film that protects the unstable lithium. The carbon nanosphere wall is just 20 nanometres thick. It would take 5,000 layers stacked one on top of another to equal the width of single human hair. ‘The ideal protective layer for a lithium metal anode needs to be chemically stable to protect against the chemical reactions with the electrolyte and mechanically strong to withstand the expansion of the lithium during charge,’ said Yi Cui, Professor of Material Science and Engineering at the university. The Stanford nanosphere layer is made of amorphous carbon, which is chemically stable, yet strong and flexible so it can move freely up and down with the lithium as it expands and contracts during the battery's normal charge-discharge cycle. ‘Of all the materials that one might use in an anode, lithium has the greatest potential. Some might call it the Holy Grail,’ said Professor Cui. Scientists have making a different part of a battery, called an anode, out of lithium, for the first time. The breakthrough could lead to electric cars with far greater ranges. A Mitsubishi i MiEV is pictured . ‘It is very lightweight and it has the highest energy density. You get more power per volume and weight, leading to lighter, smaller batteries with more power.’ Fellow researcher Guangyuan Zheng added: ‘Many engineers had given up the search, but we found a way to protect the lithium from the problems that have plagued it for so long.’ Professor Cui said: ‘In practical terms, if we can improve the capacity of batteries to, say, four times today's, that would be exciting. ‘You might be able to have cell phone with double or triple the battery life or an electric car with a range of 300 miles that costs only $25,000 (£14,700) - competitive with an internal combustion engine getting 40 mpg,’ Cui said. The new invention could ‘power the next generation of rechargeable batteries,’ he said. Most lithium ion batteries, like those you might find in your smart phone or hybrid car, work similarly. The key components include an anode, the negative pole from which electrons flow out and into a power-hungry device, and the cathode, where the electrons re-enter the battery once they have travelled through the circuit. Separating them is an electrolyte, a solid or liquid loaded with positively charged lithium ions that travel between the anode and cathode. During charging, the positively charged lithium ions in the electrolyte are attracted to the negatively charged anode and the lithium accumulates on the anode. Today, the anode in a lithium ion battery is made of graphite or silicon. Engineers would like to use lithium for the anode, but until now they have been unable to do so. That's because the lithium ions expand as they gather on the anode during charging. All anode materials, including graphite and silicon, expand somewhat during charging, but not like lithium. Researchers say that lithium's expansion during charging is ‘virtually infinite’ relative to the other materials. But its expansion is uneven, causing pits and cracks to form in the outer surface, like paint on the exterior of a balloon that is being inflated. The resulting fissures on the surface of the anode allow the precious lithium ions to escape, forming hair-like or mossy growths, called dendrites. Dendrites, in turn, short circuit the battery and shorten its life. Preventing this build-up is the first challenge of using lithium for the battery's anode. The second engineering challenge is that a lithium anode is highly chemically reactive with the electrolyte. It uses up the electrolyte and reduces battery life. An additional problem is that the anode and electrolyte produce heat when they come into contact. Lithium batteries, including those in use today, can overheat to the point of fire, or even explosion, and are, therefore, a serious safety concern. But the new break through could mean these problems will become a thing of the past.","The breakthrough, by engineers from Stanford University, California, could revolutionise technology from electric cars to smartphones .

The art experts and internet giant are working together to create a web platform, but Hockney's won’t be sold alongside any old household items. The aim of the partnership is to make it easier for millions of people worldwide to view and buy works of art, antiques and collectibles online. Sotheby's and ebay are building a new web platform to make it easier for people across the globe to view and buy works of art, antiques and jewellery online - instead of sitting in an auction room (pictured) Online bidders competed for 17 per cent of the total lots offered in 2013. John James Audubon’s elephant-folio The Birds of America sold in April 2014 for $3.5million (£2million) - marking a new record for an online purchase in a live auction at Sotheby’s. The number of lots purchased online in 2013 increased 36 per cent versus 2012. More than half of all lots sold were in the $5,000-$100,000 (£2,900-£58,300) range in 2013. Around a third of all BIDnow bidders had never bought from Sotheby’s prior to 2013. The number of visitors to sothebys.com on mobile devices doubled in 2013 versus 2012. Mobile traffic in 2014 accounts for a quarter of total Sotheby’s website traffic. Bruno Vinciguerra, CEO of Sotheby’s said that the auction house wants to reach ‘the broadest possible audience around the world'. As technology evolves and mobile commerce becomes ubiquitous, collectors are increasingly purchasing high-end items online and even on-the-go from their mobile devices. Online bidders competed for 17 per cent of the total lots offered in 2013 and this figure is rising. In 2013 alone, the number of artworks bought online increased by 36 per cent and online art sales are expected to reach $13billion (£8billion) by the end of the decade. The platform will first be in action for live auctions streamed from Sotheby’s New York rooms, to allow ‘real-time bidding from anywhere in the world’. As technology evolves and mobile commerce becomes ubiquitous, collectors are increasingly purchasing high-end items online and even on-the-go from their mobile devices (illustrated with a stock image) Bidders will be able to buy online from 18 categories to start with – including jewellery, photographs, wine and watches, which Sotheby’s said are popular online. No launch date for the service has yet been revealed, but the auction house said that it will be rolled out for themed sales and live auctions from other sales rooms across the world in due course. ‘The growth of the art market, new generation technology and our shared strengths make this the right time for this exciting new online opportunity, Mr Vinciguerra said. Devin Wenig, president of eBay Marketplaces, said that the partnership marks ‘a significant milestone in our efforts to expand the live auction market’.

Instagram may be filled with animal photos, but now a new breed of 'social petworks' is taking pet photography to a new level . For instance, YummyPets launched in the UK last year after proving popular in France. YummyPets closely resembles Facebook, and as well as letting owners post photos and updates for their pets, the site helps put them in touch with useful and local pet services. It can also be used to find missing pets, and features an instant messaging service. Elsewhere, MySocialPetwork looks like a Pinterest for pets. Grids of animals photos are organised by tags, and photos can be liked. Users begin by choosing from a range of sounds to peak their pet’s interest, including cat meows, squeak toys, doorbells and a bag of treats rustling. The sound is triggered by tapping the shutter, hopefully getting the dog to deliver its best expression before the photo is taken. Reviews seem to agree that the sounds make pups look straight into the frame. Social petwork: BarkCam also has its own built-in social network to share doggy photos.

"By . Alex Finnis . An 18-carat gold timepiece considered 'the Holy Grail of watches' is expected to sell for a record-breaking $16.5m at auction. The celebrated Henry Graves Supercomplication is a masterpiece of horology - the science of measuring time - and took eight years to make by hand. Swiss watchmaker Patek Philippe was commissioned to make it by New York banker Henry Graves in 1925, and it is considered to be the most complicated watch ever made. An 18-carat gold Henry Graves Supercomplication timepiece considered 'the Holy Grail of watches' is expected to sell for more than $16.5m at auction . Tim Bourne, Sotheby's Worldwide Head of Watches, said: 'The list of superlatives which can be attached to this icon of the 20th century is truly extraordinary. 'Indisputably the ""Holy Grail"" of watches, The Henry Graves Supercomplication combines the Renaissance ideal of the unity of beauty and craftsmanship with the apogee of science.' The 18-carat gold openface watch was the culmination of three years of research and two years of painstaking craftsmanship. The watch last sold at Sotheby's in 1999 for $11m and became the most expensive of all time to sell at auction. Now it looks set to break its own record . The watch features a perpetual calendar, moon phases, sidereal time, power reserve, and indications for time of sunset and sunrise and the night sky of New York City. It has 24 horological complications and was considered the 'world's most complicated watch' for 56 years, according to Sotheby's. A horological complication is any feature on  that indicates something other than hours or minutes. Only with the advent of computer-assisted machines to aid technical perfection in watch making today has any timepiece surpassed the Henry Graves' ingenuity. This is the second time it is being sold at auction, after being bought in 1999 for a record-breaking $11m. It became the most expensive timepiece ever sold at auction, but is now set to enter the record books for a second time. The sale will come among Sotheby's lots of important watches in Geneva in November, to coincide with celebrations for Patek Philippe's 175th anniversary. Unsurprisingly, the Henry Graves Supercomplication, which is a minute repeating chronograph clockwatch with Westminster chimes, is the highlight. Sotheby's first sold the watch in New York in December 1999, as part of a sale of 81 masterpieces from the world-renowned Time Museum. Daryn Schnipper, chairman of Sotheby's Watch Division, said: 'Our offering of this horological work of art in 1999 was unquestionably the highlight of our professional careers and set a world record which has held until today. 'We are extremely privileged to be offering it once again.' It will go under the hammer on November 11.","Henry Graves Supercomplication going under hammer at Sotheby's .

"By . Alex Finnis . An Orthodox rabbi was shot dead as he walked to a Miami temple, in what his daughter is calling a hate crime. Police and Jewish community leaders believe the incident, which left 60-year-old Joseph Raksin dead, was part of a botched robbery, and had no religious incentive. But Mr Raksin's daughter, Shully Lepokovski, told WSVN.com: 'I believe it was a hate crime, simply because he was a Jew.' Izzy, far left, prays alongside several rabbis over his father-in-law Joseph Raksin, a 60-year-old Orthodox rabbi from Brooklyn, New York, as Raksin lies in the back of a hearse . According to the Miami Herald, on July 28, police reported that swastikas were spray-painted on the front pillars of a Northeast Miami-Dade synagogue, amid the ongoing conflict over Gaza, leading to concerns the shooting may be linked. Brian Siegal, director of the American Jewish Committee's Miami and Broward Regional Office, told the Herald: 'Our deepest condolences to the [Raksin] family for this tragic loss. We are confident the police will take the matter seriously and will give them time to investigate. 'Coming so soon and so close to the synagogue that was vandalized last week with swastikas and pro-Hamas graffiti, obviously we're suspicious that it's linked, but that remains to be seen.' Fellow rabbis turned out to mourn Mr Raksin, who his daughter believes was the victim of hate crime . A group of woman and girls prays for Mr Raksin. Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Elena Hernandez says there is no indication that the shooting was a hate crime . The Brooklyn, New York rabbi, who is a father-of-six and was in Florida visiting his two daughters and grandchildren, was walking along Northeast 175th Street and Eighth Court around 9am on Saturday, when two men approached him. Police said there was an altercation before Mr Raksin was shot, but Yona Lunger, a Jewish community activist, said he spoke to a witness who told him he was shot immediately by one of the men. He was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he later died. Police said Mr Raksin was heading to Bais Menachem Chabad, a synagogue just a few blocks away, as it was the Sabbath, an important day of religious observance for Orthodox Jews. The Anti-Defamation League says it has been in close contact with lead investigators and the crime appears to be a robbery gone badly . Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Elena Hernandez says there is no indication that the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities have not released a motive, but the Anti-Defamation League says it has been in close contact with lead investigators and the crime appears to be a robbery gone badly. Orthodox Jews do not carry and money or possessions with them on the Sabbath, as it is their holy day. The incident has left the neighbourhood and Miami's Jewish community shaken. Joseph Waks, a friend of Mr Raksin and his family, told WSVN.com: 'This has a big effect in the community. A rabbi [shot] walking to temple. I've got two beautiful children. I walk to temple with them every Sabbath in Miami Beach. It's devastating.' Police are searching for two young suspects. One was apparently on a bicycle and the other on foot. It it believed they fired just one shot before fleeing the scene. A witness described one of the men to be wearing a yellow shirt, and the other an orange shirt. The community is offering a $50,000 reward for information that helps lead to an arrest.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Naked dog door girl revealed: The girl who gained widespread internet notoriety when she crawled naked through a stranger's dog door has spoken out to tell her side of the story . A Texas woman who won internet infamy last year for crawling through a stranger's dog door naked has spoken out to reveal the motives behind her seemingly bizarre action. Sara Soto, who was 25 when she became 'naked doggy door girl,' told her side of the story to MTV in a bid to legitimize the strange decision she made in spring 2012. Instead of a wild night of boozing and partying, her telling begins with her parents admitting to her for the first time that she is adopted. 'I’d just found out I don’t know who my father or mother is,' Soto told MTV while explaining that the situation was too much to handle, so she got in the car and just drove west. 'I had spun out of control because of an 18-wheeler, and I wind up in a ditch. I manage to make it out of there, walk down the freeway,' she said. There were offers for help, but Soto said they were from creeps. She managed to make her way to a police station, where an officer took her report. 'I explained to the cop where it happened. He gets my car towed,' she said. However, Soto claims the police did not offer to allow her to use the phone to call for help. With no one to drive her home, Soto set off down an unfamiliar road in the town of Weatherford, some 60 miles from home at around midnight. 'I walk toward some houses,' she told MTV. 'Maybe somebody will let me use their phone. I knocked on six houses and nobody opened the door.' Scared, alone and in a strange place, Soto, who is an amateur rapper and goes by the name Sara Toke-a-lot, hatched her plan B. Good plan? Soto says her march toward infamy started when her parents told her for the first time hours before that she's adopted. She took off and go into an accident. One thing led to another and she was naked in a stranger's home looking for a phone to call home for help . 'If I take off my dress at this doggy door,' she remembered thinking. 'I cannot get blamed for stealing anything.' This is where Soto's story and the one told to millions on the internet differ: most people believe she squeezed her tiny, 110 pound frame through the pet door. Soto claims she merely reached in and unlocked the door. Soto, an amateur rapper who goes by the name Sara Toke-a-lot, was issued an arrest warrant the very day she told MTV her side of the story--it would be her third stemming from the incident . Either way, she made it into the home, but says an alarm soon went off. Panicked and unable to see a phone, she hid in a bathtub. It was there that at least her plan to disarm the homeowners with her nudity worked. The husband of the couple who lived there had a decidedly collected reaction when he found her. ‘Honey, there’s a girl in the bathroom,’ he said to his wife, who understandably told him to call the cops. Upon her arrest, Soto claimed she was not intoxicated, though the authorities would tell MTV that she was likely high. However, at one point she was transferred to a psychiatric facility before she finally made it home. Soto continues to maintain she was not stoned, but unfortunately for her the legal woes from that April night continue to haunt her. Thanks to some continued infractions, Soto had an arrest warrant issued on the very day she spoke to MTV, her third stemming from the incident. To this day, she claims she's recognized by people and for that reason has not applied to a job. Instead, she's getting her rap career on track. 'I’m happy about it, I’m already working on my music. I didn’t mean to do all this,' she told MTV. 'it was like a publicity stunt, but I didn’t do it for that. I’m just wild and free, and that’s what America’s supposed to be about, right?'

"By . Joshua Gardner . Yet another small child has reportedly ingested a detergent pod as instances of accidental poisonings with the colorful gels continue to mount. Thirteen-month-old Minnesota girl Zoe Mishler had been eating blueberries when she popped one of the dazzling blue laundry packets into her mouth. Instead of a burst of berry flavor, the poor little girl received near-fatal chemical burns in her mouth and down her throat. Calamity: A little girl named Zoe in Burnsville, Minnesota endured a week of intensive care after a detergent pod she bit into exploded down her throat . Enticing: Colorful packaging and bright, candy-like pods have likely helped cause some 20,000 cases of accidental ingestion since the gel packs became popular in 2012 . Zoe spent a week in intensive care, reports KMSP, and remains in recovery at home where she requires frequent nebulizer treatments to her burned throat. For her mother Ellen Mishler, every moment of pain her daughter experiences is agonizing. 'All I wanted to do is take the pain away from her,' she told KMSP. While wrenching, this family's brush with calamity is all but uncommon. Zoe is one of over 100 cases of accidental detergent pod ingestion this year in Minnesota alone. While none of those have been fatal, not all children have been so lucky. And according to Consumer Reports, some 20,000 calls have been made to poison control centers since the pods gained widespread popularity in 2012. A mother's agony: 'All I wanted to do is take the pain away from her,' Ellen Mishler said as she recalled the terrifying days after her daughter's accident, from which the little girl is still recovering . Recovering: Zoe still requires frequent nebulizer treatments to help ease the suffering from her burned throat . Like in Zoe's case, ingestion can cause extreme burns, vomiting and diarrhea. In extreme cases, death can result. Pod manufacturers like Proctor & Gamble have introduced more child-resistant tops to combat the problem. Likewise, Sam's Club--which made the version of laundry pods that poisoned Zoe--says they're moving towards a safer product. 'Sam’s Club takes consumer safety seriously… we have added safety and cautionary language… and transitioned from transparent opaque pouches and tubs,” the company told KMSP in a statement.","Zoe Mishler of Minnesota is on the path to recovery after suffering serious chemical burns in her mouth and throat .

A wealthy New York City socialite non-too-pleased with the prospect of living next door to France's top diplomat to the U.S. has thrown a wrench in the country's $7.8 million attempt to buy an official residence in her Manhattan co-op building. Not on her watch: New York City socialite Elizabeth Kabler upended the sale of a long languishing apartment in her co-op because she didn't like the idea of a French ambassador moving in . Ambassador François Delattre and the French government will have to continue their search for stateside digs now that Elizabeth Kabler, resident of famous East Side co-op tower dubbed River House, has gotten her way. Fearful of too many guests, constant entertaining and of a neighbor who fancies himself above the law, Kabler penned waged a biter campaign to urge her fellow stakeholders to block the sale of the 14-room co-op to French , or any foreign emissaries. The Wall . Street Journal obtained a letter Kabler wrote to her neighbors in June . after France first made their bid for the place in May. 'It . is not in the interests of the residents of River House to cohabit with . foreign emissaries who are, to a large extent, beyond the reach of the . law,' Kabler wrote. Built . in 1931, River House offers sweeping views on the East River just a . couple of blocks from United Nations Plaza. Considered one of New York's . finest apartment buildings, it would have been a choice spot for . Delattre and for subsequent ambassadors. '[The . ] 5 Bedroom, 5.5 Bathroom, duplex offers the grace and flow of a bygone . era with oversized rooms, 10'6"" ceilings, fine proportions and large . windows,' reads the official Sotheby's listing. The home boasts a library and formal dining room, three maid's bedrooms and a maid's bath, according the listing. While . the French agreed to limits on the number of armed guards in the . building and to limits on sovereign immunity, Kabler's efforts would . ultimately doom the purchase. After . the socialite's campaign, the board placed tight restrictions on the . number of parties the Ambassador would be allowed and on the number of . guests allowed at each. The good life: The famous Art Deco River House is one of New York City's finest buildings, but some say its intimidating co-op board has tarnished its appeal . Still looking: France's Ambassador to the US François Delattre wanted to make the 14-room East Side duplex the permanent home of the French ambassador, but his parties, armed guards and diplomatic immunity soured the deal for residents of River House . Perhaps . it was Kabler's family ties to diplomacy--her philanthropist mother . Leonore Annenberg held the rank of ambassador as chief of protocol under . President Ronald Reagan and her stepfather Walter Annenberg was a U.S. ambassador to the U.K.--that fed her fears, but they came at an . inopportune time for the building. The . apartment, while among the choicest in the city, has been on the market . for years and seen its asking price cut several times. Perhaps . it was for that reason that the broker who handled the almost-sale now . maintain there was absolutely 'no backlash' following the diplomat's . offer. 'This . is not an increasing trend,' Sotheby's broker Pat Wheatley told . Expatica.

'My . name has been intentionally left out of the stories, replaced by the . name of the 12-year-old daughter of my former supervisor’s best friend,' Jud wrote on Facebook. 'The little girl did a science fair project based on my . PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED DISCOVERY of lionfish living in low-salinity . estuarine habitats.' To Jud's credit, Lauren attended his lectures on lionfish as she was doing . her own research two years ago for her sixth grade science project. She also cited Jud's work in her report, notes the Washington Post. Lauren's . claim is not to have discovered lionfish can live in less saline . environments, says her father, but it's that she took Jud's work to the . next step by determining just how fresh water can be before the fish . will die. I thought we were friends: Lauren's dad says his daughter's feelings are hurt by Jud's accusations and says the little girl merely took Jud's findings a step further . 'Clearly she did not discover lionfish were in the estuary,' Lauren's father Albrey Arrington told the Washington Post. 'Lauren predicted experimentally how far up the estuary they could invade.' Arrington says he even has proof that Jud was himself shocked by Lauren's findings, which she made by changing the salinity inside tanks holding the venomous fish, in the form of emails. 'Craig (Layman, Jud's former boss and Mr. Arrington's friend) told me about the 6 ppt feeding, but I didn’t know she ramped them back up to 27 ppt in 2 hours with no ill effects,' Jud wrote in 2012, according to an e-mail shared with The Washington Post. 'That’s crazy.' Jud explains away this by saying he tends to 'overstate the excitement and importance of kids’ discoveries' in order to encourage them. At least one outlet that previously publicized Lauren's accomplishment has since apologized to Jud, who nonetheless appears to see the damage as done. 'This has been one of the most disappointing experiences in my academic career,' he said. Neither is 13-year-old Lauren unscathed by the acrimony. 'When I first kind of told my daughter what was happening,' Arrington said, 'she looked at me honestly with a confused look and said, ""I thought Dr. Jud and I were friends.’” Lionfish: The venomous, fast-breeding fish is taking over reefs up and don the East Coast. Research shows it could also be miles up our rivers thanks to a previously unknown ability to survive in nearly fresh water . Lionfish, a tropical native of the Indian and Pacific oceans likely introduced through the pet trade, have been colonizing swaths of the Caribbean and Atlantic for years - from the U.S. Eastern Seaboard and the hard-hit Bahamas to the Gulf of Mexico. The a striped saltwater species with a flowing mane of venomous spines, damage reefs and devour native fish, and they are eaten only by sharks — or larger lionfish. They have been such a worrying problem that divers in the Caribbean and Florida are encouraged to capture them whenever they can to protect reefs and native marine life already burdened by pollution, overfishing and the effects of climate change. Across the region, governments, conservation groups and dive shops have been sponsoring fishing tournaments and other efforts to go after slow-swimming lionfish to try and stave off an already severe crisis. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched a campaign in 2010 urging the U.S. public to 'eat sustainable, eat lionfish!' But just because shallow waters hugging coastlines have seen declines, the fast-breeding species is hardly on the way out. Fat, football-sized lionfish are daily caught in fishing pots set in deeper waters that spear fishermen and recreational divers never see.","Florida teen Lauren Arrington won third place and her 15 minutes of fame with a project about lionfish .

"The argument occurred as the pilot cruised down wrong taxiway at the Atlanta airport . The pilot took offense at what he called the controller's 'bad attitude' over the mistake . By . Joshua Gardner . Shocking audio of a heated exchange between a Delta pilot and an air traffic controller has flyers wondering just who's in charge of keeping them safe during air travel. All the more disturbing is the time when moment the argument occurred: just as the pilot was landing the jet at the Atlanta airport on the wrong taxiway. 'Like, oh my God, there's another plane out there like six miles away,' mocks the pilot. Scroll down for video . In danger? An airline pilot and air traffic controller are heard getting into a heated argument in newly released audio that has some flyers wondering if the people charged with taking care of them are doing a proper job . The pilot was on the taxiway called Mike and another plane was on its way to that very taxiway. 'Delta 2242, you're supposed to be on Mike,' the unnamed, coolheaded air traffic controller says in audio posted to LiveATC.net. 'Yes sir,' the pilot responds. 'We're going out there now.' The aitr traffic controller responds: 'It looks like you joined Lima,' in reference to the taxiway on which the pilot had actually landed. That's when the pilot gets nasty. 'You know what,' he snaps, 'We'll taxi out there any way we want when you tell us to. I don't like your attitude.' Still, the Atlanta controller, charged with keeping hundreds of thousands of passengers per day safe at America's busiest airport, stayed cool. 'Good morning, there was no attitude. i was just trying to correct you. That's my job to correct you if you mess up,' he said. The pilot again accuses the air traffic controller of being the one neglecting his duties before another pilot on the same frequency chimes from another plane to sum the confrontation perfectly. 'Settle down, Captain Happy,' he quips.","The argument occurred as the pilot cruised down wrong taxiway at the Atlanta airport .

"By . Joshua Gardner . The mystery of how a little Maltese named Reese ended up 1,800 miles from his Texas home after going missing for seven years has been solved and a struggle over his ownership has cropped up in its place. Reese, who disappeared all those years ago, showed up on the side of a Washington State highway over the weekend before a microchip identified Dinah Miller of Tyler, Texas as his owner. The pooch was flown back to Texas and into Miller's giddy embrace on Monday, but now the family who lost him near Tacoma has filled in Reese's years-long gap in history are desperate to have him back. But Miller says, 'No way!' despite already having two other Maltese pups. Mourning a loss: The Davis family says they lost Reese--the Maltese they call Harley--over the weekend, which led his original owner from over seven years ago to get the dog back . Not giving him up: Dinah Miller has two other Maltese pooches and says she won't give up Reese to the Davis family . She's also unfazed, it seems, by the tears of 2-year-old little girl from Spanaway, Washington who called the dog Harley, and her closest friend, up until this weekend. 'Harley is my daughter’s best friend. That’s her little buddy. They do everything together,' Kelli Davis told KHOU. Davis and her family say they adopted the Maltese six years ago in Mesquite, Texas--near Dallas. Back then, he was marked as an owner surrender and records don't show whether his microchip was ever scanned. Best friends: Kelli Davis says Reese, or Harley as they called him for six years, should be in their home and that her 2-year-old daughter is distraught over him being gone . Legal bind: Legal experts say Reese is Miller's under the law because she owned the dog when he was microchipped . The Davis family would later relocate to Washington from Texas, which explains how Reese got so far from home. After seeing their beloved Harley on the news, the Davis family hoped to get their dog back. No such luck, says original owner Miller. 'I don’t know what to do. We just lost a part of our family,' said Davis. Meanwhile, legal experts say that Miller is the legal owner because she initially gave Reese his microchip. And confident he's back home her for good, Miller says she'll be treating Reese like a king. Reunion no one expected: Dinah Miller,center, holds her Maltese Reese, who vanished without a trace from her Texas home 7 years ago and was found along a busy Tacoma, Washington road this weekend . It's an untidy ending to a story that only days before had seemed so heartwarming. The simple, if somewhat mysterious, reunion of a pet owner and her beloved dog over seven years in the making. 'We drove, we searched,' Miller told KHOU about the day Reese went missing from a friend's home near Dallas. 'We walked, we looked over fences, we peeped everywhere we could without getting shot.' Reese was gone and would stay that way for years. Until by what Miller believed was a miracle, he came back. A Washington vet had scanned Reese's microchip and traced him to Miller. 'We cannot believe it, we just can't believe it,' Miller told KHOU as she anxiously awaited her old pal's arrival on a United flight to Houston alongside her daughter Tisha Reed. 'Hopefully they'll just pick up where they left off,' Reed said as Reese's plane was en route. Once he arrived, Reed's hopes came true. Footage shows a reunion that could not have been warmer as Reese scrambled frantically from his crate to be with Miller. 'Just to hold him again and love him for the rest of his life,' said Reed. 'I know it means a lot to my mom.' If dogs could talk: No one knows where Reese has been for the last seven years or how she traveled 1,800 miles .","Reese vanished from a Texas home and was found alongside a busy road in Washington State this weekend .

"By . Joshua Gardner . One in every 25 New Yorkers is a millionaire, reveals a study out Tuesday. That shockingly high number comes from a survey conducted by Spear's magazine along with wealth consultancy WealthInsight, which sought to identify the top 20 cities in the world by millionaire density. The results mean that out of bustling New York's 8 million-plus people, some 389,100 are millionaires. Can you spot them? New York City and Manhattan in particular is home to the world's fourth largest population of millionaires and the most billionaires . Meanwhile, New York is home to the most billionaires in the world. But New York, with its 4.63 percent, is just fourth in the world's top 20 for millionaires. The study found that the riviera city-state of Monaco can claim the most millionaires. There, a shocking 29.21 percent of residents makes seven figures. Just below Monaco is Zurich, where a none-too-shabby 27.34 percent of the populace is a millionaire. Puttin' on the Ritz: Monaco came in at No.1 on the list of top millionaire cities.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A South Carolina mom arrested for leaving her 9-year-old at a playground while she worked a shift at McDonald's is now out of a job. Debra Harrell was arrested for unlawful neglect of a child on June 30 when a stranger called police after finding the little girl alone on the North Augusta playground, a 600 yard walk from her mother's workplace. Another stranger has now taken up the mother's cause and started a fundraiser for Harrell that has topped $30,000. Unfairly accused? Debra Harrell was arrested June 30 after leaving her 9-year-old daughter at a playground while she worked her shift at McDonald's . Arrested: Debra was booked on unlawful child neglect charges and while she's been freed on bond, her daughter was placed in state custody, where she remains . That's a good for Harrell, since it's been revealed the 46-year-old is now out of a job and her daughter, now in state custody, is at present without a mother. On Tuesday, Harrell's attorney Robert Phillips told the Huffington Post that Harrell had been let go from her job, but that he didn't know why. 'She is currently unemployed,' he said. However, McDonald's spokesperson Lisa McComb maintained that Harrell's lack of a job was not the company's doing. 'It would not be appropriate to discuss an employment matter in the media, but I can confirm that this employee has not been terminated,' McComb wrote in statement. While the reason behind her joblessness is unclear, Harrell quite clearly needed the work enough to leave her daughter unattended in a playground. But many critics who initially judged her for her apparently heartless action have likely since given Harrell the benefit of a doubt. One woman, a complete stranger to Harrell, has become especially wrapped up in the working mom's cause and started a fundraiser to support her with huge success. That woman, Clair Ryan, makes the case for supporting Harrell on a YouCaring page she's set up for that purpose. 'It was . very likely a choice that Debra would not have made were there other . reasonable and affordable options available,' Ryan writes. Ryan says Harrell has been unfairly portrayed by some media outlets. 'Contrary to many reports, while the park . would be more than a mile from Debra's workplace by car, it is only a . few thousand feet - maybe a 5 minute walk - by foot,' she writes. 'The . little girl was given a cell phone so she could call her mom at any . time.' Opposing views: A complete stranger has taken up Harrell's cause with a fundraiser that has topped $30,000. That woman, Clair Ryan, says that while the playground is a mile from Harrell's McDonald's by car, its is around 600 yards on foot . Ryan says Harrell only chose to send her daughter to the playground after the laptop computer the 9-year-old once played on in the restaurant while her mother worked was stolen from their home. Ryan's YouCaring page for Harrell had already tripled its $10,000 goal. And with 21 days to go and support building for the mother, she and her daughter will likely get far more than $30,000. Which is more than enough to get the little girl a new computer and into a good summer camp or day care. While Harrell may have those blessings to look forward to, for now she remains out of jail on bond as she awaits trial, her daughter languishing in the state's care. 'Taking her daughter away has also surely been a slap in the face to Debra, writes Ryan. 'It sends a message that as a working mom, all her efforts are just not good enough.' 'Currently unemployed': Since Harrell's June 30 arrest, she has reportedly cut ties with the McDonald's location where she worked. The company says they did not fire her, while Harrell's attorney said Monday the 46-year-old is 'currently unemployed'","South Carolina mom Debra Harrell was arrested June 30 after her daughter was found playing alone as her mother worked a shift .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Associated Press . The mother of the then 7-year-old boy molested by the fugitive killed in a daytime Manhattan shootout Monday has spoken out to convey her relief. 'I'm relieved the threat is gone,' the unnamed San Diego mother told the new York Daily News on Tuesday, just a day after NYPD detectives and U.S. Marshals cornered pedophile Charles Mozdir, who was killed as part of the ensuing Greenwich Village showdown. One of those detectives has emerged as a hero of the day after managing to survive being hit by three bullets as he helped bring Mozdir to justice. Scroll down for video . An injured U.S. Marshall sits on the sidewalk outside a West Village, NYC smoke shop after being shot on Monday by pedophile Charles Mozdir . Cops: Heavily armed police investigate the shooting, which left Charles Mozdir dead and one of the officers shot three times. That officer, Mario Muniz, was celebrated Tuesday by both his mother and the relieved mother of the then 7-year-old boy Mozdir molested . Discovered: Sex offender Charles Mozdir, 33, had been on the run for two years prior to being shot dead following a dramatic shoot-out in New York City on Monday afternoon. He's apparently been hiding in plain sight . Mario Muniz is that detective. The 45-year-old has 20 years of service with the NYPD under his belt and had recently been given a promotion. And as Muniz recovered Tuesday, his proud mother spoke out about her hero son. 'Everyone told me he is one of the best. He is a first-grade detective,' Carmen Muniz told The New York Post. 'He is a hero but I don’t want him to be a hero. I want him to be alive.' Nonetheless, Mrs. Muniz, who lives in Queens with her son and family, remains proud. 'I just want him to come home. I’m going to put up a sign saying ""Welcome Home,""' she said. 'I am going to cook him whatever he wants.' No doubt, the California mother is also counting her blessings, Muniz maybe chief among them. She says she's . 'I want to send my deepest appreciation to the officers,' she said. 'My family and I are so comforted that we don't have this threat hanging over us anymore.' The mother explained that she knew the 33-year-old before he molested her son and then fled California for New York. 'He was a wolf in sheep's clothing,' she said of Mozdir, who was found hiding in plain site as he worked at a Manhattan smoke shop. 'He was the type of person who thought he was smarter than everyone else. So that's exactly how I think he would try to hide. Blend in and disguise himself.' When the Daily News told the mother that Mozdir was living under the name John Smith, she was appalled. 'That's creepy,' said the mom, who's husband is named John. 'I don't know if he did it because of my husband, but he always had a little bit of an obsession with my husband.' Injured: Two U.S. Marshals and an NYPD detective were wounded in the shooting which erupted at around 1pm Monday in New York City's West Village . Mozdir is seen being carried out of the shop on a stretcher on Monday after he pulled a gun on officers. He died in hospital . The shootout Monday between Mozdir and members of the New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force happened just after 1 p.m. in Greenwich Village not far from New York University in a highly trafficked tourist area bounded by jazz clubs, restaurants, a subway station and a basketball court. Mozdir's handgun was recovered at the scene, and 20 extra rounds of ammunition were found in his pocket, Police Commissioner William Bratton said. A police detective first entered the narrow smoke shop and identified Mozdir, who apparently was alone, Police Commissioner Bratton said, before leaving and returning with the U.S. marshals. The detective was shot at least twice, in the stomach below his protective vest and in the right chest, which could have been deadly were it not stopped by the vest, Bratton said at a hospital. One U.S. marshal was shot in the elbow and another in his buttocks, he said. All three were in stable condition and had been visited by city and federal officials. Saved by the vest: NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Bill De Blasio hold up the police detective's bullet-proof vest on Monday to show where he was shot. They said the item likely saved his life . Mayor Bill de Blasio said the three officers are stable and that, 'We pray everything we are hearing is true and that these officers will be OK in the long run' The detective didn't fire his weapon, but the federal agents fired multiple rounds, authorities said. 'They do what law enforcement personnel do every day,' Mayor Bill de Blasio said. 'They have to put their lives on the line to protect the rest of us.' A $1 million bench warrant was issued for Mozdir's arrest in June 2012 after he skipped an arraignment in San Diego Superior Court on child sexual assault charges, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney said. Mozdir, a wedding photographer, also had been charged with attempting to dissuade a witness from prosecution, the criminal complaint said. He had posted $250,000 bail. Mozdir's . case had recently been featured on CNN's 'The Hunt with John Walsh.' Mozdir was accused of abusing the boy while babysitting him, and . authorities later found evidence of child pornography and bestiality on . his cellphone and computers, according to the show's website, quoting . federal authorities. Authorities had searched for him in Coronado, Georgia, California and Mexico, the show said. The .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and James Nye . A leaked memo reveals that high-ranking executives at Comcast admit the excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly their fault. Taking the blame: An internal memo from Comcast COO Dave Watson blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics . The company's chief operating officer Dave Watson says in his memo that the nagging, begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by Ryan Block was part of what Comcast paid and trained the employee to do. 'It was painful to listen to this call, and I am not surprised that we have been criticized for it,' Watson says in the document first leaked to Consumerist. The memo . surfaced just a week after the call to Engadget founder Ryan Block--who . recorded it and put it on Soundcloud, where it's now been played over 5 . million times--went viral. 'We . are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to . the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote. Comcast has since confirmed the authenticity of the call and issued an apology. 'We . are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to . the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote. 'Why . is it that you don't want the faster speed? Help me understand why you . don't want faster Internet?' demands the Comcast rep in one portion of . the call after Block asks to cancel his service. Despite . Block being adamant that he wanted to cancel, the employee told him . that he had to be given a good reason or he wouldn't do it. This 'rude, unhelpful and condescending' behavior was 'straight up belligerent' according to a stunned Block. Only . eight minutes of the call were recorded because Block's wife was on the . phone to the rep for the first ten, during which he acted in the same . way to her. Interrogated: Ryan Block was confused by the unyielding attitude of a Comcast employee who refused to let him cancel his service with the cable giant unless he gave him a good reason . 'I . started the call by (very nicely) saying that we were moving, and that . we needed to cancel our service,' Block's wife, Veronica Belmont, wrote . in the description of the recording on SoundCloud.com. 'He asked if we wanted to move our current service. I said no, thank you, but we’ve already signed up for Astound.' 'The . representative continued aggressively repeating his questions, despite . the answers given, to the point where my wife became so visibly upset . she handed me the phone,' Block wrote in the audio description. 'Overhearing the conversation, I knew this would not be very fun.' As fellow annoyed consumers across America soon learned, it was not very fun.Despite that, Block would--like Watson--come to the employee's defense, at least in a way. In a statement to NPR, he too blamed the system that created the customer service rep and not the rep himself. 'Customer . retention and other CS departments often provide financial incentives . to representatives to prevent customers from disconnecting (among other . things),' he told NPR. 'That system effectively pits a representative . and the customer against one another. Everyone loses — except maybe the . cable company's bottom line, sometimes, if they 'save' an account.'","An internal memo from Comcast COO Dave Watson blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Associated Press . As weather conditions begin to favor the struggle to tame wildfires that have burned through hundreds of square miles in Washington State, incredible drone footage that drives home the truly devastating impact of the blaze has been released. Th aerial footage taken by Chelan HD Productions shows the communities devastated by the raging inferno across 370 scorched square miles of the Evergreen State. As of Sunday, authorities estimated the number of homes destroyed in the relentless inferno to be 150 and the shocking drone footage puts the ruin into startling perspective. Producers of the impressive footage encourage viewers to donate to those left without homes via the tip jar beneath their Vimeo video, here. Devastating: Drone footage taken by Chelan HD Productions of the devastation left behind by wildfires in Washington State is as captivating as it is shocking . Forecasters say calmer winds and cooler temperatures are headed for the fire-scorched region, conditions that could help firefighters in their battle against wildfires that have charred hundreds of square miles of terrain. Sunday's official estimate put the wildfire burning in north-central Washington at more than 370 square miles, compared with 260 square miles on Friday. The forecast for Monday and Tuesday calls for lighter winds and temperatures, said Spokane-based National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Koch. 'Overall, it looks like the weather scenario is improving,' Koch said. Then on Wednesday a 'vigorous' front is expected to cover Washington, bringing rain to much of the state. But it will also bring lighting, he added. Shocking: The blaze had continued unabated for a week by Sunday, when authorities placed the number of homes destroyed at 150 .

'The benefits of the system are still up in the air,' Koch said. 'We may get some rain where we need it, but we may also experience some lighting that could cause some new ignitions.' Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers estimates that 150 homes have been destroyed, but suspects that number could be higher. His deputies haven't been able to search parts of the county where homes are spread miles apart. No serious injuries have been reported, Rogers said. There are nearly 1,400 firefighters battling the flames, assisted by more than 100 fire engines, helicopters dropping buckets of water and planes spreading flame retardant. On Sunday, Rogers was driving to the town of Twisp to survey the damage. 'It's the first time in four days I've seen blue sky,' he said. 'Every day, when you got up, it was nothing but smoke. All we've seen of the sun is a red ball.' Although the weather is improving, the towns in the scenic Methow Valley remain without power and have limited landline and cellphone service. Okanogan County Public Utility District officials told KREM that fully restoring power to the area could take weeks. Not a sure thing: 'The benefits of the system are still up in the air,' Koch said.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Chicago man who was seriously gored by a bull July 9 during Pamplona's running of the bulls has spoken out from his Spanish hospital bed to detail his terrifying brush with death. Bill Hillman, who was on his tenth run, writes in the Washington Post that it wasn't his own ineptitude that got him impaled by the bull called Bravito. Instead, the American author of Fiesta: How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona claims it was several terrified and inexperienced British runners who inadvertently got him gored. Gored: Bill Hillman was one of a handful of runners at this year's running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain who were gored. He suffered a terrible gash to his thigh and remains in the hospital but has written a first-hand account of his brush with death in which he vows to run again . The harrowing moment: Here, Bill is seen being impaled in the leg by the bull named Brevito, meaning 'fierce one' Despite his harrowing experience, and before he was even released from the hospital, Hillman vowed to run again. 'Bravito, meaning ""fierce one,"" pierced his horn through my right thigh and lifted me into the air,' Hillman writes. Hillman says that he first tripped over the leg of one inexperienced British runner before another knocked him right into Bravito's horns. After the first goring, Hillman was knocked to the ground and gored once more. 'As I fell to the ground and scuttled toward the barricades on my back, Bravito gored my leg again,' he writes. 'When paramedics pulled me to safety, I saw a racquetball-size hole in my mid-thigh. Blood ran down my leg and flooded my shoe.' Hillman writes in the Washington Post that the men pictured in blue were inexperienced runners who inadvertently caused him to be gored . Some of his first thoughts were with his family: 'Go find my wife and tell her I'm sorry,' he told a man. Given more time to think back on his experience, he wasn't so sorry that he'd leave the tradition behind. 'I will keep running for another chance to lead a Spanish fighting bull up the street. When that happens, I become one with the fiercest, most majestic animal on Earth,' he says. Hillman, who says he was raised on the wrong side of the tracks by a former gangster father before making his own mistakes, reveals that running from the bulls is therapeutic for him. A Miura fighting bull gores another reveler during the running of the bulls at the San Fermin festival, one of several who were impaled in 2014 . Runners run ahead of a ''Miura''  fighting bull which tossed some runners during the running of the bulls, at the San Fermin festival, in Pamplona, Spain, Monday, July 14, 2014 . 'Being gored is part of the bull-running tradition,' he writes. 'The sense of danger — and the excitement of narrowly escaping it — are part of what got me into bull running. Danger has always been a part of my life.' Dozens of people are injured each year in the 'encierros,' as the runs are called in Spanish, most of them in falls. Two twenty-something Australians and five Spaniards, in addition to Hillman, were gored in this year's running of the bulls as part of the San Fermin festival. Fifteen people have died from gorings since record-keeping began in 1924.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Officer Facebook: 34-year-old Mary Ferguson is the Facebook Cop in Menlo Park whose $194,000 salary and benefits are paid for by the tech giant . A wealthy Silicon Valley town has partnered with Facebook to fund a brand new officer on its police force whose job, among other things, is to ensure privileged techie offspring stay 'on the up and up.' Meet Mary Ferguson, AKA the Facebook Cop, whose position was created through a highly unusual public-private partnership between tony Menlo Park and the social media giant. Over the next three years, Facebook agreed to pay $600,000 to the town, where the company also happens to be headquartered. Ferguson, 34, who's paid $194,000 in salary and benefits per year for her services, keeps an eye on the internet behavior of potentially unruly kids by using an online persona that hides her true identity. Ferguson's primary duties apart from patrolling Facebook include keeping children in school, working with juvenile offenders, and helping large area businesses equip themselves for natural disasters, campus shootings or other violent crimes, reports the Wall Street Journal. 'Mary is a pro-active police officer who enjoys working with kids,' Commander Dave Bertini told NBC Bay Area in March, when the force first accepted the funds. 'Her passion and enthusiasm for truancy abatement will drive the department’s program in a successful direction for the youth of Menlo Park.' While many residents of the well-off tech town appear happy with the unusual corporate partnerships, some people see a conflict of interest. Menlo Park Mayor Ray Mueller supports the partnership. 'Facebook . moved into a part of town that was blighted, that was hurting,' Mueller . told the WSJ. 'One of the first things we're seeing is this public . safety net coming down to protect everyone.' The Menlo Police veteran's new job is to stop student truancy in the well-off town of 32,000 and to patrol online using a fake identity in order to keep area kids on 'the up and up' Mueller brushed off suggestions that the tech giant is acting solely out of self interest. 'Anyone who has the perception that Facebook is trying to protect themselves really doesn't understand the situation,' he told the WSJ. 'That place is a fortress—they don't need the Menlo Park Police to protect them.' Some experts have their doubts. 'That raises some potential conflicts that, if I was the chief, I am not sure I'd want to wrestle with,' University of South Carolina criminal justice professor Geoffrey Alpert told the WSJ. Alpert said he worries about skewed loyalties. 'What do you tell your officers about how to treat people who work at Facebook?' he wondered. For it's part, Facebook has called the $600,000 donation a no-strings-attached gift. 'We just identified a need in the community,' Facebook spokesperson Genevieve Grdina told the WSJ. 'It's not the ""Facebook officer""; it's the officer for the whole community.' Dilemma? While some fear the unusual private-public partnership creates an ethical dilemma, others say Facebook is simply acting out of good corporate citizenship' (pictured is part of Facebook's sprawling Menlo Park campus)","Menlo Park, California has created a new position for Officer Mary Ferguson thanks to donation from Facebook .

Uber terrifying: New York business traveler Ryan Simonelli was in Washington DC when he says he was picked up by an Uber driver who then proceeded to flee from a city inspector in a high speed chase . An executive visiting Washington, DC says he was taken on a terrifying high-speed race down a busy freeway Monday by an Uber car service driver who held him against his will. Ryan Simonetti says he and two colleagues were traveling on business when he hopped into a car from the trendy service as an inspector spoke to the driver. The driver soon pulled off, but Simonetti and company quickly realized that--though the inspector wasn't quite done with his questioning--the driver was very much done being questioned. 'That . cop’s following you. What’s going on?' Simonetti, in an interview with . the Washington Post, recalled asking the driver as the car began to . accelerate. But the driver tried playing it cool as he headed toward I-395 and away from the District of Columbia. 'Oh . no, he’s not a real cop,' said the driver as the inspector continued . his pursuit. 'Sorry, we're going to have to run this red light.' In a scene Simonetti told the Post was like an episode of COPS, he tried desperately to get the driver to stop. He said he even resorted to getting physical with the driver. 'It was insane,' Simonetti said. 'I physically tried to force his leg to hit the brake. I ripped off his pant leg.' Even then the driver refused to stop. Only after Simonetti threatened to injure the man did he finally pull off at an exit. Scroll down for video . Crazed: Simonetti says he was taken on the 10-minute high speed ride out of DC and into Virginia where the driver finally dropped him and his colleagues off at an exit before fleeing again--the wrong way up an exit ramp . At that point, Simonetti said the inspector pulled in front in order to try and impede the driver from going any further. But even that wasn't enough to halt the Uber man's progress. He soon turned around and escaped by driving the wrong way up an exit ramp. Simonetti almost immediately spread the word about his shocking experience. 'Was . just kidnapped by an @uber driver in DC, held against my will, and . involved in a high speed chase across state lines with police #Crazy,' he tweeted. Though . crazy certainly is an apt description of the 10 or so minute chase, . Simonetti soon left the case to the proper authorities as his friends . and followers tweeted their horror.

However, the woman told a local TV station Tuesday that she accidentally left her keys inside the Jeep after placing her children in the backseat as the family were preparing to take off. And eyewitnesses have backed the woman's claims, saying that it was the mother who asked a passerby to break the window in her vehicle.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Miami police officer has been suspended pending an investigation into a brawl he had with an alleged speeding driver he recently pulled over who turned out to be his ranking officer. Officer Marcel Jackson didn't know he was pulling over a fellow cop when he made the traffic stop and was shocked when he says the driver lunged at him and told him to get back in his car. The driver turned out to be Lieutenant David Ramras with the force's internal affairs unit. Despite Ramras's apparent combativeness toward the uniformed officer, it's now Jackson who's been suspended. Scroll down for video . Cop vs. Cop: A routine traffic stop quickly turned into a brawl between Miami police officers after a uniformed cop pulled over his off-duty superior officer . Quickly devolves: After footage shows what appears to be Lieutenant David Ramras lunge at Marcel Jackson after he's pulled over, a brawl breaks out . As WPLG notes, it's Ramras who appears in video taken by Jackson's GoPro camera to lunge first. Miami police cruisers are not equipped with cameras and it's unknown why Jackson was taking video. The footage begins as Jackson is first pulling over the white Chevrolet, whose driver he would later say refused to stop at first. When the driver did stop, Jackson approached the car. When he asked for the driver's license and proof of insurance, the driver appears to fling his car door at Jackson and lunge. Jackson then easily overpowers Ramras, and wrestles him to the ground as passing officers swarm and leap atop Ramras. That's when things became awkward. Video shows . the altercation quickly coming to an end, presumably when all the men . learn that Ramras is a fellow cop with over twenty years experience. Jackson, meanwhile, stuck to his guns and suggested in the video that Ramras was pulling rank on him. Swarm: The altercation quickly escalates as more passing police swarm to the scene . Uncomfortable: An awkward moment soon came when all the responding officers realized they'd pulled over one of their own, a veteran of over 20 years . 'I'm like, I don't know who you are, Bro,' he said. 'I don't care if you're a lieutenant or whoever you are.' But that's precisely who Ramras was. Before the video ends, the lieutenant can be seen phoning someone as the officers linger at the scene. And now Jackson has been suspended as both officers are investigated by Miami authorities. While Ramras, unlike his inferior officer, has merely been reassigned and not suspended, the president of the local Fraternal Order of Police told WPLG that the law may be on Jackson's side. 'Time will tell how this will play out,' said Javier Ortiz. 'I believe that Officer Jackson was acting in good faith when he pulled over Lt. Ramras. Once the contact was made between the officer and the lieutenant, that’s where things get sketchy.' Jackson suggests in the video that Ramras was attempting to pull rank on him and get out of the ticket.

"By . Associated Press . and Mail Online Reporter . Flash-flooding in southern California claimed the life of at least one person on Sunday, as extreme rainfall wiped out dozens of homes and left thousands stranded by impassable roads. On Monday, the skies cleared and crews got to work clearing the roads and surveying and the damage done to some 30 homes in the Mount Baldy and Forest Falls area. Downpours punctuated with thunder and . lightning dumped nearly 5 inches on Mount Baldy and as much as 3 1/2 . inches on Forest Falls some 50 miles away, the National Weather Service . said. The sole victim of the afternoon's rain storm was identified as 48-year-old Joo Hwan Lee of El Segundo, who died after his white Toyota Prius was swept down a swollen creek and became wedged among boulders and a log. Scroll down for video . Fatality: El Segundo resident Joo Hwan Lee, 48, died on Sunday after his white Toyota Prius (pictured above) was swept down stream in a flash flood in southern California . Final minutes: A local resident saw Lee moments before he died, when he was parked on her road . Impact: Around 1,500 residents of Oak Glen and 1,000 at Forest Falls, both outside San Bernardino, were cut off by impassable roads in Sunday's storm. The areas are around 50 miles from Los Angeles . Local resident Angela Batistelli was returning home with groceries when she found Lee parked in her driveway. Hikers heading up 10,068-foot Mount San Antonio, also known as Mount Baldy, frequently park there and she asked the driver to move along. Rain was falling hard when she carried some bags up to her house perched on stilts. She saw the Prius down the street; its taillights were surrounded by water and then it was gone in the roar of water filling the canyon. Batistelli's car, a Toyota Echo, also washed away. It was found sticking straight up, its front end buried in the silt-filled streambed. Her 250-gallon propane tank was torn from the house and skipped down the street. Michael Honer also has a home overlooking Bear Creek and spoke of watching the stream flow for the first time in two years. At first, it carried only leaves. By the time the rain stopped an hour later, the flow had carried away logs, rocks and even cars, sweeping a driver to his death. 'The stream was a raging black torrent of debris and big logs and muddy, silty water,' Honer said Monday as he shoveled mud outside a friend's house above the creek. 'It was apocalyptic.' Aftermath: Jessica Gosney digs out her car on Monday, after rocks and mud inundated her home in the mountain community of Forest Falls in the San Bernardino Mountains . Wiped out: Debris and rocks are piled up outside a cabin in Bear Canyon in Mount Baldy, California on Monday .

Those who witnessed the flash flooding up close described a roar as waters surged down the mountains. George Smith of San Diego had been hiking up Mount San Gorgonio with a friend when they came to a wash that had been dry earlier in the day. 'We were just kind of deciding should we make a go of it, to cross or not, when there was a 10-foot high wall of water and debris and logs coming toward us,' he said.'It sounded like thunder coming down the river. Me and my friend had to scramble up a cliff to get out of the way of it.' The damage: Onlookers view rocks and mud and downed power lines from a mudslide . Cleaning up: A bulldozer clears boulders and mud from a road in the mountain community of Forest Falls on Monday . He and 12 other hikers huddled together and called 911. When the operator asked for a cross street they had to explain that they were in the forest. A woman who lives near Forest Falls lit a fire in her fireplace and let them dry out. Nearly 2,500 people, including a group of about 500 campers who spent the night at a community center near Forest Falls, were stranded in the woodsy communities until roads reopened Monday. San Bernardino County resources were stretched thin by the storm. Scores of swift-water rescue teams and fire engines had been dispatched to far-flung areas, county Fire Capt. Josh Wilkins said. In the Angeles National Forest, a group of four or five people and a dog were airlifted to safety. In Mount Baldy, home to a small ski area, dozens of mud-covered volunteers pitched in to dig out homes and cars inundated with dirt and rock. The most significant damage was on Goat Hill Road, where a landslide buried some homes up to their roofs.

"By . Associated Press . and Mail Online Reporter . The suburban Detroit homeowner who shot dead an unarmed 19-year-old black woman who knocked on his door last fall said he is haunted by his actions as he took the stand today in his second-degree murder trial. Theodore Wafer, 55, told the jury Monday that he feared multiple people were trying to break into his house when teen Renisha McBride banged on his door in the early hours of November 2, after she drunkenly got into a car accident. He added that he didn't know whether his shotgun was loaded when he opened the door and fired at McBride's head. 'It's devastating,' a tearful Wafer told the jury. 'She had her life in front of her. I took that from her.' Scroll down for video . Theodore Wafer took the stand on Monday to defend his actions in the November shooting death of 16-year-old Renisha McBride . In distress: Renisha McBride got into a car accident in the early hours of November 2 and knocked on Wafer's door, apparently looking for help . But Wafer also said that he feared for his life and that he didn't want to be a victim in his own home. 'I wasn't going to cower in my house,' Theodore Wafer said. Wafer . is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter and could be . sentenced to up to life in prison with the chance for parole, if he's . convicted. He says he shot McBride in self-defense, but prosecutors . argue that Wafer could have stayed safely behind his locked doors and . called 911 instead of confronting McBride, whom he didn't know. Softly and methodically, Wafer told the Wayne County Circuit Court jury how he followed loud bangs from his front door to his side door and back to the front again before fetching his 12-gauge shotgun. He said he opened the front door slightly and saw that the outer, screen door was damaged. He then opened the inner door further and 'this person came out from the side of my house so fast. I raised the gun and shot,' he told jurors after taking the stand on the seventh day of testimony. Wafer also said he thought there could have been more than one person outside of his 1,100-square-foot home near Detroit's far west side. He said he pulled the trigger 'to defend myself. It was them or me.' When police arrived, McBride lay in a pool of blood just off the porch. Self defense? Wafer told the jury that when he opened his screen door, he saw that it had been torn and thought someone was trying to break in. That's when he pulled the trigger no McBride. Wafer's home pictured above. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, civil rights activists questioned whether race may have been a factor. Wafer is white and McBride was black, and some likened the killing to that of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. But race faded as an issue and wasn't mentioned as a factor by prosecutors or defense attorneys during court hearings that preceded the trial. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors played a recording of Wafer telling an officer that he didn't know the gun was loaded. They contend that Wafer didn't need to use deadly force against McBrideAn autopsy found McBride's blood-alcohol level was about 0.22, which is nearly three times Michigan's legal limit for driving. About 3½ hours before Wafer killed her, McBride crashed her car into a parked vehicle on a Detroit street about half a mile away. To acquit Wafer, the jury would have to find that he shot McBride because he had a reasonable and honest fear for his life. Emotional: Wafer struggled to hold back tears when he took the stand on Monday, describing the events that led up to McBride's death . Occasionally rubbing the right side of his head and speaking with his eyes closed, Wafer testified that he bought the shotgun about six years ago. Wafer's lawyer, Cheryl Carpenter, asked if he had a security system installed at his home. He said no. 'I think everybody would like to have a security system in their house,' he said. 'I couldn't afford it.' The neighborhood had changed greatly since he bought the house in 1994, added Wafer, who appeared Monday to be fixated on his personal safety. 'My front door and screen door are usually always locked,' said Wafer, adding that the same goes for his back door. He said he uses the side door most often to get in and out and that the screen door on the side of his house is usually not locked. Profound loss: Walter Ray Simmons reacts to photos of his deceased daughter during Wafer's trial on Thursday, July 24 . Earlier Monday, a firearms expert testified for the defense that Wafer and McBride were both apparently standing close to his screen door when he shot her through it, killing her. Retired state Trooper David Balash said the hole in the door made by the shotgun blast shows it was near the door when he fired it. He said the buckshot wounds on McBride's body show she was standing near the door when Wafer shot her last fall. 'My opinion is she was very close to the door ... within a foot,' Balash told the jury. It is not clear how or why she showed up on Wafer's porch. They didn't know each other. Dr. Werner Spitz, a former medical examiner, testified last week that a laceration on McBride's hand shows she may have injured it while pounding on Wafer's door. But the doctor who performed the autopsy found nothing remarkable about her hand.","Theodore Wafer admitted to shooting dead 19-year-old Renisha McBride after she came knocking on his door last November looking for help .

Wilmington police are now investigating the death of a toddler who died late Friday after being hospitalized with heavy bruising and brain injuries whose cause has yet to be determined. A’Niah Davila-Torres, one-and-a-half years old, was brought severely injured to St. Francis Hospital Tuesday by a daycare provider and her boyfriend. Police began to probe the cause of the injuries, and a medical examiner photographed them Friday night shortly before she passed away. A¿Niah Davila-Torres, one-and-a-half years old, was brought severely injured to St. Francis Hospital Tuesday by a daycare provider and her boyfriend . The toddler's mother, Vinnia Davila, blames the daycare provider and contacted police. 'She's brain-dead,' she told The News Journal. Police have so far declined to characterize the investigation. 'All . I can say is that we’re investigating the alleged circumstances of the . baby’s injury,' said Wilmington Police Department spokesman Cpl. Jamaine Crawford. The girl's daycare provider has yet to be publicly identified. According to Davila, she left her daughter and son Aston, 2, at the woman's home Tuesday. The child care provider has been watching the children since A'Niah was 6 weeks old. Davila did not see her daughter again until she had been admitted to the hospital. The bruise over the left of the girl's face from forehead to chin and other around her right ear were the result of 'physical abuse,' a doctor told Davila. She says she was informed of her daughter's condition when the daycare provider sent a text to Davila's mother. The daycare provider left the girl at the hospital to work a night shift for Amazon. Upon reviewing the infant's injuries, doctors said there was no blood flow to the brain. A preliminary check of records by the state Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families could not find a listing of the unidentified child care provider having a license. As the family gathered around her hospital bed to say goodbye to A’Niah, brother Aston told them what he saw. 'As . soon as he saw her, he said, ‘They hit her, they hit her,’' said . his mother's cousin Morris.

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Just weeks after her luxurious 'she cave' became national news, someone has robbed former Mrs. Texas United America of nearly $1 million in jewelry, bags, and valuables. Theresa Roemer said she and her husband were only gone 90 minutes for dinner at a country club just two blocks away, but they came home to broken glass and empty shelves. The robbery bears all the markings of being perpetrated by a professional thief. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Theresa Roemer's massive 'she-cave' housed a fortune's worth of expensive handbags, watches, shoes and other baubles . Cleaned out: What's likely a professional thief made off with nearly a million dollar's worth of Roemer's possessions . It appears the robber gained entrance by using a glass cutter to get into the bathroom. The intruder was likely small, based on the size of the hole. 'I have 16 cameras on this house and there’s no footage of him . anywhere around the house – nowhere,' Roemer told the Montgomery County Police Reporter. 'It had to be out . that dark back corner of the house and out the back gate to the golf . course.' Surveillance footage recorded a small man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking four trips to move all the goods outside. The Roemers did not turn on their security system since they were only going a short distance, but did lock house. Theresa Roemer told police she saw an unfamiliar Hispanic man in his late teens outside her gate earlier, but assumed he lived in the neighborhood. 'They took everything,' Roemer said. 'They took all my jewelry, all . my watch collections, my husband’s watch collections, my Birkin . collection. They literally walked out with between $800,000 and a . million dollars’ worth of stuff.' Roemer said that because she was only away from her home a short while she did not arm the security system . Roemer said she and her husband were only away for 90 minutes to eat dinner at a nearby country club . Roemer said she used the space to host charity events and that it took her a whole 45 minutes to get ready . The most expensive items were taken including 10 Rolex watches, up to a dozen Chanel watches, . Cartier watches, and other expensive baubles and accessories. 'I feel violated… raped,' she said. 'To watch someone on film . take everything out of your house that means  much to you – it’s just . wrong.' She may have been targeted due to the recent media attention on her  3,000sq ft closet, called her 'she-cave.' Theresa . Roemer, a former Miss Texas United America, enlisted designer Thom . Anderson to add the luxurious three-story space to her Woodlands, Texas, . home, which houses her handbags, shoes and other accoutrements. It cost . roughly $500,000 to build. 'It . started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over . and they said, ""I just wish it was bigger,""' she told the Houston Chronicle, adding: 'Since then it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger, it's like a ''she cave.'' It appears the thief gained entrance by using a glass cutter to get into the bathroom . Violated: Roemer compared teh break in to feeling of being 'raped' 'The . third floor houses all my furs and big hats, you come down the spiral . staircase to the second floor which is where I get my hair and make up . done, it also houses all the shoes from Louis Vuitton and Gucci,to my tennis and work out gear,' she said. 'Then . you come down a floating staircase, which is just magical, and the . first floor is where you pick out your jewelry and bags,' she continued, . noting that it typically takes her 45 minutes to get ready. In fact, the closet even features a champagne bar - perfect for hosting events to benefit charitable causes. 'Yes, it’s full of amazing things,' Mrs Roemer she had told Houston’s KHOU, 'but this closet was built and intended for fundraising.' Roemer . has used the hot-ticket space to raise money for causes such as the . American Heart Foundation and Texas Children's Hospital. But it also serves the style needs of those close to Mrs Roemer. The thief target high-end items like Rolex and Cartier watches . 'My daughter always says that she doesn’t need to go to the store; she can just shop my closet!' she told Neiman Marcus's blog. 'And of course I do let a few, very special friends borrow my Birkin bags.' Upon learning her sanctum had been violated, she tried to put things in some perspective. June was the seventh anniversary of her son's death in a car accident. 'I need to count my blessings that no one was hurt or killed,' Roemer said. 'I’ve been through amazingly hard things in life, like burying . my son, and this is not anything compared to that.'

"By . Mail Online Reporter . An 81-year-old woman missed her own funeral after the mortuary mixed up two bodies. Edna Lawson died on July 19, but the Texas octogenarian was not in the coffin lowered on top of her World War II veteran husband's at a cemetery last weekend. Bruce Lawson, Edna's son, knew something was wrong when he went to identify his mother's remains at Mabrie Memorial Mortuary, but they insisted everything was fine. Bruce Lawson, seen here holding a program from his mother's first memorial service, knew something was wrong when he went to identify his mother's body at a mortuary. Though he knew it didn't look like his mother, he was made to believe her appearance had just greatly changed through the embalming process . 'I said to her, I said, it doesn't look like my mom,' Bruce told a local television station he said to the woman at the funeral home. Mother of three Edna Lawson, 81, was not in the coffin that was buried in a shared plot with her husband last weekend . 'Do you think maybe you have the wrong body? Maybe it's someone else back there? And she said we don't make those kind of mistakes.' In his grief Bruce became convinced his beloved mother's appearance had changed through the process of embalming and the family went ahead with the service. After a memorial at the Pentecostal Missionary Baptist Church a coffin with was supposedly Edna's body was put on top of her husband in a shared plot of a Houston cemetery. Days later the Lawsons received a phone call from the funeral home saying they had Edna's body in the back. Bruce returned, was once again asked to identify the body, and said, 'now that's my mom.' Edna's three children now have to face the process of memorializing and burying their mother all over again. The other body, whose identity has not been released, has been exhumed. Her family has been notified of the situation as well. And the funeral home has apologized, saying, 'When Mabrie Memorial Mortuary discovered the mix up, we immediately contacted the affected families, apologized for the error, and took all appropriate steps to rectify the situation. 'We have also taken steps to insure that a similar situation does not happen in the future... We deeply regret that the Lawson family had to endure this temporary delay in properly transitioning their loved one and will do everything we can to make the remainder of their experience comfortable.' But the apology will only go so far for Bruce and the rest of Edna's family, who worry about their mother even after death. 'She wanted a spiritual way to leave this earth but it got robbed from her and her spirit.' Days after the funeral Mabrie Memorial Mortuary, pictured above, phoned Bruce and said they had found his mother's body. Now the buried body will be exhumed and the Lawsons must go through the process of re-memorializing and re-burying their beloved mom all over again .","Edna Lawson, 81, died on July 19 .

"By . Sara Nathan . The battle between Bethenny Frankel and Jason Hoppy for custody of their young daughter Bryn concluded today - with the pair agreeing to both share parental duties. The Skinnygirl millionairess, 43, accused her 42-year-old estranged husband of hacking into her personal email and says he reportedly 'sought to obsessively control her every move through their four-year-old daughter', as the pair fought over custody in court last week. But today, Bernard Clair, Hoppy’s attorney, confirmed that the custody part of the divorce case has been settled, stating: 'My client is delighted that this custody dispute has been resolved; that his co-parenting status has been acknowledged; that the parties’ child will have the benefit of being raised by both parents; and most importantly, that his daughter will no longer be at the mercy of a high profile courtroom battle.

""You be the princess, I’ll be the prince, Mommy will be the witch.""' Changing it up: On the same day, Bethenny was seen stepping out with a different outfit on later in the day . It got nasty: In the court case, Frankel recalled how Hoppy made their daughter 'start crying' on May 8 after a school party . Smartened up: For her second outfit of the day, Bethenny wore a sleek pair of white trousers and black vest top . In addition Frankel recalled how Hoppy made their daughter 'start crying' on May 8 after a school party. Frankel claims he said to Bryn: 'You don’t want to go with Mommy, right? You want to be with me.' Although . their divorce is still ongoing, the custody agreement was reached just . days after it threatened to spill over into a bitter and hate-fuelled . row with damaging allegations made in a New York courtroom. Frankel hired lawyer Allan Mayefsky, who repped Katie Holmes in her split from Tom Cruise. In opening . comments last week, Mayefsky claimed the Bravo star's husband went 'to . war' once their union crumbled in 2012, saying: 'He threatened to . destroy her. 'He had her followed and spied on along with their daughter. He hacked into her most private personal email.' Bitter battle: Bethenny had been in court battling with her estranged husband Jason Hoppy over custody (pictured today in New York) Finally over: Bethenny can now resume her parenting duties without having to battle in court (pictured in New York on Wednesday) ​'​He has . consciously placed his desire for revenge … over the best interests of . this family and particularly the child,' Mayefsky concluded.​ ​'He has . sought to obsessively control their every move through their daughte​r.' Mayefsky said his client is a 'very, very involved mother' whose success will benefit the child. While Bethenny had been insisting on primary custody and sole decision-making authority for Bryn, Jason ​was asking for shared custody. Bitter split: Bethenny and Jason are seen at Manhattan's Family Court on May 28 accompanied by her lawyers . She means business: Bethenny refused to settle out of court (pictured at court on May 28) While under . attack, Jason showed no emotion. His attorney Clair, who has . also repped Simon Cowell's girlfriend and mother of his baby son, Lauren Silverman, also accused . the reality TV star and businesswoman of wanting to get even. One . of the examples mentioned was how Bethenny allegedly stripped their . shared condo on Hudson Street when she vacated it earlier this year. 'The clothes were gone, the favorite stuffed animals gone, the favorite dollhouse gone,' Clair said. He argued . the change made Bryn upset. When her father went to cook her a meal to . calm her nerves, he said the kitchen was almost empty. Real . love: Bethenny and Jason enjoyed a break in St. Barts after tying the . knot in March, 2010, two months before Bryn's birth. The happy time was . captured in Bravo reality show, Bethenny Getting Married . 'He . found that every single utensil had been taken but replaced with . plastic knives, forks and spoons like you would pick up from a takeout . place. One pot was left,' Clair said. Clair . also said Frankel used 'the child as a prop … in the pursuit of her own . career and her own brand.' He said she 'embarked on a secret endeavor . to have a children’s book published' this coming September about Bryn’s . life. 'Ms. Frankel even arranged for the illustrator to come to her home to follow . this child around so that every likeness and every sense of the child . could be presented,' Clair said. 'And that’s not all: This children’s . book has the Skinnygirl logo, Skinnygirl being the brand of Ms. Frankel, . throughout its pages.' According to RadarOnline, Bethenny was in 'tears' while on the stand, claiming her estranged husband said she was 'disgusting.' Once a close family: Bethenny and Jason with daughter Bryn and their dog in April 2012 . 'If you don’t want to be with me and you’re ending this marriage, I want nothing to do with you ever again. I’m going to destroy you,' she revealed Hoppy had told her. She added that Jason said, 'You’re already losing fans. I’m going to ruin you' and also saying, 'You’re dead to me. I want nothing to do with you. You think I want to be with you on the holidays? You’re a piece of s***. You’re garbage. You have no idea what I’ve got on you.' Bethenny filed for divorce from Jason 16 months ago. Jason had . reportedly been hoping to come to an out-of-court deal with his . estranged wife, who sold her Skinnygirl alcohol brand to Beam Global for . an estimated $39m with a similar amount promised if the brand hit . certain sales targets. But the source said Bethanny is refusing to . settle. 'Bethenny . sat outside the courtroom and made notes on what looked like a script . or a book draft,' an eyewitness told RadarOnline of the former talk show . host's appearance on Thursday morning. No, she's mine: Jason, 42, has been equally adamant about his custody right to Bryn as the couple's bitter divorce wrangle comes to a head after 16 months . 'There were no tears or emotions. Both Bethenny and Jason looked very somber.' In June 2010, the celebrity starred in the Bravo reality TV show Bethenny Getting Married, which documented her engagement to Jason, their marriage on March 28, 2010, and the birth of their daughter two months later. The brunette, whose show Bethenny was cancelled by Fox after just one season, is finding solace in the arms of her new beau, Michael Cerrusi. She has been dating the beefy 34-year-old son of a prominent New York attorney since the beginning of the year.

"By . Sara Nathan . and Daniel Bates . Actress Tatum O'Neal is today standing by her embattled son Kevin McEnroe following his drug arrest. The 50-year-old former child star - who has struggled with her own drug demons - posted a picture of herself with her son, with the message: 'Addiction is a disease. Not a moral issue. Support, Empathy, Love.' Tatum, who has three children with her ex-husband, tennis champ John McEnroe, also put up a picture of herself cuddling Kevin and her other kids, son Sean and daughter Emily.Scroll down for video . 'Support, Empathy, Love.': Tatum O'Neal tweet this picture today of her and her son, Kevin McEnroe, 28, who was arrested in Manhattan yesterday . She simply wrote: 'Beautiful family!' Kevin, 28, has been working at a bartender at a Lower East side bar in Manhattan after attending a $40,000-a-year private school and studying for a master's at Columbia University. He was arrested late on Tuesday night after police say they saw him carry out the alleged ‘hand-to-hand’ drug deal in the middle of the street in the East Village. Officers who searched Kevin reportedly found on him six small bags of cocaine and more than two dozen prescription pills. They also discovered 10 morphine pills, 20 painkillers and an anti-anxiety tablet. At his arraignment at Manhattan’s Criminal Court, Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Werner told the judge that the haul was so large that prosecutors doubted it was just for personal use. Kevin is currently charged with . criminal possession of a controlled substance in the Fifth Degree, a felony offence. Prosecutor Miss Werner told the court: ‘Given the amount, we believe we have a strong possession-with-intent-to-sell case’. the criminal complaint issued by Manhattan's DA office said: 'The defendant knowingly and unlawfully possessed a controlled substance with intent to sell it'. Kevin, who was wearing a dark coat and jeans, looked on the verge of tears and did not say anything as the prosecutor read out the charges against him. Arrested: Kevin McEnroe, the son of tennis champ John McEnroe and Oscar-winning actress Tatum O'Neal, is pictured leaving Manhattan Criminal court on Wednesday after being caught in a drug deal Tuesday night . Police say they saw him carry out the alleged 'hand-to-hand' drug deal in the middle of the street in the East Village. Officers who searched Kevin reportedly found on him six small bags of cocaine and more than two dozen prescription pills. They also discovered 10 morphine pills, 20 painkillers and an anti-anxiety tablet . The court was told that he does not have a criminal history and he was released without bail. Neither Kevin’s mother or father attended the hearing - and he was met by his uncle Mark McEnroe, who runs the John McEnroe Tennis Academy in New York, who led him away. Kevin attended Trinity School in New York and was still at Columbia whilst working at the trendy Schiller’s Bar in New York. He has been living in a modest home in Gowanus, Brooklyn. In a bizarre twist Kevin’s arrest happened a few blocks away from where his mother, Academy Award winning actress Tatum, 50, was arrested in 2008 for trying to buy crack during her own battle with drugs. McEnroe, 55, a BBC commentator and former tennis champion, said that the entire family was supporting Kevin, 27, as he 'works through his issues'. A statement read: 'The entire McEnroe family is extremely upset with regard to recent developments about Kevin McEnroe. 'This is a private matter, and his entire family will do everything we can to support Kevin as he works through his issues at this very difficult time.' Kevin's defence lawyer Isabelle Kirshner however said there was 'certainly nothing remarkable' about the amount of drugs found on him in an attempt to play down the significance of his buy. Kevin’s alleged drug dealer Niro Meneses, 22, who lives on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, was charged with criminal sale and criminal possession of a controlled substance. Charged: Officers charged Kevin with criminal possession of a controlled substance. Pictured above with his father John McEnroe in 2012 . Son of stars: Kevin McEnroe (center) is the oldest son of John McEnroe (right) and ex-wife actress Tatum O'Neal (left). McEnroe and O'Neal have another son named Sean, 27, and a daughter Emily, 23 . He was held on a $10,000 bond or $3,500 cash bail. McEnroe is known as the original tennis bad boy but his family life was where the real drama was. He and O'Neal met when he was 25 and she was 20 and despite a whirlwind romance things soured badly. The couple got married in 1986 and divorced in 1994, with McEnroe taking custody of the three children because O’Neal was battling her heroin addiction which had been an issue since the age of 14. At one point things got so bad that he banned her from even seeing the kids. In his 2002 memoir, which was called: 'You cannot be serious', McEnroe told how when he split with O'Neal she said to him: 'One day you'll thank me for this'. John wrote that at the time he did not know what she meant - but that in hindsight he thought she was blaming herself. He wrote: 'She realised she was such . trouble, and so incapable of being the wife that I wanted, that . eventually I'd be happier with somebody else'. O'Neal . was outraged when she heard his comments and claimed that he used . steroids while on the pro-tennis tour, something he later admitted but . claimed he did not know what they were. Elsewhere . in his memoir McEnroe also McEnroe wrote about 'screaming arguments' and 'long silences' that doomed their marriage and how O'Neal became . jealous because his career was on the rise while she struggled to get . parts.

"By . Sara Nathan . Designer Rachel Roy is jetting to Paris to attend Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's wedding alongside rumoured A list guests Beyoncé and Jay Z -  days after it was reported she clashed with Solange Knowles at the Met Ball. Rachel, 43, was rumoured to have had a blow-up with Solange just hours before Beyoncé's younger sister lashed out at her brother-in-law Jay Z in an explosive elevator altercation at a Met Ball after party.

The mother-of-two posed for pictures in a photo booth at the event, alongside Kim and her best friend Brittny Gastineau. After video footage emerged of Solange Knowles hitting out at multi-millionaire rapper Jay Z in the elevator leaving the Boom Boom room at the Standard hotel in New York, US Weekly reported that Solange had yelled at Rachel earlier at the after-party. The source added that, during the disagreement, Beyoncé 'got in the middle of it, although it remains unclear what it was about. The 27-year-old apparently told the designer 'anyone who gets close to Jay has to be warned and deal with her as a sister,' according to US Weekly, while the Daily News also reported that both Solange and Beyoncé were unhappy that Rachel was too close to Jay Z. Despite this, Rachel remains insistent . that Solange was fighting with someone else standing close by her and is said to be unhappy at . being drawn into the incident, MailOnline understands.

He . wrote: 'Forgot about this one @ava_dash @atrak and solange ...I am . actually impressed with her independent spirit... She seems like a . fighter #festivallife.' Rachel also seemed to allude to the furore as she referenced a Jay Z song on Twitter on Wednesday. Promoting her clothing line, she tweeted a link to her new summer line, with the words: 'The Beach is better!' This was taken to be a clear reference to 2007 Jay Z track Beach is Better. But after being criticised for her tweet, Rachel added: 'Tweeties this is silly,the beach IS better in summer or anytime in my book,no idea that was the name of a song, #welovethesea #alllove xxRR' After the elevator attack, Beyoncé and Jay Z released a statement saying it was a family issue between Jay Z and Solange, saying: 'As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident.

""They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.'

"By . Sara Nathan . It is the most Tony-nominated show of the season. But the stars of Broadway sensation, A Gentleman’s Guide To Love & Murder, have told of their fears the show would close before it won 10 nominations for the prestigious theater awards - including Best Musical. The musical - which last night dominated the Drama Desk Awards, scooping seven gongs - has had a long journey to Broadway following a string of workshops, out-of-town runs - with the producers even battling a lawsuit. And despite winning plaudits from some of New York's toughest critics following its opening night in November, actress Lisa O'Hare admits the show soon 'struggled' to sell tickets, saying: 'There is no Daniel Radcliffe  - we don't have any huge names.

'But even then, audiences were going crazy and our producer Joey Parnes said 'this is going to be a long haul', to be honest, the subject matter and the title are a little bit strange! 'Now people are sitting up and taking notice and since our nominations we've been selling wonderfully.' Having starred on stage in big hits Mary Poppins and My Fair Lady, Lisa tells how she turned down a show in London to appear in the workshop for A Gentleman's Guide, saying: 'I knew from reading the script years ago I wanted to be part of it, it's so rewarding to be part of something from the beginning, to see something grow and have this success. 'I believed in it from the beginning - I knew it had a future or deserved to have one. And I decided to take a risk!' It took writers Robert L.

"By . Sara Nathan . and Eleanor Harding . For years, he has been one of the world's most sought-after bachelors. But any ladies still dreaming they will one day run away with George Clooney are about to be disappointed – as it has been reported he is finally engaged. His bride to be is Amal Alamuddin, a glamorous British humanitarian lawyer who has represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Scroll down for video . So in love: Actor George Clooney with Amal Almuddin, 36, on safari in Africa . Clooney is understood to have proposed recently after the couple enjoyed a series of exotic holidays around the world during a seven-month romance. His relationship with Miss Alamuddin, 36, is a departure from the long list of actresses and models he has dated in the past. Rumours of their engagement have been circulating in the US media after she was spotted several times in the last week sporting a 'huge ring'. US-based Entertainment Tonight reported that on Thursday, the lovers were spotted at celebrity restaurant Nobu in Malibu, California, with Clooney's friends Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber. At the dinner, Miss Alamuddin had a conspicuous ring on her left ring finger, according to an onlooker. The same ring was seen by another diner at another LA restaurant, Craig's, on Wednesday, when the pair were understood to be celebrating their engagement. A friend told US magazine People: 'George and Amal are trying to keep things very low-key but they also aren't really trying to hide this, it doesn't seem. Big news? George Clooney's girlfriend Amal Alamuddin, pictured here in October, was reportedly seen by multiple people showing off a ring at Nobu in Malibu, California, on Thursday. 'I think it's like they want the people they love to know that this is real, that they plan on being together for ever.' Clooney, 52, was first photographed with Miss Alamuddin last October in London. In March, they went to Tanzania, where they were photographed on safari, and they also visited the Seychelles. Earlier this year, a source who has worked with Clooney told People: 'He's with someone who is a very accomplished attorney. She isn't someone who is pursuing a career in acting or entertainment. She's on his level.' History repeating? While known as a diehard bachelor, George has been married before briefly to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993, pictured here in 1990 . Miss Alamuddin was once voted the 'hottest barrister in London' by a law blog, but her life could not be more removed from the celebrity world which Clooney inhabits. She comes from a prominent intellectual Lebanese family who fled war-torn Beirut when she was a child and settled in a large modern house in Buckinghamshire. Her mother, Baria, was a noted beauty when she was younger – a Liz Taylor of Lebanon, by  all accounts. Her father, Ramzi, is a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut. The family are believed to belong to the Druze religious sect, an offshoot of Islam. After leaving Oxford, where she gained a 2:1 in law, Miss Alamuddin studied at the New York University School of Law. Now working out of London's Doughty Street Chambers, she specialises in international law, human rights, extradition and criminal law. Asked about the engagement news yesterday, her parents' housekeeper beamed a large smile and said: 'I don't know.'  But a neighbour said: 'I'm really happy for her – who wouldn't be happy with George Clooney as their husband?' Yesterday, Clooney's spokesman Stan Rosenfield did not deny the engagement rumours but just said: 'I do not comment on his personal life.' Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993. Since then he has said that although he is not completely closed off to the idea of another wedding, he is not the marrying type. Last December he told Esquire: 'I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever. I was married in 1989. I wasn't very good at it.' His previous girlfriends include British model Lisa Snowdon, former wrestler Stacy Keibler, cocktail waitress Sarah Larson, Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis and Baywatch star Krista Allen.","Bride to be is Amal Alamuddin, a humanitarian lawyer .

The trio remain close and Kim and Kanye joined Ms Wintour at the Met Gala in New York last week. When asked about the wedding photos being featured in Vogue, a Vogue spokeswoman said: 'We never comment on future issues'. Kim and Kanye appeared on the April cover of Vogue, shot by legendary Annie Leibovitz. Golden ticket: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's surprisingly elegant wedding invite . Standing in a strapless Lanvin gown, Kim looked the blushing bride with her Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring, valued at over $ 5million, as Kanye stood with his arms wrapped around her. The hashtag #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple was emblazoned beneath them on the cover. The cover led to around 250,000 sales - about 20 percent more from the previous issue featuring Rihanna. The wedding of the reality star and the rapper is said to be so intimate . that even Keeping up with the Kardashians executive producer and family . friend Ryan Seacrest did not score an invite. Speaking . on Monday at the FOX Upfronts in New York, American Idol star Seacrest, . 39, told Access Hollywood: 'Here's what I would guess.

Friendship: Anna Wintour has forged a close friendship with rapper Kanye and reality star Kim - defending her decision to put them on the April cover of Vogue . For months it was rumored that music millionaire Kanye had been 'begging' Ms WIntour to put his fiancée on the cover of Vogue. But Ms Wintour put those rumors to rest in her April 2014 Editor's Letter for Vogue's Shape Issue, calling the cover shot: 'both charming and touching'.'You may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on . Vogue’s cover,' wrote the 64-year-old Editor In Chief. 'He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better . reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true.' Ms Wintour applauded Kim's 'strength of character', writing: 'There’s barely a strand of the modern . media that the Kardashian Wests haven’t been able to master, and for . good reason. 'Kanye is an amazing performer and cultural provocateur, . while Kim, through her strength of character, has created a place for . herself in the glare of the world’s spotlight, and it takes real guts to . do that.'

Ms Wintour, who has been editing the magazine since 1988 says a long held tradition of Vogue is 'being able to feature those who define the culture at . any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes . the way it looks and influences the way we see it. 'I think we can all . agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and . Kanye to a T. (Or perhaps that should be to a K?),' she writes with tongue in cheek. Rumors that Kim may have secured herself a spot on Vogue's cover went into overdrive in June last year after the couple was spotted dining at Ms Wintour's West Village home in Manhattan.

"By . Sara Nathan . Nigella Lawson's ban from the US could have a huge impact on the future of her ABC show, The Taste. The curvaceous British TV chef, 54, who was refused entry to America because of her court confession that she took coke, has been a judge on the reality show for two seasons. However, today, an ABC source told MailOnline: 'No decision has been made yet on whether or not the show will come back for a third season. 'We finished production on season two ages ago and the finale episode aired in February.' Scroll down for video . Anguish: The past few months had clearly taken their toll as exhaustion was etched on Nigella Lawson's face as she stepped out of her London home after being banned from the US last month . Anthony Bourdain, a former heroin addict who once admitted selling his prized record collection to buy drugs, worked with Nigella Lawson on The Taste . Support: Nigella Lawson - seen here with co-star Ludo Lefebvre - was given support from her Taste friends. Fury: Nigella Lawson's Taste co-star Anthony Bourdain hits out at the US in her defence . And another source said: 'Nigella is obviously the big selling point for the show - she's a big draw - and if she's denied entry to the US and a visa to work here, then the future of the show is in doubt'. Meanwhile, Nigella's co-star Anthony Bourdain today tweeted his support for the star, saying: 'I am absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of US actions re: #Nigella travel. Unbelievable.' The U.S. Embassy in London said today that Ms Lawson has now been invited to apply for a visa, but experts warned the star could face a drug test by U.S. doctors. Season 2 of The Taste ended in February with 3.2 million viewers. And despite going up against NBC's Winter Olympics coverage, the show was up week to week by 7 per cent in total viewers - and up 14 per cent in women aged 18-34. The ‘Domestic Goddess’ was forced to confess under oath during a trial last year that she had snorted cocaine seven times and smoked cannabis in front of her children. When the Domestic Goddess made her return for season 2 of The Taste it was her big return to television screens following her very public divorce from Charles Saatchi. She stars alongside French chef Ludo Lefebvre, cooking star Bourdain and Marcus Samuelsson on the show. Ludo went on to reveal how he had grown 'very, very, very close' with Nigella, describing the mom-of-two as a 'great woman'. He said it 'broke my heart' to see his co-star's ordeal during the trial of her former housekeepers who were cleared of fraud in December. In an interview with The Times, Ludo described how he first saw Nigella on television when he moved to America in 1996, but they met for the first time last year. The married chef, 42, said: 'We have become very, very, very close - we click right away.' He went on to say seeing the court appearance 'broke my heart' before adding: 'Have you heard anything like this before? No. Because she is a great woman.' His wife, lawyer Kristine Lefebvre, went on to say Nigella had described the French chef as 'a very good-looking younger brother'. Close: French chef Ludo Lefebvre, Nigella Lawson's Taste co-star said her court case against the Grillo sisters 'broke my heart' and called her a 'great woman' Saucy: Nigella was certainly flirty when it came to winning over contestants on the show, who were hoping to be picked by the panel of chefs . On The Taste, the judges must decide whether they want the cook based solely on the taste.‘Food is never just food, it’s exquisite and it appeals to every sense,’ Nigella said. ‘It can change your life.’ The Daily Mail told how Nigella was stopped from boarding a flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles. The brunette arrived alone at Heathrow’s Terminal Five on Sunday morning to catch a direct British Airways flight to LA. She is thought to have checked in and passed security before being told she could not board her plane. She had to return to the first class check-in to arrange to collect her hold luggage. ‘She didn’t seem to say much, but she did not look happy,’ said an onlooker. ‘She could not get on the flight so she had to turn around and leave.’ Nigella is thought to have tried to enter the U.S. by registering online for permission to travel and confirming she had not been arrested or convicted of offences including taking illegal drugs. But the US can also decide to bar foreigners who have committed drugs offences without ever being charged. Would-be travellers can apply to have the ban lifted, but this can take months.

Today, a US embassy spokesman said: 'There are several ways of legally travelling into the United States and Ms Lawson has been invited to come to the embassy and apply for a visa for travel to the U.S. 'We understand she has professional requirements for US travel and these matters are generally handled routinely and expeditiously, so stand by.'

"By . Sara Nathan . and Chris White In Los Angeles . Brittany Murphy’s father is demanding that his daughter's body is EXHUMED after he ordered a toxicology report that left him fearing she and her husband had been poisoned to death. Angelo Bertolotti has said he is 'pushing and pushing and pushing' the Los Angeles Coroners office to exhume the bodies of the tragic Clueless actress, who died aged 32 in December 2009, and her husband Simon Monjack, who died just five months later aged 40. A family source told MailOnline today: 'Angelo says that he sent letters to the Coroners office, he says he's sent them the report, but he's heard nothing back'. According to LA law, the next of kin of the deceased can order an exhumation to be carried out privately at their own cost, but the source said: 'Angelo has spent a fortune on the case so far and is waiting for the Coroners office to get involved, but he knows this may have to be done privately if the coroner doesn't give him any satisfactory answers. He's working on getting it done.' Today, Simon Monjack's mother Linda Monjack, who continues to be haunted by her son's death, told MailOnline: 'I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they exhumed Brittany, I've been hearing talk of this for months. Scroll down for video . Exhumed: Angelo Bertolotti,the father of Clueless star Brittany Murphy, is attempting to get the bodies of his daughter and her husband Simon Monjack exhumed . Mrs Monjack would have to give her permission for her son to be exhumed as his next of kin - but makes it clear she is not yet in agreement - as speaking from her UK home she said: 'It's incredibly upsetting. 'It's very difficult to know how you deal with it anymore. Will we ever get any answers about Simon and Brittany? No-one will help me and I just want to find out what happened. 'The toxicology test Angelo did - and it's awful result - has spurred him on to want to do more and I'm not surprised at all that he wants to exhume Brittany.' Mr Bertolotti has teamed up with filmmaker Julia Davis, the wife of his business partner - and both believe that Brittany and Simon were poisoned. They fear Brittany was targeted by . shadowy government agents for offering her support to Miss Davis, a Department of . Homeland Security 'whistleblower'. Last November, a startling report claimed that Brittany did NOT die from natural causes - despite the fact by the Los Angeles Coroner originally attributed her death to pneumonia and anemia. Her husband died in May 2010 at their Hollywood home reputedly from the same causes. The star's father Mr Bertolotti, 87, finally secured the . release of his daughter's hair, blood and tissue samples for testing . after years of litigation and submitted them for independent testing. Investigation: Simon Monjack, the husband of Brittany Murphy, died in eerily similar circumstances to the star, just five months after her death in December 2009. Now, pathologist Dr Cyril Wecht has been brought on board by Brittany's father Angelo Bertolotti . The . Carlson Company then found ten heavy metals in Brittany's system which were . several times higher than World Health Organization high levels at the . time of her death. 'If we were to eliminate the . possibility of a simultaneous accidental heavy metals exposure to the . sample donor then the only logical explanation would be an exposure to . these metals (toxins) administered by a third party perpetrator with . likely criminal intent,' the report stated. Heavy . metals are found in most rodenticides and insecticides meaning the . actress could have been slipped rat poisoning or bug killer. At . the time of her death, Brittany displayed all the symptoms of heavy . metal poisoning including: headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, . coughing, sweating, disorientation, wheezing, congestion and pneumonia. Mr Bertolotti told the family source that Julia Davis is 'the one who is following things up for us.' 'We don’t have any concrete information on Brittany and Simon being exhumed, but she’s trying. We have no co-operation at this point from the Coroner’s Office. They say the case is closed, but it’s not closed. They’re liars, they’ve had every report we’ve given them. There’s a cover up somewhere. ‘The Coroners Office refuse to co-operate, why should we go privately? We’re working on getting it done. They have to co-operate with us, period. That’s going to happen. We want to force them to do it, they should do it. There’s a cover up somewhere. Why should I let them get away with this? They’re going to have admit they’re wrong. I’m taking a stand on this and all the things they’re saying are false. 'We’re on top of it, we’ll see where it goes, it’s in their ballpark, but we’re trying, just watch this space,' he claimed. Mr Bertolotti's investigation comes as a final, haunting glimpse of Brittany came in the final film she would ever film was released last month. Haunting: The final glimpse of Brittany Murphy in her last film, Something Wicked, which had limited release last month . Breakdown: Brittany Murphy gets emotional in the trailer for her last ever film Something Wicked . The actress's final performance in Something Wicked had been held back from release since her death. But the movie premiered in Eugene, Oregon, as a tribute to where it was filmed in 2009 and was set to be screened in Porland and Seattle. The star has a major role in the psychological thriller, which tells the story of a young couple trying to get married, but are hampered by gruesome secrets from their past collide and sinister forces in the present. Brittany's mother, Sharon Murphy, has denied her daughter and her husband were poisoned. Having brought up Brittany . single-handedly following her divorce from Mr Bertolotti when their . daughter was just one, she wrote in the Hollywood Reporter last November: . 'I have no choice now but to come forward in the face of inexcusable . efforts to smear my daughter's memory by a man who may be her biological . father but was never a real father to her in her lifetime. 'Angelo . Bertolotti has relocated to California in his old age to claim he is . here for Brittany, as he never was in life. He has made outrageous . statements over the past few years, culminating in this latest madness: . that my darling daughter was murdered.' Sharon . - who now lives in seclusion in Los Angeles - said: 'His claims are . based on the most flimsy of evidence and are more of an insult than an . insight into what really happened.' Linda Monjack (left) said nobody has answered any of her questions about her son's death, and the coroner's officer only did the most basic of tests . Suspicions: . Linda Monjack (right) talked about her suspicions regarding her son's . death after Brittany's father, Angelo Bertolotti (left), publicly said . that he believed the actress' support of Julia Davis, left, in her . border guard whistleblowing case was behind the mysterious and tragic . deaths . Today, a . spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroners Office said: ‘There are . private companies and pathologists out there who do perform the . exhumation. T . 'This can be . close to the death itself or years after the the death. One of the more . popular companies is 1 800 AUTOPSY, a lot of people go to them looking . for a second opinion, if they're looking at medical malpractice or just . want another opinion. 'The . companies have got business contracts to do this - it’s a matter . entirely between them and the family. Once the body leaves this office, . we have no jurisdiction or control over it. It can be cremated, buried, . moved abroad, or they can have a second autopsy.’ When asked about speculation that foul play could have been involved in her son and daughter-in-law's deaths, Mrs Monjack told MailOnline in November: 'It never crossed my mind before, but now it has.'

The 34-year-old swimwear model - who was this week pictured without make-up and wearing sweats as she strolled in the London sunshine -  is rumored to have been dating Prince Andrew, who at 54 is is 20 years her senior. The brunette was pictured affectionately kissing the Duke of York goodnight after their third dinner date in as many weeks earlier this month. But while the Duke of York lives in luxury at the Royal Lodge in the grounds of Windsor Great Park, previously inhabited by the Queen Mother, Monika lives with her parents Maria, said to work as a cleaner, and Zdarvko, who is believed to be unemployed due to his bad back, in a $830,000 former council house in North London.

Monika - who we can reveal was close to George Clooney up until late last year when they were pictured embracing - and her family bought their three-storey terraced home in December 2007 and neighbours . say they have been at the property for more than 10 years. She is listed on the British Land Registry document with her parents and brother Marin. Title documents held by the Land Registry state: 'The . transfer dated 17th December 2007 made between the Mayor and Burgesses . of the London Borough of Camden and Zdravko Jakisic, Marin Jakisic, Mari .

A friend of Monika's told MailOnline she believed the model, who fled war-torn Croatia with her parents when she was 10, had met Prince Andrew through mutual friends. While neighbours have yet to see Prince Andrew, they did see the Monika's former boyfriend, the former Egypt and Tottenham Hotspur soccer player known as Mido.

The picture prompted a flurry of . calls to Buckingham Palace – forcing Andrew’s representatives to issue . the embarrassing and unprecedented statement. A . spokesman for the prince who had hitherto declined to comment on . speculation about the nature of their relationship, said: ‘I can confirm . the Duke of York is not engaged to Monika Jakisic.’ It later emerged that the picture she posted . on social networking site Twitter of the engagement ring and restaurant . bill was a congratulations message to two friends. Monika's modelling career took off after she entered a competition run by Storm, the agency which represents Kate Moss. Standing 5ft10 tall, she now refers to herself as the ‘Croatian sensation'.

"By . Sara Nathan . The ex-husband of Simon Cowell's lover Lauren Silverman has spoken out on his pain at their very public divorce - calling the 'ordeal' a 'very difficult time in my life'. Speaking to the New York Observer . about the devastating marriage split, Andrew Silverman 37, who shares joint custody of his eight-year-old son Adam with Lauren, admits: 'It was a fascinating experience, unexpected and shocking...I learned a lot, moved forward.' And as Lauren, 36, splits her time between her £26,000-a-month New York apartment and Cowell's London home with their newborn son Eric, Adam spends his portion of his time with his father living in an Upper East Side co-op and attending the same exclusive Manhattan school as his father did before him. Meanwhile, Andrew's brother Alex Silverman even takes the opportunity to make a jibe at the brunette in the report, saying: 'You can’t take someone who has very poor roots and turn them into a . golden child, but that’s what the media tried to do - to turn his . ex-wife into a great person to benefit a celebrity.' Cowell has revealed he leaves changing his son's nappies to the nanny - because 'I don't think dads do that' Burnt offering: Simon Cowell looked like he had spent to much time in the sun as he went for dinner with Lauren Silverman in Miami on Tuesday . Having barely spoken since the divorce was finalized in December, Andrew said: 'My core business has continued to . move forward. I learned a lot about myself as an individual, the . importance of family. My focus has been on my son throughout the whole . ordeal.' Having been friends with music mogul Cowell, Andrew makes it clear he was stunned at being thrown into the spotlight last July when it was revealed his wife had been having an affair with the X Factor star - and was pregnant with his child. He said: 'Being in the public spotlight is not something I envy. It’s never been my way.' 'Privacy has tremendous value. I’ve tried to be as quiet as possible even though everyone wants to hear about this hoopla. 'I just wanted to refocus on what I do,” he said. 'I am a regular person, not a tabloid thing. It was a fascinating experience, unexpected and shocking.' And making a reference to his ex-wife, Andrew said: 'I think for both of us, making sure our son has a normal environment is the primary focus.' Lauren gave birth to Cowell's son Eric on Valentine's Day at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and the couple quickly left the New York and headed to Miami to see Lauren's family before going to London, where Cowell has been filming his UK show, Britain's Got Talent. Her son Adam has met his younger brother and has also been with his mother in Miami, New York and London, according to sources, but has been kept firmly out of the public eye. Meanwhile, Andrew's brother Alex, with . whom he runs family property firm Andalex, told the Observer: 'I give . him a lot of credit for everything he went through and that he was able . to keep his mind focused despite what was going on.' The brothers are seen as rising stars in New York real-estate scene and the family own a string of Manhattan apartments as well as a $4.5million country home in Stamford, Connecticut.

MailOnline . told how the Silvermans were so upset at Andrew and Lauren's marriage . that they boycotted their wedding - such was their dislike of the . Florida-raised socialite. He said that the focus should be on his brother, calling him 'a really great person who has moved on with his life.' Cowell is pictured here with the mother of his child, American socialite Lauren Silverman . It has been reported that key to the . Silvermans' divorce settlement was a strict stipulation that Cowell, 54, . would have to stay away from Adam or face a $50,000 penalty if he ever . comes in contact with him. And . if Cowell should happen to see him THREE times, then Lauren will lose . all contact with her son until a court is able to intervene and decide . what to do.

"By . Sara Nathan . Moving on: Josh Elliot is quitting GMA to join NBC Sports . Josh Elliott has been removed entirely from the GMA website - just a day after quitting for rival network NBC. The 42-year-old broadcaster left his role on GMA for a $4million deal with NBC Sports on Sunday. And now there is no trace of the news star, who helped GMA take the ratings crown from NBC's Today Show. He has been removed from the GMA website, and all videos and promos featuring him have been taken down. An ABC source confirmed to MailOnline today: 'It's not unusual that GMA, just like any other show, rejig promos when there's some kind of departure. 'It's standard procedure.' Josh was actually offered $5million-a-year from ABC - but turned it down as he believed there was a brighter future for him at NBC. Another source said: 'ABC really thought that Josh was a total ingrate and that he just dragged out the negotiation. 'But he's gone now and while he's got a couple of weeks left on his contract he won't be working anywhere.' While Sam Champion got a teary send-off when he left for The Weather Channel in December, Josh was 'on vacation' when his departure was announced to GMA viewers on Monday morning. His exit was revealed as ABC's Amy Robach was announced as his replacement. George Stephanopoulos congratulated Robach on her promotion at the top of Monday morning's show and briefly touched on Josh, saying: 'He is going back to his roots, reporting on the NFL and the Olympics on NBC Sports. 'He let us know last night, and, Josh, it has been a great run with you here on GMA. We're very happy you're going to be pursuing your passion.' Josh's departure now leaves George as the only male co-host on GMA, something co-anchor Lara Spencer joked about when she said 'The estrogen is flowing.' Sources say that ABC chiefs are now looking for a new male co-host to join the team. Scroll down for video . Rumours, rumours: GMA co-hosts Lara Spencer and Amy Robach are now keen to quell any reports they don't get along - and today tweeted a picture of themselves with their 'claws' out . Lara, 44, who last week signed a . $2million-a-year-deal to stay on GMA, and Amy, 41, who is currently . undergoing treatment for breast cancer, have already made a clear bid to . quell a groundswell of rumours they do not get along in the slightest. Both today tweeted a picture of them holding up their 'claws' after having a manicure while wearing GMA crowns. After weeks of negotiations with ABC, Josh will anchor NBC's highest-profile sports including Sunday Night Football, the Olympics and Triple Crown Racing. Josh battled to get a huge bump in his salary after his popular co-star Robin Roberts signed a deal believed to be worth $14million. A source said: 'Josh knew that he wasn't going to get that amount - but what he wanted was an increase that was proportionate to Robin's boost.' Josh's move to NBC means that he will be well lined up for the anchor role on the Today Show when Matt Lauer eventually leaves. Matt's $25million contract is up later this year and while he may sign an extension to his contract - he may well depart within the next year or two, leaving the job wide open for Josh, according to TV sources. However, Josh has a six-month 'non-compete' clause with Today Show, so he can't be on the air anytime soon. Another source said that while Josh could also be in line for Bob Costas's job, he was 'an addition' to NBC Sports - NOT a replacement.

"By . Sara Nathan . and Ashley Collman . Captain Phillips actor Barkhad Abdi was stopped by immigration officials returning to the U.S. last month after traveling to London to receive the BAFTA award for best supporting actor. The Somali-born actor who made his first film appearance as a pirate involved in the 2009 hijacking of the Mearsk Alabama, was flagged for his criminal history including arrests for drug possession and credit card fraud. Abdi, a permanent resident of the U.S., now faces a hearing with Customs and Border protection this week that carries the possibility of deportation, a source told the Star Tribune. However, that same source said it was unlikely 28-year-old Abdi would actually be deported since customs officials usually only do that in the most serious cases. Scroll down for video .

The pair pose at the Golden Globes . But, as MailOnline has learned, Barkhad . has also been charged with a number of offenses ranging from card fraud . to giving a police officer a fraudulent name. On August 18, 2012, Barkhad was arrested by Black Hawk County Sheriff's County Office in Iowa, along with four others after cops were called to a disturbance on MM 60 near Gilberstville. A police report from the time states: 'On arrival, two subjects were holding another subject down on the ground after he had allegedly ingested a plant leave material called 'Khat' and drank a partial bottle of liquid Tylenol. 'The combination of the two caused the subject to lose control of his faculties and attempt to jump out of a moving vehicle. 'Deputies during their investigation found suspected Marijuana in the vehicle as well as a plastic baggie containing the suspected 'Khat'. Under his full name Barkhad Abdinasir Abdi, the actor and his friends were all charged with Possession of Marijuana and Possession of Khat and transported to the Black Hawk County Jail. Cops were assisted at the scene by fire departments, Waterloo Police K-9 Unit and the Tri-County Drug Task Force. The charge was later dismissed by Iowa Court. It was not the first time Barkhad had been in trouble with the law. On February 2, 2004, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and given one year of probation for giving a police officer a false name of another person, and buying liquor aged under 21. He was also fined $1000. The following year, on June 1, 2005, Barkhad was charged with financial transaction card fraud and sentenced to 200 days in jail and two years probation, alongside being given a $500 fine. Living it up: Barkhad Abdi, 28, gets behind the wheel of a Ferrari in Hollywood . It is all a far cry to where Barkhad now finds himself: hobnobbing with Hollywood's A list at parties and award ceremonies. He beat off stiff competition to win the . role of real-life Somali pirate Abduwali . Muse, who led the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, an incident during . which merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage by . pirates in the Indian Ocean. Having won his role at an open casting call and barely realizing his performance would be a hit, Barkhad even went back to working at his brother Guled Abdi's . T-Mobile shop in the 24 Mall in Minneapolis before the movie came out. He now plans to move to Los Angeles to further his career next month and has taken on an acting agent. Captain Phillips has gone on to make more than $217million at the box office, far exceeding its budget of $55million. Abdi made $65,000 for his starring role but has so far not seen any bonuses or extra paychecks despite the film's success. During awards season, he was even forced to stay at a low-brow hotel by the airport so he could be near a friend who would drive him around for free. However, he is in talks to star as marathon runner Willie Mtolo who develops an unlikely friendship with a bar owner, once sanctions against South African athletes competing internationally were lifted. Speaking about a future in acting, he told the New Yorker: 'Yeah, I want to keep on doing it... any role, as long as it’s a good story, it doesn’t matter ... I'm moving to L.A. and I’m reading some scripts now, specifically there’s a TV show that I’m reading for.'

After receiving the Oscar nomination,a stunned Barkhad told the  Wall Street Journal: 'It was shocking, honestly - I was jumping up and down.' And he said: 'My life’s been changing since this movie came out, and it’s just for the better. And it’s getting better day by day. Today’s the best you got.' He told Entertainment Weekly: 'I wasn’t sure of myself. I wasn’t a complete actor. I was just auditioning with no previous experience. Paul Greengrass gets all the credit, honestly.

The curvaceous British TV chef, 54, who was last month refused entry to America because of her court confession that she took cocaine, has been a judge on the ABC reality show for two seasons. And today, an ABC source today confirmed to MailOnline the show is returning. What this means for Nigella has yet to be seen as she will need to get her working visa approved by the U.S. embassy in London before she can embark on any filming. Scroll down for video . Axed: Nigella Lawson - seen filming a commercial for Whittaker's chocolate in Wellington, New Zealand, this week - will need her U.S. visa to return to the States to film season 3 of The Taste . Anguish: The past few months had clearly taken their toll as exhaustion was etched on Nigella Lawson's face as she stepped out of her London home after being banned from the US last month . Anthony Bourdain, a former heroin addict who once admitted selling his prized record collection to buy drugs, worked with Nigella Lawson on The Taste . Nigella has recently been in Wellington, New Zealand, filming a commercial for Whittakers chocolate and on Friday tweeted that she was back home in London, enjoying a jet-lagged supper of steak, broccoli, tomato salad, baked potato and baguette. When asked how her trip was, she replied: 'Beautiful and delicious'. The ‘Domestic Goddess’ was forced to . confess under oath during a trial last year that she had snorted cocaine . seven times and smoked cannabis in front of her children. And last month, the Daily Mail told how Nigella was stopped from boarding a flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles. She . is thought to have checked in and passed security before being told she . could not board her plane. She had to return to the first class . check-in to arrange to collect her hold luggage. Nigella . is thought to have tried to enter the U.S. by registering online for . permission to travel and confirming she had not been arrested or . convicted of offences including taking illegal drugs. But the US can . also decide to bar foreigners who have committed drugs offences without . ever being charged. Would-be travellers can apply to have the ban . lifted, but this can take months. Nigella has since been invited by the U.S. Embassy in London to apply for a working visa - and could face a drug test by U.S. doctors. At the time, her Taste co-star Anthony Bourdain today tweeted his support for the star, saying: 'I am absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of US actions re: #Nigella travel. Unbelievable.' Season 2 of The Taste ended in February with 3.2 million viewers.

Ludo went on to reveal how he had grown 'very, very, very close' with Nigella, describing the mom-of-two as a 'great woman'. He said it 'broke my heart' to see his co-star's ordeal during the trial of her former housekeepers who were cleared of fraud in December. In an interview with The London Times, Ludo described how he first saw Nigella on television when he moved to America in 1996, but they met for the first time last year. The married chef, 42, said: 'We have become very, very, very close - we click right away.' He went on to say seeing the court appearance 'broke my heart' before adding: 'Have you heard anything like this before? No. Because she is a great woman.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rick Parfitt, Status Quo guitarist, is on the road to recovery . The son of Status Quo guitarist Rick Parfitt yesterday revealed his father is on the road to recovery and is expected to be ‘back rocking soon’. The band was forced to cancel a number of concerts after Parfitt, 65, fell ill on Friday night and was rushed to hospital where he was kept overnight. Taking to social networking site Twitter on Sunday afternoon, Parfitt’s son, also called Rick, posted: ‘Thank you for all the kind well wishes. Have spoken to dad today and all signs are good that he will be back rocking soon.’ Other tweets from him suggest his father may have become unwell because he over-exerted himself: ‘Hi all,...just to say that Dad is ok, but he has to stop thinking he is invincible that is all I can say right now. #WorriedandUpset.' And: ‘You cant help people who don’t want to be helped, no matter how much you care about them.’ Status Quo are currently on their European tour and were due to perform in Pula, Croatia at the weekend but the gig was abandoned, along with five other shows that were going to take place in Monte Carlo, Switzerland and Germany. According to the band’s official site, the next performance will take place on August 15 in Nottingham. Parfitt, who has previously suffered from ill health, had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997 after doctors warned him about his dangerous rock and roll lifestyle fuelled by drink and drugs. In 2005, he had to cancel a tour to undergo tests for suspected throat cancer. He has previously revealed his fears he will not see his young twins Lilly Rose and Tommy Oswald grow up. Speaking last November, he admitted: 'I probably won’t. Even if I live to 80 they will just about be 20. I would love to see them get to 21. 'It frightens the life out of me when I think I’m not going to see them grow up, and to see what they do and what they become. His son Rick Parfitt Junior took to Twitter to thank fans for their well wishes and say 'all signs are good' 'I know it’s morbid, but I’m only being realistic. I won’t be around.' Despite life-saving bypass surgery, he vowed not to become dull, adding he still enjoyed the 'odd pint'. It is unclear whether Status Quo, famed for hits such as Whatever You Want and Rockin’ All Over The World, will be able to press ahead with their UK tour in December. More information on Parfitt’s condition is expected to be released on Tuesday. The rock band, pictured in the 1960s, were due to kick off a 32-date tour with their Croatia gig.

Facelock asks people to identify familiar faces across a range of different photos. Previous research has found people recognise a face even if images are poor. The system uses a set of faces known to a user, to create a personalised ‘lock’. Users . can pick portraits of people familiar to them, which can include idols . such as sports personalities, musicians or even poker players. Researchers then create a set of faces known to that user only, to make it difficult for hackers to break into accounts. If we know someone well we will quickly recognise them in a photo even if it is blurred or hazy. But when we are shown two pictures of a stranger, we often assume the images show two different people. Scientists from Glasgow and York  universities asked volunteers to name Z-list celebrities who they knew well, but most people would not. The team then made up panels of nine pictures, each showing one celebrity face and eight strangers. Volunteers were shown four of the panels and asked to spot the faces they knew. They got all four right almost 100 per cent of the time. Even a year later, they still did extremely well, journal PeerJ reports. The researchers said this is because, unlike with passwords, they did not have to memorise anything. Do you remember: Faces may soon replace passwords but will you remember who's who? This scatterplot shows the relationship between personal attackers' acquaintance ratings, and the number of correctly guessed targets in their first attacks. The area of each datapoint is sized to correspond to the number of cases contributing to it . Previous research found matching identical images (a) is trivial, matching different images of unfamiliar faces is hard (b), but matching different images of familiar faces is easy (c) Tests also showed it was very hard for . strangers to crack the code. Spouses sometimes spotted all four faces, . but the risk could be cut by using more obscure celebrities or more . pictures. Lead author . Dr Rob Jenkins said: ‘Pretending to know a face you don’t know is like . pretending to know a language you don’t know – it just doesn’t work. ‘The only system that can reliably recognise faces is a human who is familiar with the faces concerned.’ It is hoped software firms will use the research to create photo access codes for computers and mobile phones. The . ‘lock’ consists of a series of face grids, and each grid is constructed . so that one face is familiar to the user, whilst all other faces are . unfamiliar. Authentication is a matter of simply touching the familiar face in each grid. But for fraudsters, looking at the same grid will be left confused as none of the faces stand out. Researchers said the system is better than current methods as users don’t have to consign complex passwords or PINs to memory, or put names to faces. Past psychological research has shown that familiarity with a face is virtually impossible to lose, and in the current study users authenticated easily even after a one-year gap. In contrast, disused passwords can be forgotten within days. Plus, Facelock is said to be hard to crack. Researchers asked volunteer attackers to watch a successful authentication sequence based on four target faces, so they could pick out the same four faces from similar test grids. However, the attacks were thwarted simply by using different photos of the same faces in the test grids. For the user, who is familiar with the target faces, it is easy to recognise the faces across a range of images. For the attacker, who is unfamiliar with the target faces, generalising across images is difficult.","Facelock asks people to identify familiar faces across .

Asked to recall their pre-birth expectations, the study found 44 per cent of women did not feel anyone had honestly prepared them for giving birth. But despite this, more than half said they actually enjoyed the experience in the survey of over 1,662 Mumsnet users found. Almost half of mothers enjoyed giving birth - but two thirds said it was the most painful experience of their lives . Meanwhile, just under half would do it differently the next time or not give birth again, and 64 per cent said it was the most physically painful experience of their lives. A spokeswoman for the website explained the apparent inconsistent figures of 47 per cent saying they enjoyed it and 64 per cent agreeing about the extent of the pain as 'just one of those contradictions of birth'. The survey found 19 per cent of women were still having sex in their ninth month. The majority of women - 81 per cent - said images and portrayals of women giving birth in TV and films are normally unrealistic. Justine Roberts, Mumsnet Founder, said: 'It can be tricky to find unvarnished truth about what giving birth is actually like.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Scientists have made a ‘giant leap forward’ in the battle against deadly superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics. British researchers have decoded a key defence mechanism of some of the most hard-to-treat bacteria. The breakthrough paves the way for new drugs to treat those bugs which have become resistant to antibiotics – including a single pill that treats multiple illnesses. British researchers have decoded a key defence mechanism of some of the most hard-to-treat bacteria . A spokesman for the researchers said: ‘This is a giant leap forward in the fight against superbugs. ‘This discovery doesn’t come a moment too soon.’ Detailed in the prestigious journal Nature, it follows stark warnings that the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs could drag the health service back to the 19th century. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, has described an ‘apocalyptic scenario’ in which, in just 20 years’ time, routine operations such as hip replacements become deadly because relatively minor infections can’t be quashed. And the World Health Organisation has said that deaths from scratches and scrapes will soon become common because antibiotics are losing their power. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, has described an 'apocalyptic scenario' The University of East Anglia research focuses on gram negative bacteria –  a large family of bugs that includes E coli and Salmonella and many hospital superbugs. These bacteria have a thick outer layer that make them particularly hard to kill and are becoming more and more resistant to antibiotics. The researchers identified a way of disabling this defensive wall.  Without it bugs cannot survive.Lead researcher Professor Changjiang Dong, said: ‘This is really important because drug-resistant bacteria is a global health problem. Many current antibiotics are becoming useless, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. ‘The number of superbugs is increasing at an unexpected rate. This research provides the platform for urgently-needed new generation drugs.’ Professor Brendan Wren, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ‘New antibiotics against gram negative bacteria including many hospital superbugs are notoriously difficult to develop and the problem is exacerbated as many of these bacteria are increasingly resistant to currently used antibiotics.’ He added that the research offers the possibility of creating a new drugs that disarm dangerous bacteria. The discovery was made using one of the world’s most powerful x-ray machines. Housed near Didcot in Oxfordshire, the Diamond synchrotron uses beams of light 10 billion times more powerful than the sun to peer inside everything from medical molecules to historical documents. Antibiotics are important medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Bacteria can adapt and ﬁnd ways to survive the effects of an antibiotic. They become ‘antibiotic resistant’, meaning that the antibiotic no longer works. The more often we use an antibiotic, the more likely it is that bacteria will become resistant to it. Some bacteria that cause infections in hospitals, such as MRSA, are resistant to several antibiotics.","British researchers have decoded a key defence mechanism .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Pregnancy: It is feared that the crop chemicals stunt the development of the unborn child's brain . Pregnant women who live near fields sprayed with pesticides can run more than three times the risk of having a child with autism, a study has found. It is feared that the crop chemicals stunt the development of the unborn child’s brain, setting it up for problems in years to come. Campaigners say it is not surprising that powerful chemicals which attack the brains and nerves of insects also harm people because the two share many of the building blocks of life. Researcher Irva Hertz-Picciotto said: ‘If it were my family, I wouldn’t want to live close to where heavy pesticides are applied.’ However, others cast doubt on the study and said the result could be a statistical blip. The researchers, from the University of California, Davis, studied almost 1,000 mothers, overlaying their addresses on maps of pesticide use in the area. Those living within a mile of fields treated with common pesticides called organophosphates saw the odds of having an autistic child raised by around 60 per cent. Exposure in the last three months of pregnancy seemed to be even more damaging. These women were twice as likely to have an autistic child as others. One particular pesticide, chlorpyrifos, more than trebled the odds, when a woman was exposed to it halfway through her pregnancy, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives reports. Crop spraying: Exposure in the last three months of pregnancy seemed to be even more damaging . The researchers said exposure to pesticides in the womb may be particularly problematic because the unborn child’s brain may be especially vulnerable. Although the study was done in the US, many of the chemicals are approved for use in Britain. The research comes amid concern about rising rates of autism. Today, more than one in 100 British children has autism or a related condition such as Asperger’s Syndrome – a ten-fold increase on 30 years ago. Elizabeth Salter Green, the director of campaign group CHEM Trust, said: ‘This research is of great concern when one considers the reliance of UK agriculture on pesticides and what appears to be a similarly large increase in autism here as in the US.’ 'If it were my family, I wouldn’t want to live close to where heavy pesticides are applied' Irva Hertz-Picciotto, researcher . But others stressed that the study did not prove that pesticides cause autism. Dr Geoff Bird, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘Parents of children with autism are more likely to show autistic-like traits. 'It may be that parents of autistic children prefer to live in less densely populated places which just happen to be closer to farms which just happen to use pesticides.’ The National Autistic Society also urged caution, saying that the development of autism is much more complicated than the researchers had suggested.","Crop chemicals feared to stunt development of the unborn child's brain .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Britain’s cats are getting so fat that they now have their own diabetes clinic. Just like their owners, cats are eating badly and exercising less and weight is ballooning. The average cat weighs 25 per cent more than a decade ago and the creatures are four times more likely to become diabetic than 30 years ago. Fat cats are also at risk of potentially fatal liver conditions, lameness and arthritis, as well as skin conditions triggered because they can’t stretch enough to groom themselves properly. Dr Sijin Niessen with Wilf, one of the cats to enter the Feline Diabetic Remission Clinic in Hertfordshire . Fat cats, such as Zorro, who weighs twice as much as he should, are becoming more common with the average cat weighing 25 per cent more than a decade ago . Experts say that just like humans, much of the problem has its roots in a bad diet and lack of exercise. Heavier traffic, coupled with owners seeing cats as companions rather than hunters, mean that Britain’s 8.5million pet cats are spending more and more time locked indoors. Plus, modern lifestyles are out of kilter with age-old genes. Stijn Niessen, who runs Britain’s first clinic devoted to the study of feline diabetes, said that more than half of the cats kept indoors are dangerously overweight, compared with a quarter of those that regularly go outdoors. Dr Niessen, of the Feline Diabetic Remission Clinic in the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals in Hertfordshire, said: ‘Because we live so closely with these animals, they are exposed to the same pressures. Cats, such as Tom, pictured, are also at risk of potentially fatal liver conditions, lameness and arthritis through being overweight . ‘They get tasty, rich foods from us, which thousands of years were not available. ‘But genetically cats are much the same as they were then they hunted and intermittently consumed prey.’ The vet, who has treated more than 100 cats in his clinic in the past year said that while these ancient genes would once have helped cats store vital energy until their next meal, they now predispose them to diabetes. His study of blood samples from diabetic cats shows that Burmese cats are particularly prone to the condition. And, just as with people, diabetes is more likely to develop in middle and old age. While it can be controlled with regular insulin injections and a low-carbohydrate diet, it raises the risk of a number of health problems and can kill. Last month, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home admitted the fattest cat in its history. At 22lb – just over a stone and a half – Titan is more than twice his recommended weight and the most recent in a ‘spate of morbidly obese felines’ to squeeze through the home’s doors. Lindsey Quinlan, Battersea’s head of cattery, told the Sunday Times: ‘Most of the dangerously overweight cats we get have been living indoors. ‘But people often give their pets too much food or the wrong types of food as an expression of their love, although it is in fact a form of cruelty.’","The average cat now weighs 25 per cent more than a decade ago .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Those who frequently use the word 'like' in conversation may be more thoughtful, research shows (library image) It is, like, a really annoying habit. But don’t be too swift to dismiss those who pepper their conversation with ‘like’. Because far from being a sign of low intelligence, it may signal thoughtfulness. Those who frequently use the ‘discourse marker’ may be simply taking time to think about what they are saying, if you know what I mean. The theory comes from US researchers who analysed recordings made of more than 200 men and women as they took part in conversations in their everyday lives. The team, from the University of Texas, looked at how often the volunteers used the word ‘like’. They also counted up mentions of ‘I mean’ and ‘you know’. So called filled pauses – ‘ums’ and ‘uhs’ were also totted up and the results compared with information about the volunteers’ personalities. Despite frequent use of ‘like’ often being seen as a sign of empty-headedness, the word was a particular favourite of conscientious types. The researchers admitted this could be a rogue result. But, assuming it is reliable, it may be that ‘like’, as well as ‘I mean’ and ‘you know’ are signs of more considered speech. In other words, footballers who fall back on it in World Cup interviews, and starlets who say it over and over may be more thoughtful than you give them credit for. The study, published in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology, also found that the three discourse markers were more popular with women than men and with the young than the old. The researchers said: ‘As people become older, the gender effect disappears.  This may be indicative of normative life transition into adult roles, such as when one graduates from college and enters a job market. ‘A career role change may be a possible factor that leads people to change their use of filler words.’ Similarly ‘ums’ and ‘uhs’ were more common in the young.  However, their use was not linked to gender or to personality, despite their often been seen as a sign of anxiety. The scientists from the University of Texas anaylsed 200 people's conversation - and found those who used 'like' and other filler words had more considered speech (library image)","Scientists at University of Texas analysed conversations of 200 people .

"By . Fiona Macrae . No more 'tinnies': The use of Australian slang, which was aided by Dame Edna Everage (pictured), is in decline in Britain, according to linguistic experts . Hello possums! If you are enjoying a barbie with a few tinnies while wearing your sunnies, you are hopelessly out of date. Australian slang has fallen out of fashion, experts fear. They say that a new generation of Aussies is coining fewer words of their own and borrowing more from abroad. The decline of the backpacker also means that less of the lingo is making its way around the world. The warning comes from Tony Thorne, a linguist at Kings College London and author of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang. While the latest edition of the dictionary still contains many long-standing colourful terms, there are just three new additions from Down Under. And two of these are just old words that have come back into common usage. Mr Thorne said that Australian slang first began to take off in the late 19th century, aided by the rich dialects of settlers from Scotland, Ireland and London’s East End. He told the BBC: ‘Those people weren’t hampered by the upper-class cultures of the UK. 'They were much more free to play with language, creating nicknames for local things, in a way that buttoned-up Brits in those days weren’t able to do.’ Australia’s convict past also played a role, with slang, even today, still being popular with prisoners and those who want to keep their conversations private. But it was in the 1960s and 70s that Australian slang really took off, aided and abetted by the popularity of Dame Edna Everage and other characters created by comedian Barry Humphries. Hugely popular Australian soap operas also helped spread the world. John Hajek, a professor in linguistics at Melbourne University, said: ‘There was certainly a huge shift in attitude towards Australian English in the UK as a result of Neighbours. ‘It exposed the British to a much wider variety of Australian accents and terminology. ""Rack off"" [Get lost]. ""Daggy"" [naff/uncool]. Soap influence: John Hajek, a professor of linguistics at Melbourne University, said Kylie's role in Neighbours was partly to blame for the increasing use of phrases such as 'Rack Off' [get lost] . ‘Good old Kylie Minogue certainly exaggerated her Australian accent as Charlene, which is partly what made her so popular.’ But Australia today is much more business-like, and the language used reflects this. Americanisms are being embraced and young people are latching onto words and phrases from social media, rather than creating their own words. But there is one exception, ‘selfie’, the term for self-photographs, is believed to have originated in Australia. Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was ridiculed when he said that a question whether enough women were promoted was a ‘fair shake of the sauce bottle’ meaning fair enough. His critics claimed his attempts to appear to be a man of the people by using Aussie slang were insincere.","Phrases like tinnies, barbies or sunnies are out of date, say linguistic experts .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Lifesaver: Koalas lower their body temperature by clinging to trees . The image of a koala hugging a tree is as Australian as a barbecue with a few tinnies. That cute pose, however, turns out to play a vital role in the marsupial’s survival. By wrapping their bodies round cool tree trunks, the animals can stop themselves overheating during long, hot summers. Researchers at Melbourne University used radio collars to track koalas’ movements and thermal imaging to measure the trunk temperature of the trees they chose to sit in. During the summer, they sat lower in trees, where it was cooler, and were more likely to stretch out and hug the trunk. Tree trunk temperatures were up to 9C below air temperature, with the bark of their favourite species particularly cool, the Royal Society journal Biology Letters reports. It is thought this allowed them to transfer heat away from their body, without the danger of dehydration that comes with panting. Researcher Natalie Briscoe said: ‘Access to these trees can save about half the water a koala would need to keep cool on a hot day.’ 'Our results highlight the . important role of tree trunks as above ground ‘heat sinks’, providing . cool microenvironments not only for koalas, but also for all tree . dwelling species.' Co-researcher Andrew Krockenberger said: ‘About a quarter of koalas in one population died during a heat wave in 2009, so understanding the types of factors that can make some populations more resilient is important.’ The team added that other tree-loving animals, including monkeys and leopards, are likely to use a similar strategy. Scroll down for video . Study: Researchers said koalas can survive with much less water thanks to their tree-hugging strategy . A healthy koala lives up to 16 years. There were once millions in Australia, but they were hunted heavily for their fur in the early 1900s. Last year the Australian government listed koalas in Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory as a threatened species, and some are even warning the animal could face extinction if more is not done to protect it.","Study from Melbourne University tracked koalas with radio collars .

Women who tested the £20 cream reported feeling eight years younger . They were particularly happy to see that the fine lines on their . foreheads, cheeks and around their eyes had started to fade away. The night cream, which goes on sale today, is the first to harness the healing powers of thymosin beta-4. The protein can also rejuvenate skin by attracting young, healthy cells to areas that have been damaged by age, pollution, sunlight and smoking. Women who used the cream were happy to see that the fine lines on their foreheads, cheeks and around their eyes had started to fade away (file picture) But while levels of thymosin beta-4 are high in our late 20s and early 30s, they fall as we age. Simply putting it into a cream would be of little use, as the molecule is too big to break its way through the surface of the skin. So, scientists from Avon’s research and development department in New York screened more than two million compounds for ones that turn up the body’s own production of the protein. They hit on two compounds, including a Himalayan plant used in Chinese medicine, and incorporated them into the cream. The face cream also contains other ingredients designed to protect the skin against day to day wear and tear. In tests, the lotion helped stop a cut apple from turning brown. And used by women for two months, it improved the appearance of wrinkles by 30 per cent. Blotchiness was halved and sunspots a third better, according to a dermatologist’s assessment. The women’s own opinions were equally glowing, with some saying they looked eight years younger. Anthony Gonzalez, the Avon scientist behind the £20 cream’s development, said it was inspired by ‘powerful medical advances’.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Everyone over the age of 40 should take cholesterol-busting statins, an eminent heart surgeon says . Everyone over the age of 40 should take cholesterol-busting statins, an eminent heart surgeon says. Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, who has carried out more heart transplants than anyone else, said the benefits of taking the controversial drugs ‘massively’ outweigh the risks and to not make them more widely available is ‘lunacy’. Sir Magdi, professor of cardiothoracic surgery at Imperial College London, also believes statins should be available without a prescription. Statins are the most-widely prescribed drugs in Britain and are credited with saving thousands of lives a year by preventing heart attacks and strokes. But a row is raging about their side-effects. A report published in the British Medical Journal said the cholesterol-lowering drugs, taken by eight million Britons, cause side-effects such as liver and kidney disease and diabetes in one in five patients. Parts of the article were withdrawn last week, following repeated criticism from an Oxford University academic that the risks had been exaggerated up to 20-fold. Sir Rory Collins said the figure is one in 100 and described the published claims as a ‘huge error’ that will ‘cause unnecessary deaths’ by discouraging patients from taking the medicine. Now, Sir Magdi has said that stopping taking the drugs would be disastrous. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that he found the row very upsetting, adding: ‘It is almost certainly going to result in people not taking statins and that is a major worry to many of us because the evidence is overwhelming, the lower the cholesterol, the healthier you are and the longer you will live. ‘Not only that, it prevents heart attacks and strokes but also cancer, dementia. So not to take statins is a disaster.’ He then called for the drugs to be easier to access – and for more people to take them.Sir Magdi said he believed statins should be available from chemists without prescription and that everyone over 40 should take them. He said that side-effects pale into insignificance when compared with the benefits and ‘not to make use of what we have is lunacy’. Statins are the most-widely prescribed drugs in Britain and are credited with saving thousands of lives a year by preventing heart attacks and stroke . Sir Magdi said: ‘The drug has  been around for 25 years or so and  we do know the long-term results  and exactly what it does biochemically. ‘We know exactly how to monitor any complications which are very minor compared to the benefits so I don’t see the problem.’ Currently, the prescription of statins is based on health, rather than age, with anyone judged to have a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack in the next decade offered them. But millions more could soon take the pills, as the cut-off is expected to be lowered to 10 per cent.Some doctors have questioned the mass-medication of essentially healthy people and say there are better ways of spending NHS money. Dr Mike Knapton, a GP and associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘I am not sure we are yet in a position where everybody over a certain age should be prescribed a statin.‘Even if in theory it would have public health benefits it could turn life into a disease.’","Sir Magdi Yacoub carried out more heart transplants than anyone else .

You cut down on calories, the pounds rapidly fall off and you are finally the size you want to be. But as soon as you go back to normal, all that weight piles back on again – often with a little bit more. But now scientists have got to grips with why crash dieters struggle to keep the pounds off long-term. Research shows that rapid weight loss leads to much more muscle being lost than slow, steady slimming. Muscle is better at burning off calories than fat which means that if you have less muscle, less energy will be used and so the weight will begin to creep up again. The theory, discussed yesterday at the European Congress on Obesity in Sofia, Bulgaria, is based on evidence from Dutch researchers – who put one group of people on a very low calorie diet for five weeks and another group on a less strict diet for 12 weeks. The eating plans were designed so that both groups lost the same amount of weight – just over different timescales. The scientists measured the volunteers’ free fat mass – all the tissue in the body apart from fat – at the start and at the end of the diet. This is a way of measuring how much muscle is lost, as other parts of the body - organs, blood and bones - are not affected by dieting. Both groups lost similar amounts of weight – but those on the very low calorie diet lost much more muscle. Even a month after coming off their diet, they had lost almost three times as much muscle as those who had lost weight more slowly. It is normal to burn off some muscle on a diet, because as you get lighter you do not need as much muscle mass to move around. But it is thought that on a crash diet, the body is forced to break down extra muscle to create the protein and sugar that is missing from meals. Shot-term: The study said highly restrictive diets, such as those centred on cabbage soup, lead to particularly rapid muscle loss . Lead study author, Maastricht University researcher Professor Marleen van Baak, is now tracking the two groups for nine months to see if the crash dieters regain more weight than the slow dieters. However, she suspects this will be the case. She said: ‘It is not so much reaching a certain weight loss that’s difficult, it is maintaining that weight loss over a period of time that is the real challenge.’ Professor Hermann Toplak, president-elect of the European Association for the Study of Obesity, warned that highly-restrictive diets, such as those in which people eat cabbage soup and little else, are usually so low in protein that the body has no option but to generate its own protein by breaking down muscle. As a result, crash dieters can lose 50 per cent of their strength within just a fortnight. This can leave them feeling so weak that they feast on the foods they have denied themselves – and they rapidly put on weight. The experts also discussed other reasons why crash dieting does not work in the long term. They included the idea that most of the ‘weight’ that is lost is water which is replaced on eating normally; and fast slimmers don’t learn how to eat healthily day in, day out, so as they return to normal, unhealthy diets they simply start gaining weight again.","Theory was unveiled at European Congress on Obesity in Sofia, Bulgaria .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Being bullied at school could raise the odds of having a heart attack as an adult. A study found that men and women who had been victims of bullying as children had higher levels of a blood protein linked to heart attacks and strokes. However, the reverse was true of the bullies. They had made less of the suspect compound than others. The researchers analysed data collected from almost 1,500 people during childhood, throughout their teenage years and into adulthood. Disease risk: Being bullied can lead to health problems later in life (photo posed by models) This included blood samples and interviews about their experience of bullying. Levels of C-reactive protein, which is linked to a host of health problems, including heart attacks and strokes, rose with age. However, they were highest in those who had been bullied as children. And the more they had been bullied, the more C-reactive protein they made. Those who did the bullying had the lowest levels – lower even than those who had no involvement in bullying, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Researcher Dr William Copeland, of Duke University in North Carolina, said: ‘Enhanced social status seems to have a biological advantage. 'Social advantage': The study concluded that bullies were actually least at risk . ‘However, there are ways children can experience social success aside from bullying others.’ He added that bullying can be added to poor nutrition, lack of sleep and other factors known to affect C-reactive protein levels. A recent British study found those bullied as children were more likely to have poor mental and physical health 40 years later, aged 50. They were also less likely to be in a relationship and less happy with life. The researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘We need to move away from any perception that bullying is just an inevitable part of growing-up. ‘Teachers, parents and policy-makers should be aware that what happens in the school playground can have long-term repercussions for children.'","U.S. study linked childhood trauma with protein which causes poor health .

"By . Fiona Macrae . IN SOFIA . Starting young: Research has suggested children who eat more sugary foods are more likely to have stressful lives . Children as young as five seek solace in food when anxious and stressed, a study has found. Although some adults are well-known to be emotional eaters, the research shows that the seeds are sown at a very young age. Rows at home, bullying and illness all drive youngsters to reach for unhealthy, sugar-filled snacks, an obesity conference heard. Belgian researchers asked more than 300 children, aged between five and ten, questions about their lives. Topics covered included whether they had experienced stressful life events, such as the divorce of their parents or the death of a grandparent, and how angry, anxious, sad and happy they felt. Bullying, problems with friends and rows with brothers and sisters were also factored in and parents answered questions about their children’s behaviour. The parents also filled in a questionnaire about how often their children ate various foods, while the youngsters explained when they felt driven to eat particular foods. The results showed that the more stressful a child’s life, the more sweet foods they ate. Girls were particularly prone to comfort eat and to give into temptation when times were tough, the European Congress on Obesity in Sofia, Bulgaria, heard. It is feared the children will take even more solace in food as they get older and are able to buy and prepare it themselves. Researcher Nathalie Michels, of Ghent University, also showed that levels of the hormone cortisol rose with stress. She thinks this may stop the body reaction to leptin, a hormone that normally tells our body when it has had enough to eat. Dr Michels said that that parents and schools should teach children who to cope with life’s ups and downs. She said: ‘Parents and children should be made aware that stress can influence emotional eating behaviour, so they can pay attention to potential triggers and anticipate this behaviour. ‘Furthermore, children should be equipped with stress-coping skills, such as problem-solving or asking for help, instead of seeking solace in food.’ Others said that parents should be aware that they are role models. Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘From the moment that an infant is born it learns that sweetness brings comfort. It should therefore be of no surprise that it is sophisticated enough, even by age five, to know that it’ll feel better about some unhappy event having eaten a chocolate biscuit or something sugary. Habit: Experts warned that children learn comfort eating behaviour from their parents . ‘After all, that’s what mummy does and parents are role models and copied. ‘Mummy, of course, should know better but most five year olds olds will lack the knowledge that indulgence food can be bad for you, and be habit forming, if not eaten in moderation. ‘There’s nothing wrong with the occasional sweet treat - but that’s a far cry from comfort eating to relieve stress.’ One in ten children aged four to five in England is obese. By the time they are ten or 11, the figure has doubled. Children who eat a Mediterranean diet at home are 15 per cent less likely to be obese than others, a study of eight European countries found. Meals rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, oily fish and olive oil kept weight down irrespective of age, gender and socio-economic status, in Sofia heard.Surprisingly, Mediterranean-like meals were more common in Sweden than in Cyprus, the University of Gothenburg researchers said.","Research found rows at home, illness and bullying prompt comfort eating .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Scientists believe that  regular injections of young blood could help keep us youthful in both mind and body . It sounds like a barely believable plot in a Dracula-inspired novel. But scientists believe that regular injections of young blood could help keep us youthful in both mind and body. Studies reveal that a chemical found in young blood can boost brains and strengthen withered muscles. The discovery could even help those already suffering from  diseases such as Alzheimer’s, with hopes that tests on patients could start later this year. And it may also be possible to create a pill to avoid the need for injections for the squeamish. Professor Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine from  University College London, spoke of the potential benefits. ‘Dracula’s power to grow stronger by drinking blood would be trivial compared to the impact of a drug discovered in blood that produced true brain rejuvenation for all,’ he said. The excitement surrounds three experiments from the US, which some may find ghoulish. In one, pairs of older and younger mice were studied after their blood vessels were connected to allow flow from one to the other. The scientists also gave the older animals regular jabs of young blood. The study found that the youthful blood boosted the number of connections between cells in the brain’s memory hub and made them stronger. From Dracula, who as a vampire, had to drink virgin blood to survive, to blood-swilling mothers today, there has long been a fascination with the restorative powers of blood. In 1492, Pope Innocent VIII is said to have received, at the behest of a Jewish physician, a transfusion of the blood of three ten year old boys. All of them, including the Pope, died. Julia Caples, 45, from Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, has been drinking live human blood from willing donors for the past 30 years. The care worker, who says she is hooked on the practice, consumes around half-a-gallon of blood per month and believes that it keeps her feeling young and vigorous. Ms Caples says she finds her 'donors' - fellow vampire fans willing to let her drink from them - at her local occult and oddities store. 'I feel more beautiful than any other time when I'm regularly drinking blood', she says. A fading sense of smell was also sharpened, said researchers in  California. Meanwhile, the older mice did as well as younger animals in tests in which they had to remember how to navigate out of a ‘swimming pool’, the journal Nature reported. Researcher Tony Wyss-Coray said: ‘It’s as if the old brains were recharged by young blood.’ He hopes to test the treatment on Alzheimer’s patients in a matter of months. Co-researcher Saul Villeda added: ‘We’ve shown that at least some age-related impairments on brain function are reversible. ‘They’re not final.’ He said that it might be possible to use young blood to keep the brain healthy into old age. In addition, said Mr Villeda, the rejuvenating effect could also help those who have already developed diseases like Alzheimer’s. In a second study published in the . journal Science, researchers from Harvard University used young blood to . boost the strength of ageing mice by up to half. Endurance was also improved and a protein called GDF11 was found to be key. The third piece of research, also from Harvard, pointed to GDF11 helping to sharpen smell. This suggests it may be possible to encapsulate the benefits of young blood in a pill, rather than needing regular injections. The excitement surrounds three experiments from the US, which some may find ghoulish. In one, pairs of older and younger mice were studied after their blood vessels were connected to allow flow from one to the other . Professor Mason said: ‘The Dracula fantasy of drinking blood to regenerate is so last century  compared to the reality of the  scientific breakthroughs in regenerative medicine. ‘If, and it’s a big if, GDF11 goes on to achieve real rejuvenation in humans, this will start to hammer a stake through the heart of the ageing process.’ Alzheimer’s Research UK said the studies were interesting but urged caution. Director of research, Dr Eric Karran, said: ‘These studies are of unknown significance to humans. ‘This research does not investigate the type of cognitive impairment seen in Alzheimer’s disease, which is not an inevitable consequence of ageing. ‘Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia and we urgently need treatments capable of stopping the disease in its tracks.’","Scientists say regular injections of young blood 'could help keep us youthful'

"By . Jill Reilly . x . A pair of Second World War airmen are to be buried with military honours 70 years after their plane went down in Papua New Guinea. The remains of 1st Lts. William Bernier and Bryant Poulsen were identified through DNA and other evidence collected from the crash site in a forest on the Pacific island nation, said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan with the Defense Prisoner of War-Missing Personnel Office. Bernier was from Augusta, Montana, and Poulsen from Salt Lake City, Utah. On April 10, 1944, their B-24D . Liberator nicknamed 'Hot Garters' took off from an air base in eastern . Papua New Guinea. It was one of 60 B-24s tasked with bombing . anti-aircraft positions around Japanese airfields, according to . PacificWrecks.com, a nonprofit group that documents details on military . personnel missing in action from the Pacific Theater. Poulsen . piloted the 28-ton bomber while Bernier was the bombardier, stationed . in a glass cockpit in the aircraft's nose and responsible for sighting . and releasing its bombs. Their plane went down after being hit by anti-aircraft fire over the city of Madang, Morgan said. Four . of the 12-member crew exited the aircraft after it had been hit. Those . men were captured by the Japanese and executed, Col. Morgan said. The . remaining crew, including Poulsen and Bernier, went down with the . aircraft. Their remains . were accounted for using mitochondrial DNA — which can be compared to . DNA from living relatives — and 'circumstantial evidence,' according to . Col. Morgan. Further details were not provided.

Of the 16 million Americans who served in the Second World War, more than 400,000 died during the war and more than 73,000 remain unaccounted for, according to the Defense Department. Bernier's niece, Sandi Jones, said she plans to bury his remains in Augusta in September. She said that after his disappearance, Bernier's mother refused to discuss the matter, hoping that he would one day return to the family's ranch. Their plane went down after being hit by anti-aircraft fire over the city of Madang, Morgan said. Pictured: The coastal landscape of Papua New Guinea . 'He was a Montana boy, so that's where he should be,' Jones said. Bernier, whose nickname was 'Laddie,' enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Air Force on December 10, 1941 - just three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, according to his enlistment records on file with the National Archives. He was not married, worked before the war in the forestry industry and attended three years of college, the records show. Poulsen enlisted April 17, 1942.

News of their Christian work in North Korea raises the possibility that the couple are facing persecution . because of their religious beliefs, but their eldest son Simeon, 27, denied they acted as undercover missionaries in . China or that their cafe on the China/North Korea border served as a front for unsanctioned religious . activity. The son of a Canadian couple mysteriously under investigation in China for threatening national security has insisted that they were not undercover missionaries in North Korea.  Pictured: Julia and Kevin Garratt (centre) with their . children Peter, 21 and Hannah, 17 . Mr Garratt poses for some photos on social media.  Their eldest son Simeon said that his parents had a meeting with Canadian consular officials on Wednesday for half an hour each and said in a message through them that they were 'safe' but confused by their detention . 'That stuff was all through the government . of North Korea,' he said as he insisted his parents did not 'sneak . across the border.' Simeon, who now lives in Canada, told the Huffington Post that his parents had a meeting with Canadian . consular officials on Wednesday for half an hour each and said in a message through them that they were 'safe.' 'The conditions are fine. The Chinese side kept . emphasizing the fact that they're meeting with every human rights code,' he said, adding that his parents were being held in a guesthouse under . constant guard. 'They're not allowed to leave or talk to anybody.' 'The . best way I could describe is my dad is upset, for sure. I think he's . angry, mad, confused, there's a lot of things that they have going on . and it's not just them that suffers from this.' His denial came as it emerged that Kevin Garratt, 54, and Julia Dawn Garratt, 53, from Vancouver  were sent hundreds of thousands of pounds from a Canadian church to fund their North Korea-focused charity and made regular trips to the secretive state . The couple are 'suspected of gathering and stealing intelligence materials about, among other things, China's military objectives and important national defence research projects,'  according to China's foreign ministry. Their son who left China permanently in 2011, told the Vancouver Sun that . Canadian officials have told him 'they do want to be involved' but have . suggested the family hire a human rights lawyer to also start . advocating for their parents’ release. Simeon believes his parents will eventually be released, but will likely have to return to Canada. 'That’s hugely crushing — that’s pretty much their entire lives,' he said. The couple, who have four children, moved to China in 1984 and run a coffee shop in Dandong, on the China-North Korea border . Today Rich . Kao, head minister at a small church just outside Vancouver that backs . the Garratt's charity, North Star Aid, said the couple, who moved to China in 1984, had been doing missionary work in the country and launched North Star Aid. He said they were moved . to focus on North Korea after seeing the poverty in the country and the . contrast with improving conditions in China. North . Star operates as a subsidiary of Five Stones, Kao said, but is run by . the Garratts from Dandong and largely staffed by church volunteers. North Star's funding largely comes from outside the church, he said, and the group relies heavily on word-of-mouth for support. The couple at the 2008 opening of their coffee shop in Dandong just across the border from North Korea . 'God said, in a prayer meeting, go to Dandong and I'll meet you there, and he said start a coffee house. We serve the best coffee on the border ... and we do some other things too,' said Mr Garratt .

A screen that reads 'justice, rule of law, patriotism, dedication' is seen on the closed front of the coffee shop . The . charity's website says it serves North Korea 'with love and practical . assistance' and features a photo gallery of workers delivering aid from . trucks. The investigation comes a week after . Canada took the unusual step of singling out Chinese hackers for . attacking a key computer network. The Chinese embassy in Ottawa, however, is dismissing questions about the timing of the Garratts' detention. 'We . believe there is no need to overinterpret this case,' spokesman Yang . Yundong said in a statement. 'Various rights of the couple have been . fully guaranteed.' It is . unusual for foreigners to be charged with violating China's state . secrets law - a serious crime that is punishable by life in prison or . death in the most severe cases. China, who . is Pyongyang's only major ally, has a very broad definition of state . secrets and North Korea is deeply suspicious of Christian proselytising . activities, punishing them harshly. Doing anything that could be seen as overtly religious along the sensitive border with North Korea was risky, experts said. 'North .

Later, a motorcyclist shot and wounded a man on another Jerusalem street, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for Monday's attacks in the city. But a spokesman for Hamas, the dominant group in the Gaza Strip, said: 'We praise the heroic and brave operations in Jerusalem, which come as a natural reaction to the crimes and massacres by the Occupation against our people in Gaza.' Tensions have been high in Jerusalem for the past month over the Gaza war and the killing of a Palestinian teen in the city by alleged Israeli assailants out to avenge the deaths of three abducted Israeli youngsters in the occupied West Bank. Yossi Farienti, Jerusalem district police chief, said the excavator 'hit a Jewish citizen at a construction site and then drove about 50 metres (yards) down the road, where it overturned the bus with its arm, slightly injuring three people'. A police spokesman said police officers shot at the driver, killing him. TV footage showed the man's body hanging out of the excavator's cabin. Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch said the nearly four-week-old Gaza war had also raised fears of attacks in Israeli cities.

Neither the Foreign Ministry nor Xinhua said if the couple had been detained, although the ministry said the Canadian embassy in Beijing was notified on Monday and that the couple's 'various rights have been fully guaranteed'. Mrs Garratt, who was born in Britain in Bristol, moved to Canada when she was 11 where she met her husband who is a Canadian citizen. Three of their children - Simeon, Sarah, 25, and Peter, 21, -  were born in Toronto and they adopted Hannah, 17, in China. After they moved to China thirty years ago they worked as teachers and brought their children up in the country until 2004 when they moved back to Canada. 'My parents moved back to Canada when I started university, thought it would be good for all of us to have a few years of 'North American living'. My mum did consulting for the school board and my dad worked for an NGO (World Vision),' explained Simeon. The Garratt's at their youngest daughter Hannah's graduation. Their eldest son, Simeon, 27, (right)  told MailOnline the charges are false: 'My parents have dedicated their entire lives to helping the Chinese people so I find it extremely insulting that news like this is even a possibility' On their 2008 return, the couple, who speak Mandarin, opened the popular cafe which is named after their youngest son. The Garratt's western-style coffee shop has a view of traffic flowing across the Yalu River that divides China and North Korea. 'It is the only foreign run coffee shop there,' explained Simeon. 'My Dad always jokes that they opened it because there wasn't any good coffee. 'They do good Western food and they have an 'English Corner' every Friday night where customers practice speaking English and find out about North America.' There have been reports that the couple also helped people plan tours to North Korea, but Simeon, a real estate agent living in Vancouver, insisted it was not a business and they just helped to arrange visits because they have a deep interest in the country and had become friends with local tour guides. 'They have a fascination with North Korea. They have friends who come over and they help arrange tours,' he said. The coffee shop's website says the cafe is only metres from the Friendship Bridge that spans the river, calling the venue the 'perfect stop off while en-route to or returning from the Hermit Kingdom'. Today the Foreign Ministry said in a short statement: 'Kevin Garratt and his wife ... are suspected of collecting and stealing intelligence materials related to Chinese military targets and important Chinese national defence scientific research programs, and engaging in activities that endanger China's national security.' China's state secrets law is notoriously broad, covering everything from industry data to the exact birth dates of state leaders. In severe cases, the theft of state secrets is punishable with life in prison or the death penalty. Beijing is also sensitive about its relationship with North Korea, whose ruined economy is partly kept afloat with Chinese aid. Information in China can be labelled a state secret retroactively. The couple moved to China in 1984 and run a coffee shop in Dandong just across the border from North Korea . The announcement of the investigation into the Garratts comes a week after Canada took the unusual step of singling out Chinese hackers for attacking a key computer network and lodged a protest with Beijing. Canadian officials have said 'a highly sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored actor' broke into the National Research Council, the government's leading research body, which works with big firms such as aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. . In response, Beijing accused Canada of making irresponsible accusations that lacked credible evidence. 'It's completely unprecedented. We haven't had this sort of thing (before),' Charles Burton, a Brock University professor who served as a diplomat at Canada's embassy in Beijing in the early 2000s, was quoted by The Globe & Mail as saying. Canada's right-leaning conservative government has had an uneven relationship with Beijing since taking power in 2006. Citing human rights concerns, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper initially kept his distance. Under pressure from business in Canada, he sought to reach out to Beijing. There have been reports that the couple also helped people plan tours to North Korea, (pictured) but their son  insisted it was not a business and they just helped to arrange visits because they have a deep interest in the country and had become friends with local tour guides . China is Canada's second most important trading partner after the United States, and bilateral trade is growing. Total Canada-China trade was C$69.8 billion in 2012 and $72.9 billion in 2013, according to official Canadian data. In July, Chinese prosecutors charged British corporate investigator Peter Humphrey and his American wife Yu Yingzeng for illegally obtaining private information. The couple were detained last year following work they did for the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and their trial is set for August 8 in Shanghai. The Canadian embassy said it was aware of reports that two Canadians had been 'detained' in China and was gathering information. 'Our consular officials stand ready to provide assistance as required,' embassy spokeswoman Mary Anne Dehler told Reuters.

"By . Jill Reilly . One of the women who killed for Charles Manson has given her first on-camera interview about why she felt compelled to murder innocent people. Patricia Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence in the California Institution for Women, says she took part in the cult killings because she was a 'coward' and  'wanted to feel loved'. Krenwinkel was convicted along with Manson and two other female followers in seven 1969 murders, considered among the most notorious crimes of the 20th Century. But the grey-haired inmate, one of Manson's two surviving female followers, claims it was her Los Angeles childhood 'in a house where silence was golden by my parents' that led her to fall so easily under Manson's deadly trance. Scroll down for video . Patricia Krenwinkel, (seen left in 1969 and right now) who is serving a life sentence in the California Institution for Women, says she took part in the cult killings because she was a 'coward' and 'wanted to feel loved' 'My older sister was deemed incorrigible by the time she was four or five, because she was a half sister and she ended up getting into drugs and she had a child by fifteen, she says in a documentary produced by Olivia Klaus and published on the New York Times. 'As I started to go to school I never felt like I had fitted in, I never had that sense of belonging,' says the 67-year-old. Krenwinkel, who is now the longest-incarcerated female inmate in the California penal system, says after her parents' divorce she moved into with her sister in Manhattan beach. Charles Manson follower Patricia Krenwinkel, centre, is seen walking to court to appear for her role in the 1969 cult killings of seven people in Los Angeles . Aged 20, she met Manson in Manhattan Beach in 1967 along with Lynette Fromme and Mary Brunner . 'I stared losing contact with friends and I dropped out of college and I went to live with my sister. 'I was starting to drink and using has hand marijuana and whatever my sister had around. I was killing for a way out. I found myself thinking there has to be more. 'I never ever developed a sense of who I was and where I was going and what I wanted to do. But aged 20, she met Manson in Manhattan Beach in 1967 along with fellow followers Lynette Fromme and Mary Brunner. 'I wanted to please, I wanted to love, I wanted for the first time to feel safe. I wanted to feel like someone was going to care for me because I hadn't felt that from anywhere else in my life,' she says. 'And in giving up and moving on with Manson was just basically throwing away the rest of my life.' On August 8, 1969 Manson and his 'Family' slaughtered Sharon Tate, the actress wife of Roman Polanski, eight and a half months pregnant, and three of her friends at her home above Beverly Hills . Homicide detectives remove Sharon Tate's body from the scene of her murder . Two years later on August 8, 1969 Manson and his 'Family' slaughtered Sharon Tate, the actress wife of Roman Polanski, eight and a half months pregnant, and three of her friends at her home above Beverly Hills. Stephen Parent was a fifth victim that night - he had driven to the property to see if caretaker William Garreston wanted to buy his AM/FM Clock radio and had stayed on for a beer at the guest house. He was shot multiple times when he wound down the window at the electric gate as he left. The following night they butchered small business owners Leno and Rosemary La Bianca, in their home in Los Angeles. Krenwinkel then wrote 'DEATH TO PIGS' in blood on the wall. Krenwinkel was 22 when she was arrested in Mobile, Alabama, by then-Mobile police officers Billy McKeller and Sam McLarty in December 1969. She admitted during her trial that she chased down and stabbed heiress Abigail Folger at the Tate home . She admitted during her trial that she chased down and stabbed heiress Abigail Folger at the Tate home and participated in the stabbing deaths of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the following night, . She was convicted along with Manson, Van Houten and Atkins. Another defendant, Charles 'Tex' Watson was convicted in a separate trial. All were sentenced to death but their sentences were commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme Court briefly outlawed the death penalty in 1972. 'At 23 I ended up on death row, I was in a cell 23 hours a day,' she recounts in the documentary. 'And I think It was at the point more than ever, all of a sudden having been on death row, and away from any influence of him that I was going to have to make the decision of my life and I would have to say that everything I had ever believed was now wrong. 'To do that was going to be the most difficult thing I had ever done because I would now have to be fully responsible for the damage, the wreckage and the horror. 'It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of and it all comes from such a simple thing as just wanting to be loved. 'The saddest part is my definition of love is totally skewed. 'Today I am who I choose to be. I take responsibility every day for every word I say, what I believe, what I do, I am who I am today. 'I learned choice at the most horrific cost.' Susan Denise Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie van Houten smile during their trial . Krenwinkel has had parole denied several times. In her 40 years at the California Institution for Women, she has earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self help programs as well as teaching illiterate prisoners how to read. In recent years, she has been involved in a program to train service dogs for the disabled. She has had a discipline-free record in prison. None of those convicted has ever been paroled and one of them, Susan Atkins, died in prison last year after being denied compassionate release when she was terminally ill with cancer.","Patricia Krenwinkel, 67, is serving a life sentence for the cult killings .
