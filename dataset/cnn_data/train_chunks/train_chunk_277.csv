"London (CNN) -- Even ""the office cat"" knew about phone hacking at News of the World, a former journalist at the tabloid insisted in court Wednesday, testifying that his phone hacking skills were the main reason former Editor Andy Coulson hired him. ""Coulson knew it,"" said Dan Evans, who confessed on the stand this week to hacking into actor Daniel Craig's voice mail and finding out that actress Sienna Miller was having an affair with the James Bond star. She was seeing actor Jude Law at the time. Coulson, who became British Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman after resigning from the tabloid over an earlier hacking scandal, is one of seven people on trial accused of phone hacking and related crimes in London. He denies the charges. News of the World owner Rupert Murdoch shut the paper down in the summer of 2011 in the face of public fury over its journalists listening to private voice mails, including those of a missing teenager Milly Dowler. Dowler later was found to have been murdered. Police investigations suggest that thousands of people, from celebrities and politicians to crime and terror victims, were targeted by News of the World phone hacking. Testy exchanges . Coulson's attorney, Timothy Langdale, spent Wednesday grilling Evans about subjects from the mechanics of phone hacking to his efforts to get immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. The exchanges got testy at times, such as when Langdale said there was nothing to stop Evans from looking for another job if he was unhappy at News of the World. ""There was nothing to stop me jumping off a bridge either, but I didn't do that,"" Evans shot back. Langdale pressed Evans on why he left the Sunday Mirror for the News of the World, questioning Evans' explanation that he wanted to stop hacking phones. Evans said he was so unhappy at the paper that he turned to alcohol and cocaine. ""Was all that because of the hacking you had to do?"" Langdale asked. ""Carrying an enormous secret made me unhappy, and delving into the lives of people who didn't deserve it made me unhappy,"" Evans testified. But he continued hacking phones at News of the World, he testified, saying it was ""absolutely"" the reason Coulson hired him. Craig's phone hacked . On Tuesday, Evans said he had played Coulson a voice mail left by Miller for Craig while she was at a club with Law, and that Coulson had said: ""Brilliant!"" Langdale pressed him Wednesday on whether Coulson had said that. ""The exact word 'brilliant' may have been paraphrasing,"" Evans said. ""You've gotten into the habit of paraphrasing, haven't you?"" Langdale shot back. A similar exchange came later Wednesday morning when Langdale attacked Evans' assertion that phone hacking was discussed at the main weekly News of the World news meeting. Evans conceded that his account was based on hearsay from a colleague. ""You're prone to making sweeping assertions which are not based in fact, aren't you?"" the defense lawyer demanded. ""That is not correct, sir, although I understand why you might want people to think that,"" Evans said. Coulson was editor of the paper in 2006 when its royal correspondent was arrested for conspiracy to hack phones. The correspondent, Clive Goodman, later pleaded guilty. Coulson then resigned, always denying he knew of the hacking. Then Cameron, the British Conservative party leader, hired Coulson to be his top communications adviser. Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010. At the height of the phone hacking furor in July 2011, Cameron said he would make a profound apology if it turned out that Coulson had lied about his knowledge of phone hacking. The hacking allegations prompted Cameron to set up an independent inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the media with the public, police and politicians.","Reporter tells court he was hired for his phone hacking skills at now-defunct tabloid .

"(CNN) -- Rights group Amnesty International has condemned a reported Saudi court ruling sentencing a man to be paralyzed as retribution for having paralyzed another man as ""outrageous."" In a statement issued Tuesday, the rights group called the punishment ""torture,"" adding that it ""should on no account be carried out."" Local media reports about the case surfaced over the weekend. The Saudi Gazette, an English language daily paper, reported that Ali Al-Khawahir was 14 when he stabbed and paralyzed his best friend 10 years ago. Al-Khawahir, who has been in prison ever since, has been sentenced to be paralyzed if he cannot come up with one million Saudi Riyals ($266,000) in compensation to be paid to the victim, the newspaper reported. CNN cannot independently verify the reports. ""Paralyzing someone as punishment for a crime would be torture,"" said Ann Harrison, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""That such a punishment might be implemented is utterly shocking, even in a context where flogging is frequently imposed as a punishment for some offenses, as happens in Saudi Arabia."" The rights group calls this an example of a ""qisas,"" or retribution, case, adding that ""other sentences passed have included eye-gouging, tooth extraction, and death in cases of murder. ""In such cases, the victim can demand the punishment be carried out, request financial compensation or grant a conditional or unconditional pardon."" Despite repeated attempts, the Saudi Justice Ministry could not be reached for comment on the case. ""If implemented, the paralysis sentence would contravene the U.N. Convention against Torture to which Saudi Arabia is a state party and the Principles of Medical Ethics adopted by the UN General Assembly,"" Amnesty International said. This is not the first time a ""paralysis as punishment"" sentence has made headlines in Saudi Arabia. In 2010, local media reported the case of a 22-year-old man who was paralyzed in a fight, saying he had subsequently requested paralysis as punishment for the man he'd fought with. After the initial reports, the Saudi Ministry of Justice denied that paralysis had ever been considered as punishment in that case.","A Saudi court has sentenced a man to be paralyzed if he can't pay compensation, media say .

"London (CNN) -- A former editor for the News of the World was released without charge Friday by British police hours after he had been taken into custody, but was told to report back to police in October. Andy Coulson was arrested earlier Friday in connection with allegations of phone hacking and corruption in a case that promises to be a growing political liability for Prime Minister David Cameron, whom Coulson had served as press secretary. ""I came in today voluntarily as I have been offering to do in the last few months,"" Coulson told reporters outside Lewisham Police station. ""There is an awful lot I would like to say but I can't."" The newspaper's former royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, was also taken into custody Friday. Metropolitan police would not say whether he was released, but implied that was the case. In a statement, police said that a 53-year-old man had been arrested in connection with corruption allegations and was released. Goodman, 53, had been sentenced to four months in prison in 2007 over the phone hacking. Another arrest occurred Friday night, when police said officers from the Operation Weeting team had arrested a 63-year-old man at a residence in Surrey on suspicion of corruption. The team is conducting the phone hacking investigation. The scandal has prompted questions over the British prime minister's judgment in hiring Coulson after he resigned as editor of the News of the World because of the allegations. Speaking shortly before his former aide's arrest was announced, Cameron went on the defensive at a Downing Street news conference Friday, saying: ""The decision to hire him was mine, and mine alone."" He said he gave Coulson a second chance after receiving assurances that he had not been involved in wrongdoing at the newspaper. Coulson had resigned from the News of the World after its then-royal editor, Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed for intercepting voice-mail messages left for royal aides. Coulson denied knowledge of their activities. Asked about media reports of a search of the offices of the Daily Star, where Goodman now works, police said there was an ongoing search of business premises in central London, but did not confirm that the Daily Star building was involved. Meanwhile, prosecutors have asked Strathclyde Police in Scotland to look into allegations of phone hacking and data protection breaches ""in light of further emerging developments regarding the News of the World."" Earlier Friday, Labour leader Ed Miliband called on Cameron to admit the ""appalling error of judgment"" he had made in hiring Coulson and to apologize for bringing him into the heart of government. Cameron used his address to call for full inquiries into the phone hacking scandal, urging a broad reform of the press. He said the News of the World turmoil ""is not just about journalists on one newspaper, it's not even just about the press -- it's also about the police and about how politics works, and politicians too."" A fresh start is needed, he said, after decades in which politicians from the Labour and Conservative parties grew too close to the news media. ""This is a wake-up call,"" he said. ""It's on my watch that the music has stopped and I'm saying loud and clear that the relationship has to change in the future."" Cameron also referred to Rebekah Brooks, the embattled chief executive of News International and former News of the World editor who is said to be a friend of Cameron, saying that he would have accepted her reported offer to resign. News International is the parent company of New of the World. The prime minister said the full public inquiry into wrongdoing at the paper should be led by a judge to ensure its impartiality, with ""no stone left unturned."" But it will not begin until after a police investigation into alleged criminal activity has concluded. However, he said, a second independent inquiry into ""the culture, the practices and the ethics of the British press"" should begin as soon as this summer and look into a new system of regulation. The public has been let down by the police, the politicians who represent them and the news media, Cameron said, and he promised to do everything he can to give people a press that is ""clean and trustworthy."" On Thursday, the News of the World's parent company, News International, announced that Sunday's edition of the scandal-hit tabloid will be its last. The move followed accusations that the News of the World illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities, and claims it may have bribed police officers. Police said Thursday they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of hacking. If Coulson is implicated, the fallout could have damaging consequences for Cameron. He is close to current and former top officials at News International, former Tony Blair spokesman Alastair Campbell told CNN Thursday. Miliband said Cameron must ""come clean"" about any conversations he may have had with Coulson about phone hacking, before and after Coulson was appointed communications chief. Coulson resigned as editor in January 2007 after Goodman and Mulcaire were jailed. After he moved to his communications role with the Conservative Party, the scandal resurfaced. Coulson was questioned by police in November and resigned from his Downing Street position last January, despite the Crown Prosecution Service ruling that there was ""no admissible evidence"" to bring criminal charges. Miliband said the system of self-regulation through the Press Complaints Commission has failed. He described the press watchdog as a ""toothless poodle"" in need of reform. A new body with more independence is needed, he said, to restore the reputation of British journalism. He also said politicians must take some of the blame for letting the news media gain too much power. ""For too long, the political class have been too concerned about what people in the press would think and too fearful of speaking out"" rather than standing up for the rights of the people, he said. And he urged senior executives at News International, including the chairman, James Murdoch, to take responsibility for the scandal. ""I welcome James Murdoch's admission of serious errors. But closing the News of the World, possibly to reopen as the Sunday Sun, is not the answer. Instead, those who were in charge must take responsibility for what happened."" The scandal has heightened debate over a proposed takeover of broadcaster BSkyB by News Corp., which owns News International. All are part of the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, father of James Murdoch. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt will consider the impact of the News of the World's closure as he reviews its bid for BSkyB, his department said. Miliband joined other members of parliament in expressing concern over the deal, saying it has ""significant implications for media ownership in Britain"" at a time when public confidence in News Corp. executives is low. James Murdoch said Thursday, in announcing the shutdown, that the scandal had ""sullied"" News of the World and ""has no place in our company."" And paying out-of-court settlements to some victims was ""wrong and a matter of serious regret,"" he said. The paper's roughly 200 employees are now out of jobs, but are free to apply for other positions within News International, the company said. The layoffs have angered union representatives. On Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch called allegations against his flagship Sunday paper ""deplorable and unacceptable."" News of the World was the first British national newspaper Rupert Murdoch bought, in 1969, as he began to propel himself from Australian newspaper proprietor to international media magnate. In addition to owning News of the World, News International owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corp. also encompasses Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers.

"HAMMOND, Louisiana (CNN) -- The actions of a justice of the peace in Louisiana who refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple have prompted some top officials, including Gov. Bobby Jindal, to call for his dismissal. Beth Humphrey and Terence McKay say they were denied a marriage license because of their race. Jindal said the state judiciary committee should review the incident in which Keith Bardwell, justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to issue a marriage license to Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend, Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond. ""This is a clear violation of constitutional rights and federal and state law. ... Disciplinary action should be taken immediately -- including the revoking of his license,"" the Republican governor said. Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said the committee should ""use its authority to have Justice Bardwell dismissed from his position."" ""Not only does [Bardwell's] decision directly contradict Supreme Court rulings, it is an example of the ugly bigotry that divided our country for too long,"" she said.  Watch Terence McKay react to the denial of a marriage license » . Bardwell has not returned repeated calls from CNN this week. However, Bardwell told Hammond's Daily Star in a story published Thursday that he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. ""I'm not a racist,"" Bardwell told the newspaper. ""I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children."" Bardwell, stressing that he couldn't personally endorse the marriage, said his wife referred the couple to another justice of the peace. The bride says the case boils down to discrimination. Humphrey said on Thursday that she called Bardwell on October 6 to ask about getting a marriage license, and was asked by his wife whether it would be an interracial marriage. Humphrey said she was told that Bardwell does not sign off on interracial marriages. She said the couple, who received their marriage license October 9 from another justice of the peace in the same parish, have reached out to an attorney to determine their next step. ""We would like him to resign,"" she said. ""He doesn't believe he's being racist, but it is racist."" Patricia Morris, president of the NAACP branch of Tangipahoa Parish said her NAACP chapter has forwarded the case to the state and national levels of the civil rights group. ""He's an elected public official and one of his duties is to marry people. He doesn't have the right to say he doesn't believe in it,"" Morris said Thursday. ""If he doesn't do what his position calls for him to do, he should resign from that position."" According to the Census Bureau, Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black. The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia case. In the unanimous decision, the court said that ""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the state.""

"London (CNN) -- British prosecutors have charged a former aide to British Prime Minister David Cameron and a close confidant of media baron Rupert Murdoch with illegal eavesdropping on voice mail, authorities said Tuesday. Cameron's former director of communications Andy Coulson is among eight journalists facing charges, as is Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Murdoch's News International. The names of the suspected hacking victims announced include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Paul McCartney, soccer star Wayne Rooney and actor Jude Law. Read more: Full CPS statement . The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism, led to the closing of a major tabloid and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Murdoch. The charging announcement delivers one more public relations blow to Murdoch, who last week stepped down from a string of company boards of directors and further distanced himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune. Coulson and Brooks are former editors of the defunct Murdoch tabloid the News of the World, which was shut down last year in the face of public outrage at the hacking scandal. That preceded News Corp.'s decision to withdraw a multi-billion-dollar bid to take over British Sky Broadcasting. Likewise, Tuesday's developments add further potential embarrassment for Cameron, who hired Coulson to run his communications team in May 2010. Coulson quit the post in Cameron's office last year when police opened a new investigation into phone hacking. It's the first time anyone has been charged with phone hacking in the 18-month investigation. Brooks, who was charged with conspiracy to intercept voice mails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, vigorously denied the charges, saying she was ""distressed and angry."" ""The charge concerning Milly Dowler is particularly upsetting, not only as it is untrue, but also because I have spent my journalistic career campaigning for victims of crime,"" she said in a statement released by her lawyers. Coulson said he ""wouldn't and, more importantly, that I didn't, do anything to damage the Milly Dowler investigation."" He said his tabloid ""worked on behalf of the victims of crime, particularly violent crime, and the idea that I would then sit in my office dreaming up schemes to undermine investigations is simply untrue."" He said he was disappointed by the charges and would fight them in court. Another of the suspects named Tuesday appeared to point the finger at others. ""I have always operated under the strict guidance and advice of News International's lawyers and under the instructions of the newspaper's editors which will be abundantly clear when this matter comes to court,"" one-time News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck said on his blog. Cameron's office and News International declined to comment, as did McCartney and a number of other celebrities named as potential victims. British law places tight restrictions on what can be reported about people facing criminal charges. Former British Home Secretary David Blunkett was one of several suspected phone-hacking victims who cited fear of interfering with the prosecution when declining to comment on the charges. Five other journalists were charged, the Crown Prosecution Service announced, while three will not be prosecuted. The CPS said it is still waiting to decide about two other cases. The journalists facing charges include former top News of the World staff, including Thurlbeck, former managing editor Stuart Kuttner and editor Ian Edmondson. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who is suspected of carrying out the hacking, is also among the eight. They are next due to appear in a magistrates court on August 16, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Prosecutors allege there were more than 600 victims of phone hacking between 2000 and 2006. Read more: Familiar abuse of power as press fights regulation . Coulson resigned as editor after an earlier round of the phone-hacking scandal involving the paper's royal correspondent Clive Goodman and private investigator Mulcaire. They were sent to prison for hacking into the voice mails of staffers working for Prince William and Prince Harry. Coulson said he knew nothing about the hacking but resigned because he was editor of the paper at the time. Brooks went on to become chief executive of News International after her time at News of the World and is seen as personally close to Murdoch. She quit News International, the British newspaper publishing arm of News Corp., amid the scandal last summer. Murdoch recently resigned from a number of positions within News Corp., his global media empire, as the company began moves to separate its entertainment and publishing arms following the scandal. News Corp. shares trade in New York, where markets were closed when the CPS made its announcement. British police have been investigating phone hacking by people working for Murdoch since January 2011 and have arrested dozens on suspicion of phone hacking, computer hacking and corruption. Read more: Timeline of UK phone hacking scandal . The scandal exploded with the revelation that one of the hacking victims was Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old British girl whose phone was hacked after she disappeared in 2002. She was later found murdered. The Met Police continues to investigate claims of phone hacking in their investigation, known as Operation Weeting. A parallel police operation is investigating claims of inappropriate payments to police and public officials. Cameron established a separate independent judge-led inquiry into media ethics, the Leveson Inquiry, after the news of the hacking of Dowler's voice messages. Cameron and other senior current and former government figures have been called to testify before the inquiry, as have Murdoch and Brooks. Dowler's parents told the inquiry in November how phone hacking on behalf of News of the World had given them false hope their missing daughter was still alive. In fact, the messages had been accessed by a private investigator working for News of the World, Dowler's father, Bob, told the inquiry panel. The young girl had already been murdered.

"(CNN) -- I spent part of my childhood in Ankara, Turkey, and part of it in Madrid, Spain. The school I attended in Ankara was a local building where they strictly followed the Turkish curriculum. My classroom oversaw a large courtyard, which we couldn't see from our benches during class hours since all the windows had been half-painted in gray. Who had done it, I often wondered. Whose idea was it to cover the windows in such a dull color to prevent us from peering into the world outside? The school I attended in Madrid was an international college with a predominantly British curriculum. I was the only Turk there. There were interesting contrasts between the two institutions, each of which left an impact on my young mind and soul. But the distinction that perhaps struck me most was the presence and the absence in each of ""the national oath"". In Ankara, every Monday morning we would gather in the schoolyard, hundreds of us, wearing black uniforms and snow-white lace collars. Turning our faces towards the bust of Ataturk -- the founder of modern Turkey -- and keeping our arms straight like soldiers, we would chant in perfect unison: ""I am a Turk, I am correct, I am diligent ..."" And we would finish the oath with the same pledge: ""May my existence be a gift to you!"" It was that final line that disturbed me deep inside. I just wanted to be myself. Nothing more, nothing less. Why was my being an offering to the Turkish state and the Turkish nation? Could I not have a Self separate from the collective Self? As years went by I started asking new questions: Was there room for individuality in the Turkish society? If so what were its limits and why? Generations in Turkey have grown up repeating the national oath. Even if you were Kurdish you were still expected to say aloud, ""I am a Turk."" It was assumed that we all shared the same nationality (Turkish) and the same religion (Muslim) -- even those students who were Jewish or Armenian. The school system was based on sameness. We were treated as a mass of undifferentiated beings rather than individuals with diverse backgrounds and varying talents. It was only in 2013 that the national oath was abolished. But the ideology of sameness remains deeply-rooted. Today, it is just as difficult as yesterday to be and to remain an individual in Turkey. It is harder for women. In Turkey a woman is primarily seen as someone's wife or someone's daughter or someone's mother. As a woman novelist, I am always treated as a woman first, then as a writer. For a male novelist it is the exact opposite. He is seen as a writer first and then people talk about his gender, if at all. One thing that makes me happy as a writer is to witness the diversity of my readers in Turkey: conservatives, liberals, leftists, secularists, Kemalists, Kurds, Alevis, Jews, Armenians ... Women with headscarves, women in miniskirts. But Turkey's mainstream culture is deeply suspicious of ""difference"" -- be it cultural, ethnic or sexual. Turkish society is stubbornly patriarchal and homophobic. Sameness is venerated. The Prime Minister tells us that every Turkish woman should have at least three children while the government talks about the need for creating a ""new, pious Muslim youth."" When identity is imposed from above, once again, individuality is in danger. Imagination is in danger. This land, which once upon a time, was a multi-ethnic, multilingual and multi-religious empire, has turned itself into a nation-state where uniformity and authoritarianism are venerated at the expense of diversity and cosmopolitanism. Turkey is filled with dynamism and potential for change but its adherence to sameness is stifling creativity and preventing it becoming a true and mature democracy. It is frustrating to see how little progress we have made over the years when it comes to improving our democracy, freedom of speech and women's rights. We draw endless zigzags; one step forward, one step back. And beneath the weight of sameness, Turkish society is more polarized than ever. The gap between supporters of the Prime Minister's AKP party and its opponents is so wide that no one even attempts to bridge it anymore. We are divided into ghettoes of the like-minded. Glass walls surround us everywhere. We see each other but we neither listen nor talk, afraid and paranoid of the Other. As a result, the culture of coexistence, which was never profound in the first place, is eroding fast. There are only three areas left where people from different cultural and political backgrounds can still get together: art, literature and football. Outside these spaces we are a badly divided society.","Until 2013, Turkish children would chant a national oath at school, says Elif Shafak .

"(CNN) -- A judge in California just sent shock waves across America's public education system, declaring tenure laws unconstitutional. The case started two years ago, when nine students sued the state of California, asserting that their constitutional right to equality of education is violated by laws that protect ""grossly inadequate teachers."" Two unions representing 425,000 teachers stepped in to fight the students, their families and a legal team backed by a powerful education reformer, Students Matter. The students had two main arguments. First, that five California laws that allow public school teachers to secure (and keep) tenure after 18 short months caused the students to be unreasonably exposed to ""grossly ineffective teachers."" And second, that minority and poor students were disproportionately stuck with them. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu not only agreed with the students, he drew parallels between his opinion and the decision in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down ""separate but equal"" laws and ended segregation in schools. Treu put a spotlight on the negative impact (loss of competency and earning potential) that grossly ineffective teachers have on kids and labeled it ""compelling"" and ""a shock to the system."" The judicial beat down was so complete and unequivocal, the judge struck down any and all laws that protect grossly ineffective teachers at the expense of kids, including laws that protect ""permanent employment status,"" ""first in first out"" and ""dismissal statutes."" Here were the key elements of the ruling: . 1. California is one of 37 states that give permanent employment status to teachers in three years or less. In California, it was a mere 18 months on the job. The judge found that both teachers and students are ""disadvantaged"" by the practice and that there's ""no legally cognizable reason (let alone a compelling one)"" to rush to tenure. 2. ""Dismissal statues."" Experts testified that dismissals in California are ""extremely rare"" and administrators find it next to ""impossible"" to get rid of ineffective teachers. In 38 states, teachers can have multiple appeals and the process is so complex and costly it can take up to 10 years in some states and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to remove someone. The judge found the termination process such a joke he called it an ""illusion."" 3. ""Last In, First Out."" In 33 states, if there are layoffs, it's last in, first out with no regard of merit. The judge raised the common-sense point that if the best teacher is the junior one, his or her merit should be considered in the decision of who to lay off. The message is loud and clear: Students, we've got your back. Unions, get ready for a fight. And a fight it will be. This isn't just a case about schools in California, but one that education reformers and teachers' unions are watching across the nation. The unions plan to fight for tenure all the way to the Supreme Court if they have to -- and it's a fight I believe they will lose in both the courts of law and the court of public opinion. We all agree that schools are a place where the first and foremost goal should be to help children learn and succeed. We also agree that schools are failing. Pick any metric (drop-out rates, comparisons to other countries, grade-level competencies), and you'll find a system that's horribly broken. Ask anyone how to fix it and you'll get widely different answers. I personally agree with both Sir Ken Robinson's assessment of our schools and his argument for a total paradigm shift in education; you may have a different TED Talk you prefer on education. Great, competent teachers are the single most important factor in kids in-school learning and growth experience. I encourage you to read the opinion. This judge acknowledges how powerful teachers are and describes the power they truly have to make a difference: ""Competent teachers are a critical, if not most important component of success of a child's in-school education experience."" There are many outside-school factors that impact students: poverty, violence, home life, health, nutrition or disabilities but as this judge so eloquently writes, ""quality of teaching is what matters most for the students' development and learning in school."" This decision isn't an indictment of teachers in general; it's a statement about the critical difference they make (positive and negative) and a take down of laws that protect the ""grossly inadequate"" ones. It's sad that the unions are gearing up for a fight. It's too bad the judge couldn't just make his decision and assign a little homework instead. How remarkable would it be to see a teachers union leader, who claims that the union puts kids first, have to write an essay reflecting on the lessons learned after hearing testimony for two months. Maybe, just maybe, 18 months is a bit hasty for a tenure review. Maybe ""Last In, First Out"" isn't the best layoff system for kids or for teachers. Maybe overhauling the dismissal process for incompetent teachers is not only best for students but actually strengthens the union because its active members are the ones who are more effective in the classroom. It was a shame in 1954 that students had to sue to gain their constitutional right to equal access to education, and it's a shame that 60 years later students are still fighting to secure it and teachers' unions are the ones fighting them every step of the way.","Judge in California ruled the state's tenure laws are unconstitutional .

"Beijing (CNN) -- An acrid blanket of gray shrouded the Chinese capital for a third day Sunday, leading to a rare smog warning as the index hit record levels. Data show air quality index soared past the highest level of 500. Anything past that is regarded as ""beyond index."" As the number soared, the streets got emptier. The sun, peeking shyly behind the hazy blanket, was barely visible. Authorities warned residents to cut down on outdoor activities and take shelter indoors. Reports of respiratory problems -- and sale of masks -- skyrocketed, according to state media. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing recorded an index of over 700 on Saturday, but the number had lowered by Sunday. Read more: Which city has best quality of life? Beijing residents say pollution is worsening despite authorities' assertions that air quality has improved since the city hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. Last year, heavy haze and smog forced the cancellation of almost 700 flights at Beijing airports. The city is comparable to Los Angeles, another gray city, according to experts. ""With their difficult meteorological conditions and a large number of pollution sources, addressing pollution is a long-term and difficult task,"" Deborah Seligsohn, adviser of the World Resources Institute, said last year.

"(CNN) -- The global oil market is on tenterhooks as a result of the violent Sunni insurgency sweeping down from northern Iraq and threatening Baghdad. Iraq has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and the uncertainty has pushed the price of the global benchmark, North Sea Brent, up 10% in the last two weeks to as high as $115 a barrel. Oil has hit a nine-month high and is close to what many would consider an economic danger zone. Another $10 spike could undermine growth from the U.S. to China by pushing up the cost of transportation and production. But the real acid test for the market is unfolding now, as the ISIS militants enter Saddam Hussein's former territorial stronghold around the Baiji refinery. And markets are pricing in a potential supply risk -- including the possibility of a divided Iraq. Baiji is a sprawling complex with a refining capacity of 290 thousand barrels a day, according to the former head of energy studies at OPEC Saadallah Al Fathi. The battle for Baiji, with conflicting reports of who is in control, is indicative of what is wrong in Iraq. There is no cohesive national strategy that brings together Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. The national petroleum law has been parked within Iraq's parliament for five years. The bill would finally establish a revenue sharing agreement for national production from the Shiite south to the Kurdish north, and eventually the under-explored south-western corner of the country. The government of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in his bi-lateral meeting Monday, has been unable to unite Iraqis. One could argue the country's oil bounty has been a blockade in efforts to find a resolution. Iraq has been a growing force in the markets. The executive director of the International Energy Agency Maria van der Hoeven recently described it as a country with the last of the ""easy oil."" It is not difficult to find or to produce and it is plentiful, but last week she noted its ""expansion looks increasingly at risk,"" in the IEA's Medium Term Oil Market Report. The country sits on an estimated 143 billion barrels of proven reserves. Daily output hit a 35-year high of 3.6 million barrels day this year, placing Iraq right behind Saudi Arabia, within OPEC. Last year, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister for Energy Hussain Al-Shahristani told me of aspirations to hit 12 million barrels a day in the next decade, which would put it head-to-head with Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia. The IEA is suggesting about half of that level would be an ambitious target. But the market is far more cautious, and is pricing in a severe interruption to those production plans. There is, indeed, a ""new reality"" on the ground, as Masoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish Regional Government, told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Tuesday. Not knowing how the ISIS insurgency will play out, or who will control refining capacity, could favor Shiite-controlled facilities around Basra in the south and Kurdish-controlled production blocks in the north. A ""who's who"" of big oil names -- Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, Total, Lukoil of Russia and China National Petroleum -- operate out of both areas. Further upset will send significant ripples through the world markets. Executives I have spoken to say they have not yet suffered security breaches, but that they have set up private forces to protect oil assets. The executives speak of evacuation plans that are in place, but at this stage do not believe they will be needed. But, as Barzani has said, Iraq is in a new reality.","The global oil market is on tenterhooks as the ISIS insurgency sweeps Iraq .
Oil prices are rising as markets take in risk -- and the chances of a split Iraq .
The country has huge oil reserves which have so far escaped major upset .

"London (CNN) -- Diehard supporters, tourists and the curious swamped pockets of left-wing protesters to bid farewell to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in London Wednesday. In scenes that echoed the divisions Thatcher drove through Britain as she transformed the economy and society during the 1980s, people of all social classes lined the route from the Palace of Westminster to St. Paul's, some to pay tribute, some to condemn and many just to get up close to a spectacular state occasion. Hours before the ceremony began, the crowds were already five or six deep in some places; thousands crammed onto the sidewalk alongside souvenir shops and cafes opposite the cathedral -- for centuries a symbol of London and the site of historic moments in the life of the city, from the Blitz to the Royal Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana to the Occupy protests. Many of the onlookers were smartly dressed, their dark outfits echoing the formal suits of the ""official"" mourners; others carried Union Jacks, photographs of the ""Iron Lady"" and fold-up picnic chairs, giving the somber occasion a somewhat festive air. Follow live updates of the funeral of former UK PM Margaret Thatcher . ""I had to be here,"" said Ian Twinn, a child of the Thatcher era, originally from Essex in eastern England, who traveled from his home in New York especially for the funeral. He typified the sort of person for whom Thatcher's legacy of free-market economics and individuality had the greatest impact. ""I was a boy in the 1980s. Rightly or wrongly, she changed the landscape of the UK forever, and she made me feel I could do anything,"" said Twinn. ""We haven't seen anybody like her since -- on either side of the Atlantic."" For Jacqueline Lawrie, from London, who met Thatcher several times in the 1980s while working as a photographer on the local paper in her constituency, Britain's first female PM was a huge influence. ""She was a real inspiration for women -- she made us feel we could achieve anything we wanted to,"" Lawrie said. Fellow Londoner Catherine Bingham agreed: ""She did so much to show women that there isn't a glass ceiling."" While the majority of those in the crowds were old enough to remember Thatcher's era well, younger mourners were also on hand to pay tribute. ""She had a really good attitude and didn't let anything stand in her way,"" said Alistair Brockbanks, who was just four years old when Thatcher left Downing Street for the last time, ""I think she's quite inspirational to people."" Rewriting history: How UK might have been without Thatcher . Iain McGill, from Edinburgh, said Thatcher ""showed the value, the power of ideas. She changed the lives of tens of millions of people for the better, she defeated Communism. She changed the world, not down the barrel of a gun but through ideas."" But others in the crowd felt Thatcher's 11 years in power had left the UK a less positive legacy. At Ludgate Circus on the approach to St. Paul's, a crowd of about 100 protesters waved placards, rainbow-hued ""Peace"" flags and signs reading ""Tory Scum,"" ""Anarchists Against Thatcher"" and ""Respect is earned in life, not death"" as the Union Jack-draped coffin, topped with an opulent arrangement of cream roses, passed by on a gun carriage. Rowland, from London, was among those waving Socialist Worker placards reading: ""We remember: The miners, Falklands, Poll Tax, Bobby Sands. Now bury Thatcherism,"" a summing up of the coal battles, the Falklands Conflict, a hated tax based on homes and an Irish Republican Army convict who died on hunger strike. ""I'm not here to celebrate Thatcher's death, which I think some are,"" he insisted. ""I'm here because this shouldn't have been a state funeral. David Cameron and others have tried to present this as a moment of state unity, but she's not a unifying figure -- the ideas she represents are continuing to do great harm to the country."" London's police, well used to running security in a city where the pomp and ceremony of royal and state occasions is a feature of life, had warned protesters to exercise carefully their right to object to what Thatcher stood for. Turning their backs on the military procession carrying Thatcher's casket was acceptable; yelling obscenities and throwing objects was not. Even some of the protesters were of a very British kind: Polite to a fault. ""Rest in Peace, but Kindness is better than Greed,"" read one sign, carried by James Wilkinson, from London. 'Hurt and anger' from Thatcher policies still felt . ""It's a protest, but a mild one,"" he explained. ""I really wanted to see the spectacle, I admit that, but I thought if I came, I had to show that I'm no fan of Margaret Thatcher. I didn't think she warranted such an occasion."" Many of those who lined the streets in tribute to the former PM said they understood that she was a polarizing figure. ""Whether you like someone or not, and whether you like what they did or not, you have to be respectful,"" said Lionel Voke, an activist in the Conservative Party that the ""Iron Lady"" led to three election victories. ""We're here out of respect -- to us, she was wonderful. I accept that not everyone sees it the same way, but it's the same if Tony Blair died. I wouldn't necessarily come, but I'd expect him to be treated with respect, and I'd want him to rest in peace."" Blair led the reformed Labour Party to victory over the Conservatives in 1997, seven years after Thatcher was unceremoniously bundled out of office in a political coup by her colleagues. He was among the mourners at the funeral, a reminder that she saw the adoption of free market economic policies by the rival Labour Party as perhaps her greatest achievement -- an orthodoxy few in the political mainstream challenge despite the banking crisis and a lengthy recession. ""People have a right to have their say, and they did that on Saturday at their protests, but I don't think you should interrupt people's grief -- this is a family which has lost their mother, their grandmother,"" said Ian Twinn. Others were clearly angered by the presence of what they saw as an ""obnoxious and tasteless"" protest, with mutterings of ""no respect,"" and ""put them on the front line!"" spreading through the crowd. But one of those demonstrating against Thatcher's legacy, Ben, from London, said he had thought carefully about the wording of his banner: ""RIP: Regulated finance industry, fair taxes, communities, the great British mining industry, free milk for schoolkids,"" because ""I didn't want to be insulting or disrespectful."" Thatcher: Revered and reviled, in death as in life . And for the most part, the boos and chants were drowned out by ordinary members of the public who came to bid farewell to a woman who transformed Britain and, in some cases, their own lives. ""We know what the UK was like before 1979 and it wasn't pleasant,"" said Voke. ""I started my own business in the 1970s, and it thrived in the '80s -- I credit Margaret Thatcher for that."" That was a sentiment echoed by Fred Ehrlich, a ""great admirer"" of Thatcher, who moved to the UK from his native Germany in 1957. ""She was just what this country needed. Before she came along, in the 1970s, it was awful here, they used to call it 'the sick man of Europe,' but she changed all that."" The funeral -- officially ceremonial rather than a state occasion in a distinction invisible to all but the most pedantic royal watcher -- was the first for a former prime minister and war leader since Winston Churchill's body was borne along the same route a generation ago. In recognition of her role in the Falklands conflict with Argentina in the early 1980s, pall-bearers from each of the UK's armed services carried Thatcher's coffin into the cathedral, having escorted it from the official church of the Royal Air Force. Retired RAF serviceman David Tindall, from Kent in southeastern England, was one of many former armed forces personnel there ""to pay my respects to a lady I thought was the greatest prime minister since Churchill."" While for many the day was a somber one, for Katherine Mills, from London, it was a positive occasion. ""I don't really do funerals, but for her, I thought I should come along. It feels like a celebration,"" she said. ""It's like the changing of the guard; we've moved into a different season with her passing. It's not a sad occasion -- she had had an amazing life."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Supporters turn out to honor the ""Iron Lady"" at her funeral at London's St Paul's Cathedral .

"(CNN) -- When a new president strolls into the White House, there's a kick in his step and a twinkle in his eyes. This photo illustration projects what President-elect Barack Obama may look like in four years. But as the years go by, the high-stakes decisions, constant criticisms and the fluctuating public opinion chip away at the president. His shoulders slump a little and his energy may seem sapped. The president ages twice as fast while in office, according to a theory advanced by Dr. Michael Roizen, a chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic. ""The typical person who lives one year ages one year,"" he said.  ""The typical president ages two years for every year they are in office."" Using public information, Roizen looked through medical records of previous presidents back to Theodore Roosevelt. Assessing factors such as diet, blood pressure, physical activity and lifestyle habits, he calculated that the leader of the free world ages more quickly. Roizen, who is the author of ""RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?"" has not assessed the ""real age"" of President-elect Barack Obama, who is 47, because of lack of medical data. ""Barack Obama is a fairly young guy and doesn't have great of a risk,"" Roizen said.  ""If he's president for eight years, he ends up having the risk of disability or dying, like someone who is 16 years older."" Former president Bill Clinton entered the office with a robust head of salt-and-pepper hair and a healthy habit of running.  After bitter partisan battles, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and impeachment by the House, Clinton left office with wrinkles and powder-white hair. ""Chronic stress can produce lots of wear and tear on the body,"" said James A. McCubbin, a Clemson University professor of psychology and senior associate dean of the College of Business and Behavioral Science. ""This is what we see in the changes in the appearance in the beginning and end of the presidency."" Roizen points to the experience of Ronald Reagan. ""When Reagan came into office, he stood up absolutely straight. He was joking and incredibly quick-witted about current events. When he left office, he was hunched over. The age signs on face was there. His jokes were those of olden days rather than current events,"" he said.  See the toll of the presidency » . On Wednesday, Obama, President George W. Bush, and all three living former presidents -- Jimmy Carter, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Clinton -- are meeting in the Oval Office and then having lunch together at the White House. After eight draining years in the Oval Office, an outgoing president like George W. Bush can reverse the tolls of stress by exercising and spending time with friends, Roizen says. ""Do as many healthy things as you can adopt,"" Roizen suggested.  ""The main thing he should do is finding what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which is tough for presidents to find something meaningful to do."" During his second term, Bush dealt with a troubled war, a struggling economy, and sagging approval ratings.  But the avid runner, mountain biker and fisherman showed that his reflexes haven't slowed. ""I mean, did you see him dodge that shoe?"" said David Zinczenko, editor-in-chief of Men's Health magazine, referring to a December news conference in Iraq where an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the president and Bush swiftly ducked the flying footwear. Twice. The incoming president is also no slacker. Although accused by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of having skinny legs, Obama regularly frequents the gym and plays basketball. The president-elect was on the cover of Men's Health in November. ""This is not a broccoli-shunning, pork rind-eating, McDonald's-popping guy. I mean, this is someone who eats arugula and guacamole and Hawaiian pizza,"" Zinczenko told CNN.   Watch a report on presidential aging » . ""If the worst that happens is that your hair goes a little gray, so be it."" Many recent presidents have turned to sports to decompress. Presidents have enjoyed mountain biking (George W. Bush), golf (Clinton, Gerald Ford, Dwight D. Eisenhower), tennis (Ford, Carter, George H.W. Bush), jogging (Clinton, Carter and both Bushes), swimming (Ford), bowling (Richard Nixon), horseshoes (George H.W. Bush) and horseback riding (Reagan). Check out projected aging of other political leaders . ""The daily routine of a president is really grueling,"" Ron Nessen, Ford's press secretary, told CNN. ""It's hard to get thinking time. Ford talked about how when he was swimming laps, it gave him time to think about things."" During the Democratic primaries, Obama worked out at the gym in the Cleveland Clinic the morning of his debate with then-rival Hilary Clinton. Living up to his nickname ""No Drama Obama,"" the candidate was remarkably calm, considering a high-stakes debate was to take place that night, Roizen recalled. ""Maybe he will age better, because he handles stress better,"" he said.  ""The fact that he smokes means he still has inner stress."" Retaining a close group of friends and confidants is an important way to reduce the isolation of the presidency, Roizen said. CNN's Alina Cho and David S. Martin contributed to this report.","Presidents age twice as fast, says a theory by expert on aging at Cleveland Clinic .

"(CNN) -- Even by dramatic jailbreak standards, this escape was particularly brazen. Two men posing as tourists reportedly commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates using cables or ropes into the hovering aircraft -- and zipped away. All in broad daylight. All in full view of incredulous witnesses. It was a real ""James Bond moment,"" witness Francis Emond told CNN affiliate CTV about Sunday's escape from the correctional facility in Saint -Jerome, about half-hour northwest of Montreal. But despite the movie-worthy getaway, the prisoners' freedom didn't last long. By early Monday morning, authorities arrested both inmates and two other people. Sky's no limit: 5 epic helicopter prison escapes . A pilot roped into the plot? Authorities have not yet said how long they believe the plot had been percolating. But it was put into play early Sunday afternoon. The helicopter belonged to a tour company in Mont-Tremblant, a city in Quebec about 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Montreal. Two men posing as tourists hired the chopper for a tour, said a reporter from LCN television network who said he knows the pilot. Once they were in the air, the men held a gun to the pilot's head and reportedly ordered him to fly to Saint-Jerome. Quebec provincial police spokesman Benoit Richard would not comment on the reports. Reaction time 'probably too slow' Once at the detention center, the helicopter hovered as two inmates climbed aboard using cables or ropes lowered for them, police said. Slack-jawed prison guards watched as the helicopter then spirited away as two of their prisoners clung on. One of them, police said, was 36-year-old Benjamin Hudon-Barbeau who had beaten a double murder conviction on an appeal. But he was in prison in connection with an attempted murder investigation. The other, 33-year-old Danny Provencal, was serving a seven-year sentence for various offenses, including arson, police said. The prison, which houses 480 inmates, knows how to handle the expected. About a month ago, it quelled a riot before it got out of hand. But, Yves Galarneau, the deputy director general of Correctional Services Western Quebec, said he'd never seen anything like this escape in his three-decade-long career. ""The reaction time was probably too slow,"" he told reporters, adding that everything happened very quickly. Galarneau also acknowledged the jail did not have security protocol in place to prevent a helicopter from swooping in. ""As far as I know, it's a first in Quebec,"" he told reporters at the scene. ""It's exceptional."" A manhunt for the fugitives followed. Calls to a station . Adding an extra layer of audacity to an already extraordinary caper, a man claiming to be Hudon-Barbeau called a Montreal radio station to say he'd been shot in the calf during the escape -- and to justify his departure. ""I don't want to cause any harm to anybody. I am not a killer. I never did anything bad to an innocent,"" the man told 98.5 FM. ""I know that (the escape) wasn't the best thing to do, but I didn't want to stay in prison anymore. I am ready to die."" The man then said the escape was Provencal's idea. ""It was not my idea to get away but Danny convinced me it was his friends who arranged it outside,"" the man said. Chopper found . Authorities found the chopper back in Mont-Tremblant, where the flight originated. The pilot was inside but the men had fled. The pilot was taken to a hospital for a medical assessment and later for questioning. Police later said they had ruled him out as a suspect. The men, meanwhile, escaped in a white Cadillac Escalade -- with police on their tail. A short-lived breakout . Authorities tracked the SUV to the town of Chersey, about 50 minutes north of Saint-Jerome. The men got out of the vehicle there and began shooting, said Richard, the police spokesman. Police shot back, he said, but no one was injured. LCN, the television station, showed images of a cottage where the men were believed to be hiding. Outside, the white Cadillac stood, its driver's side door open. Six hours after the escape, police arrested three men. One of them was Hudon-Barbeau. Police did not release the names of the other two. But Provencal was still missing. Several hours would go by before he too was in custody. Police found him holed up inside a sugar shack in the same city. He eventually surrendered early Monday morning. All four men will appear in a court in Saint-Jerome Monday to face charges. Escapes not unheard of . While spectacular, airborne escapes are not unheard of. Albanian inmate Alket Rizaj broke out of a maximum security prison in Greece twice -- in 2006 and 2009. On both occasions, accomplices swooped in to the prison's courtyard on helicopters and inmates climbed aboard using rope ladders. Both times, Rizaj was recaptured. Last month, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic. But the plot was foiled when the prisoner was shot and the chopper was forced to land on the prison parking lot. In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican jail aboard a helicopter. The New Yorker's flight inspired the book ""The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan"" and the 1975 movie ""Breakout."" And in France, Pascal Payet escaped not once, not twice but three times from French prisons. Each time, he was recaptured. Fleeing to the sky: 5 epic helicopter prison escapes .

"(CNN) -- As Halloween approaches, my 10-year-old daughter is getting excited about choosing a scary costume for trick-or-treating and the prospect of a bucket full of sweets. I usually accompany her, but this year has stirred memories of a genuinely spooky encounter, re-awakened by a recent assignment for CNN. The British Film Institute is about to release the full 144-minute version of The Shining -- 24 minutes more than previously seen in Europe. If you're of a nervous disposition, the thought of subjecting yourself to additional minutes of what many regard as the most terrifying movie ever made might be a less than appealing one. But true horror fans are licking their lips in anticipation. The film -- directed by the brilliant Stanley Kubrick in 1980 -- is now regarded as a masterclass in movie-making but at the time it was largely received with the scratching of heads and a mood of disappointment. Kubrick adapted the film from the book written by horror novelist Stephen King -- and that's where my connection begins. In 1974 King and his wife stayed at the majestic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, a small town at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The hotel was due to shut down for the winter season and the Kings were the only guests in the place, echoing round the long empty corridors and silent ballroom. By the time they checked out of Room 217 the next morning -- Halloween - King had the bones of his chilling story. Stanley Kubrick treasures on display . I visited Estes Park 34 years later and decided to take my family to the Stanley Hotel. Although Kubrick's film was shot at the Timberline Lodge in Oregon (exteriors) and Elstree studios near London (interiors) the resemblance is uncanny. Our guide told us the hotel was inhabited by a number of ghosts, sometimes appearing in photographs as balls of energy. The warning was met with a mixture of giggles and suspiciously raised eyebrows. We were about to shuffle along another carpeted corridor when my wife gave a cry of surprise: ""Look at this!"" We gathered round her camera to see an image of the staircase on which were three orbs of light -- different sizes, different opacities, different to anything I'd ever seen before. They hadn't appeared to the naked eye nor had they appeared on anyone else's camera. During the rest of the tour our group achieved a degree of minor celebrity by repeating the feat at several other locations within the hotel. There was one on the wood-panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we checked back through all the pictures, we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide. The images were taken in different places, with very different lighting and of the 200 photographs we took during our holiday no orbs appeared on any other photograph -- nor indeed on any photograph ever taken on that camera before or since. We were amused and baffled but promptly forgot about them when we returned to London. This month, covering the story of the extended version of The Shining came my way and while researching it I remembered the photographs. So when I went to interview the film's executive producer Jan Harlan at his home in the ancient English city of St. Albans, an hour's drive north of London, I took them with me. He talked eloquently about Kubrick and his movie. ""It was a film that shows nothing but ambiguity. And this is what Stanley wanted,"" he said. I showed him the pictures. He seemed amused but like me could offer no plausible explanation. They too remain ambiguous and I'm happy for them to remain so. But for some fans of the film, ambiguity leaves a void which must be filled with conspiracy theories. Some claim to have discovered hidden messages about anything from the Holocaust to the plight of Native Americans, and to Kubrick's apparent use of the film to confess to helping the U.S. government fabricate the Apollo moon landings. ""It's amazing how this film invited speculation and fantasy in the audience. Which is good,"" said Harlan. ""It's a great compliment to Kubrick that people go into orbit about it."" ""Orbit"" eh? Is that another deliberate clue... no, I'm not going down that road. I'll stick to my own photographs instead. And if there is anyone out there with a good theory (conspiratorial or otherwise) about those we'd love to hear from you.","The British Film Institute is releasing the full 144-minute version of The Shining .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- President Barack Obama held a town hall meeting Saturday with a group of young people in the Soweto section of Johannesburg, with video links to similar groups in other cities in Africa. Here are five things that he said in response to questions from the participants in a format he called ""a little humbling"" but energizing. CNN Johannesburg correspondent Nkepile Mabuse moderated the town hall. Praise for Mandela . Obama paid homage to former South African President Nelson Mandela, the 94-year-old founding father of the country's modern democracy who is in critical condition in a Pretoria hospital. ""Obviously, he is on our minds today, and we join the people of the world in sending our prayers to Madiba and his family, because he still inspires us all,"" Obama said, referring to Mandela by his clan name. Obama noted that Mandela held on to his optimism during his 27 years in prison under South Africa's apartheid regime, and he urged his audience to learn from that. ""There will be time to test your faith, but no matter how old you grow, I say ... don't lose those qualities of youth: your imagination, your optimism, your idealism, 'cause the future of this continent is in your hands, and if you keep your head pointed toward the sun, and you keep your feet moving forward, I promise you will have no better friend and partner than the United States of America."" Mandela showed that ""through a commitment to the constitution and rule of law and equal treatment for all people that a country can prosper despite a tragic history."" Obama meets with Mandela's family in South Africa . A bright view of Africa's future . Africa's role in the world economy as a provider of raw materials to other parts of the world dates back to colonial days and must be changed, Obama said. Though foreign aid remains critical in some parts of the continent, ""It is very clear that people want to break out of a dependency trap. The idea is not that Africa should be the ward of some other country. What we need is an Africa that's building, manufacturing, creating value, inventing and then sending those products around the world and receiving products in return. ... If we do that, there's no reason why Africa cannot succeed."" Progress against terrorism . Though ""some progress"" has been made in dealing with extremist groups, ""the problem has metastasized"" to include more regional terrorist organizations such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, Obama said. ""Though they may not have the same transnational capacity that some of the earlier organizations did, they're doing great harm in Africa and in the Middle East and in South Asia."" The terrorist threat affects more than Western countries, he said. ""The number of people killed by terrorist attacks in Africa or South Asia far outstrips deaths by Westerners,"" he said. ""This is not just a problem for us; this is a problem for everybody."" Terrorism is more likely to emerge in countries that are not delivering for their people, ""and where there are areas of conflict and underlying frustrations"" that have not been adequately dealt with, he said. He cited responsive governance and strong democratic institutions as bulwarks against terrorism taking root. ""They're the most important defense against terrorism."" American ambitions . Obama rejected ""this notion that we want to somehow expand our military reach,"" citing the end of the war in Iraq and plans to end the war in Afghanistan as evidence. ""This idea somehow that we want to get more involved militarily around the world is simply not true,"" he said. ""First of all, it costs a lot of money, and the United States -- just like every country around the world -- has to think about its budget. And where we intervene, oftentimes it's not very effective because, unless you've got a local population that is standing up against terrorism, we end up being viewed as interlopers and intruders."" He said he wants the African Union and other regional organizations to beef up their capacity to send peacekeepers ""to nip terror cells that may be forming -- before they start and gain strength."" The United States, he added, can provide advice, training and, in some cases, equipment. Global warming looms . The world's biggest environmental challenge is climate change, Obama said, adding that carbon emissions are warming the planet and threaten to cause the problem to spin out of control. ""We are going to all have to work together to find ways in which, collectively, we reduce carbon,"" but wealthy countries must do more than companies that are still developing, he said. ""Obviously, they shouldn't be resigned to poverty simply because the West and Europe and America got there first. That wouldn't be fair, but everybody's going to have to do something."" If, however, everyone buys cars, installs air conditioners and moves into big houses, ""the planet will boil over unless we find new ways of producing energy,"" he said.","""Don't lose those qualities of youth,"" President Obama urges his audience .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Russia's use of strategic bombers and ballistic missiles against Georgia's civilians outside of the South Ossetian conflict is ""far disproportionate"" to Georgia's alleged attack on Russian peacekeepers, a senior U.S. official said Saturday. The official was not authorized to speak on the record due to the sensitive nature of the diplomacy. Russia's use of its potent air weaponry signals a ""severe"" and ""dangerous escalation in the crisis,"" the official said. ""For the life of me, I can't image that being a proportionate response to the charge that Georgia has attacked Russian peacekeepers,"" the official said. ""It's hard for us to understand what Russia's plan is here."" The official said Russia is probably trying to destabilize Georgia politically to kill its chances of joining NATO. Georgia wants to join NATO, but Russia opposes the move, concerned that the alliance's eastward march will erode its influence. NATO rejected Georgia's membership bid in April despite strong lobbying from U.S. President Bush, though the alliance promised that Georgia could join at a later date.  Watch President Bush comment on conflict » . Still, Georgia bears some of the blame for the fighting over South Ossetia, the official said. Recently, the United States has had ""very blunt exchanges with"" Georgia, telling its leaders that they have no chance of winning a war with Russia and that they should stick to a path of diplomacy.  Watch injured Georgian soldier being treated » . The official said European allies have told the United States that Russia has ""crossed a line of unacceptable behavior"" and should ""expect international condemnation."" ""I do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies,"" he said. The United Sates, Britain and NATO on Friday called for a cease-fire. And on Saturday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed an immediate cease-fire as part of a three-step plan to end fighting. Sarkozy's proposal calls for the return of Russian and Georgian troops to their former positions and requires Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected. A statement from Sarkozy's office did not provide further details on the plan. The official also said the State Department has authorized only the voluntary departure of dependents of U.S. embassy employees from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. The official said he did not know how many dependents would choose to leave. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council held a private meeting on Georgia on Saturday, though it seemed unlikely that there would be any immediate agreement on a statement on the conflict. The U.S., European Union and international security organizations on Friday called for an end to the fighting . Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Friday discussed the conflict in Beijing, where they attended the opening of the Summer Olympics. The EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were sending envoys to Georgia to secure a cease-fire, but a senior U.S. State Department official said the United States would send only a representative after a cease-fire is in place. The European Union said it was working with other parties ""towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Chicken nuggets. Sandwiches. Pizza. Baseball games. Play-Doh. These are some of the basics of childhood that could prove deadly to my 4-year-old son, Teddy. Teddy took his first sip of milk in 2005, triggering a strong allergic reaction as seen in this family photo. Teddy has food allergies that can cause anaphylaxis, a deadly condition that can cut off his breathing. He has to steer clear of milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts -- even places like baseball stadiums where peanut exposure can't be avoided. We found out about Teddy's allergies partially through trial and error and then through allergy testing when he was 18 months old, and we didn't want any more missteps. Now our job is to try to prevent contact with those foods until he either outgrows them or he becomes old enough to police himself.  Watch what we go through to protect Teddy » . Our vigilance starts before food even enters the house. When we are in the grocery store, we have to read every label to see if the food contains something harmful.  See tips about living with food allergies » . We'll get all the way through one of these and be thinking, ""hurray!"" and then see ""caramel coloring"" and have to put it back. There's still enough wiggle room in food labeling, apparently, to not have to list what's in that -- often milk -- or what's in ""natural flavoring."" Devil in the details . And just because a food item was OK last week doesn't mean the recipe hasn't changed. And just because the package looks right doesn't mean you've picked up the right package. I was in a hurry when I picked up rice cheese in December, so I didn't carefully read the label. Teddy saw the cheese when I was unloading the groceries and asked for a slice -- and then another. Although the cheese looked like our regular vegan cheese without milk, it was an almost identical package that contained milk protein. Teddy ended up in a hospital emergency room with hives all over his arms, legs, tummy and back. His nose was running and he was drooly. He got a shot of epinephrine before he could develop breathing problems. It's a harsh reminder that we can never let down our guard. Once we get food into the house, we try to label it. We have stickers, or we use markers to warn away from giving a particular product to Teddy. Labels aren't enough for baby sitters. We set out a bin of ""Teddy safe"" snacks. School: Lots of cupcakes, no Play-Doh . School is tough, too. The macaroni necklaces my 8-year-old daughter Catie once made for me in pre-K were charming. Who would think that something so simple could make another kid very sick? There's no Play-Doh. It can have wheat in it. Same for papier-mache. Teddy's pre-K teachers are great -- they contact us for alternative suggestions when their lesson plans include food products. But it can be exhausting. Every month, it seems, there is another ""holiday"" at school. And all seem to be connected to food celebrations. Every time other parents send food in, we have to worry about whether Teddy will be safe. I try to always be the ""cupcake mom,"" because I can make cupcakes without milk, eggs or wheat that still taste good. (Even the teachers fight to get them.) When someone else brings cakes, I try to find out in advance so I can make a Teddy-safe alternative. If there is no warning, the school has a bin of Teddy-safe snacks. Challenges in the kitchen . I try to cook mostly Teddy-safe food at home. The first reaction many people have to hearing of Teddy's allergies is a dumbfounded, ""What does he eat?"" There are actually many foods that are OK for him: meats, vegetables, fruits and most grains. We just don't often get the chance to use convenience foods. I have alternatives for meatloaf and tacos that work OK. But sometimes I just want to make pasta for the family. I know that I could just make rice pasta for everyone. But, frankly, it's about three times the price and doesn't taste as good. So I have to be careful. I can't use the same spoon to stir both. And even when I'm draining the pasta, I have to remember that if I don't drain the rice pasta first, I have to use two colanders. So I try to keep that straight. This is why it's nearly impossible for us to get Teddy food at a restaurant. It's very easy for a contaminated utensil to be used in the kitchen without us knowing. And that would be after getting the restaurant staff to show us labels from all food items. This month, we will be meeting with some staff members at Teddy's new elementary school, where he'll be entering kindergarten in August. When we start a new school or new situation, it's always an anxious time. We're going to talk with the school nurse and cafeteria manager about strategies to keep Teddy safe. Teddy will need a classroom as free from danger as possible, and that can be an issue. As soon as we talk about not having peanut products in his classroom, some people think we don't want their kids to have peanut butter sandwiches for lunch. No, we just want peanut products eaten only in the cafeteria. In the lunchroom, Teddy can be watched so that if peanut butter touches him or milk is spilled on him, he will be decontaminated as quickly as possible. (If milk touches Teddy, he gets hives -- he doesn't even have to ingest it. This is a lot different from ""lactose intolerance,"" which some people confuse with a milk allergy. Lactose intolerance produces gastric distress for someone. A milk allergy can be life-threatening.) We'll probably post signs the way we've done at his day cares and preschool, showing him in reaction to an allergen and listing what action to take. Fears of budget cuts . We're hoping that the school nurse doesn't fall victim to budget cuts, because that is our emotional safety net right now. We're comforted by the thought of someone with anaphylaxis experience being close to Teddy. It's all part of the constant vigilance, doing our best to keep him safe. If we'd been handed a list of Teddy's allergies when he was freshly born at the hospital, I think we'd have been overwhelmed. But we found out a bit at a time, and we've been dealing with it now for more than three years. Despite some bumps, Teddy's been able to survive our stumbles and thrive.","Teddy, age 4, has food allergies that, left untreated, can cut off his breathing .

"(CNN) -- Americans talk a good game about wanting to eat well. More than 75 percent claim they want to see more healthy options on restaurant menus. But when it comes time to order, only about half say they actually make nutritious choices, according to a recent survey. Steakhouse portions often exceed the recommended five to seven ounces of animal protein per day. On the other hand, 77 percent rank taste as the top priority for a restaurant dinner, and 44 percent say satisfying hunger matters most, according to the responses reported in June by Mintel, a market research firm. Of 2,000 adults polled in February, 20 percent said food health is an important factor when they order dinner. Still, nutrition experts stress that it is possible to satisfy your taste buds and hunger while making nice to your heart. ""Eating out with friends and family is a pleasure you don't have to give up when you're on a special diet,"" said Anne Cain, a registered dietitian and senior editor at MyRecipes.com. ""You just need to arm yourself with information about heart-healthy choices and not be afraid to ask questions about the menu and make special requests."" (MyRecipes.com is owned by Time Warner, the parent company of CNN.) Every person's needs are different when it comes to what he or she should eat, health experts say. ""There are some people that really have to worry about calories, there are some people that really have to worry about sugar, some people that really have to worry about salt. All of these bring in different kinds of mandates for you,"" said Riska Platt, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Heart Association. Still, some foods are more likely than others to derail a heart-healthy diet. Here are some tips to help you eat for your heart when dining out. Chinese  Instead of oil- and fat-laden dishes such as lo mein, egg rolls, kung pao chicken or fried rice, try steamed chicken, seafood or tofu with vegetables, and ask for sauce on the side. ""Chinese food can be a hidden salt mine,""said Sari Greaves, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. Ordering it ""as unadorned as possible"" and with sauces on the side will help you control your sodium intake. Soups such as egg-drop and hot-and-sour are low-calorie and low-fat, but may also be ""salt bombs,"" Greaves said. But despite the poor reputation eggs have for their high-cholesterol properties, low-fat dieters don't have to steer clear of egg-drop soup, she said: ""It's saturated fat and trans fat in your diet that raise your blood cholesterol, more so than cholesterol in your diet."" Stir-fried dishes are also a safe bet because they're generally cooked quickly and with very little oil. On the other hand, watch out for foods designated ""crispy"" or ""double-sauteed,"" which indicate deep-fried dishes, said Greaves. Sandwich shop  Instead of a sandwich on white bread, a white roll or white wrap and topped with mayonnaise or cheese, try whole-grain bread options topped with vegetables, mustard or olive oil, and little to no cheese. Watch out for deli meats, which often contain a lot of salt, Platt said. Hummus can be a good alternative to mayonnaise or cheese, as it contains heart-healthy fat. Platt endorses hummus, which is made from chickpeas, because it helps Americans fit legumes into their diet. Just don't overload on it, because the calories can add up. Platt also suggests skipping oversized muffins. Even if they're bran muffins and consequently high in fiber, they're full of fat, sugar and calories. Breakfast wraps can also be detrimental to a heart-healthy diet, especially when an entire salt- and fat-heavy meal of eggs, cheese and bacon is packed into a compact package. Italian  Instead of pasta topped or filled with cream, cheese or meat, try grilled, broiled or poached seafood with a small order of pasta with garlic and oil or tomato sauce. Greaves suggests ordering shellfish such as shrimp, mussels or clams at an Italian restaurant, as long as they aren't deep-fried or cooked in butter. Although these shellfish might be higher in cholesterol than salmon or tilapia, she said, they're still very low in saturated fat. If you do want cheese in your meal, add a sprinkling of parmesan atop a dish instead of gobs of cheese as the centerpiece of your meal. And for an appetizer, Greaves recommends skipping the meat- and cheese-heavy antipasto salad in favor of shrimp cocktail, which is low in saturated fat. Also, pair bread with heart-healthy olive oil, not butter. Oil is rich in calories, though, so don't overdo it. Japanese  Instead of tempura-style rolls or rolls with mayonnaise (think spicy tuna), try fresher sushi with fish high in cardio-friendly omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel or halibut. The avocado in California rolls also carries heart-healthy benefits. Edamame, which are green soybeans, may indirectly lower your blood cholesterol and are a good source of fiber and omega-3s, Greaves said. But if you're monitoring your sodium intake, request that the salt be omitted. Be on the lookout for the word ""kewpie,"" or Japanese mayonnaise, if you're trying to cut back on saturated fat. Steakhouses  Instead of a full portion of steak, try limiting your meat intake by ordering a beef kebab, or a chicken or seafood selection cooked without butter or salt. Choose lean cuts of beef such as round, sirloin, chuck, flank steak or tenderloin. Remove any visible fat that may be attached to the cooked meat, Cain said. The American Heart Association recommends eating five to seven ounces of animal protein per day, and a 12-ounce steak at a restaurant far exceeds that, Platt said. Split a steak with one of your dining partners, or eat half and take the rest home for another meal. Steakhouses also offer deceptively fattening sides, such as creamed spinach or fully loaded baked potatoes. Swap out those fatty sides for steamed vegetables, and you'll be in better shape. Mexican  Instead of a cheese-filled burrito or taco, try a seafood, chicken or vegetable fajita. The seafood or chicken will provide lean, healthy protein, while a vegetable centerpiece will boost your fiber intake. If you get beans, make sure they're not refried; black beans provide protein and fiber without artery-clogging saturated fat, Greaves said. You can also cut down on saturated fat by opting for pico de gallo or salsa instead of sour cream. Since it's made from heart-healthy avocados, guacamole contains good fat that can lower bad LDL cholesterol while raising good HDL cholesterol. Just limit your intake to about two tablespoons, Greaves said, because it can carry a lot of calories. Greaves also warns that you should watch out for salted rice and rice with cheese -- no-no's for people on low-sodium or low-fat diets.","Dietitian: Be heart-friendly by asking how things are prepared, making requests .

"Niwot, Colorado (CNN) -- Crocs, the distinctive colorful clogs loved and hated in equal measure, first hit stores in 2004 and were an immediate hit. By 2007, the Colorado-based company was selling 50 million pairs a year, reaching $850 million in sales. Then it all went south. The economic collapse in 2008, combined with a saturated market, created what Crocs CEO John McCarvel described as a ""perfect confluence of events."" ""Too many people have the same product, selling it to the same consumers, and just our inability to evolve as a brand caused a turn of fortunes in the business,"" he said. The company was hit hard. In one year, it went from a $200 million profit to a $200 million loss in 2008. There were too many Crocs in too many stores, and some people had grown weary of the comfortable, but not exactly fashion-forward, design. By early 2009, the company was almost out of cash and struggling to make payroll. It needed to find a way to attract new customers. ""We had to innovate our way out of the situation we had put ourselves in,"" McCarvel said. In other words, the company would have to expand beyond its classic clogs if it was going to survive. ""I think you do get to the point where maybe everybody has a red and a blue and a black pair and they are looking for something else, and that was part of the strategy,"" said Christy Saito, the company's vice president of product design. ""We need to offer different looks for people because they can't wear the same thing every single day."" While Crocs clogs were undeniably popular, they were also scorned by fashionistas and people tired of seeing the colorful plastic shoes nearly everywhere. One hater started an I Hate Crocs blog, and another launched a Facebook page called ""I Don't Care How Comfortable Crocs Are, You Look Like a Dumba**"" which has more than 1.6 million ""likes."" McCarvel is familiar with the criticism of the original Crocs design. ""When I first wore the shoes home ... my wife says to me, 'What are those? Those are the ugliest shoes I've ever seen,' "" he said. ""And you know there's a certain truth to that."" But within the company, there was a notion that perhaps even critics could find something to love about Crocs. ""A lot of the haters didn't like the way other people looked in them, but they did maybe resent a little bit the comfort those people had and that they had the courage to go ahead and go out in public and wear them,"" explained Dale Bathum, Crocs' senior vice president of product. So the company set out to create a new line of shoes -- flats, wedges, sneakers, boat shoes, even winter boots -- that would be as comfortable as the clogs, but would appeal to more style-conscious consumers. ""It's so funny, someone actually stopped me in a mall and said 'Where did you get those shoes? I love them,' and I said, 'These are Crocs,' "" Saito said. ""[People] say, 'Oh my God, where can I buy these?' That's the normal reaction we get from people,"" she said. ""There has been hardly any resistance."" Crocs still sells plenty of its old-school clogs, but the new designs now account for 54% of the company's sales. ""Our main focus today is getting new customers to understand that we're no longer just a clog,"" McCarvel said. ""I think this is our biggest challenge as a brand today ... getting people to take a look at us in a different way."" To showcase the new shoes, Crocs has opened 120 stores in the United States and hopes to open another 100 stores this year. It is also expanding into new overseas markets, which now account for 65% of sales. With the new designs leading the way, Crocs is back in the black. Last year, the company make $150 million in profits and $1 billion in total revenue. ""We're a very young company, we're barely 10 years old,"" Saito said. ""[These] ups and downs have taught us about how to compete and how to have a comeback.""","Colorful plastic Crocs clogs became wildly popular .

"(CNN) -- A gunman attacked worshippers at a Colorado Springs, Colorado, megachurch Sunday afternoon, killing one person and wounding four others before being killed by a security staff member, the city's police chief said. Police would not discuss whether there was any connection between the church shootings and an attack on a missionary training center outside Denver about 12 hours earlier that left two people dead and two wounded. The gunman in that incident was still unknown. Chief Richard Myers called the Colorado Springs church security staffer ""a courageous security staff member who probably saved many lives."" He said some of the shooting victims being treated at the hospital have life-threatening injuries. Several ""suspicious devices"" were found at the church, Myers said. SWAT teams were clearing the multiple buildings at New Life Church, along with an explosives unit, he said. Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church, said the church had a security plan in place. ""I'm proud of the way our team responded,"" he said.  ""Many, many lives were saved because of the quick action of some committed volunteers at our church.""  Watch as a church member describes what he saw » . He said about 7,000 people were at the church, which had just completed a late-morning service, when the shooting took place shortly after 1 p.m. The wounded were taken to Penrose-St. Francis Hospital, where two were in critical condition, Howard said. Another patient was in good condition and one fair, hospital spokeswoman Amy Sufak said. Police know neither the motive for the attack nor of any relationship between the suspect and the victims. Police spokesman Lt. Fletcher Howard said area businesses were placed on lockdown after the shooting ""to make sure there's not any other suspects at large."" As of Sunday afternoon there was no known connection between the two Colorado shootings, Howard said, but he did not rule out that possibility. Arvada, site of the missionary training center, and Colorado Springs are about 80 miles apart. Howard said investigators are expecting detectives from Arvada to come to Colorado Springs to check for any connections between the two cases. In Arvada, police said they were investigating whether there was any link between the two fatal shootings. ""Obviously, two shootings at two faith-based locations is very concerning to both us and Colorado Springs,"" said Deputy Police Chief Gary Creager. New Life Church is on the northwestern outskirts of Colorado Springs, near the U.S. Air Force Academy. The non-denominational church claims a membership of more than 10,000. The church was founded by the Rev. Ted Haggard, an evangelical Christian leader who was ousted in 2006 after allegations that he had been a client of a male prostitute from whom he had purchased drugs. Haggard admitted to undisclosed ""sexual immorality"" and called himself ""a deceiver and a liar"" in a letter to the congregation. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Dear reader: . Actually, that's the subject of today's column. That salutation. Because there is a real question that has quietly been building -- perhaps not the most important question in this tense old world of ours, but a question nonetheless: . Is ""Dear"" an endangered species? It would appear to be. You may have noticed that fewer and fewer people begin their letters and notes with ""Dear."" Some holdouts -- I'm among them -- do, but this may be mostly out of lifetime habit. Even people who grew up using the traditional salutation -- middle-of-the-road, go-by-the-book people -- now regularly begin their notes with ""Hi."" This is mostly a function of the digital-communications age. ""Dear,"" which always looked fine atop a business letter, or a handwritten note, is increasingly seen as archaic and old-fashioned on a computer screen or on a smartphone or mobile device. The pending disappearance of ""Dear"" is a sea change in the way we write to each other -- yet when you think about it, there are few logical reasons arguing for a longer life for that particular word. We've always used it, just because we've always used it. But step back for a second and think about it -- about addressing business associates, or people you've never met, as ""Dear."" It has worked commendably in letters, but imagine using it with those same people in face-to-face situations. Picture yourself walking up to someone in an airport or at a business meeting and automatically calling him or her ""dear."" You might be greeted with a withering glare, if not a punch in the nose. And imagine what would happen if you went around your office every day, in person, calling people ""dear."" You'd be taking a quick trip to Human Resources. The reason ""Dear"" may be destined to die is that it faces a dilemma much like an army confronted with a pincers movement in war: On the one flank, written-on-paper, mailed letters -- the kind that have always been started with ""Dear"" -- are rapidly disappearing, as use of the U.S. mail itself dwindles. On the other flank, many people who use e-mail decided a long time ago to go with nothing at all, or with ""Hi"" (followed by the recipient's name), as a reflection of the new informality and ease of note-writing. With text messages, the idea of a salutation doesn't even come up. (And of course, there is the ever-popular ""Hey"" salutation, used by those who think that ""Hi"" is much too stodgy.) Not wanting to trust my own judgment on this vital matter, I put together an ad hoc advisory panel of five etiquette teachers and coaches from around the country (yes, even in our hail-to-sloppiness era, such people exist). They pondered the ""Dear"" question. Watch: British etiquette for London Games . ""Even with the new normal of being informal, the proper way to start an e-mail is with 'Dear,'"" said Cynthia Lett, director of the Lett Group, a protocol training company in Silver Spring, Maryland. The time to switch to ""Hey,"" she said, is ""when we get to the point of dropping by each other's houses without an invitation and opening the refrigerator to see what is available for a snack."" Patricia Rossi, an etiquette coach based in the Tampa Bay area of Florida, said, ""I really think it is best to open an e-mail with 'Dear Mr. Moore,' as it's important to start out with a more respectful and formal salutation. Mr. Moore will respond in a manner that he wishes to set the tone with."" Barbara Pachter, an etiquette expert in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said, ""E-mail doesn't technically require a salutation, since it is in memo format. And when e-mail first appeared, many people did not use a salutation. Eventually people started adding a salutation to appear friendlier and help the tone of their writings."" Jacqueline Whitmore, who advises on etiquette from her base in Palm Beach, Florida, said, ""In my professional opinion you can never go wrong when you're too formal, but you can often be dead wrong if you're too casual."" And Paul Siddle, whose etiquette-and-protocol operation is based in Richmond, Virginia, responded to my question about ""Dear"" possibly being anachronistic by saying: ""Anachronistic? Well, we are certainly becoming a more relaxed society, but there will always be a right way and a wrong way to do things. And using appropriate salutations, and closings, in written communications is the right way to do it."" Most e-mailers and text-messagers do not consult etiquette coaches, though, and with the demise of words-on-paper letters, the future of ""Dear"" appears dire. There are, it should be noted, some ethereal and symbolic forces working against ""Hi"" in other parts of society: . When Katie Couric took over the ""CBS Evening News"" in 2006, she at first began each broadcast with ""Hi, everyone,"" to send a signal of friendliness and non-pontification. The ""Hi"" soon enough went away; evidently the word was too breezy for viewers across the United States who had long watched the evening news on the networks, and were accustomed to ""Good evening."" But an e-mail is not the evening news, and perhaps it is time to begin saying our inevitable fond farewell to ""Dear,"" and to say that farewell before the salutation has already become dearly departed. Thank you for reading. With my most sincere good wishes until we meet anon. Why should the press be polite to presidents? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Does the salutation ""Dear"" have a place in modern correspondence?
In digital communication, especially texting, it's formal, archaic, too intimate, he says .
But etiquette experts say it still important to correspondence, it's impolite to be too casual .
Greene: That may be true, but reality is fewer people use it; it's likely on its way out ."
"(Health.com) -- It's definitely fall: Kids are back in school, football season has kicked off, and ragweed is blooming. While autumn means cooler temperatures and colorful leaves, it also means runny noses and red eyes for millions of Americans. Doctors recommend a management plan to help chronic allergy sufferers through the fall season. How do you enjoy the season without the side effects? ""Find out what is causing your allergy symptoms,"" says Angel Waldron, a spokeswoman with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA). ""Get with your doctor and have an allergy management plan."" Health.com: Asthma action plan: What it is and why you need it . That management plan may include limiting your outdoor activities to times when the pollen count isn't at its peak, says Rebecca Piltch, MD, an allergy and asthma specialist in San Rafael, California. (It's usually highest between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m.) When you come back inside, change your shoes and clothes, says Neil Kao, MD, of the Allergic Disease and Asthma Center, in Greenville, South Carolina. Changing clothes ""will help reduce the pollen that you are bringing in from outside, says Kao. ""If you don't at least take off your shoes, you're tracking the pollen all over the house."" Health.com: 15 hypoallergenic dogs and cats . And take a shower to wash any allergens off your body, Dr. Piltch says. Once inside, keep your windows closed, change your air filters, and run your air conditioner, Dr. Kao adds. For more severe allergies, over-the-counter and prescription medications can help. Dr. Kao also recommends nasal sprays, which he says are ""simple and safe."" ""It's like washing your hands, except for your nose,"" he explains. Dr. Kao isn't expecting fall allergies in his home state, South Carolina, to be very bad -- a welcome change. ""With all the rain we've been getting across the southeast, the temperatures have been getting lower and the rain has been washing the pollen out of the air,"" he says.

Some states, like Georgia, may have less pollen after days of flooding rains, but the extra dampness is the perfect climate for mold, a major fall allergy, Dr. Piltch says. Although the South suffers from weed and mold spore allergies in the fall, Gerald Kress, an executive with SDI Health, which operates Pollen.com, says the North and Northeast gets hit particularly hard by ragweed -- and 2009 is shaping up to be a banner year for ragweed pollen. In cities from Columbus, Ohio, to Bangor, Maine, the number of people being affected by allergies is up more than 50 percent over 2008. ""It's been a better year for ragweed,"" Kress says. Usually the region gets more rain from hurricanes, but that hasn't happened this year. Kress expects the number of people suffering from autumn airborne allergies to increase between 2 and 5 percent over last year. ""It's up 1.3 percent right now,"" he says.

"Washington (CNN) -- It helped get him re-elected, so President Barack Obama is again employing campaign-style tactics to increase pressure on congressional Republicans to compromise to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Failure to reach a deal means tax increases and deep spending cuts take effect in five weeks, a scenario analysts fear could push the country back into recession. While aides on both sides have been talking, no follow-up meeting between Obama and congressional leaders has been scheduled after their initial post-election discussion on November 16. Instead, Obama met Tuesday with small business owners, the first in a series of events this week intended to highlight his push for raising taxes on the wealthiest 2% of Americans while maintaining current rates for everyone else. Norquist: Rep. King 'tried to weasel out' On Wednesday, Obama meets with the chief executives of major corporations, while congressional Republicans and Democrats will talk separately with deficit-reduction gurus, including former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and Maya MacGuinneas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group advocating fiscal reform. The president also will meet with those described by the White House as middle-class Americans who face a major impact if higher taxes and automatic reductions in military and discretionary federal spending take hold. Obama concludes the week with a trip Friday to Hatfield, Pennsylvania, to visit a manufacturing operation and deliver a speech. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner's office announced Tuesday that congressional Republicans will hold a series of events in Washington and home districts across the country with small business owners to frame Obama's tax policy as a threat to new jobs. The series of meetings involving all parties showed the high-profile tactics being used to demonstrate to the nation, including financial markets, that a deal can happen. Stocks closed lower Tuesday as investors grew increasingly concerned about whether Congress can adequately and swiftly address the situation. Prospects for a deal remain front and center for investors, with the U.S. economy showing more signs of improvement in its long recovery from recession. Economists point to fears about higher taxes in 2013 as a potential threat to rising consumer confidence. Asked why Obama was meeting with business leaders and traveling to Pennsylvania instead of negotiating directly with Republicans in Congress, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday it was important to bring the broader American public into the discussion. Read more: Fiscal battle over mortgage deduction . The fiscal cliff resulted from a failure to reach a deficit reduction agreement in the past two years due to longstanding differences between Democrats and Republicans on taxes -- particularly whether to extend tax cuts from President George W. Bush's administration. Obama made the issue a central theme of his election campaign, and now the White House believes the president's re-election validated his call for including more tax revenue in addressing the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt. ""This topic was perhaps the most debated, the most discussed, the most analyzed, for a year,"" Carney told reporters on Tuesday, adding that the election result showed Americans supported Obama's approach. ""To suggest that we should, now that the election's over, stop talking to the American people about these vital issues is, I think, bad advice,"" Carney said. Last week, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, said the president's re-election campaign and its grass-roots resources will ""live on,"" most likely as a tool to promote the president's second-term policies. Obama for America, the name of the campaign, already released an e-mail to its distribution list in an attempt to educate readers on the president's fiscal cliff argument and to rally supporters behind him. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky complained that Obama was ""back on the campaign trail"" instead of ""sitting down with lawmakers of both parties and working out an agreement."" ""We already know the president is a very good campaigner,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. "" ... What we don't know is whether he has the leadership qualities necessary to lead his party to a bipartisan agreement on big issues like we currently face."" The president wants to let tax rates for income over $250,000 for families or $200,000 for individuals return to higher 1990s levels, while maintaining current rates for the rest of the country. He contends his plan would prevent a tax hike for 98% of Americans. Read more: Will potential FAA cuts hurt fliers? Republicans oppose increasing any tax rates, arguing that Obama's plan would hinder job growth because some small business owners who file personal returns would pay higher taxes under it. After meeting with Obama on Tuesday, three of the 15 small business owners who took part said they wanted certainty about their own tax situations while preventing middle-class Americans from paying higher taxes. Andra Rush, who founded Rush Trucking of Wayne, Michigan, said her message to Obama was that failure to extend the tax cuts to the middle class could stall what she called new economic momentum in the country. ""I would have higher tax rates,"" Rush conceded, adding that it was more important for ""ordinary Americans"" to have more money to spend instead of paying it in taxes if everyone's rates go up. Karen Mills, who heads the government's Small Business Administration, said the main message to Obama in the meeting was that the owners needed certainty in their tax situations so they could plan for next year. Boehner and other influential GOP figures have declared their willingness to consider other ways to boost tax revenue as part of a broader deal that includes entitlement reforms and spending cuts. That position undermines the no-tax-increase pledge championed by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, which Democrats consider to be a major impediment to a deficit reduction deal. Some Republicans -- including conservative Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina as well as Rep. Peter King of New York and Scott Rigell of Virginia -- have dropped their adherence to Norquist's pledge. Norquist responded harshly Monday night, telling CNN that those denouncing the pledge were breaking their commitment to voters. He targeted King for saying a pledge signed years ago no longer applied. King ""tried to weasel out"" of the pledge, adding: ""I hope his wife understands commitments last a little longer than two years or something."" According to Norquist, King knew when he signed the pledge that it applied to ""as long as you're in Congress."" Opinion: Don't be scared of Grover Norquist . ""It's only as long as you're in the House or the Senate. If he stayed too long, that's his problem,"" Norquist added. To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, the softening tone by some in the GOP was explained by new poll numbers that showed 45% of Americans would blame Republicans for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff, while 34% would blame Obama. Republicans insist Democrats must agree to cut discretionary spending and make significant reforms to Medicare and Social Security as part of a deficit reduction deal. However, organized labor and other elements of the Democratic base oppose any major reforms to the popular entitlement programs. While some Democratic legislators express willingness to reform Medicare and Medicaid, they reject making Social Security reform part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, saying it is self-funded and therefore doesn't add to the deficit. Obama spoke by phone over the weekend with Boehner and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, Carney said Monday, and he rejected a reporter's assertion Tuesday that no progress was taking place in efforts to avoid the fiscal cliff. On Capitol Hill, a Senate Democratic leadership aide said Monday that behind-the-scenes talks have ""haven't been tremendously productive."" Negotiations were not at a point ""where people are huddled in a conference room with spread sheets"" but are instead at the early ""dancing stage,"" the Democratic aide said. Congressional Republican leadership aides declined to characterize the state of the talks, though one noted the fact that discussions continued could be interpreted as progress. The CNN/ORC International poll released Monday also showed that a solid majority of respondents -- two thirds -- supports the Democratic stance that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Of that total, Republicans favor such an approach by 52%-44%. Read more: House Republicans launch PR offensive on fiscal cliff . Without a deal, tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 -- when George W. Bush was president -- will expire, raising rates for everyone starting in January. In addition, spending cuts would reduce spending on the military, national parks, the Federal Aviation Administration and other government services. However, the government and Congress still would have time to prevent draconian effects from the fiscal cliff when a new Congress convenes in January. William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, called that a form of brinksmanship best avoided. ""To be sure, no one believes that non-agreement by December 31 would be the end of the story. After a period of finger-pointing, discussions would resume,"" he wrote last week in a New Republic opinion piece. ""But equally, no one knows how the failure to reach agreement before the end of 2012 would affect the dynamics of the negotiations."" In addition, ""we can be reasonably sure ... that national and global markets would react adversely and that businesses, which are already retreating from planned investments in new plant and equipment, would become even more uncertain and risk-averse.""

"(CNN) -- Computer issues prompted a temporary ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Wednesday. The computer failure occurred at the Federal Aviation Administration's Los Angeles Flight Center, which controls air traffic for the region. All arriving flights that were inside the flight center's airspace at the time of the ground stop landed at the airport, according to LAX spokeswoman Nancy Suey Castles. Approximately 10 inbound flights that were outside that airspace were diverted to other airports. ""Airlines at LAX are reporting an estimated 10 cancellations and 110 departure delays throughout tonight,"" the spokeswoman said. Earlier, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown stressed that radar was not down and that authorities hoped to resolve the computer glitch soon. The agency had warned of the potential for gridlock at some area airports, citing significant volume already en route. Departure delays of up to two hours were reported at LAX, one hour at Salt Lake City International Airport and up to an hour and a half at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Officials had said ground stops were also in effect at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Long Beach Airport and John Wayne Airport, all in California. According to LAX, the airport is the sixth busiest in the world, and the third busiest in the United States. CNN's Sean Morris, Cheri Mossburg, Aaron Cooper, Rene Marsh and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","The Federal Aviation Administration lifts its ground stop .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The northern lights came to the Deep South on Monday night, making them visible hundreds of miles farther south than they normally would be. Scientists call it a coronal mass ejection. To the rest of us, the brilliant shades of green, orange and red that danced across the night sky might simply be called beautiful or eerie. The northern tier of the United States -- places like Seattle, Minneapolis or Boston -- is normally the southern limit for the solar flares, meteorologist Jim Branda at the National Weather Service office in Memphis, Tennessee, said. But on Monday night, the display -- also known as the aurora borealis -- could be seen as far south as Oklahoma City, Memphis and Atlanta. The light show was caused by a solar outburst. ""A storm on the sun's surface was blown off, and the solar wind scattered it,"" Branda said, explaining what created the natural light show. ""The energy and magnetism interact with the earth's atmosphere and the magnetic field."" The Twitter universe lit up with comments. Some said the display was ""stunning,"" while others called it ""wonderful."" Enjoy it while you can, Branda said. The southern light show normally only happens once every three or four years. If the sky is cloudy, it might be seen only once every 10 years in southern states, according to Branda .

"(CNN) -- Once again we see the scenario unfold: A powerful man, with tremendous responsibilities, apparently ""caught"" in a compromising sexual situation with a woman who is not his wife. There is the now-familiar ritual of the threats of embarrassing revelations of intimate conversations, the hunted-down ""other woman"" who either decides to tell more or not, the nationwide harrumphing and moralizing, and the schadenfreude-stoking musings over the humiliations of the loyal wife. And of course, there is the spectacle of another career -- in David Petraeus' case, one that distinguished him in his service to our country -- in tatters. But while the media tell a familiar narrative of misjudgment and temptation, to me this story is about the terrifying power of the Patriot Act, married to the terrifying power of the resurrected Espionage Act -- and combined with a lethal admixture of our nation's Puritanism, prurience about and ignorance regarding sexuality. What happened to Petraeus -- and the recent slew of other powerful men or men threatening to some power blocs, from Eliot Spitzer to Bill Clinton? They were surveilled by political elites in an increasingly intrusive surveillance society, and exposed. Opinion: Must one lose a job over infidelity? We should understand that the surveillance that keeps tripping up these powerful men is not something about which only heads of state, whistle-blower publishers or generals have to worry. It also includes others in which the allegations of what initiated their downfall are more complex and serious, such as Nicolas Sarkozy and Julian Assange. Because of the Patriot Act, any of us, if we annoy or threaten powerful interests, can have our e-mails read without our knowledge. Any of us can be subject to a search that could lead from one e-mail correspondent to another until the National Security Agency or the FBI, which have both confirmed that they have invested heavily in domestic surveillance of social networks, find something -- anything -- that could be seen as compromising. At that point, any of us can be subjected to terrible pressure -- even legal threats -- if what is uncovered can be in any way described as ""classified information."" We live at a time in which our government is vastly over-classifying subjects in the name of public interest or that might embarrass the state. Heaven forbid if anyone provides ""material support"" for the enemy, which is so vague a term that President Barack Obama's own lawyers confirmed to Judge Katherine Forrest, in my presence during the New York hearing on the National Defense Authorization Act this past spring, that it can be used to include basic journalism about, for instance, the Taliban, or other information the government simply does not wish exposed. Any of us can be threatened with possessing classified information. This is why Bradley Manning has spent months in solitary confinement in prison. We can be threatened with the Espionage Act. This is why Assange is hiding in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. If Assange were convicted of receiving classified information, and extradited under the Espionage Act, he could theoretically be shipped to Guantanamo -- for which some congressional voices have called. But that precedent casts a shadow over everyone who might have ever heard about or discussed classified information -- something that is routine in Washington. There are still many unknowns to the Petraeus story. Maybe it really is just about the CIA and the FBI being very, very worried about Petraeus sleeping with his biographer. But we don't need to buy into this theater. If there is a national security breach -- which would be a real issue if one took place -- that can be investigated and addressed without spectacle or bullying. Opinion: Blame affairs on evolution of sex roles . In working with these two appalling laws, we need to understand what loss of privacy means: Any of us can be brought down, intimidated, silenced, threatened, by exposure of our personal lives, for any reason. We all have secrets we do not wish made public. Any of us can be threatened with exposure of infidelity, or sex addiction, or flirtatious communications, or addiction to embarrassing pornographic images, or alcoholism or bipolar disorder, or even our discussions with our doctors, psychiatrists or accountants -- about our most personal information. It is hard to imagine fully what the loss of sexual privacy means to private life -- and to the human condition. In the film ""The Lives of Others,"" set in East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down, the state listened in on lovers doing what lovers do: quarrelling, engaging in highly intimate acts of desire and passion, and sometimes, yes, betraying their spouses. But what is clear from the depiction is that whatever private pain such betrayal as infidelity causes, the general pain and the deadening quality for everyone, of living in a society in which there is no privacy -- and no sexual privacy -- is far, far more destructive and more distorting of the human condition. Sexual privacy is absolutely necessary for human beings to have basic dignity, and that includes the space to make mistakes or do things one may regret. A third of couples, husbands and wives, report that they have committed infidelity. What if all of those marriages were subject to surveillance and exposure? What if the power regarding who tells you that your spouse has betrayed you, becomes not a private struggle in private life, but a matter for the state to decide? And how many people in marriages that might have survived an infidelity, might have their lives and relationships further shattered by the state, as it can do now, from knowing the details of every single e-mail or credit card record or gift? Finally, add to this toxic mess American Puritanism and prurience. It is easy to look at what seems to be a man, a mistress and a furious wife, and to assume that one knows all about what has gone on. But often such situations are complex. Women commit adultery as often as men do, though the media are full of stories asking: Why do men cheat? Indeed, women initiate divorce more often than men do. Female unhappiness in intimate relationships is rife in America, because of some basic misunderstandings of female desire that I have detailed in my new book. It is not our place to judge and condemn, or to cast the first stone. A new understanding of the dangers of the Patriot and Espionage acts should show us why it is more important than ever for couples to be permitted to experience the pain and betrayal of a possible infidelity in private, without the power of the state breathing down the necks of all involved. Of course, there is no way ever to justify an infidelity -- betrayal is always wrong. One cannot know from the outside what kind of sexual or emotional loneliness may have been part of any given marriage, what kinds of demons any one of us might struggle with. Understanding the toxic sexual culture in which American marriages try to thrive should lead us, at least, to see such breakdowns without snap judgments. And understanding the role of a surveillance society in the state's choosing which adulterers to go after should give us pause about joining into to any theatrics of public condemnation. Unless there was a serious state security issue in relation to this infidelity, what happened between Petraeus and Paula Broadwell should be, personally speaking, the equivalent of classified information: in other words, absolutely none of our business. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Naomi Wolf.","Naomi Wolf: We live in an increasingly intrusive surveillance society .
Wolf says for her, Petraeus story is about terrifying power of Patriot and Espionage acts .
She says loss of sexual privacy would be destructive to the human condition .

"(CNN) -- After the craziness of the winter weather, it's time for some positive predictions, right? Meteorologists are on the lookout for a weather pattern that could mean a milder hurricane season for the East Coast this summer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday that there's about a 50% chance of a weather phenomenon called El Nino developing this summer or fall. That's not a guarantee, but conditions are favorable enough in the next six months to warrant an ""El Nino Watch."" An El Nino event occurs about once every three to seven years, said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It involves the warming of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, and results in major changes in the jet stream where storms track. As the ocean builds up heat in the western Pacific Ocean, some of the heat goes into the atmosphere through evaporation. The moistened atmosphere invigorates storms, Trenberth said, changing where hurricanes and typhoons occur. But those of you on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast, rejoice: ""It means that the Atlantic hurricane season will be rather weak because it can't stand the competition,"" Trenberth said. An El Nino event would likely mean more shear -- wind speeds that increase with height -- in the upper levels of the atmosphere during hurricane season. This wind shear would suppress the development of tropical systems. California would also benefit if El Nino conditions develop and continue into the winter. The state is suffering from one of the worst droughts in its history. An El Nino pattern in the winter time usually results in much wetter conditions for the West Coast. Because El Nino warms up the atmosphere as a whole, we may see a mini global warming phenomenon, Trenberth said. Places that shivered through a deep freeze this year may see above-average temperatures next winter, if the pattern continues, Trenberth said. But in other parts of the world, El Nino can be quite disruptive, depending on where you live. Monsoons in India and droughts in Australia may result, Trenberth said. Hawaii would be more likely to see a hurricane. Flooding in Peru and Ecuador are also associated with El Nino. Farmers there have switched from cotton to rice farming to adapt during such times, Trenberth said. In February, sea surface temperatures were below average in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, but above average near the International Date Line, NOAA said. There were also strong low-level westerly winds reappearing over the central equatorial Pacific, which could help to hold onto the increased heat content in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. Right now the El Nino Southern Oscillation is in its ""neutral"" phase -- neither warm nor cool -- but models suggest that El Nino could develop. The last record-breaking El Nino event was in 1997 to 1998. The pattern led to a relatively warm winter, but also a series of devastating weather events: Flooding in the Southeast and California, an ice storm in the northeast and tornadoes in Florida. ""Be careful what you wish for sometimes,"" Trenberth said.","NOAA: 50% of El Nino this summer or fall .
The pattern would mean warmer atmosphere .
California could get a relief from drought .
Record-breaking El Nino was 1997 to 1998 ."
"Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats are taking a cue from Beyonce and targeting ""all the single ladies"" in the hopes they can take over Republican held seats this November. Party officials recognize that Democrats' chances of retaking control of the House are remote at best, but by zeroing-in on unmarried women, who helped propel President Barack Obama to his second term, they believe they can shrink the GOP majority. Democrats have recruited female candidates in many competitive districts, crafted a message about how the current Republican agenda impacts women and created a technology program designed to identify unmarried women and get them to the polls this fall. More than 60% of the candidates included in the House Democrats' ""red to blue"" program - which funnels resources to top tier races - are women. Raising money, visiting the Veep . Recently, these candidates visited Washington to raise money, meet with Vice President Joe Biden and huddle with top leaders to get campaign advice. Aimee Belgard, an attorney, mom, and local elected official who is running to replace GOP Rep. Jon Runyan from New Jersey, emphasized in an interview with CNN that she'd be the first woman in a decade to be elected to the state's congressional delegation, if she wins. ""As I'm out talking to them, they are glad to see someone who understands the issues that they are talking about - whether it's about the economy and their families, you know -- I can relate to that,"" Belgard told CNN. Congressional sisterhood a powerful voice for the voiceless . Iowa Democratic candidate Staci Appel, a former member of the State Assembly, touts her role pushing through Iowa's first statewide equal pay bill in 2009. She says Iowa has never elected a woman to a federal office, a fact she says she uses in her message to voters. ""You're looking at a woman who is going to go out there and fight for you. So it gives you a strong reason to vote for somebody,"" Appel told CNN. Democratic candidate Martha Robertson is facing New York Republican Rep. Tom Reed, and says she and other female candidates are an antidote to the dysfunction in Washington. ""We have bipartisan record of really getting things done. We have a guy who is just sitting in Washington just voting 'no' on everything and people want to see some change. They're tired of the fighting - we can make a difference,"" Robertson said. Dems see an opening . The results of the 2012 election show why Democrats believe they have an opening if they concentrate on single women. According to CNN's exit polls, unmarried women were about one quarter of the electorate in 2012, which was a record high. In that election, single women voted 68%-31% for Democrats over Republicans in congressional contests. Democrats admit they can't replicate that level in a non-presidential year, but they believe boosting turnout in several dozen districts can overtake the advantage Republicans traditionally have among married women. The House Democratic campaign arm is using the playbook developed by Virginia's Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in his victorious 2013 campaign. McAuliffe lost among men, but won the election because women supported him over the then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli by 9 points. Among unmarried women, the margin was more dramatic -- McAuliffe prevailed 67% -25%. The campaign committee created ""ROSIE,"" a voter modeling program named after the iconic World War II ""Rosie the Riveter,"" which they say stands for ""Reengaging Our Sisters in Elections."" This program culls data to identify unmarried voters, and then targets messages using email, paid mail and social media to motivate them to vote in November. The task to get these women motivated enough to go to the polls will be tough. Women building: GOP-led House to vote on women's museum . Seeking a narrative . A poll released last month by Democracy Corps, a Democratic leaning group, projects a 20-point drop off in unmarried female voters from 2012 to 2014. After seeing the impact of what happened in the 2010 midterm election when many women stayed home and Republicans gained the majority, Democratic candidates are talking about issues that hit unmarried women's pocketbooks -- an increase in the minimum wage, an extension for jobless benefits and legislation promoting equal pay. Democrats don't have the power in the House to move legislation on any of these items. But their campaign strategy includes turning losing battles on the House floor into a narrative to argue that House GOP members are ignoring issues that these women care about. ""As long as Republicans keep blocking equal pay for equal work, restricting women's health choices and delaying the Violence Against Women Act, women will continue to run - and win - as Democrats,"" House Democratic campaign chairman Steve Israel told CNN. But Missouri GOP Rep. Ann Wagner, who is helping with the House Republican effort dubbed ""Project Grow"" to expand the party's female ranks in the House, told CNN that unmarried and married women care about the same issue this year -- jobs. She predicted this fall female voters overall will line up with the Republican economic agenda that includes job training, education, fixing the problems with Obamacare, and creating more energy jobs. ""We're doers and we want to get things done. We want solutions, and we think we have message that resonates with all women,"" Wagner told CNN. As McAuliffe did in Virginia last year, House Democratic candidates are painting their Republican opponents with the broad brush of being right-wing ideologues that will endanger the priorities of women. Robertson said of Republican Rep. Reed, ""He's completely tea party - he's the most extreme in New York State on his labor votes, on his shutdown votes, it's just across the board."" Even if this group of female candidates does get elected to the House they will likely enter Congress as members of the minority - and the least senior. But they don't see that dynamic as a problem because they still believe they can have an impact serving their constituents. ""I think electing more women and more people who want come up here and get things done -- that is what makes a difference. We're trying to change the environment."" Appel told CNN.

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- Two years ago, Karen Daniel was wider around than she was tall. ""It's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit,"" says Karen Daniel who has lost 175 pounds. Weighing 375 pounds, the 45-year-old wife and mother had high blood pressure; her knees hurt and she was always hot. She felt fatigued and could barely breathe at the slightest exertion. Even the simplest things became a chore -- tying her shoes, crossing her legs, getting in and out of the car or trying to fit into a chair with arms. ""I wasn't living ... I was just existing,"" recalled Daniel. She hadn't always struggled with her weight. Daniel said she started gaining weight at age 18 after moving out of her parents' home to live on her own. By the time she married her husband, Paul, at age 22, she weighed 225 pounds. ""Whenever something happened, I used food,"" said Daniel. ""It was like my drug of choice was food. I never did drugs or alcohol. I was addicted to food."" Seven months after her wedding and another 50 pounds later, Daniel became pregnant with her first child. Instead of gaining weight during the pregnancy, she lost 75 pounds after a doctor warned her not to use it as an excuse to eat. But after her daughter Sarah was born, Daniel gained back all the weight she'd lost and then some. Ten years later, she weighed 300 pounds and became pregnant with their second child, Mckenna. Again, she lost weight during the pregnancy, but with the stress of having another child and running her own business, she turned to food. By the time her youngest daughter was 10 years old, Daniel weighed 375 pounds. ""I ate all the time. ... I was stuffing my emotions, I was eating my emotions,"" said Daniel. ""When I would finally get [Mckenna] to bed at night, I would stay up late and that was my time alone. I tried to de-stress and wind down and I'd watch TV and eat. It was mindless eating."" Mentally, something started to click and Daniel began to wonder how and why she had allowed her weight to spiral out of control. She said there was no ""lightbulb"" moment or wake-up call that made her realize she'd had enough. For her, there was a series of events that helped her finally realize she was tired of being morbidly obese.  Watch Karen Daniel take flight to achieve a lifelong dream » . ""I couldn't bend over to tie my shoes, get down on the ground or fit into chairs. Everything was hard,"" said Daniel. ""You're constantly worried about fitting on the toilet or in the shower or visiting someone's house and [worrying] about breaking a chair. It affects every minute of your life and you don't realize it."" As fate would have it, she saw a TV commercial for exercise equipment that was being sold at a local gym. It was geared toward senior citizens, but Daniel saw it as a start. When she showed up to buy it, she met the gym's owner, Bill Crawford. ""He gave me some of his literature and told me if I needed anything or a jump-start to give him a call,"" said Daniel.  See Daniel's before-and-after photos » . When Daniel got home, she told her sister, Jan, she was thinking about hiring Crawford as her personal trainer, but she was hesitant. Her sister asked if she would have to think twice about hiring a trainer if it were for her husband or daughters. ""She made me realize I was worth it as much as they were,"" said Daniel, whose fear of failure kept her from telling people outside her family about her plans to work out. On September 15, 2006, Daniel showed up for her first training session. She was wearing a dress over her workout clothes because she refused to be seen in size 40W pants. ""When Karen first walked in the door, she weighed 375 pounds and she could barely make it from the car to the front door,"" recalled Crawford, founder of Basic Training in Phoenix, Arizona. ""I knew that just making it to the front door of a fitness center was a big deal."" Before her first workout, Crawford took her measurements, but the tape measure wasn't long enough to fit around her hips. He needed seven more inches. ""I was 67 inches around on my butt and 65 inches tall. So I was two inches bigger around than I was tall,"" said Daniel, who had a body fat percentage of 54.60 percent. ""I also couldn't fit on his scale or in some of his machines when I started."" Crawford and Daniel improvised and she made it through her first hourlong workout. She continued to train for one hour, three times a week and said even though she ""hated every minute of it"" she pushed herself. ""It was extremely hard, I'm not gonna lie,"" said Daniel. ""I couldn't count down the minutes fast enough. It was something I did not enjoy -- I was so out of breath. I was sweaty, hot. But as soon as I stepped out that door, it was so worth it to me because I felt so much better about what I had accomplished. I knew I made it through one more workout. I knew it was getting me closer to where I wanted to be."" In addition to the one-on-one training sessions, Daniel modified her diet, eating more proteins and complex carbohydrates. She also eliminated bread and pasta and reduced her intake of sugar, salt and processed foods. If she craved something sweet, she ate a piece of fruit. She cooked with olive oil instead of butter. Just short of her one-year anniversary, she had lost 102 pounds. Her daughters gave her a Tiffany bracelet and her sister, Jan, treated her to her first pedicure. Crawford, her trainer, celebrated her success with a reminder. ""I had her take two 50-pound dumbbells and walk out to the street and walk back,"" recalled Crawford. ""When she got back she was exhausted and that's the kind of weight people have to carry when they're overweight like that."" On her one-year anniversary, Daniel had lost 114 pounds. By her two-year anniversary on September 15, 2008, she had lost 170 pounds. Now weighing around 200 pounds, she has gone from wearing a women's size 30 dress to a size 14 and she's gone from wearing a double-wide shoe to a medium width. Since losing the weight, Daniel has celebrated many milestones she never would have achieved weighing nearly 400 pounds, such as attending sporting events with her family, white-water rafting, kayaking, flying on an airplane without buying two tickets or using a seatbelt extender or simply being able to look down and see her feet. She recently achieved one of her lifelong dreams: riding in a hot air balloon over the Arizona desert.  Today, she works out nine times a week -- doing cardio and weight training twice a day with Crawford on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Then she does a mix of cardio and weight-resistance classes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.   Even though she now enjoys working out, staying on track is a constant struggle. Daniel said losing weight has been the hardest thing she's ever done.  ""Every minute of my life was about my weight. What I couldn't do. Things I couldn't accomplish,"" said Daniel, who admitted it was hard to get started. ""It's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit. Fit feels so good."" What's next for Daniel? She wants to lose 35 to 40 more pounds before her 48th birthday and keep adding to the list of things she wants to do to make sure she savors every moment. Most of all, Daniel hopes to inspire others by sharing her weight-loss story on her Web site, www.ihavebones.com. ""I just wish they would take the first step, because it's so worth it. Your life is so much better than worrying about where you're going to sit and how you're going to sit. You can actually ... enjoy life!""

"(CNN) -- It was a day of firsts at the World Cup as France got a boost from technology and Bosnia and Herzegovina scored a groundbreaking goal. And one of those ""firsts"" was a ""last,"" as Switzerland netted a winning goal deep into stoppage time, in what is reportedly the latest score in the opening round of the tournament. Here are some of the highlights from Sunday in Brazil: . Getting on the board . It took almost the entire contest, but Bosnia and Herzegovina made sure its first World Cup match didn't end up a shutout. Vedad Ibisevic brought his homeland to within a goal of Argentina with a score in the 84th minute at Rio De Janeiro's Maracana Stadium, trickling a score past Argentine goaltender Sergio Romero. But it was too little, too late, as Argentina held on for a 2-1 victory. We should mention that Ibisevic wasn't the first Bosnian to put the ball in the net. The problem is Sead Kolasinac knocked it into the wrong net, scoring an own goal just 3 minutes into the game. A hot Messi . It turns out the deciding goal was Argentina's second tally, by none other than Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest (and most scrutinized) player, who has a history of underperforming in the World Cup. Messi scored a sublime goal in the 65th minute, on a give-and-go with Gonzalo Higuain that led to a strong left foot off the inside of the post. The tally led to boos from Argentine-hating Brazilian fans in Maracana, exultation across Argentina and Twitter almost exploding. The Argentine striker won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year crowns in 2009, the combined FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2010-2012, and placed second in 2013, while leading FC Barcelona to several major championships. But entering this year's World Cup, much of the focus lay on Messi's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament, which ended with a 4-0 Argentine loss to Germany in the quarterfinals. Now that the pressure to score has abated, could this be the year Messi leads Argentina to the title? As late as it gets . In 30 seconds, emotions for Ecuadorians went from exultation to heartbreak. Defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory when Switzerland quickly counterattacked in the dying seconds after Valon Behrami brilliantly tackled Ecuador's Michael Arroyo, who appeared certain to score in stoppage time. Behrami began the Swiss thrust upfield and was knocked to the ground, but the referee called for play to continue and Behrami reclaimed the ball near midfield. The breakout ended when Haris Seferovic met a Ricardo Rodriguez cross to knock home the breathtaking winner. Seferovic's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in World Cup group play, according to ESPN. And you have to hand it to Swiss coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. He subbed in two guys. Each one scored. ""It was a dream end to the game for us and is very important for the morale of the team,"" he said. No kidding. Tech test . Sometimes soccer is a matter of inches. A player barely gets a toe on a ball to poke it away from an attacker. A player leaps high but just can't quite get to a cross. A shot hits the post and ends up barely over the goal line. The latter was the situation Sunday when France's second goal in a 3-0 win over Honduras barely leaked over the line. While the fans at the stadium watched replays and booed the referee's call, new goal line technology showed it was indeed a goal. Several television replays cast doubt on the call after France's Karim Benzema smoked a shot off the right post. The ball skittered across the face of the goal before diving Honduras goalie Noel Valladares was judged to have nudged the shot fully over the line. Only one of the replays showed the ball likely over the line, but on the screen, FIFA's animated representation indicated it was a goal by a few inches. It was the first goal confirmed by goal line technology -- introduced at this World Cup by FIFA. ""That was straight out of a tennis match. Well done FIFA,"" tweeted Herculez Gomez, a forward who has played for the U.S. national team, alluding to similar technology that helps tennis officials rule whether a ball was in or out of play. Goals by the bunches . There were only three goals scored in each of Sunday's first two matches. Only? While the number of goals per game had been trending down since the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, this tournament has seen an early explosion in the number of balls hitting the back of the net. After Sunday's action there have been 37 goals in 11 matches, 16 more than during the same number of games in South Africa in 2010. (And that's not counting two goals called back in the Mexico-Cameroon match). The tournament average of 3.4 goals would be the highest since 1958. Ok, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves; there are 52 matches left.","Bosnia and Herzegovina scored its first World Cup goal .

"(CNN) -- The FBI is offering a reward in its search for the wife of an 88-year-old Georgia man who was found decapitated. It will pay ""up to $20,000 for information leading to the location of Shirley Wilcox Dermond and/or the arrest of the individual(s) responsible for her disappearance,"" Special Agent Stephen Emmett of the FBI's Atlanta office said Wednesday. Investigators are treating Dermond's disappearance as an abduction, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said. Investigators believe Russell Dermond of Eatonton, Georgia, was killed between May 2 and May 4, and they're still searching for his severed head, Sills told reporters last week. With no breakthrough in the case, authorities are reaching out to commuters. The FBI commissioned at least 100 billboards throughout the state in its search for 87-year-old Shirley Dermond and her husband's killer. The digital billboards say, ""Missing and in danger,"" and include a photo of the gray-haired, blue-eyed Dermond, along with her height, 5 feet 2 inches tall, and weight, 148 pounds. Anyone with information is encouraged to call the FBI's Atlanta field office at 404-679-9000 or the Putnam County Sheriff's Office at 706-485-8557. ""They're basically running in all corners of the state,"" said the Outdoor Advertising Association of Georgia's executive director, Conner Poe. ""They'll run once a minute, every minute, 24/7."" The billboards can be seen as far south as Valdosta, as far east as Brunswick, and as far north as Chattanooga, Tennessee, with 50 in metro Atlanta alone, Poe said. There is no indication that Shirley Demond is a suspect, and there's ""plenty"" to indicate she was taken, Sills said. Her pocketbook, cell phone and vehicle were all at the million-dollar waterfront home. ""I don't think it's a random incident. I think for whatever reason these people were singled out for this,"" Sills said. ""They live in the most exclusive neighborhood, or one of the most exclusive neighborhoods, in this county. ... They're on a cul-de-sac in a gated, multimillion-dollar resort community that we have no crime in."" The Dermonds' friends hadn't heard from them in days and went to their home in the lakeside Great Waters community, where they found Russell Dermond's headless body in the garage. Authorities have searched Lake Oconee in the vicinity of the Dermonds' home -- turning up only a lawn chair and a Christmas tree -- and sent cadaver dogs into the nearby woods, to no avail, Sills said. Residents described Reynolds Plantation -- a tony resort complex about 75 miles east of Atlanta, which also boasts a Jack Nicklaus signature golf course and a Ritz-Carlton Lodge -- as a safe enclave where people were comfortable leaving their doors unlocked. The 3,300-square-foot home where the Dermonds had lived since 1994 is valued at more than $1 million. The Rev. David Key of Lake Oconee Community Church last week said he has known the couple for about eight years and counts them among his church's 350 attendees. He said he's ""baffled"" as to why anyone would commit such crimes against them. He described the couple of 68 years, who had three adult children, as grounded, ""beloved in the community"" and ""sweet as can be."" CNN's Vivian Kuo, Devon M.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has until May 27 to respond to the National Basketball Association, which on Monday ""initiated a charge"" seeking to terminate all ownership rights in the franchise, the NBA announced in a written statement. Sterling, who owns the team with his wife, Shelly, through a family trust, will also be allowed to make a presentation at a special Board of Governors meeting scheduled for June 3. However, attorney Maxwell Blecher has demanded on behalf of Sterling that the NBA give the longtime owner a three-month extension to prepare his response, Sports Illustrated reported Monday night. The magazine, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner, said the NBA would reject the request. A receptionist at Blecher's office told CNN she had been advised to give a ""no comment"" to all media inquiries involving Donald Sterling. The NBA declined to comment on the Sports Illustrated report. In order to terminate the Sterlings' franchise rights, 75% (23) of the 30 team owners would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale. Because Sterling is banned from any NBA activities, he is not allowed to vote, but the Clippers will have a vote, the NBA said. NBA bylaws say that if Sterling doesn't respond in five business days or appear at a hearing, it will be deemed an admission to the ""total validity"" of the charge. If the owner does appear, he may be represented by a lawyer, but the NBA constitution says: ""Strict rules of evidence shall not apply, and all relevant and material evidence submitted prior to and at the hearing may be received and considered."" The 80-year-old lawyer and billionaire real estate investor is already fighting a $2.5 million fine and a lifetime ban imposed by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. The longtime owner has argued he has been denied due process. The NBA included his failure to pay among the reasons for the charge. The league said it has been damaged by Sterling's racist remarks to V. Stiviano that were posted online in April by TMZ and in an interview with CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""Among other things, Mr. Sterling disparaged African-Americans and 'minorities'; directed a female acquaintance not to associate publicly with African-Americans or to bring African-Americans to Clippers games; and criticized African-Americans for not supporting their communities,"" the statement said. In an exclusive interview with CNN's ""AC 360"" last week, Sterling talked about his relationship with Stiviano and racism in America, and he trashed Magic Johnson and other minorities. ""That's one problem I have. Jews, when they get successful, they will help their people. And some of the African-Americans, maybe I'll get in trouble again, they don't want to help anybody,"" said Sterling, who is Jewish. Some owners said privately -- and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said publicly -- after the scandal first unfolded that it would be difficult to vote on removing an owner for a personal conversation. CNN's Rachel Nichols told Cooper his interview has changed some minds, according to NBA insiders she had spoken with in the past week. ""If there were any owners who were concerned about should we be kicking someone out for a private tape, (they) now feel more comfortable,"" she said. ""Because Donald Sterling went on television with you and made statements that were abhorrent to so many people, they feel as if they are on much firmer ground to kick him out."" Sterling's lawyer . Last week, Sterling hired Blecher, an antitrust lawyer who has worked with him in the past, to fight the NBA. Shelly Sterling has said she wants to keep an ownership stake in the team but doesn't want to be the controlling partner. Her attorney said she still hopes to resolve the ""dispute with the NBA."" ""Based on our initial assessment, we continue to believe there is no lawful basis for stripping Shelly Sterling of her 50 percent ownership interest in the Clippers. She is the innocent estranged spouse,"" Pierce O'Donnell said. But the NBA said that Donald Sterling's remarks are deemed actions of the entire ownership group. In his interview with Cooper, Sterling repeatedly denied he is a racist but admitted he made a mistake making the remarks that were recorded. In the recording, which drew widespread condemnation from fans, players and the league after it appeared on TMZ, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures online of her posing with African-Americans, including NBA legend Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. He tells her not to bring Johnson to Clippers games. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" he said. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he said during a different portion of the recording. Stiviano, who has largely avoided the media since the scandal began, is scheduled to appear on ""Dr. Phil"" on Wednesday. She may have more to say about the developing situation at that time. Sterling, who has owned the team since 1981, said he was baited into saying those remarks. The Clippers' turbulent season ended late Thursday in a 104-98 loss to Oklahoma City. The Thunder won the series four games to two. Dick Parsons, a former chairman of Citigroup and Time Warner, was tapped by the NBA to be the team's interim chief executive.

"(CNN) -- A Marine accused of killing his soldier wife was advised of murder and arson charges against him in a brief hearing before a judge on Tuesday. Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden, left, and Marine Cpl. John Wimunc are accused in the death of Holley Wimunc. Marine Cpl. John Wimunc was charged with first-degree murder and arson for the death of Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc, 24, who went missing after her home was set ablaze last week. Another Marine, Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden, was charged with arson and felony accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. The case has drawn national attention, but John Wimunc's lawyer cautioned the public Tuesday against forming an opinion on the case. ""He is to be presumed innocent,"" attorney D.W. Bray said outside the courtroom. ""We have soldiers fighting all over to preserve that right. He should not be tried in the media."" A judge scheduled Wimunc's next court hearing for August 5. Wimunc and Alden were stationed at Camp Lejeune, and Holley Wimunc was stationed at nearby Fort Bragg. Joe Lenczyk, resident agent-in-charge for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Holley Wimunc and her husband were estranged and lived apart. Authorities began searching for the missing soldier after her Fayetteville, North Carolina, apartment was torched July 10. On Sunday, a witness found a charred body in a wooded area, but Fayetteville Police Detective Jeff Locklear said police were still awaiting a positive identification from the medical examiner.  Watch Nancy Grace report on the missing soldier » . However, the lieutenant's father released a statement Monday saying his daughter, a mother of two and nurse at a military hospital, was dead. Wimunc is the second female soldier from Fort Bragg to die under suspicious circumstances in recent weeks. Spc. Megan Lynn Touma, 23, was seven months pregnant when she was found dead in a bathtub at a hotel in June, authorities said. Investigators say they are treating that death as a homicide. Camp Lejeune also had a homicide case involving a female service member this year. The charred body of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, 20, was found in January in the backyard of another Marine stationed at the base. She was eight months pregnant when she died. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean has been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the case. He was arrested in Mexico in April, but because he holds citizenship in the United States and Mexico, he cannot be immediately deported and must go through the extradition process. If he chooses to fight extradition, it could take two years to return him to North Carolina, authorities said.","Marine Cpl. John Wimunc accused of first-degree murder and arson for wife's death .

"(CNN) -- What factor has the power to transform individual lives, communities, nations and the world? The answer to this complex question is a simple one: education. While it is widely accepted that there is no one solution to lift the millions across our globe out of poverty, it is also equally accepted that a key cornerstone of addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges is through providing a quality education to all children, especially girls. Despite increasing numbers attending school in recent years, 126 million children remain out of primary school and lower secondary school around the world. Some 65 million of these children are girls. The highest rate of girls not in school is across the African continent, where in sub-Saharan Africa nearly four out of five poor rural girls are not completing primary school. There are an estimated 250 million children worldwide of primary school age who can't read, write or do basic math -- more than half of whom have completed four years of schooling. It is unacceptable that in 2014 -- less than a year away from the deadline the international community agreed to get all children into school -- that 30 million girls in Africa are denied their basic human right to a quality education. Ensuring that every child goes to school, stays in school and learns something of value while there will require firm commitments and action by governments to invest in education and prioritize the education of its girls. Africa's economy has grown at more than 5% annually over the past decade -- some of the highest economic growth in the world -- leading many to use the phrase of ""Africa Rising"" when describing its countries. However, a country's economic growth does not always lead to development or improvement for its poorest citizens. To truly rise as a nation by building an equitable, sustainable and peaceful society, governments must ensure that spending on education is prioritized and used well. According to recent research, the estimated economic gain from achieving universal primary education exceeds the estimated increase in public spending required to achieve it. One extra year of schooling can increase an individual's earnings by 10%. Girls who complete a primary education are likely to increase their earnings by 5 to 15% over their lifetimes. Each additional year of schooling could raise average annual gross domestic product growth by 0.37%. If all women had a primary education, child marriages and child mortality could fall by a sixth, and maternal deaths by two-thirds. Investing in girls' education could boost sub-Saharan Africa's agricultural output by up to 25%. Some countries lose more than $1 billion a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys. Without education, how can a country's future citizens take part in growing their economy and reap benefits? Without education how can a country grow? More from African Voices . It is however, not good enough to only increase the number of children receiving education. Children and young people must learn basic knowledge, skills and competencies, such as reading, writing, critical thinking, problem solving and math, that are needed to live healthy, safe and productive lives. In Liberia, across the African continent and, indeed, around the world, it is becoming increasingly apparent that going to school is not the same as learning. This is of grave concern given that many of the social and economic returns from an education are found to come from learning outcomes rather than number of years in school. To accomplish this, more financial resources that are better spent are needed to build a strong education system capable of improving both access and learning for all. But making informed decisions about those resources requires good data. Information on teachers, how to best support them to do their jobs, and information on how students are learning are crucial for knowing what policies and programs will be effective. By using our resources more effectively and focusing them on those children that are currently left behind, we can have some of the best educated citizens in the world -- citizens who will be responsible for building a peaceful and prosperous future. At current rates, the poorest girls in sub-Saharan Africa will only achieve universal primary completion in 2086. To not invest in and prioritize girls' education, we as African leaders are telling our women that we do not care about you and your child's future. As one of those women, I will not accept this and I urge all our leaders to invest in our children's future. Investing in girls' education is not only a moral imperative, it is a smart investment. On the 16th of June, the Day of the African Child, young people from across Africa will stand at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Abba, Ethiopia, and across Africa, to call on their governments to dedicate more resources -- the recommended 20% of national budgets -- to education and develop strong and transparent monitoring systems to track effectiveness and impact. Better information on learning outcomes and public spending is key to achieving our goals. These young people want a brighter reality and they demand that their governments stand up to meet their responsibilities and commitments, in order to build a future for their children, a future for their country. When nearly 60 developing countries come together in Brussels at the end of June, as part of the Global Partnership for Education, they will be asked to commit to increase education spending. If they do, we will know if they have listened to these young people, and then the phrase, ""Africa Rising,"" can be used in all truthfulness.

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone strike killed 10 militants early Thursday in Pakistani tribal areas, local intelligence officials said. A high-level commander with the Haqqani network, Haji Gul, was among those killed in the latest drone strike in North Waziristan Agency. Other key Afghan Taliban commanders killed in the strike included Mufti Sofian and Abu Bakar. Intelligence and local Taliban sources said the latest drone strike targeted explosive-laden vehicles meant for a mission across the Afghan border. They said the Taliban were preparing to leave when they came under attack. At least five drones were flying near Miranshah city when the strike occurred, the local intelligence officials said. The first strike in six months occurred a few hours earlier. Pakistan's government condemned the strikes. ""These strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement. Additionally, these strikes ""have a negative impact on the Government's efforts to bring peace and stability in Pakistan and the region."" Northern Pakistan is home to loosely governed tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan, and is a base for foreign fighters and members of the Islamist militant Haqqani movement.

"(CNN) -- Just 10 days after the celebrations of winning the Monaco Grand Prix, Mercedes is facing the possibility of sanctions after being called to the International Tribunal of Formula One's governing body. The German team and the sport's tire supplier Pirelli have been summoned to explain an alleged illegal tire test to the FIA's disciplinary body. The tribunal has the power to impose fines and bans, including exclusion from the F1 world championship. The FIA began an investigation after rival teams Red Bull and Ferrari lodged an official protest on the morning of the Monaco race after discovering Mercedes had helped Pirelli carry out a three-day development test in Spain, which was reported by the stewards. ""The conditions of this testing may constitute a breach of the applicable FIA rules,"" the governing body said in a statement. In-season testing has been banned in F1 since 2009 but Pirelli has an agreement that says it can run 1,000 kilometers of testing with any marque during the season -- as long as every team is offered that opportunity. After gathering evidence from the Italian tire manufacturer, Mercedes and the other 10 teams, the FIA has decided that Mercedes has a case to answer -- though a date has not yet been set for the hearing before a 12-man panel. Mercedes' rivals objected because it used race drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg to carry out the test in the team's 2013 car -- and it is primarily for these reasons the sport's governing body is bringing the case before its tribunal. The rival teams have accused Mercedes of gaining a significant competitive advantage from the test and of conducting it in secret two days after the Spanish Grand Prix, where both Rosberg and Hamilton suffered tire problems despite the German having started in pole position for the second successive race. Mercedes has struggled all season with tire degradation despite being quick in qualifying. Rosberg took the team's first grand prix win of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix, held on a slower, street circuit that is not as harsh on tires. Mercedes released a statement in response to the news that read: ""We welcome the opportunity to explain the full facts of the Pirelli test in an open and transparent manner at the International Tribunal. ""Sporting integrity is of primary importance to Mercedes-Benz and we have the utmost confidence in the due process of the FIA."" Pirelli tried to assuage the situation by issuing a statement, prior to the FIA's summons to its International Tribunal, explaining the controversial tire test. ""The use of the car utilized by Mercedes, in particular, was the result of direct communication between FIA and the team itself,"" the statement read. ""Pirelli did not ask in any way that a 2013 car be used: not of Mercedes nor FIA nor the teams which, during the year, were offered the opportunity of participating in tests for the development of tires for 2014. ""Pirelli, in development testing with teams carried out in 2013, has not favored any teams and, as always, acted professionally, with transparency and in absolute good faith."" Pirelli's contract to supply tires to F1 runs out at the end of the season. The company had been close to securing a new three-year deal, but a new contract could now be in jeopardy. In light of this, Pirelli stressed that the recent tire testing had focused on developing tires for 2014 when significant rule changes governing engines will be introduced. Ferrari was also asked to explain a tire test carried out at the Italian team's private Fiorano test track in April. It used a 2011 car during this test and, for this reason, the FIA concluded the team -- which used to be managed by FIA president Jean Todt -- had no case to answer. The governing body explained that ""a 2011 car is not deemed to contravene the applicable FIA rules."" The topic of tires has dominated the 2013 F1 season with many teams, including world champions Red Bull, criticizing the current specification of rubber and the number of pit stops seen during the races. Pirelli is trialling a new ""medium"" compound tire at this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, which it then plans to introduce as the race tire for the rest of this season. It is hoped the new tire will be safer and not split into layers, as has been seen on four occasions this season. While Pirelli hopes to solve one problem on track, it will be left to a tribunal in Paris to rule on the tire controversy that has split the F1 community.","Mercedes and Formula One tire supplier Pirelli called to face FIA Tribunal over tire test .

"(CNN) -- Dear John Paul, . Father's Day is here. I know you will once again be wondering why Daddy doesn't come home from work. I know this makes you sad. It makes me sad, too. I want to see you. I want to help you dress, brush your teeth and drive you to school. I want to take you outside so we can tend to your garden of tomatoes and peppers or ride your bicycle. Since the last time we were together, I am sure you have gotten better at applying the brakes. I bet next time I see you I won't have to keep yelling ""Pedal backwards! Pedal backwards!"" I am writing this letter to explain to you why my work takes me away from home for so long. You may not understand everything I'm saying now, but I hope one day you will. I work in Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa. This country looks like heaven, but for too many people here, it feels like hell. There is stunning natural beauty, but it seems like so many of its 77 million people are simply trying to survive. Their daily life is defined by extreme poverty, sickness and constant fear of marauding militias of men who roam the country molesting women and kids with impunity. John Paul, my job is to try to make life better for mommies and kids. Women in DRC, as they do in so many countries, work farm fields, bring home firewood, fetch heavy buckets of water, cook for the entire family and take care of all the children. Even though women do that work, they earn very little money and are often treated very badly. Men receive the money earned by women. Men decide how it is spent. Much of the time, men don't even listen to what women and girls have to say about how the family money is spent. Women are excluded from many of the family's most important decisions -- even decisions that directly affect their own lives. I try to help women and girls in Congo go to school, visit the doctor and earn money so they can take care of themselves and their families. I got into this line of work because when I look back on my own childhood in northern Ghana, I realize that I could've easily been one of those people that organizations like CARE are trying to help. To help women and girls, I spend much of my time speaking with and educating men. Just as men here have the power to make life very difficult for girls and women, they also have the power to support the girls and women around them. We are most successful helping daughters and mothers when sons and fathers are working alongside us. We talk to husbands about the community-wide benefits of supporting girls' education and their wives' efforts to save money and start small businesses. We show men how violence undermines the families and communities they value. I like to remind men that the women they can help lift from misery and despair are their mothers, aunties, daughters and sisters. I also tell them that being a responsible man requires being respectful of everyone. Manhood is not about physical strength or the power to bully others. Rather, it is working to make society better for everyone, including women and girls. That is a lesson still being learned not only here in the DRC but also there in the United States and the rest of the world. When you grow up to be a man, John Paul, you will have a right to be free and make decisions for yourself. But you should not take rights away from girls or women. Robbing a girl or women of her rights is like robbing yourself. When a man takes away a girl's right to go to school, he is taking away a girl's right to do what she wants when she grows up -- her right to be a doctor, engineer, pilot, teacher, nurse or university professor. He is robbing his community of her talent and contributions. Work for the freedom of others, John Paul. Freedom is like a boomerang. What you throw into the world comes back to you. I'm sorry I won't be home for Father's Day or to open the card you made for me at school. But I'm proud to be part of a movement of men working with women around the world to make sure everyone -- regardless of gender -- is treated with dignity and respect. I may not come home in a uniform, but please know that our family's sacrifice is for the most important struggle of our time. I know it makes you sad today, but I hope one day it inspires you to help others. I am so looking forward to spending future Father's Days with you. And watching as you grow into a good man. Sincerely, . Daddy .","Michael Alandu: Son, I'll be gone for Father's Day, working to help women in DRC .
He says life there is hell for many, particularly women who are vulnerable to attacks .
He aims to educate men that respecting all, including women, uplifts the community .

"(CNN) -- Disgraced L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling dug himself in even deeper during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night. Sterling purportedly went on CNN to apologize for his appallingly racist rant that V. Stiviano, an attractive young woman whom Sterling calls a ""friend,"" had audiotaped and released almost two weeks earlier. After the team publicly protested his actions and the NBA fined him and banned him from basketball for life, Sterling had a lot to apologize for, and in the interview with Cooper, he apparently gave it his best shot. Unfortunately for Sterling, though, he only succeeded in confirming the worst that everyone already thought of him. Sterling's ""apology"" was about as bad as it gets. Although he claimed to be ""so apologetic,"" his expressions of regret morphed immediately into pleas for forgiveness and self-justification. He cited his 35 years in basketball to argue that he was entitled to ""one mistake,"" a blatant bid to retain ownership of the Clippers that was apparently based on the erroneous assumption that experience trumps bigotry. He effectively denied responsibility for his offensive behavior by accusing Stiviano of ""baiting him,"" as if any provocation could justify his racist diatribe. For some inexplicable reason, he leveled another blistering attack at Magic Johnson, a beloved sports hero whose foundation has raised millions to promote HIV/AIDS awareness and provide mentoring and scholarships for minority students, arguing that Johnson hadn't done enough for the black community. Astonishingly, Sterling then blamed Johnson's advice for his failure to come forward soon after the recordings became public. Sterling is an adult, with access to clocks and calendars. He didn't need Johnson to tell him that his opportunity to apologize credibly was quickly slipping away. Although Sterling's performance Monday night was so utterly abysmal as to call his mental competence into question, the failure of his apology lies not in his delivery but in his intent. Apologies aren't about public relations, they're about human relations, and they're an essential part of maintaining the mutual respect and consideration that people owe to each other no matter how much wealth or power they might have. An apology can succeed only if it is sincere. To apologize effectively, Sterling would have to be sincerely sorry for the pain he inflicted. Sadly, it was pretty apparent Monday night that he's not. No amount of self-serving blather could cover up his fundamental indifference to the feelings of those he hurt. For all his pratfalls Monday night, Sterling got three things right. Opinion: The 5 apology rules that Sterling broke . First, although he did his best to backpedal, he admitted that he had said the ugly things that Stiviano caught on tape. That has serious implications for the L.A. Clippers and the NBA. Basketball players, like other employees, are entitled to protection from illegal employment discrimination. Sterling may deny being racist, but his words say otherwise, and his continued association with the team would call the intent behind every management action into question. The Clippers and their fans don't deserve to see the team mired in allegations of discrimination and threats of litigation. Sterling has become a serious legal risk, and for the good of the game, he really needs to step down. Second, Sterling was right that a protracted lawsuit over his continued ownership of the team would benefit no one. Litigation is rarely the best way to solve problems, and this would be an expensive, ugly fight that no one would win. It was heartening to hear Sterling say that he'll abide by whatever decision his fellow owners reach. One can only hope that he won't change his mind. Third, and most important, Sterling was right when he admitted that he'd hurt a lot of people: his ex-wife, the team, the fans, the NBA and everyone else who believes that racism has no place in a decent society. What he doesn't seem to understand is that the feelings of other people matter, and to deliberately injure other people by pretending that their skin color makes them ""inferior"" is downright shameful. The words hurt, and the attitude behind them hurts still more. Sterling has every reason to be sorry for what he said and still sorrier for the unexamined arrogance that led him to say it. He owes a lot of people an apology, but until he gets his mind right, anything he says will simply do more damage. It's time for Donald Sterling to step away from the Clippers and spend some time examining his prejudices. Until he's humbled enough to apologize sincerely, though, it would be better for everyone, himself included, if he'd just keep mum.","Lauren Bloom: Sterling's self-serving apology confirmed the worst everyone thinks of him .

"(CNN) -- Tennis star Andy Murray is used to serving on a daily basis -- but he's taken it in a whole new direction with his latest venture. The two-time grand slam winner has launched a five-star hotel just minutes from where he grew up in Dunblane, Scotland. Set close to where Murray learned his trade on the local courts, the 15-bedroom Cromlix -- set in 34-acres of lush Scottish countryside -- is his new venture. And while he may not be bringing you the wine list or be on hand to suggest the best local whisky, Murray is involved on a regular basis in making sure it all runs smoothly. The seed of interest in the hotel was planted in Murray's mind after his older brother Jamie married his Colombian wife Alejandra Gutierrez at the Cromlix in 2010. ""It wasn't something I'd thought about but I came here for my brother's wedding and about six months to a year later we were told that the hotel was going out of business,"" Murray told CNN's Open Court. ""The property was for sale and it's five minutes from my house -- I thought it would be a nice thing to do."" Under Murray's stewardship the hotel has undergone a rapid transformation, with the old Victorian mansion restored in fine style. But a visit to the hotel doesn't come cheap -- a stay in one of the suites during the Scottish summer will cost around $1,000 a night, while a small double room will set you back $425 a night. Murray is not the only tennis player to have invested in the hotel industry. Spain's former world No.1 Juan Carlos Ferrero bought a 19th-century country house in the Sierra Mariola mountains south of Valencia and turned it into a delightful 12-suite hotel in 2007. Compatriot Rafael Nadal has also reportedly invested $13.17 million into two hotels he bought in Cozumel, Mexico. But for Murray, Cromlix's importance is that it's rooted in the history and community of Dunblane -- a small town proud of his tennis exploits. ""It's nice that a lot of the time when I do come back to the various tennis courts and centers they have around here, that the courts are busy and a lot more kids playing tennis. I'm happy about that,"" the 27-year-old says. ""It's nice because when we were growing up, the tennis courts around this area never got used, they were empty all of the time. ""In some ways for us it was good because there was always tennis courts for us, but it seemed like a shame they were empty most of the year."" When he steps off the global tennis tour for the final time, Dunblane is also a place he wants to experience more of. ""I hope to spend a lot more time here when I finish playing because I don't get the chance to come to Scotland just now,"" he adds. ""This will definitely make me want to come up to Scotland a lot more and spend time with my family and be around the hotel. ""I'm not sure exactly what my exact role or involvement will be when I am done but I hope it's still going well at that stage."" Murray's long-term partner Kim Sears has also played a key role in defining the decor of the hotel. The pair chose the names of the rooms -- they went for famous Scots such as the inventor of penicillin Alexander Fleming, actor Sean Connery and former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. ""It was hard to choose the names,"" confesses Murray. ""You don't want to leave anybody out but I thought it would be a nice fun thing to do and luckily I've got to meet some of the people that the suites are named after. They are great Scottish people. ""I might invite them to stay if I bump into them -- but they are pretty busy people."" If they do make the trip to the hotel, there is plenty to keep them entertained. Murray has installed tennis courts which are resplendent in the purple and green colors of Wimbledon -- where he will begin the defense of his title next week. The property has its own loch, which is stocked full of trout for keen fishermen, while there is also the opportunity to take part in some falconry. For now, though, Murray must put all thoughts of silver service to the back of his mind as he returns to the grass courts of London's SW19, where he also won the Olympic gold medal in 2012. Last year he claimed the Wimbledon crown with a straight sets win over Novak Djokovic -- becoming the first British man to secure a victory on home soil in 77 years. Until last week, Murray had won 19 consecutive matches on grass before suffering a shock defeat at Queen's Club by 35-year-old Czech Radek Stepanek. That loss came just days after he appointed former Wimbledon women's champion Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach. France's ex-world No. 1 will be in his box alongside his mother Judy when Murray opens the grand slam for the very first time. ""It will be special,"" he says. ""It's something a lot of past champions have spoken about -- going back as the winners of the men's title the previous year. ""They open the Centre Court on the Monday so I'm sure there will be a lot of pressure and a lot of nerves -- but I'm looking forward to it.""","Andy Murray set to defend his Wimbledon title .

"(CNN) -- The son-in-law of a couple killed in a bombing at their rural Tennessee home has been charged with planting the deadly device, authorities announced Thursday. Investigators arrested 49-year-old Richard Parker on two counts of felony first-degree murder and two counts of felony premeditated murder in connection with a package bomb that exploded at the rural Tennessee home of Jon and and Marion Setzer, investigators announced Thursday. Bond was set at $1 million, said Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Jon Setzer, a retired lawyer, died Monday when the package bomb detonated outside their home near Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Nashville. Marion Setzer died Wednesday evening at Vanderbilt Hospital. He was 74; she was 72. Wilson County Sheriff Robert Bryan said Parker lived next door to his in-laws. Investigators would not discuss a motive and provided little detail about the case against Parker, but Gwyn said he is the sole suspect in the Setzers' deaths. ""Right now we feel like we have the person responsible for committing this crime in custody,"" he said. Parker was convicted of arson in 1993, for which he served four years on probation, the TBI said. Amid the debris, investigators found a note they said may have been attached to the bomb, but would not divulge its contents. ""This is a very important piece of evidence, because now you may have handwriting,"" said former ATF agent and bomb expert Joseph Vince. Authorities originally said they thought the bomb had been delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, but on Thursday they said they now believe that was not the case. Officials said Setzer picked up the package from his mailbox, about 200 yards from the home. It detonated just inside the house, killing him and mortally wounding his wife. ""It doesn't make sense at all,"" family friend Ken Caldwell told CNN affiliate WTVF. ""When I've heard it said that it was targeted, I thought, well, they must have targeted the wrong person."" Health problems . Before he retired, Jon Setzer worked on bankruptcy and other cases. His former law partner, George Cate Jr., said Setzer was a dedicated servant and a pastor at ""little country churches."" The two met while serving in the Army Reserve. Cate said he couldn't understand why anyone would want to target Setzer or his wife. ""Nothing had happened in my recent times to make me anticipate anything of this kind happening,"" Cate told CNN affiliate WZTV. Cate and Setzer became partners at the law firm bearing their names from 1979 to 1991. Setzer worked on general civil cases and specialized in living trusts, his former partner said. But health problems eventually made it difficult for Setzer to take care of all of his clients' needs, and he quit practicing, Cate said. 'A little anxious' Neighbors said the blast has scared them; some told WZTV that officers checked other mailboxes on the street for similar devices. ""Of course, it makes us a little anxious to go check our own mailbox when we see something like this happen, because normally boxes are delivered and mail is delivered, and you don't question it,"" neighbor Tony Dedman told the affiliate. CNN's Holly Yan, Evan Perez, Brian Todd, Dave Alsup and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Authorities won't disclose a motive for the bombing .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two more people have died from a rare strain of bird flu in China, as health officials investigate possible cases of transmission between family members. The latest fatalities occurred in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces -- both in eastern China -- and brought the total number of deaths from H7N9 avian influenza to nine, from 28 reported cases, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. So far the virus has been limited to the east of the country, with infections reported in the Shanghai region, as well as in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. A total of 13 cases, including five resulting in fatalities, have been reported in Shanghai alone, where the authorities are considering a permanent ban on the trading of live poultry after culling more than 100,000 birds in the past week in an effort to contain the problem. While the source of the infection is unknown, poultry markets have become the focus of the investigation by China's health ministry and the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus had been known to affect pigeons but had not previously been discovered in humans until a series of cases were reported in China last week. Other cities across China have announced plans to suspend trading in live birds. Authorities in the city of Nanjing took this a step further by announcing a ban on the trading of livestock and live poultry would come into effect from midnight on Tuesday, according to a statement from the Nanjing Urban Management Bureau -- though the WHO says no positive samples of the H7N9 virus have been found in pigs or farms in China so far. Meanwhile, the WHO is investigating suspected ""family clusters"" of people who may be infected with H7N9, potentially the first evidence of its spread between humans. ""At this point, there is no evidence of sustained human to human transmission,"" said WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl, in quotes carried by Xinhua. But he added that there are some ""suspected but not yet confirmed cases of perhaps very limited transmission between close family members."" According to Hartl, one of the suspected family clusters was in Shanghai, with three family members having similar symptoms and one of them being confirmed of H7N9, Xinhua said. Two -- one confirmed and one suspected H7N9 case -- have now died, Hartl said. The other suspected cluster is in Jiangsu. However Hartl cautioned that even if an infection is confirmed in another family member, further investigations would be required to ascertain whether it is actually a human-to-human transmission between constant and close contacts or a viral infection from the same environmental source, Xinhua said. Despite assurances Tuesday from Vice Premier Liu Yandong that every effort would be made to prevent the spread of infections, Chinese netizens were taking to social media to voice their fears. ""I graduated from junior high school when there was an outbreak of SARS, then I graduated from high school and there was an H1N1 outbreak. Well, now I graduated from college and there is an H7N9 outbreak...... this generation has seen it all!"" @Welly Han declared on Weibo, China's Twitter-like micro-blogging service. Another, known as @Zhulin, posted: ""At this point (H7N9 influenza), not going out would be a wise choice."" CNN's Ke Feng in Beijing contributed to this report.","Nine people now dead in China following recent bird flu outbreak .

"(CNN) -- A Russian television reporter was killed Tuesday while covering the crisis in Ukraine, according to state-run media. Igor Kornelyuk, a correspondent with Russia's state-run VGTRK, came under mortar fire along with his crew near the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a regional security bloc. Kornelyuk later died at a Luhansk hospital, said ITAR-Tass, a Russian government news agency. ""This death is yet another horrid reminder that not enough is being done to protect journalists who risk their lives reporting from conflict zones in Ukraine,"" said Dunja Mijatovic, the OSCE's representative on freedom of the media. Mijatovic also said the crew's sound engineer, Anton Voloshin, is missing. Much of the conflict has been centered in Luhansk. On Monday, hundreds of pro-Russian militants carried out a coordinated assault on a border guard base there. Five of those militants were killed in the attack, said Oleg Slobodyan, the spokesman for the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service. Seven people were also killed Monday in a separate attack at a Luhansk government building, health officials said.","VGTRK correspondent Igor Kornelyuk was killed in mortar shelling Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Prominent Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian has arrived in Sydney after being deported from China where he was held by police for 15 days following his comments on the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square military crackdown. Guo arrived at Sydney Airport early Tuesday morning and told awaiting media that he was ""happy to be back here."" Chinese-born Guo, 52, previously lived in Australia for nearly two decades. He returned to Beijing in 2005 to live and work. According to a spokesman from Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Chinese authorities said Guo was detained and deported due to visa irregularities. Guo was detained on June 1 of this year after a profile of him was published in the Financial Times featuring his latest work: a billiard table-sized diorama of Tiananmen Square covered in 160 kilograms of ground pork, evoking memories of the bloody suppression of protesters in 1989. Guo was an active participant in the 1989 demonstrations, which lasted weeks and culminated in Chinese troops opening fire on a largely student crowd which had occupied the central Beijing landmark. In the FT article, Guo was highly critical of the People's Liberation Army: ""The army is regarded as a loveable institution. But at Tiananmen I realized it's not, they will kill you if ordered to,"" he was quoted as saying. Two days after the article was published, Guo was taken from his Beijing home. Detentions were on the rise ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, which was on June 4. Authorities across the country arrested a number of prominent dissidents and critics of the government, many of whom are still being held.","After being held by Beijing police for more than two weeks, Guo Jian is deported to Australia .

"(CNN) -- For the second golf major in a row, Tiger Woods will be missing. The world No. 3 and 14-time major champion announced Wednesday he would miss the U.S. Open as he continued his recovery from back surgery. Woods went under the knife to repair a pinched nerve in March and also missed the first major of the year --The Masters -- in April. The 38-year-old's last major victory came at the 2008 U.S. Open but in a statement on his official website, he said he would not be competing at Pinehurst in North Carolina next month. ""Unfortunately, I won't be there because I'm not yet physically able to play competitive golf,"" Woods said. ""I'd like to convey my regrets to the USGA leadership, the volunteers and the fans that I won't be at Pinehurst. ""The U.S. Open is very important to me, and I know it's going to be a great week. ""Despite missing the first two majors, and several other important tournaments, I remain very optimistic about this year and my future."" Injury hampered Woods' early months of the season and he has not competed on the PGA Tour since early March. This will be the sixth major championship he has skipped through injury, his absence at Augusta the first time he'd missed The Masters since making his debut there as an amateur in 1995. Stuck on 14 majors since 2008, he will now have only two more chances this season to close in on Jack Nicklaus' record haul of 18. Despite being absent for several months Woods has only recently relinquished his world No. 1 ranking, to Australia's Adam Scott.","Golf star Tiger Woods announces he will not play at the U.S. Open .

"Port Hueneme, California -- (CNN) -- The end of the line for hundreds of detained Central American children is a U.S. naval base along the scenic Pacific Coast outside Los Angeles. Just down the road is celebrity-drenched Malibu. This is Naval Base Ventura County, where 204 children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras were being temporarily housed Friday as part of the latest crisis in America's immigration system: a surge in Central American minors daring to cross the U.S.-Mexico border alone, or with younger siblings. The base is better known as home to sailors and Seabees, not Spanish-speaking children temporarily orphaned. The quarters are expected to be at capacity, 575 children, by Tuesday, 11 days after the facility opened. Posters about ""ABC"" and ""123"" and U.S. leaders such as President Barack Obama and Rosa Parks share the wall with American red, white and blue ribbons. Bunks in a barracks-like setting are brightened with pastel-colored blankets. Some bedspreads even have flower patterns. Dorms and activities are segregated by sex, but boys and girls eat meals together, officials said. The boldly colored touches are the government's effort to make the wide halls and tall walls feel less institutional for the detained children, who are between 13 and 17 years old. ""It's not like they're militarized,"" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Crosson said of the shelters on armed forces' bases in California and two other states. ""There's no military. There's no uniforms. There's no military environment."" Officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are operating the temporary shelters, not the Pentagon, Crosson said. Health and Human Services is also running similar shelters for immigrant children on Lackland Air Base in Texas and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. The emergence of child detainees at the Ventura County base is something the city of Port Hueneme can handle, Mayor Jonathan Sharkey told CNN affiliate KEYT. ""On the Port Hueneme side alone, there are at least 5,000 military folks here all the time,"" Sharkey said. ""This is a very busy base. It's a big base. This particular program is very small. It will have no impact at all as far as the city is concerned."" Since June 6 when the new California shelter opened, 15 of the Central American children have left the facility and were handed over to relatives or vetted sponsors, said HHS spokesman Kenneth J. Wolfe. Under U.S. law, detained Central American immigrant children are treated differently than those from Mexico and Canada: The Central American youths aren't deported immediately but rather are turned over to HHS within 72 hours of custody, officials said. After being held in HHS facilities, the children end up in the care of their parents or relatives living in the United States or in the care of a sponsor's group home, officials said. During that process, the immigrant child is given a court date. But very few show up to court, and the children often become some of the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, said a union official for U.S. Border Patrol agents. Consulates respond . El Salvadoran Vice Consul Julio Calderon in Los Angeles said the consulate will ask children in the shelter for any supporting documents such as a birth certificate. However, unaccompanied children in detention facilities sometimes give a fake name, Calderon said. ""That's a problem,"" he said. ""In most of the cases, they use their real names. Sometimes they use a different one because they think if I don't give my real name, I'm not going to have a problem ... being removed back to my own country, I can come back later"" to the United States, Calderon said. That belief is a mistake because U.S. authorities fingerprint the children for identification, Calderon said. Some children become crime victims during their solo journeys, he added. And some are never found. Parents and relatives ""should be happy to know that their kids are alive,"" he said. ""We have sad stories,"" Calderon said. ""There are so many times that kids are never found. We don't know what happened to them."" Guatemalan Consul General Pablo Garcia Saenz in Los Angeles will visit the facility Monday to see how many Guatemalan children need assistance, and also whether they have parents or other relatives in the United States. ""It's very, very important to visit. It's necessary to talk to the children about what happened, what do you need ... who can pick them up,"" Garcia Saenz said. Three-fourths of children are from three countries . Three-fourths of the unaccompanied children crossing the U.S-Mexico border come from three Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Erika Pinheiro, an attorney at Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project in Los Angeles, said several nonprofit legal groups like hers are overloaded with cases and have determined it's too far to travel to the naval base, about a 70-mile drive from downtown Los Angeles. Her group can't make the long trip, she said. Pinheiro is concerned the children or their U.S. relatives will not find attorneys. The children and their families often don't go to their court hearings because they don't understand or have access to legal services, Pinheiro said. ""I think it's in everybody's interest to provide these children with attorneys,"" she said. ""My worry is that we might have trafficking victims, bona fide refugees, people fleeing violence in their country who need legal representation and need legal help. ""It's the only type of legal proceedings in the United States where we expect children to represent themselves, so you have children as young as 5 years old being expected to present a very complicated case for defense against deportation, against a skilled government attorney and a judge,"" Pinheiro said. Before the California naval base releases any child to relatives, the family members must sign an agreement to attend immigration hearings, officials said.","NEW: Some children use fake names in arrest at border, Salvadoran vice consul says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The pictures told the story: Vice President Joe Biden looked solemn, patrician and in control as he sat at a long table in the White House, flanked by people on both sides of the gun control issue. The images conveyed a sense that the White House was in command on this issue. And that's the point. Historically, presidential administrations have used symbolic imagery—at times coupled with marginal actions—to shift public opinion or affect larger political or social change. ""Politics is a risk taking project,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""They put together these commissions in response to some crisis. You try a hundred things and hope something works."" As Biden's gun control task force recommendations land on the desk of President Barack Obama, political experts say it is important that his administration sends a clear signal that it has things in hand. Obama says gun lobby stokes fear of federal action . That is especially critical in what will likely be an uphill battle to push specific changes, like an assault weapons ban, as part of a broader effort on gun control. The first move in the image battle will be to appear to move quickly and decisively. ""You have to give the Obama administration credit for one thing: They've learned from history to do things quickly,"" Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said of previous task force initiatives that fizzled. In 2010, Obama appointed a bipartisan commission headed by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, a former Democratic White House chief of staff, to come up with a proposal to balance the budget and cut the debt. Like the gun task force, Simpson-Bowles reviewed current regulations, gathered input from the public and engaged in tense internal conversations. But after months of working on a proposal—a blend of steep revenue increases and spending cuts—the group struggled to agree to a solution. The president did not take up the recommendations. Obama largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term. He wrote an opinion piece two months after the 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, acknowledging the importance of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. In the piece he also called for a focus on ""effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" Newtown searches for answers a month later . But in the aftermath of that shooting and as the election season loomed, the Justice Department backed off from a list of recommendations that included a measure designed to help keep mentally ill people from getting guns. For now, at least, there is a sense in Washington that the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting where 26 people -- 20 of them young children -- were slaughtered could lead to meaningful legislative reform. Public opinion would seem to suggest that the White House efforts are well timed. In the month since the massacre, a new poll showed the percentage of Americans who said they were dissatisfied with America's gun laws has spiked. The Gallup survey released on Monday showed 38% of Americans were dissatisfied with current gun regulations, and wanted stricter laws. That represented 13-point jump from one year ago, when 25% expressed that view.""You want to strike while the iron is hot,"" Sabato said. ""We Americans have short attention spans and, as horrible as the Newtown shooting was, will anyone be surprised if we moved along by spring?"" The White House has since worked overtime to show it considers gun control an urgent matter. The vice president has spent the last week meeting with what the White House calls ""stakeholders"" in the gun control debate. On Monday, Biden was to meet with members of a House Democratic task force on guns, along with Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services. Universal background check: What does it mean? In a series of face to face discussions on Thursday, Biden sat down with the National Rifle Association and other gun owners groups before conferring with representatives from the film and television industry. In a sign the White House is prepared to move aggressively on its proposals, Biden made public comments just before meeting with the National Rifle Association, the country's most powerful gun lobby. ""Putting the vice president in charge of (the task force) and having him meeting with these groups is intended to show seriousness and an effort to reach out and respond to concerns and wishes of various groups,"" said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. Still, the NRA expressed disappointment in its discussion with Biden and later released a statement that accused the administration of mounting ""an agenda to attack the Second Amendment."" Organizations seeking tougher gun control laws insist an assault weapons ban is critical to addressing the nation's recent rash of mass shootings. However, such a ban could be difficult in a Congress mired in gridlock. ""The bully pulpit is limited. It's hard for the president to sustain that momentum,"" Zelizer said of the White House's gun control efforts after the Newtown shootings. ""The thing about symbolism is, like the shock over Newtown, they fade quickly."" Newtown opens eyes to other gun violence against young people . CNN's Jim Acosta and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report .","Gun violence recommendations are expected from Vice President Biden on Tuesday .
The proposals are expected to contain substantive and symbolic ideas to curb gun violence .

"Nikolaevo, Bulgaria (CNN) -- The homes are built with mud and straw. The streets are dirt and puddles. An old Roma lady gestures that she's so hungry it feels like her belly has been slit. This is Nikolaevo, a tumbledown Roma village in the heart of Bulgaria. If fate had dealt a girl known as ""Maria"" a different hand, she would have grown up here, surrounded by decay and poverty. DNA tests have now solved part of the mystery of Maria, the child called the ""blond angel"" by Greek media after she was discovered during a police raid on a Roma camp in Farsala, Greece. Her birth parents are Bulgarian -- Saska Ruseva and Atanas Rusev -- and, like the Greek couple who had been raising Maria, they, too, are Roma. DNA from 'Maria' matches that of Bulgarian couple . ""Maria's parents live by selling herbs they collect in the forest or recycling scrap metal. They get child support payments, too, but that's never enough,"" a neighbor who gave his name as George said. Maria's biological family live in a one-room home made of the same mud bricks as the rest of the village. The walls have been whitewashed, and a single window is partly covered with a pane of glass, the rest with a sheet of plastic. The inhabitants of Nikolaevo complain that when it rains, the houses flood and the mud buildings get drenched. When we called at the home Friday, a few hours before the DNA match was confirmed, the Rusevs had left. Producers at a national TV station later confirmed they had paid for them to go to the Bulgarian capital Sofia, a three-hour drive away, for an interview scheduled to air Sunday night. The previous day, however, Saska Ruseva had spoken to CNN's sister channel in Bulgaria TV7. She denied allegations she had sold her baby in Greece or that Maria had been trafficked abroad by a criminal gang. The Roma: A thousand years of discrimination continues in Europe, advocates say . ""We gave her away. I didn't take any money. I didn't have any food to give to her. Since I saw her on the TV, I've been sick,"" she said. Ruseva also said she did not initially name the girl ""Maria"" but had intended to call her ""Stanka."" Even though the Rusevs had left the village for the weekend, two teenagers who say they are Maria's brother and sister -- 13-year-old Angel and 14-year-old Minka -- were home alone. When I caught up with Angel he told me he had no idea the Rusevs had left. He told me he had just come back from school. He doesn't speak Bulgarian -- neighbors were on hand to translate our conversation. Angel like many in Nikolaevo speaks only Turkish. That, for historical reasons, is the language Roma speak here. Their ancestors arrived in the Balkans as soldiers or auxiliaries in the armies of the Ottoman Empire some 500 years ago. A day's drive away across the border, Maria, now believed to be 5 or 6 years old, speaks no Greek. She has grown up speaking the Roma dialect, derived from ancient Sanskrit. That was the language Romas spoke when they migrated from India more than 1,000 years ago. CNN visits Roma community where 'Maria' was found . I caught up with a woman who says she's Maria's big sister --- Saska Ruseva's eldest daughter -- 20-year-old Katia, in the next village, Gurkevo. She has very pale skin, white-blond hair tinged with red, and her eyes are bothered by bright sunlight. Maria, too, is very fair. And in the Roma camp where she was found, residents said Maria had been born with an eye problem, but they were unable to specify the exact diagnosis. When she was cured, the Roma threw a special celebration. Katia explained to me that mother Saska had traveled to Greece in 2009 to work on the orange harvest. ""My mum was pregnant at that time and gave birth, but she did not have the money to bring her baby home. She did not sell Maria but left her there and came back to Bulgaria to try and arrange the documents,"" she said. The plight of the Roma . Investigators on both sides of the border, however, doubt that version of events. Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulo, the Greek Roma couple who raised Maria from a few months old, are still in custody charged with kidnapping. And on Friday afternoon, Bulgarian police said they had launched a criminal investigation on suspicion the Rusevs had sold Maria for illegal adoption. Law enforcement sources in Greece say Bulgarian women have in the past been detected traveling heavily pregnant into Greece. They say once they give birth they pass their children off to childless Greek couples for an agreed payment. Underscoring those assertions, Greek police said Friday they had arrested a non-Roma Greek couple in Athens on charges of trying to buy a Roma baby for 4,000 euros ($5,500). Investigators have not given any hint how long it may take to prove or discount their allegations that Maria may have been the victim of an illegal adoption. What is immediately clear, though, is that she, like many Roma children, is a victim of crushing poverty. The European Union says of the estimated 12 million Roma in the EU, 90% live below the poverty line. In Nikolaevo, many inhabitants say they, like Maria's parents, regularly travel to Greece to harvest fruit and vegetables. In Greece, impoverished Roma in the camp where Maria was found say they are now faced with competition for farm jobs from Bulgarian, Romanian and Albanian Roma who are even more desperate than them and ready to work for as little as 10 euros a day. As I said goodbye to Katia, she asked if Maria would be allowed to come home to the family. ""My mother really wants her to come and live with them. She's been crying, and she's so worried,"" she said. For now, there seems little immediate prospect of a family reunion. Bulgaria's Child Protection Services went to Nikolaevo on Friday to carry out what they said was an assessment of Saska Ruseva's ""suitability as a parent"" and the family's living conditions. By nightfall, the same state officials were back with police to take Angel and Minka into protective care. A female relative had taken in the youngsters. She began to wail loudly at the prospect of the adolescents being taken away. Just then, we saw another neighbor dodge past the police officers and help Angel and Minka slip away into the night.","CNN's Karl Penhaul visits the Bulgarian Roma village where ""Maria"" grew up .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Ignoring international protests, China may have repatriated around 30 North Korean defectors who had been caught while trying to escape their homeland, a South Korean official said Friday. Park Sun-young, a South Korean lawmaker who had been on hunger strike protesting such repatriations, told CNN she believes the North Koreans have been sent back.  CNN cannot in dependently confirm the assertion. Defectors who have made it to South Korea say anyone sent back faces a long term of imprisonment in a brutal labor camp or even execution. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, meeting with the South Korean foreign minister Thursday, said he shared Seoul's concerns about defectors and ""stressed the importance of giving priority to the international standards and humanitarian considerations for the well-being of those persons."" Almost daily protests in South Korea have called for China to allow the defectors to travel to South Korea, where they would settle.  China, however, considers the defectors to be illegal economic migrants and has been sending them back to North Korea for many years. Defector Lee Ae Ran, who made it to Seoul, says there is added concern about the defectors being caught in China as ""Kim Jong Un just took over the leadership and to make his position stable, he's proclaimed that he'll kill all three generations of a defector family."" That claim is reiterated by other defectors and North Korean observers. Another defector, Won Il, told CNN he was repatriated twice by China while trying to escape North Korea. He was sent to a labor camp where, he said, he saw many die of hunger, malnutrition and exhaustion. ""Captured defectors face a slow death,"" he said. ""There is a place called 'flower garden' where about 2,000 defectors are buried like dogs. The flowers are so red there because of their blood."" Protests are likely to continue in South Korea despite the reports that it may be too late for the 30-some defectors currently in focus. Journalist Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.","A South Korean lawmaker says about 30 defectors may have been sent back .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to giving driver's license to illegal immigrants, California has spent nearly two decades embroiled in a never-ending saga. Last year, in what appeared to be the final chapter, the state legislature passed, and Gov. Jerry Brown signed, a bill making California the 10th state in the country to allow illegal immigrants to receive driver's license. Even in a dark blue state, that legislation had been a long time coming. Previous bills dating back to 1998 had been vetoed not just by Republican governors but also Democratic ones. The catch: the licenses would have to bear some distinguishing mark on them to ensure that they're used only for driving and not identification to obtain employment or board airplanes, or open bank accounts or obtain public benefits. This is what concerns many Americans, along with the irritant that the undocumented would be carrying around a type of ID that is identical to those of U.S. citizens. Immigration activists didn't like this idea, likening it to a ""Scarlet Letter."" But I signed on to what I thought was a reasonable compromise that could do a lot of good for a lot of people. For a brief moment, it looked like the drama was over, and that common sense had prevailed. This story is not over. Now California has to do battle with an entity that, when the issue turns to immigration, often runs low on common sense: the Obama administration. Partly to appease blue-collar workers who fear competition from immigrants and don't relish the idea of millions of them re-entering the workforce with legal status, the administration is a lot tougher on illegal immigration than many Republicans have long insisted. The administration has been in office for more than five years, but it has not been able to do much on immigration reform. During this time, the Obama administration has given the undocumented a one-way passage to their home countries, with nearly 2 million deportations. Now the administration is getting involved with California over -- of all the petty things -- the state's proposed design of the new driver's license for the undocumented. The trouble started when officials in California tried to get cute by deciding that they could put the required language about how the license were not for identification purposes on the back of the license instead of on the front. Otherwise, the document would look just like the ones held by U.S. citizens. Last week, in a letter to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, officials with the Department of Homeland Security wrote that the state needs to put the disclaimer on the front of the license and also use ""a unique design or color"" to distinguish these special licenses from documents carried by U.S. citizens. Many of the immigrant activist groups that initially opposed as a ""Scarlet Letter"" any kind of distinguishing language on a driver's license for the undocumented seem to be fine with the idea of putting this language on the back. What they're not fine with is the meddling by the Obama administration. They're demanding that the state's congressional delegation pressure the administration to butt out, so the licenses can be issued. The activists are right. Deciding who gets a driver's license, and what the license looks like, are state matters. The administration needs to back off. If it needs something to do, it can ease up on the deportations. The White House has said that it supports the Senate immigration bill that was passed last year. Yet, since that legislation -- which doubles the size of the Border Patrol to 40,000 agents, builds more border fencing and would only legalize an estimated half of the undocumented population -- doesn't make a real dent, activists should demand better. I don't think the administration is capable of doing better. Its immigration record is atrocious. A big part of the problem is the Department of Homeland Security, which seems confused about its mission. When dealing with deportations, over which it has complete jurisdiction, the department tries to deny the power it has. But when the issue is driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, it makes a grab for power that belongs somewhere else.","Ruben Navarrette: California was close to giving driver's licenses to undocumented .

"(CNN) -- Woody Allen famously said that 80% of success in life is about just showing up. He's wrong. Success in life -- as in diplomacy -- is about showing up at the right time. So Is John Kerry coming to the Israeli-Hamas crisis too early, too late or just at the right time? The secretary of state has been eager to get into the middle of this almost since it started. He considered going last weekend from Vienna, Austria, where he had joined five other world powers in negotiations with Iran on the nuclear deal. But he smartly decided -- or was discouraged by the Egyptians who were in the middle of their own cease-fire mediation -- not to go. Still, the rising number of deaths primarily on the Palestinian side and the real danger of escalation of a ground incursion left him little choice. Regardless of the outcome, after Syria and Iraq, both President Barack Obama and Kerry realized that the United States couldn't sit on the sidelines like a potted plant. Kerry arrives in Israel . Moreover, Kerry's hot mic comments showing his irritation at Israel's supposed ""pinpoint"" airstrikes in Gaza revealed a good deal more frustration than simply a desire to collect more frequent flier miles. Kerry is an activist and simply couldn't abide the fact that people were dying and the United States wasn't at least trying to stop it. But desire and passion won't produce a deal. Kerry proved that in his nine-month effort to negotiate an agreed framework for peace between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. So what will it take to negotiate a cease-fire, and is Kerry the guy to do it? A key question is whether the combatants now believe it is urgent to reach a cease-fire: You would think that with more than 600 Palestinians dead, thousands wounded and displaced, and Israel soldiers' casualties rising, the conflict would have created an imperative for de-escalation. And it may eventually bring both Hamas and Israel to the point that a cease-fire is a top priority. At the same time, Israel's successful Iron Dome missile defense system has insulated the government to a degree from popular pressure to stand down, and the United States generally has been supportive of Israel's right to defend itself. But Palestinian civilian casualties have increased international pressure. And Tuesday's Federal Aviation Administration decision to stop flights to and from Israel temporarily will remind Israelis about the costs of the continuing confrontation. As for Hamas, it's not easy to read its calculations, in part because it's not clear whether the military or political wing is in charge. But it is evident that having entered this conflict financially strapped and politically weak, Hamas leaders believe they need to show something tangible for the death and destruction their missiles have produced in Gaza. And, by infiltrating Israel through tunnels and confrontation with Israelis in Gaza, they have inflicted more fatalities on the Israel Defense Forces than they did in the entire three-week war of 2008/9. Indeed, Hamas seems convinced this fight could continue for a while longer. Bottom line: Both sides may be reaching a tipping point when pain outweighs gain. But they just may not be there quite yet. A second key question is who is in a position to mediate the deal. Kerry's formidable energy and talent notwithstanding, he cannot do this deal on his own. Washington has plenty of influence with Israel under the right circumstances but none with Hamas. And that means relying on regional partners who do. But that poses a variety of complications. Egypt wants to maintain the key role here while keeping Qatar and Turkey at bay to limit their pro-Hamas leanings. Still the deal will likely require payment of Hamas employee salaries and the Qataris may be the banker on that one. Egypt and Hamas will also need to work out some new arrangement to ease crossings from Rafah -- the largest pedestrian crossing from Gaza to Egypt. Israel also wants to limit the gains Hamas makes. It wants a clean cease-fire first and only then arrangements that might satisfy some of what Hamas is seeking. In the middle of this is a secretary of state who's very much improvising in an effort to determine who has the most influence with Hamas and how best to go about using it. At the end of the day, it's no coincidence that Kerry stopped in Egypt first. Cairo will remain the fulcrum of this process. The final question is what kind of deal could be achieved. The simplest way to conclude this round would be quiet for quiet: no more Hamas rockets and no more Israeli military action. But it's probably too late for that kind of a cease-fire, and it would likely only be a temporary respite. At the other extreme are a variety of proposals from demilitarization to reoccupation of Gaza by Israel to eliminating Hamas as an organization. But none of these are realistic. The best that can be hoped for is a kind of stability for stability in which a long-term cease-fire would be followed by a number of arrangements to open up Gaza economically in exchange for Hamas' commitment to stand down and ensure that there would be no attacks against Israel via tunnels and rockets. Indeed Israel may well demand the border with Gaza be supervised to prevent reconstruction and reuse of Hamas' terror tunnels. In exchange, a number of parties would be asked to deliver on certain commitments: Qatar would pay promised salaries for Hamas employees under the Fatah-Hamas unity accord; Egypt would allow the Rafah crossing to be opened under terms to be negotiated; Israel would agree to open its crossings with Gaza, perhaps with the return -- even in a symbolic manner -- of Palestinian Authority officials in some role in Gaza. Egypt would continue to crack down on military contraband, slowing Hamas' capacity to rearm. And the United Nations -- together with international donors -- would work to deal with the humanitarian costs of the current crisis. Sooner or later, something along these lines will be put together. And Kerry can work to assemble part of it. But it will be Egypt that will drive the train, not just because of its desire to be the key actor, but also to limit the outside influences of others. And of all the potential mediators, including the United States, Israel would likely prefer Cairo, which shares its objective of limiting Hamas gains. None of this will provide a long-term solution to an Israel-Hamas rivalry, let alone to the broader question of how to reach a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian problem. But it will bring to an end another costly round of Israeli-Palestinian violence. And the time for that is long overdue.","Secretary of State John Kerry went to the Middle East to try to end the Gaza battle .

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a tale of two rulings -- the best of times and the worst of times for Obamacare in the federal appeals courts. First, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit court of appeals ruled Tuesday against a key component of the law -- the federal subsidies for millions of people who signed up for health coverage. The 2-1 decision created a legal path for a possible Supreme Court case that could essentially gut the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed with zero GOP votes. A few hours later, all three judges on a 4th Circuit panel in Virginia decided the opposite by declaring the subsidies legal and proper. What the court decisions mean for you . Opposing rulings . The opposing rulings increased the chances for the issue to reach the nation's highest court, and demonstrated the deep political divisions over the law despised by conservatives intent on undermining it. Both judges in the majority of the 2-1 D.C. Circuit ruling were appointed by Republican presidents, while all three in the unanimous 4th Circuit panel were appointed by Democratic presidents. Republicans immediately hailed the D.C. panel's ruling against the subsidies as evidence of what they called fatal flaws in the health care law. ""This is yet more evidence that Obamacare is not working -- and cannot work -- for the American people,"" said GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who faces a conservative primary challenger questioning his right-wing credentials. At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest expressed confidence in the administration's legal position, saying Congress clearly intended for all Americans to have access to tax credits if needed so they could afford health insurance. CNN Poll: Obama's numbers not great but holding steady . The issue: subsidies . The legal argument involves a provision in the health care law that says people who obtained coverage through state-run exchanges can get federal subsidies such as tax credits. It doesn't specifically say that those signing up on the federal exchange also are eligible. Opponents of the law contend that lack of specificity renders illegal the subsidies for anyone who enrolled through the federal exchange. Only 14 states and the District of Columbia set up their own exchanges, meaning that the 4.7 million who signed up for subsidized health coverage through HealthCare.gov could be affected. ""It will kill Obamacare,"" Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said of an eventual Supreme Court ruling against the subsidies. ""It would make it very difficult for Obamacare to continue because the cost of health care is going to go sky high for those who are not in the state exchange."" For now, the law remains unchanged and the subsidized policies are unaffected until the legal case plays out, Earnest told reporters. The Justice Department said the government would appeal the D.C. panel's decision. Partisan divide . The easiest fix -- changing the law to specify that it allows subsidies for coverage purchased through the federal government as well as state exchanges -- would mean reopening the debate in Congress. Unlike last time, when Democrats held majorities in both the House and Senate, Republicans now control the House and are expected to make gains in the November election, perhaps taking over the Senate too. That means Obama and Democrats have no chance of getting Congress to approve any remedial change in the law. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of the leading crusaders against the health care act, argued Tuesday that the federal subsidies amounted to assuming funding powers the Constitution granted Congress. Earnest, however, said Congress intended ""to ensure that every eligible American who applied for tax credits to make their health insurance more affordable would have access to those tax credits, whether or not the marketplace was operated by federal officials or state officials."" White House revises contraception opt out . Ambiguity . The opposing rulings Tuesday pivoted over the meaning of the word ""ambiguous."" In Richmond, the 4th Circuit judges labeled the Affordable Care Act ambiguous on whether subsidies should be allowed for consumers getting insurance on federal exchanges. When a law is ambiguous, courts give deference to a federal agency's interpretation of the law, which in this case is the Internal Revenue Service rule allowing the subsidies. The D.C. Circuit decision concluded that Obamacare was unambiguous in restricting subsidies to insurance purchased on exchanges ""established by the state,"" rather than the federal exchange. In his dissent, though, appellate Judge Harry Edwards -- a Democratic appointee -- argued that labeling the phrase ""established by the state"" as unambiguous ""strains fruitlessly to show plain meaning when there is none to be found.""

"(CNN) -- A Liberian man who was hospitalized in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, with the Ebola virus has died, Nigerian Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said. ""The patient was subjected to thorough medical tests ... which confirmed he had the Ebola virus,"" Chukwu said Friday. The case has raised fears that the virus could spread beyond the three countries at the center of what health officials say is the deadliest ever Ebola outbreak and into Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria. Lagos has more than 20 million residents. As of July 20, some 1,093 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are thought to have been infected by Ebola since its symptoms were first observed four months ago, according to the World Health Organization. Testing confirmed the Ebola virus in 786 of those cases, of whom 442 died. Of the 1,093 confirmed, probable and suspected cases, 660 people have died. The man hospitalized in Lagos was a 40-year-old Liberian working for a West African organization in Monrovia, Liberia, according to the Lagos State Ministry of Health. He arrived at Lagos airport on Sunday and was isolated in a local hospital after showing symptoms associated with the virus. He told officials that he had no direct contact with anyone with the virus nor attended the burial of anyone who died of Ebola. The Lagos State Ministry of Health had said Thursday that ""the patient's condition is stable and is in recovery"" and that the results of testing for Ebola infection were still pending in his case. Infection control measures were in place in the hospital, officials said. Doctor infected . Confirmation of the death in Lagos followed news that a doctor who has played a key role in fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone is infected with the disease, according to that country's Ministry of Health. Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan is being treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -- also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, agency spokesman Tim Shenk said. Before falling ill, Khan had been overseeing Ebola treatment and isolation units at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of the capital Freetown. Ebola typically kills 90% of those infected, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60% thanks to early treatment. What is Ebola, and why does it kill? Spread by bodily fluids . Officials believe that the Ebola outbreak has taken such a strong hold in West Africa due to the proximity of the jungle -- where the virus originated -- to Conakry, Guinea, which has a population of 2 million. Because symptoms don't immediately appear, the virus can easily spread as people travel around the region. Once the virus takes hold, many die in an average of 10 days as the blood fails to clot and hemorrhaging occurs. The disease isn't contagious until symptoms appear. Symptoms include fever, headache and fatigue. At that point, the Ebola virus is spread via bodily fluids. Get the fast facts on Ebola . Health workers are at especially high risk, since they are in close contact with infected people and their bodily fluids. Adding to the danger, in the initial stages of infection doctors may mistake an Ebola infection for another, milder illness. Journalist Aminu Abubakar in Nigeria contributed to this report.","A Liberian man who was quarantined in Lagos, Nigeria, dies of Ebola .

"(CNN) -- I watched the steady hand of my first officer, Jim, advance the thrust levers of our Boeing 777. With the assistance of 115,000 ponds of thrust from each of two GE engines, the airplane began its lumbered roll down the center line of Runway 22 Left at JFK. We accelerated toward a rotation speed of 153 knots. At rotation speed, Jim applied gentle pressure to the control yoke, lifting the nose of our 602,000-pound airplane skyward. This would be one of the most critical phases of our flight to London. The immediate threat at that moment was the possibility that one of the GE engines would fail or tear itself apart internally at the most vulnerable time, an event we'd practiced for repeatedly on flight simulators -- an event controllable through mechanical design and good old fashioned pilot skills. As airline pilots, this is one of the many eventualities we prepare for on every trip. As a result of September 11, we also prepare for terrorism. And now it appears that we will be adding missile evasion to the list. It is almost inconceivable that tragedy would strike the same struggling airline twice in such a short period, but the truth speaks for itself. From over 800 flights traversing Ukranian airspace during the week before the crash of Malaysia Flight 17 it was the only airplane targeted by a missile. The crews aboard the four ill-fated flights on September 11 all had one expectation at the end of their trip assignments. They would come home to their loved ones, kiss their wife or husband, pet the dog, and listen to their children talk about the day at school. This was the expectation of the crew aboard Malaysia Fight 370 last March, and the crew of Malaysia Flight 17 last week. None of these crews went to work with the expectation that they had the potential to be casualties of war, nor did their passengers. For a relatively small air carrier it is the equivalent of losing family members, an emotionally devastating event. And like most airline crews, those at Malaysia Airlines will continue to serve at their professional best despite the circumstances. They must do this while defending themselves against criticism that the airline or the pilots could have prevented the catastrophe had they taken a different route than the one through Ukranian airspace. This begins the blame game and is a typical reaction to an unimaginable event, especially an airplane crash with such large loss of life. But the fact of the matter is that the route is assigned by air traffic control, as it is by air traffic control systems all over the world. The flight crew was simply complying with that clearance. Pilots don't have the authority to change an assigned route on their own unless an emergency takes precedence. And even in an emergency certain guidelines must be followed. As an example, on the North Atlantic track system, which defines the routes between North America and Europe, the requirement to offset from an assigned route by 15 miles in an emergency is crucial to preventing conflict with other traffic. As for the airline dispatchers, they are responsible for filing route requests that serve the airline safely, comfortably and economically. But they have to plan their flights within the confines of air traffic control guidelines and restrictions and may not have many choices in certain areas other than to select a given altitude. If the dispatcher is aware of restrictions, the requested route that he or she files will reflect that. In the case of MH17, and with many other airlines transiting the Donetsk region of Ukraine where MH17 was downed, such safety restrictions had caused the plane to fly at a higher-than-usual altitude: 33,000 feet (Ukrainian officials had raised the minimum altitude requirement to 32,000 feet). Lockerbie relative: Grieve MH17 through love, not revenge . In the United States, airspace is blotted all over the country with restricted areas that are primarily for military use. Routes filed by civilian airplanes have to avoid these areas. Pilots do not stray into restricted airspace without air traffic control permission. Some of these areas are ""hot"" continuously and others are hot only at certain times, and at certain altitudes. Yes, if it is determined that a war zone on the ground could pose a threat, an option is to use a route that circumnavigates the airspace. But the war zone overflown by MH17 was never considered a definitive threat to civilian airplanes. Threat information is only as good as the intelligence supplied by air traffic control and its cooperating governments. So how is a missile attack thwarted on an airliner? The answer, unfortunately, is not very well. In 2003, an event reported in the back page of the newspapers involved a DHL Airlines cargo A300 that was struck by a surface-to-air MANPAD missile just after departure from the Baghdad International Airport. Ironically, the crew was executing a rapid climb maneuver to limit their exposure to just such an occurrence. The left wing sustained serious damage. All three hydraulic systems lost pressure because of a rapid fluid leak. The loss of hydraulic fluid also meant the loss of pressure to the primary flight controls. Through the innovative piloting skills of the three-man crew, the airplane completed a successful landing by using differential power. The DHL Airbus A300 was fortunate to have encountered a missile of limited capabilities. If the reported circumstances of MH17's crash are accurate, for an airliner to have evaded a high-speed radar-guided missile would have been beyond its maneuvering capacity. Years back, when the MANPAD (stands for man-portable air defense system) threat was becoming a major topic of discussion as the next terrorist scenario, my airline considered installation of an automatic missile warning and detection system. With FAA approval, through a company that designed such things, three of our B767's were outfitted with the system. To use a bad pun, it never got off the ground. Cost, of course, was an issue. And from a practical standpoint, being alerted to a missile was a great tool, but an airliner's inability to quickly maneuver away from the danger still made the outcome inevitable. And with warfare technology becoming more sophisticated and deadly, an airline missile detection system may have been outdated on the day it was installed. Ultimately the truth surrounding the fate of Malaysia Flight 17 must be determined, lest we jump to inaccurate conclusions. The destruction of Korean Airlines Flight 007 in 1983 is just such an example. Although indeed a Russian fighter jet fired upon the Boeing 747, it was later determined that the pilots had allowed the airplane to drift into Soviet airspace by not selecting the appropriate navigational mode on the autopilot. The airspace involved was an area that U.S. airplanes, (some of them military versions of airliners like the 707) traversed nearby to toy with the Russians. The role of professional accident investigation is to find the cause of such tragedies regardless of their origin. We can only hope that the investigation is not further impeded by extraneous situations.","Les Abend: Pilots prepare for emergencies. 9/11 added terror, MH17 added missile evasion .

"(CNN) -- This week marked a watershed event in the transfer of power from large companies to everyday people. When Bank of America proposed a $5 monthly debit fee in September, bank executives could only hope the customer backlash wouldn't be too extreme. But 22-year-old Molly Katchpole, a recent college graduate working two part-time jobs, was incredulous that a bank just bailed out by American taxpayers would add a new fee to increase its profits while it laid off employees. Katchpole didn't just get mad; she decided to take action by launching a petition on Change.org to stop the fee. Katchpole knew she wasn't the only one fed up with the banks' overreach, and thought that if enough customers joined her campaign, Bank of America would be forced to listen. The response was overwhelming. Within a month, more than 300,000 people from all 50 states had joined Katchpole's campaign, Bank of America's Facebook and Twitter properties were deluged with negative comments and media coverage started pouring in. A Bank of America executive personally called Katchpole to try to address her concerns and its CEO had to defend his consumer-unfriendly plan on national television as complaints mounted from bank customers and others. Katchpole's campaign also inspired dozens of other people to start their own petitions on Change.org challenging their own banks to drop new proposed fees. Within weeks, other major financial institutions like Wells Fargo, Citi, and JPMorgan Chase bowed to the public pressure and dropped their debit fee plans. Finally, on Tuesday, Katchpole woke up in her shared Washington apartment to an incredible announcement: Bank of America was dropping its fee because of massive ""customer concerns."" The campaign to get Bank of America to drop its fees had won. Ten years ago, companies could make unilateral decisions without worrying much about their customers organizing against them. A customer like Katchpole might have reacted to Bank of America's new fee by changing banks, but there would have been no way for her to connect to hundreds of thousands of other disaffected customers to enact a coordinated response. Social media has radically changed this dynamic, and tools like Change.org, Facebook and Twitter empower everyday people like Katchpole to launch, drive and win campaigns against even the largest corporations in ways not previously possible. This power shift is already starting to have deep impact. It's not just that companies are now forced to publicly face concerns expressed by mobilized customers; it's that the knowledge that any significant decision will be exposed and could result in coordinated backlash is causing companies to pre-emptively change their policies to better reflect the interests of their customers and stakeholders. This is not just good news for consumers -- it's good for society. With hundreds of new campaigns started every day on Change.org, we see this impact up close. Companies not only regularly contact us to see how they can address concerns raised by people who petition them through our platform, but they also let us know they are pre-emptively addressing concerns that Change.org members are petitioning their competitors to change. Although companies have enormous influence over our communities, ranging from the environment to public health to workers rights to politics, they are often largely unaccountable on these issues. But in a world where social media is making the actions of companies transparent and enabling consumers to hold them accountable through frictionless mass mobilization, this is changing. As a result, companies will increasingly have a choice: Do the right thing or face the wrath of a million Molly Katchpoles. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Rattray.","Bank of America drops its plan to charge a $5 debit card fee .

"(CNN) -- When Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, Western leaders warned Russia against trying the same trick in mainland Ukraine. Russia is now trying the same trick in mainland Ukraine. Over the past several days, masked, heavily armed men have seized strategic locations in eastern Ukraine. In Kharkiv, pro-Russian armed forces have occupied City Hall. In Donetsk, they have taken control of the regional legislature building and the interior ministry. In Luhansk, they have taken the compound of the state security agency. In the city of Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region, armed men shot their way into police headquarters. Cell phone towers are being toppled through the area, according to Ukraine's acting interior minister, apparently with a view to silencing nonmilitary communications. Uniformed men have established checkpoints around the city of Sloviansk, also near Donetsk. A gunfight erupted at one checkpoint on Sunday, apparently leaving two dead. The Russians have infiltrated special forces into Ukraine over the past weeks and months. Now they are busily creating conditions of ""instability"" that could provide a pretext for outright Russian intervention, followed most likely by a partition of Ukraine and alignment of the eastern provinces toward Russia. In Crimea, Russian intervention has been followed by a campaign of ""disappearances"" of opposition and potential opposition figures. Inside Russia too, policy is turning again sharply repressive, symbolized by the spread of hammer-and-sickle flags at pro-Putin demonstrations. Europe outside the Balkans has known profound peace since 1991. Even the murderous wars in the former Yugoslavia, atrocious as they were, never threatened the general European peace. The Russians' actions in Ukraine do threaten the general peace. Russia is using military force -- as opposed to its usual tool kit of corruption, intimidation, and no-return-address assassination -- to reclaim former Soviet-occupied territory. In Ukraine, Russia has launched a war of reconquest. It's very hard to predict where that war will stop. President Obama was very wrong in his speech in Brussels on March 26 to suggest that the United States had no national interest in Ukraine. What's at stake in Ukraine is the peace and stability of the European continent, an issue over which the United States fought two world wars. Yet the president has signaled to Russia that it need not fear any very robust U.S. or NATO response to its depredations in Ukraine. Opinion: The West must not blame itself for Putin's revanchism . More from the March 26 speech: ""Of course, Ukraine is not a member of NATO -- in part because of its close and complex history with Russia. Nor will Russia be dislodged from Crimea or deterred from further escalation by military force."" When a president announces that he does not think a foreign aggressor's actions can be deterred, what message does that foreign aggressor hear? ""Green light!"" Unsurprisingly, Russia is driving right through that green light. The U.S. response? Over the weekend, the White House announced that Vice President Joe Biden will visit Ukraine on April 22, or not for another 10 days. Ten days from now, Putin could be standing under a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner in Kharkiv. Every supposed benefit we receive from Obama's famed Russia ""reset"" is disintegrating before our eyes. News is arriving of another Syrian chemical attack, in the village of Kfar Zeita, 125 miles northeast of Damascus. Syria still holds most of the chemical warfare arsenal that was supposed to have been entirely surrendered to Russia by February 5. Russia has announced plans to bust up the international sanctions regime against Iran with purchases of 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil a day, potentially nearly doubling Iran's oil exports. This is a rampage of mischief, far beyond one remote region of southeast Europe. And yet even as the threat to peace intensifies, the Western leaders and Western alliances charged with keeping the peace dither, fidget, and hem and haw. The most urgent necessity now: deploy teams of NATO observers to the cities that are targets of Russian activity in eastern Ukraine. NATO needs eyes and ears on the ground -- and Russia must confront that it is fomenting an international crisis. NATO needs rapidly to expand its permanent presence with the exposed eastern members of the alliance, especially the three Baltic republics. Such a move would violate the terms of the 1997 agreement with Russia on NATO expansion, which is precisely why it's an apt response to Russia's violation of the 1994 agreement on Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine needs help improving its military and police capacities. Russia is infiltrating forces across the border with pathetic ease. This is partly because Ukraine's wretchedly underpaid officials are easily bribed and partly because Ukraine's forces are too small, ill-equipped and untrained to do much even when not bribed. The next round of sanctions on Russia should focus on banks and financial institutions that move the ill-gotten wealth of Russia's corrupt leadership to safe havens in the West. Putin's fortune is not stored in rubles. He's all too aware that someday, the kind of rebellion that toppled his Ukraine stooges might topple him. It won't be easy to find that money, although of course NATO authorities should start the search. What is easier is to target institutions, Russian and Western, that move money out of Russia -- or that have suspicious clients from Russia. In the longer term, Europe needs to shift its natural gas sourcing away from Russia. The U.S. will have to allow natural gas exports, and both Canada and the United States will need to induce private actors to build the liquid natural gas facilities that make exports feasible. It's a big job. But we face a big threat.","Gunmen seize key parts of eastern Ukraine; pro-Russian forces create instability .

"(CNN) -- Press groups, prominent journalists and administration critics have all accused President Barack Obama of failing to live up to his commitment to have the ""most transparent administration in history."" To some, that pledge is now a punch line. But the commitment endures, newly appointed White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in an interview on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday. Earnest, who was a deputy press secretary before his promotion in June, cited ""a number of steps that we've taken to give people greater insight into what's happening at the White House."" There is built-in tension in the relationship between the president and the press, Earnest said: ""If there's ever a day when the White House press corps sits back and says, 'You know, we're getting all the information that we need from the White House Press Office,' then everybody in the White House press corps would not be doing their jobs, right?"" Earnest said he had seen the letter to Obama signed by more than 40 news media organizations, including the Society of Professional Journalists and National Press Foundation, urging the President and his federal agencies to be more transparent -- to ""stop the spin and let the sunshine in."" But when asked whether the groups had legitimate concerns, he referred back to the omnipresent tension between the two sides. As the new press secretary, Earnest said he has a responsibility to ""try to help the President live up to his commitment to be the most transparent president in history."" In spite of aggressive prosecutions of whistleblowers and other actions, he said that he thought the administration had lived up to it so far -- ""absolutely"" -- and pointed to the quarterly release of White House visitor records and reporters' access to presidential fundraisers at private homes. Earnest, 39, is Obama's third press secretary, following in the footsteps of Robert Gibbs and Jay Carney. He said he'd learned a lot from watching his predecessors' briefings and now tries to ""draw on some of the more effective things that they did"" during his briefings. Earnest described himself as a voracious consumer of media, thanks partly to the White House press clippings service and partly to his iPad. He plugged the Associated Press iPad app, and also ESPN, which he said is the first channel he probably checks when he turns on the television. For work purposes, ""I definitely spend some time on CNN,"" he said, calling it ""a pretty good barometer of what a lot of people -- what a lot of people in this room -- are going to be interested in on a daily basis."" Online, he was quick to mention Politico as a website that he checks. ""In some ways, they style themselves as the ESPN of politics."" Earnest said the White House would continue to seek new and nontraditional ways for the President to reach the public, just as past administrations have. ""There's no question that, at least in my view, that the President is the best advocate for his policies,"" he said. ""He is somebody who has a very clear sense of what his priorities are. And when he can be put in a position where he can communicate those priorities, we're firing on all cylinders. We're running at our best."" He joked about the recent Emmy nomination for Obama's interview on Zach Galifianakis' satirical online talk show ""Between Two Ferns"": ""I think the President would say that it's an honor just being nominated."" (The awards will be presented in August.) ""We're always looking for new ideas,"" Earnest said. ""Some of them can be online. But maybe there's a great print idea out there that we haven't come up with yet.""","White House press secretary Josh Earnest appears on CNN's ""Reliable Sources""

"(CNN) -- Health care experts recently gathered at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to discuss the public health crisis of hepatitis C, which is ravaging communities across America, and the budding hope that we may soon be able to eliminate it with a prescription medicine called Sovaldi. Hepatitis C, a chronic, potentially fatal liver disease, afflicts more than 3 million Americans. Solving the hepatitis C epidemic is a goal we should all embrace, which is why health plans are hard at work identifying at-risk patients so they can be screened and receive necessary treatment. Sovaldi, the brand name for sofosbuvir, holds remarkable promise. But the manufacturer of this drug, Gilead Sciences, has created an enormous obstacle that is straining our health care system: its eye-popping price. At $1,000 per pill, Sovaldi costs $84,000 for a single course of treatment, and well over $100,000 when combined with other medications, as is generally the case. If every person with hepatitis C were treated with Sovaldi alone at this price, the cost would be more than $268 billion. For some perspective, consider that in 2012, the United States spent $263 billion for all prescription drugs. This pricing, which Gilead attempts to justify as the cost of medical advancement, will have a tsunami effect across our entire health care system. Because the cost of health insurance is fundamentally a reflection of the price of health care services, the excessive price of Sovaldi unavoidably puts upward pressure on premiums for everyone with private coverage. It will also strain state Medicaid and Department of Veterans Affairs programs. A recent analysis found that senior citizens on Medicare Part D could see premiums as much as 8% higher next year because of the price of this one drug. And it's been projected that California's Medicaid spending on Sovaldi and the accompanying drugs could potentially outpace what the state spends in a year on K-12 and secondary education combined. High-priced drugs are not a new phenomenon. Drug makers have long used monopolies to inflate prices. But the trend with so-called specialty drugs is a game changer. Startling as the price of Sovaldi is, it's just the canary in the coal mine. More and more specialty drugs are coming on the market, with tremendous promise to save and improve lives but also with exorbitant price tags. Although these specialty drugs only account for 1% of the prescription drugs in this country, they already represent 25% of the total cost, on the way to 50%. Until now, policymakers and stakeholders have looked the other way as specialty drug prices have gone higher and higher. In fact, any discussion of price has been quashed as an assault on innovation. But asking for a blank check in the name of innovation won't work anymore. Not when it stands in the way of solving a public health crisis. Not when it threatens state Medicaid budgets and the success of Medicare Part D, and not when the pricing threatens the very innovation that is giving so many hope. Opinion: Hepatitis drugs save money in long run . We cannot have sustainable medical innovation in America without prices that the health care system can sustain. Just think, could we have eradicated polio or smallpox if the treatments were priced like hepatitis C? Today's public health challenge is to find a balance that rewards research and development and brings breakthroughs to patients, without upending family budgets, employer benefit systems and crucial public programs. That's going to require an end to the sky's-the-limit pricing that threatens the progress we all want. Now is the time for stakeholders to begin the process of working together to meet this challenge.","Karen Ignagni: A new drug holds hope in eliminating epidemic of hepatitis C in U.S.

"(CNN) -- It's the weekend. It's the World Cup. It's Brazil. That makes three good, maybe even great, reasons to party. And rest assured, there will be plenty of revelry Saturday in the land of samba. There always is, on any day. But that does not mean that harsh realities won't intervene -- perhaps related to protests, stadium problems or other issues that dogged the World Cup in the weeks leading up to football's biggest tournament. Here's a look at five things to look out for Saturday, both on and off the field. Two European football stalwarts face off . After one game Thursday and three on Friday, Saturday will be the first day with four World Cup. While all offer intrigue in their own way, from a sports perspective, one stands out: England and Italy. One of them, England, claims to have invented the sport though it can only claim one World Cup title, from 1966. Italy, on the other hand, won the most recent of its four championships in 2006. History aside, there's no clear favorite in Saturday's contest. Italy and England are about as evenly matched as they come, heading into the tournament ninth and tenth respectively in the FIFA world rankings. Spotlight on stadium construction . But the story for the England-Italy tilt isn't just that they're playing, but where they are playing: in Manaus. That's probably not the first place you think of, when you think of Brazil. The capital of the Amazonas state, it is more than 1,700 miles from Rio de Janeiro. And critics have latched on to construction of a stadium in this relatively remote locale not just for its cost, but they also question its usefulness and point out potential danger. To the latter point, a man identified as Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira fell 35 meters to his death while working to build the stadium. Stadium construction worker dies . His was the fifth death, nationwide, involved in the construction of World Cup venues. There are also concerns that playing games in the thick of the tropics might put players' health at risk, once the games begin. The forecast Saturday in Manaus calls for high temperatures in high 80s. But -- even if it is in the rain forest -- there's not expected to be rain to cool things down. Where not to find lush grass? The Amazon . Still, the game will go on Saturday at the Arena da Amazonia -- that being the official name for the Manaus stadium. Does that mean the stadium is ready for the spotlight? Not necessarily. The British newspaper, the Guardian, reports that power cables hang from walls in locker rooms and that workers very recently put on a final coat of asphalt. But the main focus, and concern, is about where all the action will take place on the field. Pictures posted online showed a spotty patchwork of grass, looking dry and bare in spots despite it being set in one of the lushest regions in the world. Numerous reports -- and more photos -- indicate the grounds crew have been spraying the field green, to make the pitch look better. White spray and goal-line technology . The funny thing is that having people spray the grass in the middle of a World Cup arena was supposed to be one of the biggest and best changes tied to the 2014 tournament. Watch Saturday to see yourself: Referees now carry around a white spray they can use to mark, say, a line 10 yards from a free kick spot. It stays visible long enough to prevent players from creeping up, then vanishes soon after that. Vanishing spray makes World Cup debut . That's not the only notable development in this year's World Cup. Those who watched Friday's Chile-Australia contest saw the debut of a new system designed to track whether a ball crosses the goal line or not. The system of cameras and sensors can follow the ball at a rate of up to 500 images per second and instantly alert a referee when it crosses the line. Technology aims to get rid of 'ghost goals' Every team has a story . Saturday's three other games, and six other teams besides England and Italy, have plenty of their own story lines as well. For Greece, led by 34-year-old club journeyman Theofanis Gekas, it's about whether it can surge, as it did in winning the prestigious 2004 Euro tournament? For Colombia, will goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon get on the field in his fifth World Cup to become the oldest player in tournament history? (He turns 43 later this month.) For Japan, can it represent Asia well -- as one of the continent's most well-respected teams -- by overcoming Cote d'Ivoire, or the Ivory Coast, in a nighttime contest in Recife? For Ivory Coast, can the 6-foot-3 Yaya Toure -- who scored 20 goals in Manchester City's championship Premier League season -- make an argument that he's one of the world's best attacking midfielders? For Costa Rica, which cruised through qualifying -- including handing the United States its biggest drubbing -- surprise the skeptics and make its way through a packed Group D? And can Uruguay successfully kick off its quest to go two-for-two in World Cups in Brazil, having defeated the South American superpower the last time the tourney was held here, in 1950? Stay tuned.","There will be four World Cup games, in four locations, on Saturday .
The most highly anticipated matchup may be between England, Italy .

"(CNN) -- When Mitt Romney asked his staff why all the applicants for cabinet positions seemed to be men, as he recounted in the presidential debate Tuesday night, he was apparently told that only men had ""the qualifications."" That is obviously not true. But this story, as well as, of course, the infamous ""binders"" comment, provide a good opportunity to talk about women's issues beyond the two perennials, abortion and contraception. As we near the end of 2012, our society still struggles with women's full integration into the workforce and men's full participation on the home front. Indeed, Romney's comments illustrate the continued superficial treatment these issues receive, not only by many political leaders, but also by society as a whole. Let's look at, for example, some basic -- yet wrong -- assumptions about women's qualifications for high-level positions. Women's college graduation rates now surpass those of men. For the past decade, women have outnumbered men in law school admissions. More than 50% of those in management and professional specialties are women. And similar trends are evident in secondary education, the professoriate, and college and university administrations. Many Massachusetts women held appropriate credentials. Politics: Obama, Romney equal on gender pay inequality . So, why didn't these women appear on Romney's radar screen until after the organizers of MassGap supplied the now-derided binders? Perhaps the administration held the common view that women suitable for leadership positions are exceptional or rare. Maybe they thought that women have so many competing obligations that they would not be available for high-level political jobs. Maybe the Romney inner circle recruited only from its own male-dominated ranks. Whatever the reasons, women's full integration into the workforce was an afterthought. The ""binders"" comment also touched on the stickiness of traditional gender roles. Romney said he ""recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible."" His example of flexibility, however, was allowing his chief of staff to ""get home at 5"" to make dinner for her family and be with her children. He stopped short of saying it directly, but Romney appears to hold a common belief that women can best be integrated into the workforce if they are still able to fulfill their duties as wives and mothers. Women's rights organizations fought for decades to dismantle laws that limited women's abilities to compete for jobs. And they succeeded. But informal restrictions still limit women's success, because the progress in the workplace has not been met by any similar shift on the home front. Politics: Romney in a bind over 'binders of women' comment . A 2011 national survey of thousands of lawyers, business leaders, educators and political activists, for example, revealed that women and men tend to assume traditional gender roles. The report showed that in families where both adults worked (generally in high-level careers), women were roughly six times more likely than men to handle most household tasks, and about 10 times more likely to be the primary childcare provider. As long as workplace flexibility is viewed as a ""female thing,"" then it's likely that cooking dinner will be viewed that way, too. Romney's casual comment reflects an assumption that women who work outside the home do so as an ""add on"" to family responsibilities. The ""second shift"" that characterized the distribution of household labor for women in the 1990s is obviously still alive and well. In fact, a substantial, multidisciplinary literature affirms the challenges of work/family balance that professional women face. Hundreds of studies have analyzed the programs and policies that work best to ameliorate these difficult circumstances. The mere existence of this burgeoning literature shows that balancing family roles with professional responsibilities is part of the bargain for contemporary women. It's simply the new normal.

"(CNN) -- If Amy Joanne Lawson followed all of the advice she got about online dating, her username would be ""ShoeDonut."" Lawson, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, checked out a library book about online dating before creating her profile. The first step to creating the perfect profile is choosing a user name that reflects your personality, the book said. It suggested she combine two of her favorite things or activities. ""Shoes and doughnuts,"" Lawson said. ""Those are two things I feel passionate about."" But she didn't think ""ShoeDonut"" would strike the right chord. So she chose ""SewBeachy."" ""Then I realized it sounded like, ""So B****y."" So began Lawson's adventures in online dating where selecting a user name is only the beginning of an often unpredictable journey. Online dating and a formula for love . The online dating industry claims it's working. One in six recently married couples met on an online dating site, according to a study commissioned by Match.com in 2009. That year, more than twice as many marriages occurred between people who met on an online dating site than between people who met in bars, clubs and other social events, the study reported. But of course, all matches don't lead to the altar. After the world learned that Notre Dame linebacker Manti T'eo's online girlfriend never existed, CNN invited readers to share their own online dating ups and downs. While none were quite as dramatic as the T'eo scandal, readers agreed: When looking for love in cyberspace, prepare for an adventure. Lawson began online dating at the end of 2011 when she realized she wasn't meeting anyone her own age in Gainesville, Florida. The lost art of offline dating . ""When you're 43, it's tough,"" she said. ""I had no idea where to meet anyone my own age in a college town."" So she turned to the Internet. She was serious about potentially finding a match, but she was willing to give most people a chance ... and have a sense of humor about it. ""I probably think about 'Star Wars' more than anyone should,"" Lawson wrote in her OKCupid profile. Lawson remembers one date with a news director (or so she thought) with vivid detail. After talking to the man for a few weeks via text and e-mail, she decided to meet him at a sports bar. Even though they ordered the same kind of beer, Lawson did not think they were a match made in heaven. ""So the waitress brings our beers, and he reached around and he said, 'Oh I forgot my wallet,'"" she said. ""Thank God I had money in my account at that point."" Online dating: Messages you shouldn't send . When they walked out to the parking lot at the end of the date, he told her he didn't have a car. As Lawson drove him home, he also admitted he was unemployed. ""I'm really not materialistic, but I just didn't think it would work out,"" she said. Lawson said her favorite part of the date was when she texted him later to tell him she didn't think it would work out between them. The text he sent her back read: ""To think I gave you points for not wearing flip flops."" Shannan White met her ex-husband on a computer bulletin board in the 1990s when she still used a dial-up modem. In 2007, White ended up online again without any romantic intentions. How technology has changed romance . She started playing the Lord of the Rings online game using an audio-only option on Skype. White got close to one of the players whom she had never met. He was her shoulder to cry on as she was going through a divorce. ""Finally just one day on Skype, everybody else had kind of hung up and I said you know, I think I love you,"" she said. White and her husband, James, got married in 2011, and she attributes her success to the fact that they told each other the truth. ""We got to know the real us, because we never lied,"" White wrote in her iReport. ""I woke up and realized I was in love with a man that I knew better than anyone, yet never laid eyes on."" Though her experience had a happy ending, she's heard plenty of stories that did not work out well. White advised to be protective with personal information because it's easy to lie online. ""I've had tons of friends that have fallen for scams or had quote unquote 'buddies' who died and magically came back from the dead,"" White said. ""It happens way more often than you realize. It's kind of ridiculous -- after 20 years, when I hear somebody [online] say, 'I have cancer' or whatever, my first instinct is 'Hmm, wonder if that's true.' If you fall for it, it's because you want fall for it.""Â  Â . Within 24 hours of registering on Match.com in 2010, Barbara Hassan had three matches ""who by all accounts were intelligent, good looking and well off."" Too good to be true, she thought. And she was right. Opinion: What we don't know about love and loneliness . One of her matches said he was ""an architect/construction manager who built and designed a building in Nigeria for orphans,"" Hassan, a 48-year-old divorcee in Texas, wrote in her iReport. They corresponded online for a few months, until the man asked Hassan to pay for his ticket to the United States. The total would only come out to $2,700. When she saw the e-mail asking for money, she had a good laugh. Hassan had become suspicious long before he asked for money. When she asked the man, who claimed he was an engineer, a physics question, he got it wrong. ""He thought he had me hooked but little did he know,"" she said. ""After I realized he was a scammer, I decided a little taste of his own medicine was due. So I let him get to the 'ask for money' part and then I shut the door on him."" But just when Hassan thought she was done with online dating, she met her husband in 2011. ""He looked at my profile, and I sent him a smiley face,"" she said. ""Three days later, we had lunch."" They bonded over their online dating scammer stories and got married 14 months later. Even though Hassan was the victim of a scam, she said she was ""extremely blessed"" to have found her husband online. ""For some reason I kept that one profile up and now I have a wonderful man in my life,"" she said. Psychologists highlight pitfalls of online dating . Whether people are looking to find their soul mate or just to have some fun, Lawson said it helps to go into online dating with a sense of humor. ""In online dating and in life, it's nice to have thick skin, let things roll of your back and move on,"" she said. ""You have to be patient. You won't put your profile up and be struck by lightning with the perfect person for you."" Do you have online dating horror stories?

"(CNN) -- Josephine Ruckinger had been estranged from family members for about 20 years. She burst back into their lives briefly with deadly consequences. Ruckinger and her husband, Jeffrey, both 43, broke into an Ashville, Pennsylvania, home, where they shot and killed her mother and brother, before being killed by Ruckinger's father, according to Pennsylvania State Police. The woman's parents, John Sr. and Roberta Frew, had returned home from an evening out around 10 p.m. ET on Friday. They were sitting in the living room with their adult son, John Jr., when their estranged daughter and her husband knocked at the door. When Roberta Frew answered, gunfire erupted, police said. Investigators believe Roberta, 64, was shot by Ruckinger, while John Jr., 47, was shot in the left side of his chest by Ruckinger's husband. Both Roberta and John Jr. died at the scene of apparent gunshot wounds. Meanwhile, John Sr., 67, grabbed a .22-caliber revolver from a back bedroom. He allegedly saw his daughter point a gun at him. He fired at least one round which, investigators believe, hit her in the head. Ruckinger's husband then fired shots at John Sr., who responded in kind, Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement. Once ""the immediate threats had been incapacitated,"" John Sr. called 911 and waited, said police. Ruckinger was pronounced dead at a nearby trauma center. By the time police arrived, her husband had died. John Sr. was not injured. Investigators do not believe John Sr. recognized that one of the two alleged attackers was his estranged daughter at the time of the incident. A motive for killings is under investigation. A search of the Ruckingers' car, parked at the bottom of the Frews' driveway, turned up a large amount of ammunition, a gas can, and a can of lighter fluid. No charges have been filed against John Sr., police said. ""He was very cooperative with the investigation and his report of the events matches the physical evidence that we found,"" Pennsylvania State Trooper Matthew Evans said in an e-mail to CNN.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis doesn't want a commonly quoted Bible verse chanted as empty words on Christmas Day -- the one about peace on Earth. ""Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors,"" heavenly hosts proclaimed when Christ was born, according to the Vatican translation. The pontiff told tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the Vatican on Wednesday where he wants that peace to happen -- in Syria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Holy Land. False pretenses won't do. ""True peace is not a balance of opposing forces. It is not a lovely 'facade' which conceals conflicts and divisions. Peace calls for daily commitment,"" Francis said in his Christmas Urbi et Orbi message. The Urbi et Orbi address is customarily political and global, as its name indicates. It is Latin and means ""to the city (of Rome) and to the world."" Popes give the address and blessing on special occasions such as Easter and Christmas. Vatican TV estimated that about 150,000 attended the blessing in St. Peter's Square, which marked Francis' first Christmas celebration as pope. He asked Jesus to inspire peace in warring factions around the world. ""Prince of Peace, in every place turn hearts aside from violence and inspire them to lay down arms and undertake the path of dialogue."" He also continued his criticism of money-driven evils. ""Lord of heaven and earth,"" he prayed, ""look upon our planet, frequently exploited by human greed and rapacity."" Pray for peace . Francis asked Christians to pray for an end to the violence and suffering in Syria and for humanitarian aid to get through to its people. He prayed for people dying of hunger, thirst and violence in the Central African Republic to find an end to war and poverty. He also addressed a new armed conflict. ""Foster social harmony in South Sudan, where current tensions have already caused numerous victims and are threatening peaceful coexistence in that young state,"" he prayed. He asked God to have mercy on civilians killed in Nigeria and Iraq and prayed that Israelis and Palestinians find peace together in ""the land where you chose to come into the world."" Francis remembered refugees fleeing conflicts and misery in Africa who died off the coast of Italy when their overfilled boats capsized before reaching the town of Lampedusa . He prayed for those who lost entire families and homes to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Pope adored . The massive turnout on Christmas Day mirrored the popularity Francis has enjoyed since becoming head of the Catholic Church. His reputation for being down to earth and genuinely caring about people has touched a chord with millions. Christmas Eve was no different. There was a record number of requests to attend this year's Christmas Eve Mass, the Vatican said. ""People are listening to him, because he's speaking in a language that's not Vaticanese,"" said Gerard O'Connell, a Vatican analyst. ""He's speaking the language of ordinary people."" The Pope preached Tuesday evening on love, forgiveness and facing life with bravery and with God's help. ""To us the Lord repeats, 'Do not be afraid.' ... And I, too, repeat, do not be afraid,'"" Francis said. He called on the throngs gathered at St. Peter's Basilica on Tuesday to cast aside hatred. ""If we love God and our brothers and sisters, we walk in the light. But if our heart is closed, if we are dominated by pride, deceit, self-seeking, then darkness falls within us, and around us."" Reforms, surprises . Nine months into his papacy, much has been made of the Pope's reforms, among them more scrutiny at the Vatican bank, changes to the church's bureaucratic structure, and a commission to deal with the abuse of minors. And while this year's Christmas liturgy remains the same, experts say we should expect the unexpected. ""He tends to be a surprise, because he does things that are normal, but are very abnormal in terms of the papacy,"" O'Connell said. ""He brought three homeless men into where he is living to have breakfast with him on his birthday. ... I suspect we will see something else again over the Christmas period."" The festivities began on Saturday, with the Pope's Christmas message to the Curia. He urged the church's governing body to avoid gossip and to focus on service. And then he practiced what he preached, spending three hours at a local hospital bringing Christmas cheer to sick children.","""Peace calls for daily commitment,"" Francis says in his Christmas Urbi et Orbi message .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to think of a time in the history of America's intelligence community when it has been more battered by accusations of over-stepping or mismanaging its mission: to secretly gather information to support the activities of the U.S. government . The list of recent revelations grew over the weekend with allegations that America has been systematically spying on its European allies. Reports in the European press, apparently drawn from documents provided by Edward Snowden, suggested that America spied on the European Union, France, Italy, Greece and other close international friends, listening in on encrypted fax transmissions and planting bugs and other devices at 38 embassies and missions in Washington and New York, as well as locations in Europe. The timing is not great: the eve of scheduled trade talks with the Europeans, a priority of the Obama administration. The new reports have caused a furor across the continent, stoking the uproar caused by earlier Snowden-related revelations that America has been listening in on millions of German calls and e-mails. Top officials, like Secretary of State John Kerry, shrugged it off by saying allies often spy on each other, and others, like former Director of the NSA and CIA Gen. Michael Hayden, noted that some friends spied on us. But the damage was done to important relationships and to the Obama administration's prior claims that it would conduct itself according to a different standard than past U.S. governments. All nations collect intelligence, Obama says . This all comes on the heels of reports that the overreach of the intelligence community begins at home. While it will be cold comfort to our NATO allies that we are only treating them as we do our own people, the details of programs that warehouse massive amounts of phone metadata and e-mail traffic were the first shock waves produced by the Snowden leaks. But the problems go beyond what Snowden leaked to the very fact that a comparatively junior contractor could gain top level clearances and access to so much information. Indeed, it is deeply disturbing that hundreds of thousands of private contractors had Top Secret clearances and that, as we have learned, many may have gone through inadequate screening procedures or been inadequately managed. Earlier news -- about the scope of U.S. drone programs managed by the intelligence community, ""kill lists,"" extra-judicial targeting of perceived threats, the scope of America's cyberwarfare programs against enemies in Iran (Stuxnet), China and elsewhere -- have already called the role of the community into question. Just last week NBC News reported that a senior U.S. military leader very close to President Obama and his national security team, Gen. James Cartwright, was a target of a leak investigation concerning Stuxnet.. These are all stories of a culture of secrecy and of arrogance that has simply gone too far. Perhaps each and every one of these missions began with a reasonable national security goal. But because so much of the planning and execution takes place behind closed doors or in situations in which the term ""oversight"" is laughably applied to wink-and-a-nod rubber stamping of initiatives, it is perhaps more surprising we have seen so few scandals than that we are dealing now with what seems like so many. Consider: According to the U.S. government's own figures, last year the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court received 1,789 applications for approval of government spying operations and OK'd all but one. Since 2001, according to a report in Salon based on government figures collected by the Federation of American Scientists, more than 15,000 applications were approved and only 10 denied. The Supreme Soviet of Cold War Russia was a less effective rubber stamp. The FISA Court is just one of the feeble oversight mechanisms that apparently did not do its job. Congressional and executive branch officials have bought into the post 9/11 paranoia and hopped up threat mentality and come to accept that even the possibility of an attack on the United States warrants disregard for U.S. laws and international agreements. Not to mention the principles of respect for individual liberties and reasonable constraints on government power on which the United States was established. This was well illustrated when NSA Director Keith Alexander argued that the agency's massive surveillance programs were warranted because they allegedly stopped ""over 50"" terror attacks, with scant reference to the size of the attacks, the real risk posed, whether other means to stop them that didn't involve massive surveillance might exist, or to the possibility that the damage done to civil liberties might be worse than that which might have been produced had the terror plans gone forward. Opinion: Why we're all stuck in the digital transit zone with Snowden . Indeed, senior U.S. officials have told me that, in their view, a primary motivator for accepting all these programs was fear that resisting would hold dire political consequences for them, should an attack occur. In other words, in the modern U.S. intelligence community, CYA has become more important than CIA. There are real threats out there. And, yes, other nations spy on us. Terrorists use new technologies to target American interests and citizens and must be contained. Cyberwarfare poses a growing threat to the United States as well as other nations. All these facts require analysis and countermeasures by the U.S. government. Some require the United States to go on offense. But what the revelations show is a series of errors of overreach and bad judgment, not that all our programs should be eliminated. The problem here is one of scale and of profoundly compromised and twisted values. That problem itself is complicated and exacerbated by America's emergence as the world's first cybersuperpower. As such, we have sought to flex our technological muscles not only in ways that make us safer but that introduce a new form of constant, low-grade, invisible conflict that makes Cold War spy games seem quaint in their narrowness--even if their stakes were much higher. In the past, I've called this Cool Warâ€”neither cold nor hot but dangerous nonetheless, not just to our enemies but also to our friends, our interests and our values. Edward Snowden broke the law and if the United States can bring him in, he deserves to be prosecuted. But the ones who should be in their own hot seat are those who created, approved and rationalized into existence the sprawling, seemingly uncontainable global intelligence and cyberwarfare apparatus that is as much of a threat to the kind of country we want to be as any terrorist group. Opinion: Why can the U.S. do about Snowden? The problem for us, of course, is the only people with the power to restore balance and common sense limitations to these programs are the ones who let them get so out of control in the first place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: The U.S. intelligence community is being slammed as overreaching .
He says more news of spying, on United States' European allies, has drawn shock and anger .
He says it's out of control, with poor oversight and disregard for laws and U.S. values .

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden deserves amnesty and the ability to return to the United States without fear of being incarcerated for reporting crimes by people in high places in the U.S. government. Monday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon that the NSA's widespread collection of millions of Americans' telephone records was unconstitutional bolsters this view. But for some, whether to give Snowden amnesty is not an easy matter to reconcile. After all, they say, he broke laws in divulging classified information. Indeed, some say he is a traitor. But just as a member of the U.S. military is not required to follow an unlawful order, it is proper that an employee of the United States intelligence community -- NSA, CIA, DIA and others -- should report any information that concerns law-breaking by the intelligence agencies or their employees. An NSA official's suggestion that amnesty for Snowden could possibly be put on the table was undoubtedly welcome news for Snowden, yet NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander rejected the suggestion. But how can anyone believe that Snowden would not be deserving of amnesty? Clearly it is the government and its senior officials who committed the crime -- people who took oaths to defend the Constitution from enemies both foreign and domestic and who failed to take to heart the words they swore to uphold. Indeed, Snowden did not -- nor does any government employee -- swear allegiance to the president of the United States, or even to the secretary of Defense or the director of NSA. No, he swore to uphold and defend the Constitution. Unfortunately, while federal law protects whistleblowers who work in other government sectors from reprisals for truth-telling and have paths for reporting wrongdoing and mismanagement, those who work in intelligence are expressly denied such rights. When Senior Staff Representative Diane Roark and longtime senior NSA employees Bill Binney, Ed Loomis, and I submitted a formal complaint about mismanagement at the agency, the government's response on July 26, 2007, was to send the FBI to raid our homes, searching them for seven hours and seizing our computers, phones and other digital media. We are just now getting our property back after having successfully sued the government in December 2012. The government even indicted Tom Drake, although it dropped its criminal charges in the case against him. Still, for the five of us, it was the equivalent of a punch in the face and a warning to other would-be ""truth-tellers"" not to report wrongful government activities or the government will come after you. Snowden clearly saw what the government does to whistleblowers who try to work within government to fix things that are wrong. He knew that our complaint to the United States Department of Defense inspector general in September 2002 went for naught. Although the report agreed that our complaint was well-founded, nothing happened -- no one was found guilty of wrongful behavior or waste of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Even before writing the complaint, we -- all longtime and senior NSA employees -- along with Diane Roark, a senior staffer on the House Permanent Select Subcommittee on Intelligence, had approached Congress in 2001 about the matter of illegal collection of data about U.S. citizens. No action. Snowden might have known that we were ultimately punished by approaching officials, and even had our security clearances revoked when the FBI raided our homes -- despite the fact that four of the five of us were not indicted and none of us was found guilty of committing a crime. For employees in the business of intelligence, there are no honest brokers, no viable paths to follow to report the subverting of the U.S. Constitution. It is the reason Snowden went first to Hong Kong and ultimately Moscow to seek refuge. He did not go to those places to give away national secrets, rather he needed a place to stay that was safe from extradition and where he could wait while the United States sorted through the facts, especially those regarding government leaders who violated the most basic of our nation's laws -- the right to privacy. It was shocking to see the interview on MSNBC a few years ago with the former director of NSA, Michael V. Hayden, and hear him redefine the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. When asked whether NSA had violated the Fourth Amendment, Hayden said it had not. Hayden said ""probable cause"" was not the Fourth Amendment's standard for violating a citizen's privacy -- it was based on ""reasonable suspicion."" Recognizing that the whole matter of secret presidential orders and extreme interpretations of the Constitution in regard to executive wartime authorities by the U.S. Department of Justice could be the subject of a book by themselves, one thing is clear -- no one asked either the Supreme Court or the people of the United States whether bulk collection of citizens' phone metadata was constitutional. As we saw on Monday, Judge Richard Leon does not think so. In recent days, Hayden defended the actions of both the Bush and Obama administrations, stating that the NSA collection program was ""blessed"" by all three branches of the U.S. government. What Hayden has not said is that neither the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court nor Congress had a good understanding of what was going on. The NSA contends it provided Congress with the opportunity to be briefed on the surveillance, but some members of Congress dispute that. Snowden's revelations since June have certainly made it clear that no one -- except the NSA -- believes they had the whole truth about the extensiveness of its data collection efforts, whether from the Internet or from the phone system. Perhaps more germane to this discussion whether Snowden should receive amnesty and the matter of who committed the real crime -- Snowden or the government -- is that the legal basis for NSA in defending its actions can be found in a single court case called Smith v Maryland (1979) -- which went to the Supreme Court at a time when there was hardly an internet and nobody even dreamed there would be cell phones, social network sites or Twitter. In this case, touted by the government as legitimizing the bulk collection of metadata under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the police inserted a recording device at the telephone company to record the metadata -- phone number originating the call, time of call, number called and duration of conversation -- associated with a man suspected of robbing a lady. The alleged thief challenged the constitutionality of the police recording the metadata associated with the phone call, but the Supreme Court backed the lower court's decision that doing so under the circumstances was constitutional. Now, one might ask how does the Supreme Court's approval of the collection of metadata associated with a single phone call made by a suspected thief end up authorizing the bulk collection of phone metadata of hundreds of millions of American citizens by the most powerful spy agency in the world? We all know that the field of law has its quirks, but it's clear such an interpretation of law does not constitute justice, let alone make sense. With those facts as background, I think most Americans would agree that Edward Snowden deserves amnesty. In fact, it is those who allowed these programs to be implemented and developed over the past 12 years who should be prosecuted. After all, do we not stand for ""equal justice for all""? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of J. Kirk Wiebe.","Kirk Wiebe: Edward Snowden is entitled to amnesty in the U.S. without fear of incarceration .

"(Mental Floss) -- Major League Baseball's umpires are all over the news after a spate of, er, questionable calls throughout this postseason. Despite larger postseason umpiring crews that include two extra umps in the outfield, it feels like an inordinate number of calls have gone the wrong way. All of these gaffes have prompted renewed debate about whether baseball should start using instant replay. How could umps blow this many calls that are so obvious when viewed in slow motion? Aren't these guys trained professionals? Are they handsomely rewarded? What do we really know about the men in blue, anyway? After some spotty officiating in the NFL last fall, we did some digging on the officials in the four major sports. Here's what we found: . They make good money . A National Football League ref can make anywhere from $25,000 to $70,000 a season, although since most of the games are on Sundays, they can also have other jobs during the week. (We'll get to those in a minute.) That cash comes with responsibilities, though. In addition to relaying the calls to the teams and fans, a ref is also the crew chief, or leader, of the seven-man officiating team that also includes an umpire, a field judge, a back judge, a line judge, a side judge, and a head linesman. Officials in other sports pull down more loot, but they have much more grueling schedules... • Baseball. According to MLB.com, MLB umpires get around $120,000 when they start out in the big leagues, and senior umps can earn upwards of $300,000. Between spring training, a 162-game schedule, and the postseason, being an MLB ump is a job that takes up most of the year. They are, however, well cared-for while on the road. Each ump gets a $340 per diem to cover hotel and food, and when they fly, it's always first class. Working a full postseason can tack on an extra $20,000, plus expenses. They also get four weeks of paid vacation during the regular season. These guys hang onto their jobs, too; on average, there's only one opening for a new big league ump each season. • Basketball. National Basketball Association refs are similarly well compensated. They earn anywhere from $100,000 to $300,000 for an 82-game season. There are some nice fringe benefits, too; when referee Tim Donaghy admitted to helping gamblers fix games, the NBA asked that he repay other benefits he'd pulled in over the course of his 13-year career, including $750 worth of sneakers and $4500 worth of free tickets. • Hockey. If you can skate and survive the occasional lockout, National Hockey League ref is hardly a bad job. Refs make between $110,000 and $255,000 while linesmen earn from $72,000 to $162,000. Mental Floss: Stories behind all 30 NHL team names . NFL refs have day jobs . Since NFL refs only work one day each week, they can have ""real"" jobs to supplement what they earn on any given Sunday. Some of them actually have pretty interesting jobs. • Mike Carey, my personal favorite ref, is an entrepreneur and inventor who holds eight patents for snow sports apparel. He founded and co-owns Seirus Innovation, a ski apparel company. • Walt Coleman is infamous in Oakland for being the ref in the ""Tuck Rule Game,"" but he's also a fifth-generation dairy farmer who once held the position of president of the Arkansas Dairy Products Association. • Walter Anderson became an official in the league in 1996 and got the promotion to referee in 2003. Prior to becoming a referee, he was better known as Dr. Walt Anderson, a dentist. • Tony Corrente is probably used to dealing with unruly crowds of guys from his day job as a high-school social studies teacher. • If Jeff Triplette seems hard to scare on the field, it's probably because he's seen worse. He was an Army Reserve colonel during the Persian Gulf War, where he was awarded a bronze star. Mental Floss: What's with those AFL throwback uniforms? • Bill Leavy is similarly tough; he spent 27 years as a police officer and firefighter in San Jose. • Ron Winter's not just a ref, he's also an associate professor in Western Michigan University's phys. ed. department. • Gene Steratore must love how he looks in stripes. In addition to being an NFL ref, he officiates NCAA hoops games and has drawn March Madness assignments in previous seasons. • And when Ed Hochuli isn't officiating a game (or working out), you might find him in a courtroom. He's a trial lawyer in the Arizona firm Jones, Skelton, and Hochuli, which employs over 80 attorneys. It's a long climb to the top . How does one become a ref? Most of these guys have humble beginnings as officials. Carey started officiating Pop Warner games in 1972 and gradually worked his way up through the college ranks. Eventually, he became an NFL side judge in 1990 and received a promotion to NFL referee, the pinnacle of football officiating, in 1995. Hochuli started as a Pop Warner ref in the early 1970s; he was a law school student who needed a little extra pocket cash. He then slowly made his way up through high school, junior college, and small conference college ball before getting a Pac-10 gig. He eventually made it to the NFL in 1990.

"(CNN) -- If you're accosted at an airport by someone who already knows your name, destination and dietary requirements, don't assume they're working for the TSA. Virgin Atlantic has begun testing Google Glass. The airline is conducting a six-week experiment with the wearable technology for passengers in its Upper Class Lounge at London Heathrow airport. The web-connected specs should enable concierge staff to identify passengers arriving at the airport.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama intervened Saturday in Philadelphia's rail strike, signing an executive order that puts union workers back on the job while they continuing negotiating with a regional transportation authority. The order calls for the creation of a Presidential Emergency Board to mediate the differences between the workers and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, putting the roughly 450 employees back to work on Sunday morning. The employees are covered under the Railway Labor Act, which means a federal mediation board may intervene to work with the parties to resolve contract disputes. Under the order, the board has 30 days to make recommendations to end the dispute. Obama issued the order at the request of Gov. Tom Corbett. ""It is imperative that parties continue to work toward an agreement for the benefit of the tens of thousands of people who use SEPTA rail every day,"" Corbett said in a written statement. The dispute between the engineers and electrician unions and SEPTA revolves around pay raises and pensions. The strike affected 13 lines that serve the suburbs and the Philadelphia International Airport, officials said. It includes engineers who drive or operate the commuter rail lines, said Jerri Williams, spokeswoman for the transportation Authority. The lines affected carry about 60,000 commuters daily, which is 10% of the total ridership in the Philadelphia area, she said. ""As long as these workers show up for their regularly scheduled Sunday shifts, regional rail service will be restored to full Sunday operations in the morning,"" Williams said.

"(CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board will assist the South Korean government in investigating the crash of an Asiana Airlines cargo plane, officials said Friday. Asiana Flight 991, a Boeing 747-400F cargo airplane, went down Thursday near the southern South Korean island of Jeju, where parts of the plane were found but not the aircraft itself. The two pilots are believed to have been killed, the safety board said in a statement. The plane crashed around 4:12 a.m. en route from Seoul's Incheon International Airport to Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China, the NTSB said. The flight crew reportedly declared an emergency due to an in-flight fire, the board said. The plane crashed into the East China Sea about 70 miles west of Jeju Island, the NTSB said. U.S. officials have designated air safety investigator John Lovell as the NTSB representative, to be joined by an NTSB operational factors investigator and advisors from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, the safety board said. The Korea Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board is leading the probe, the U.S. safety board said.

"(CNN) -- Two men claiming to be Los Angeles-area gang members have posted a video showing them firing rifles in Syria's civil war, apparently fighting on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. In the profanity-laced video, the two men fire rifles from behind a cinder-block wall at ""enemigos"" -- enemies -- though the camera never shows an enemy in the distance. The two men often refer to ""gang-banging"" and their ""homies,"" and one of them displays gang hand gestures and tattoos. The video was publicized this week by the Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washington-based organization that studies and translates news accounts and social-media postings. ""This is very unique because these guys are over there, and they are with the pro-Syria forces and pro-Hezbollah forces,"" said Steven Stalinksy, executive director of the institute. ""We have been monitoring foreign fighters over the years, and there has been a handful of Americans going to fight, but they have been going to fight against Assad."" The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces is investigating the video. ""The JTTF is aware of the video and is investigating to determine any potential threat to Americans or to U.S. interests,"" FBI spokeswoman Ari Dekofsky said in a statement. ""We are not in a position to provide further comment at this time."" The ties to the al-Assad regime apparently stem from how one of the two gang members identifies himself as ""Wino"" from the Westside Armenian Power gang. Some Armenians side with Assad because he has protected the minority group in Syria. Wino uploaded the video and photographs to his Facebook page, where he is identified as ""Wino Ayee Peeyakan"" and by his real name, Nerses Kilajyan, according to MEMRI. The video was also posted to YouTube. Although media accounts and MEMRI explained that Kilajyan's Facebook page contained several photos and comments earlier this week, his page was taken down as of Wednesday. MEMRI's website, however, has reposted Kilajyan's photographs showing him wearing Hezbollah garb and standing by a purported Hezbollah operative, MEMRI said. The pro-Iran Shiite militant group Hezbollah has fought on the regime's side of Syria's three-year civil war. Hezbollah is deemed a terrorist group by the U.S. government. Kilajyan is also photographed standing beside the man who also appears in the Syrian video, MEMRI said. That man in the video calls himself ""Creeper"" and says he's a member of the Sun Valley GW-13 gang. In the slang of a Latino gang-banger, Creeper often sprinkles his fluent English with Spanish words. ""Judging by the photos, Wino seems to have been fighting in Syria since December 2012. Comments by Wino's Facebook friends suggest that the two were deported from the U.S. due to their involvement in criminal activity,"" MEMRI's website says. In the two videos, the two men appear to be addressing gang members back in the Los Angeles area while they fire their rifles. Creeper: ""We're in Syria still gang-banging."" Later he adds: ""Tell the homies: in the ... Middle East, still gang-banging."" Wino: ""We're in Syria, homie. We're in Syria, homie. ... We're on the ... front line."" In the video, Creeper cites rappers Mr. Capone-E, Mr. Criminal and Crazy Loco, but those rappers distanced themselves from the video. ""I've spoken to both Mr. Criminal and Crazy Loco, and none of us have any associations whatsoever with the two men in the video,"" the rapper Mr. Capone-E said in a statement. "" I've been very blessed to have the most amazing fans from all walks of life and with all kinds of political views. I personally do not condone any type of violence or any type of action that leads to criminality. ""I'm by no means a political person and will not be speaking on the subject of Syria, on which I'm wholly uninformed,"" the rapper said. Syria submits revised plan for removing chemicals .

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old Connecticut high school student suspected in the slashing death of a classmate was charged with murder as an adult Tuesday. The victim, Maren Sanchez, 16, who was described by her family as ""a bright light full of hopes and dreams,"" died Friday after being slashed in a school stairwell, authorities said. She was cut in her neck, chest and face. Though the motive remains under investigation, police were looking into whether the boy was angry after Sanchez rejected him as a prom date. The suspect, Christopher Plaskon, was taken into custody Friday by a school police officer in the principal's office. His clothing and hands were bloodied. ""I did it,"" Plaskon allegedly told the officer, according to a probable cause statement filed with a Milford court Tuesday. ""Just arrest me."" The Jonathan Law High School student, who remains under emergency commitment at a medical facility, was ordered held on $3 million bond. During a special court session convened at the medical facility, Plaskon's lawyer, Richard Meehan, Jr., said his client had been advised of his rights and told that he was being charged with murder as an adult. He faces 25 to 60 years in prison if convicted. Meehan said in a statement that Plaskon ""is in need of continued psychiatric care and medication and should be housed in an age-appropriate correctional center when he is released from the emergency commitment."" Plaskon is to be formally arraigned Friday, provided he is released from the emergency psychiatric hold. In a statement Tuesday, Plaskon's family said words could not convey ""the raw sadness we are left with by this unimaginable tragedy. Our hearts are forever broken."" The statement continued: ""To the Sanchez family, our deepest sympathies. Please know that you are now, and forever, in our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers. We join with the entire Milford community to celebrate the life and mourn the loss of this most vibrant and exceptional young woman. To our extended family, friends and neighbors and all who have reached out to us in our darkest hour with warmth, kindness, understanding and compassion, you cannot know how much it has meant to us. Thank you."" The fatal slashing occurred about 7 a.m. Friday in a school stairwell. A witness saw Plaskon on top of the victim and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, according to the probable cause statement. Another witness allegedly saw him discarding a bloody knife in a school corridor. Sanchez, a junior, suffered ""multiple lacerations,"" police said. The state medical examiner's office concluded Saturday that Sanchez had died from ""stab wounds to the trunk and neck"" and ruled the death a homicide. School staff members and emergency technicians attempted ""life-saving measures,"" according to Milford Police Chief Keith Mello, but Sanchez was pronounced dead at Bridgeport Hospital at 7:43 a.m. The prom, which was scheduled for the night of the slaying, was postponed. All students were sent home, and counseling services were made available throughout the weekend. On Friday, friends and classmates of Sanchez gathered and released balloons into the air. The balloons were violet, her favorite color. On Instagram, classmates in prom attire posted images of themselves holding her green prom gown. The slain girl's cousin, Edward Kovac, read a statement from her family lamenting what they called an ""unprovoked attack"" that ended the life of a young woman who had ""her future at her fingertips."" ""Maren should be celebrating at her prom this evening, with her friends and classmates,"" the family statement said. ""Instead, we are mourning her death, and we are trying as a community to understand this senseless loss of life."" The family statement recalled other cases of school violence, saying ""we can never forget the lessons ... from this"" and other incidents. One of those incidents happened about 22 miles away in Newtown, where a lone gunman shot his mother to death, then went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 people, including 20 children, before taking his own life in December 2012. ""We need to ensure that more young children are protected from violent attacks at school,"" the family said. In their statement, the Plaskon family said, ""In prayer we ask for comfort for the Sanchez family and all of us so deeply affected by this tragedy. We pray for the wisdom to guide us as we desperately try to pull together the shattered pieces of our families. And finally, we pray that time may soften our wounds and reveal forgiveness in the hearts of all.""

"(CNN) -- The 2013 America's Cup will be faster than ever after organizers announced that wingsail catamarans will be the vessels of choice. The race has historically been between yachts with a single hull, however the 34th edition of the contest will be between multi-hull vessels with wings rather than traditional sails. This means the boats will travel faster through the water, with top speeds in excess of 30 knots, almost three times as fast as in the past. The Golden Gate Yacht Club, hosts of the 2013 race and holders of the cup, have also announced a new, shorter race format for the competition. In an attempt to boost interest in one of sailing's showpiece events an annual World Series will also take place, starting in 2011, resulting a world champion team being crowned. In addition, a youth America's Cup will also be introduced, set to begin in 2012. In a statement on the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) website, the CEO of 2010's winning syndicate BMW ORACLE Racing Russell Coutts explained the reasons behind the changes. ""We believe this new format and new boat will put the America's Cup back at the pinnacle of our sport,"" said Coutts. ""These changes will give equal opportunity to competitors and long-term economic stability to all teams and all commercial partners. We promised fairness and innovation and this is what we've delivered."" The statement also explained how, in addition to generating interest in the contest, the new annual America's Cup World Series will provide increased commercial revenue for the teams and their sponsors. The venue for the 2013 contest is not due to be announced until the end of the year, with San Francisco, Valencia and a location near Rome believed to be under consideration. Vincenzo Onorato, President of the 2013 challengers Mascalzone Latino, supported the changes: ""I think that we need to acknowledge that the Defender has kept its word. The America's Cup is going to have fair rules and a truly independent management of the racing.""","The 34th America's Cup will take place on faster wingsail catamarans .

"(CNN) -- The evidence, and the claims: . The knife . Prosecution says: A knife found in co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito's house has the DNA of Amanda Knox on the handle and of victim Meredith Kercher on the blade, suggesting it's the murder weapon. Defense says: The knife doesn't match the shape and size of wounds on Kercher's body or an outline of the knife left on her bed. The defense also presented experts who said DNA on the blade was too small to be definitive. DNA on Kercher's bra clasp . Prosecution says: A bra clasp that was ripped from Kercher's bra and found on the floor of her room has DNA of Raffaele Sollecito on it, proving he was in the room when she was killed. Defense says: The bra clasp is contaminated and essentially tainted evidence because it was moved around the crime scene and left there for more than six weeks before it was picked up as evidence. Knox's confession . Prosecution says: During her interrogation, Knox said she could hear Kercher screaming. She also pointed the finger early on at Patrick Lumumba, who was eventually released. The prosecution said Knox's false statement proves she is lying and was at the home when Kercher was killed. Defense says: Knox's statements were made when she was asked to imagine what would have happened that night in her apartment. The defense maintains Knox pointed the finger at Lumumba because she was confused and pressured. Eventually the confession was thrown out because Knox was not questioned with a lawyer present. Bloody footprint on bathroom rug . Prosecution says: The prosecution attributed a bloody footprint on a rug in the bathroom to Sollecito, which they say proves he was there at the time of the murder. Defense says: Sollecito's lawyers presented forensic experts who said the print is in no way a match to Sollecito, but instead a match to Rudy Guede, who was convicted separately in the case. The defense focused on Sollecito's hammer toe, which they say wouldn't leave an imprint like the print found on the mat. The window . Prosecution says: A broken window in the home Knox shared with Kercher was an attempt by the American to stage a break-in as a cover for the murder. The prosecution maintains it would be impossible for someone to break the window and climb through the window as proposed by the defense. Defense says: The window was broken by Guede, a known drifter who had broken into homes before. Defense expert Francesco Pasquali simulated how glass would break if a rock were thrown from the outside. His testimony included that he believes a burglar could have thrown a rock that way, not from the inside (to stage a robbery) as the prosecution maintains. Allegations of crime scene contamination . Defense says: The defense has argued that several pieces of key DNA were contaminated at the scene. Crime scene video shows investigators sometimes not wearing gloves or hair coverings, prodding their fingers in Kercher's wounds, leaving key pieces of evidence at the scene for weeks and moving them around, and at one point breaking a window for no reason. Prosecution says: The prosecution has argued that all the evidence was indeed properly handled and that it isn't their job to prove the crime scene work was good enough. Instead, they say, that's the job of the defense. Bloody shoe print in Kercher's room . Prosecution says: The bloody shoe print found next to Kercher's body belonged to Sollecito and placed him in Kercher's room when she was murdered. Defense says: After Guede, a man from the Ivory Coast who was convicted in a separate trial for murdering Kercher, was found to have a shoe box for shoes matching the print, they argued for a re-examination of the print. Francesco Vinci, a coroner and forensic specialist for Sollecito, testified he believes it was wrongly attributed to Sollecito and belongs to Guede.","The verdict in Amanda Knox's appeal will be heard after the defendant statements next week .

"(CNN) -- Even as they were rejecting as far-fetched an Australian company's assertion that it may have identified the resting place of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 -- thousands of miles from where investigators have been searching -- experts acknowledged Wednesday that they have little choice but to check it out. ""The investigators are going to be hard-pressed to blow this off,"" said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation. ""I think, at this point, because of the lack of results where they've been searching for six weeks, they're almost stuck. They have to go look."" The Adelaide-based firm GeoResonance has said that electromagnetic fields captured by airborne multispectral images some 118 miles (190 kilometers) off the coast of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal showed evidence of aluminum, titanium, copper and other elements that could have been part of the Boeing 777-200ER, which disappeared from radar on March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. ""The company is not declaring this is MH370, however it should be investigated,"" GeoResonance said Tuesday in a news release. GeoResonance Managing Director Pavel Kursa, citing intellectual property concerns, would not explain how the imaging works. Nevertheless, the company got its wish on Wednesday, when Bangladesh sent two navy frigates into the Bay of Bengal to the location cited by GeoResonance. ""As soon as they get there, they will search and verify the information,"" Commodore Rashed Ali, director of Bangladesh navy intelligence, told CNN in Dhaka. The chief coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, retired Chief Air Marshal Angus Houston, held out little optimism that any such search would prove fruitful. He told Sky News International that the search area in the Indian Ocean had been set based on pings believed to have emanated from one or both of the plane's voice and data recorders. ""The advice from the experts is that's probably where the aircraft lost power and, somewhere close to that, it probably entered the water."" CNN aviation expert Miles O'Brien said GeoResonance's claims are not supported by experts. ""My blood is boiling,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""I've talked to the leading experts in satellite imaging capability at NASA, and they know of no technology that is capable of doing this. I am just horrified that a company would use this event to gain attention like this."" He called on company officials to offer ""a full explanation"" for their assertion, which he said appeared to be based on ""magic box"" technology. Sending investigators to the Bay of Bengal would draw away from the limited resources that are focused in the southern Indian Ocean, O'Brien said. But that won't stop them from going, he predicted. ""I think they have to,"" he said. ""It's a public relations thing now."" David Gallo, director of special projects at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, also expressed skepticism. ""It's so revolutionary, and I don't know anyone that knows of this kind of technology,"" he told CNN. ""And I know most of the people in this business."" 'We were being ignored' The company's director, David Pope, said he had not wanted to go public, but did so only after his information was disregarded. ""We're a large group of scientists, and we were being ignored, and we thought we had a moral obligation to get our findings to the authorities,"" he told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday. GeoResonance's technology was created to search for nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry under the ocean's surface or beneath the earth in bunkers, Pope said. And the company's news release said its search technology was reliable. ""In the past, it had been successfully applied to locate submersed structures, ships, munitions and aircraft,"" it said. ""In some instances objects that were buried under layers of silt could not be identified by other means."" The company began its search four days after the plane went missing and sent officials initial findings on March 31, Pope said. It followed up with a full report on April 15, which it would not make public. ""We only send our report to Government authorities as it contains the exact coordinates of what we believe to be the wreckage of an aircraft,"" Pope said Wednesday in an e-mail. By going public with their conclusion, if not their data, the company says it hopes it will spur officials to take its claim seriously. Malaysian authorities contacted GeoResonance on Tuesday and were ""very interested, very excited"" about the findings, Pope said. Inmarsat, the company whose satellite had the last known contact with MH370, remains ""very confident"" in its analysis that the plane ended up in the southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the MH370 investigation told CNN. The Inmarsat analysis is ""based on testable physics and mathematics,"" the source said, and has been reviewed by U.S., British and Malaysian authorities as well as an independent satellite company. Is GeoResonance on to something? Relatives hear new details . On Tuesday, relatives of the 239 passengers and crew heard new details from officials, including audio recordings of conversations between the plane and a control tower that had not been released before but appeared to contain nothing out of the ordinary. ""Malaysia three seven zero, contact Ho Chi Minh 120.9, good night,"" says a voice identified by Malaysian officials as that of a radar controller in Kuala Lumpur. ""Good night Malaysian three seven zero,"" answers a male voice believed to be a Flight 370 crew member. A preliminary report on the plane, submitted last week to the International Civil Aviation Organization, will be released to the public Thursday, the Malaysian Ministry of Transportation said Wednesday. ""The report will be very basic, I assume -- most initial, preliminary reports are,"" said Schiavo, the aviation analyst. ""Just the facts, basic things."" But she predicted it will also lay out what is not known, as well as a blueprint for the path ahead and, as such, could prove helpful to family members of those who were aboard. Plane audio recording played in public for first time to Chinese families . More intense underwater search . Seven weeks of intense searching have found nothing linked to the plane. Though some ships will stay on the Indian Ocean to gather any debris, the international air effort to find the plane is over. The likelihood of finding any debris on the ocean's surface is ""very remote indeed,"" since it has probably become waterlogged and sunk, Houston said. So crews will scour a larger area of the ocean floor -- 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) -- in a process that could take eight months, officials said. The next phase will use private contractors and could cost about $56 million. Houston said that could stretch to 12 months if any glitches with equipment or weather were to occur. He was confident the aircraft will be found, though perhaps not soon. ""Nothing happens fast underwater,"" he said. ""It could take months and months and months and months."" The Bluefin-21, which has searched the 121-square-mile (314-square-kilometer) area around where pings were thought to have been detected, resumed searching a nearby area of the ocean floor at about 1 a.m. ET on Wednesday -- its 17th mission, according to a U.S. Navy source. New phase to include private contractors, may cost $60 million . Journalist Farid Ahmed reported from Dhaka; CNN's Anna Coren reported from Adelaide, Australia; Miguel Marquez and David Molko reported from Western Australia; Mitra Mobasherat reported from Kuala Lumpur; Tom Watkins, Holly Yan and Mariano Castillo reported and wrote from Atlanta; and Mike Ahlers contributed from Washington.

"(CNN) -- It's a World Cup photograph taken over 40 years ago. Shot on film, and after the game, but it still ranks as one of the most memorable and impactful of football images. At the 1970 tournament, legendary Brazil player Pele and England's 1966 World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore share an open embrace and dazzling, relaxed smiles after the heat of battle against each other on the pitch. ""It's a wonderful moment. Two legends, that natural expression, friendship and admiration. There's a real power to that photography,"" says CNN Digital's director of photography Simon Barnett. Photographer John Varley captured that moment while many others around him were changing film or were unaware it was unfolding. ""This is a great example of a picture that most of us could take these days if we're keeping our eyes open. Look around. You can get moments like these. And they really resonate,"" Barnett tells CNN's Sports Photography Masterclass series. ""There's no reason not to take a lot of pictures nowadays. You can delete them afterwards,"" he adds. ""Keep your mind open to imagery because it can come from the most surprising of places."" Fast forward almost three decades later, to another iconic image that also stands the test of time -- but portrays peak action instead of the quiet power of an off-the-field interaction. It was the 1998 World Cup final in Paris. France's goalkeeper Fabien Barthez dramatically foiled Brazil's superstar striker Ronaldo as the home side pulled off a shock 3-0 victory. ""It's a remarkable peak action photograph and it works as well because there was a whole backstory with Ronaldo that day,"" Barnett explains. Ronaldo, the World Cup's all-time leading scorer, was the best player of the tournament. However, there was a controversy that day when he was initially not named in the starting lineup. Rumors spread that he had a pre-match seizure. Despite this, Ronaldo did take the field for a Brazil side heavily favored to win. ""They ended up losing and Ronaldo had a pretty bad game on top of that. So there's a metaphor here for what a bad day Ronaldo had,"" says Barnett. ""Typically you go into these World Cups and you assume it's a straight-up sports event. But then something else happens -- this added drama that soccer sends."" iReport: Send us your best football photos . While there is a lot at stake for players on such big occasions, the photographers are also out to make a name for themselves. In this case, the snapper was Simon Bruty -- well known for his work with Sports Illustrated. The magazine's layout is probably the reason this particular shot of Ronaldo and Barthez was shot as a vertical, says Barnett. ""Photography tends to be horizontal and certainly in this day and age where we're looking at pictures on a screen, on our phone, on our iPads, horizontal is typically the way to go,"" he explains. ""Now Bruty was shooting this for Sports Illustrated so I'm sure in the back of his mind was to get the cover, which is one of the rare places that you can actually have a really good use for a vertical picture. ""And I believe this was going to be the cover until it got overtaken by a picture of (American football legend) Mike Ditka smoking a cigar, for whatever reason."" The equipment Bruty used then seems ancient compared to today's technology, which Barnett calls ""truly staggering."" ""As a photo editor, we used to pick up the phone and ask photographers, 'Did you get it?' Now the question is, 'Where is it?' "" he says. Even in the four years since the last World Cup in South Africa, the speed at which photography moves from field to office is much faster. ""Quite literally we can be seeing pictures within the minute,"" Barnett says. ""Photographers are shooting on the sidelines. Those images instantaneously go to their picture editors, be it in New York or Rio. They are editing and they are being sent to us."" And what about in the next four years, when the World Cup is played in Russia? How will photography have changed? ""Right now the way we take still photos is we press the button to start the camera. I've got a feeling you're going to get to a place where you press the button to turn the camera off,"" Barnett predicts. He says the process will entail looking at a game afterwards to pick out the best angle and most important moment. But despite the technical wizardry of our age, Barnett says the talent of an experienced photographer will always have cache. ""Technology has made the job easier. But the analogy I'd give is that cameras these days are like Formula One racing cars. But the real difference is who's driving the car. If I try to drive one of those cars, I'm not going to win a race. You give it to a professional driver -- they'll win races.""","Photo of Pele's 1970 meeting with Bobby Moore captures football legends .

"(CNN) -- In an age when people are encouraged to collect hundreds of Facebook ""friends"" and thousands of Twitter followers, some social media users, particularly young ones, are going smaller. Yes, Facebook and Twitter remain the juggernauts of social sharing -- Facebook with more than 1.2 billion active users and Twitter with more than 240 million of its own. But over the past couple of years, it's been smaller social sharing and messaging tools, most of them mobile apps, that have gotten the most buzz and gained the most users. These services encourage users to target personalized messages to individuals or small groups instead of broadcasting posts to larger networks of people. That doesn't mean folks are ditching Facebook for the silly photos of Snapchat or the 6-second videos of Vine. But these emerging social hangouts increasingly are where young users are communicating with each other. ""I think it is too early to say that they're abandoning the larger social networks, but certainly the audience for those networks is now fragmented,"" said Shayla Thiel-Stern, a journalism professor at the University of Minnesota who focuses on digital media and culture. According to a GlobalWebIndex survey from last fall, the two fastest-growing apps used by teens were Vine, which lets users share brief video clips, and WeChat, a Chinese mobile text and voice messaging app. Usage of WeChat had increased a whopping 1,021% from the beginning of 2013. Among those same teens, 56% said they were active on Facebook, compared to 76% at the beginning of the year. ""We did see a decrease in daily users, partly among younger teens,"" Facebook chief financial officer David Ebersman acknowledged during an earnings call at the end of last year. That's no surprise, according to Thiel-Stern. ""First, young people are always looking for the coolest new thing, and now that their parents and grandparents are on Facebook, it's certainly not a cool new thing,"" she said. ""Some of it is social currency, in general. ""Second, younger people have truly embraced the move to apps that are a combination of visual, mobile and social. They carry phones that are set up to shoot photos and videos and they are quite conditioned -- perhaps by their early years on Facebook -- to sharing experiences in a way that previous generations might not be."" As opposed to a single new destination, alternate social usage has spread to a host of tools. In 2013, Snapchat, Instagram and Vine were all downloaded from Apple's app store more frequently than Twitter or Facebook. WhatsApp, the messaging tool that Facebook bought for $19 billion last month, has more than 450 million users worldwide. And Instagram, a photo-sharing network that feels more intimate than Facebook (despite being bought by Facebook), now has more than 150 million users. The most recent buzz coming out of Silicon Valley is small, anonymous social apps like Secret and Whisper. Those apps combine the joys of scandalous water-cooler gossip with the Internet's ability to keep us anonymous while we do it. You're still posting to your established social networks, but nobody knows which friend said what. That speaks to one reason some observers see a move to smaller social networks. Putting one's best foot forward -- particularly in a way that will please Mom and Dad, your co-workers, your drinking buddies and your high school pals all at once -- gets hard after a while. Last year, the Pew Research Internet Project conducted focus groups with teens who said they had become less excited about Facebook, ""disliking the increasing adult presence, people sharing excessively, and stressful 'drama.'"" The report noted, though, that few of them had stopped using the site altogether. In fact, those with the largest networks on Facebook (more than 600 friends) were also the most likely to retreat at times to other, smaller social media. Path, launched by former Facebooker Dave Morin in 2010, limits users to no more than 150 friends. (It was originally just 50.) The app hasn't fully lived up to the hype it received when it rolled out, and its growth has been hampered, in part, by privacy snafus early in its existence. But it has continued to chug along and now has more than 25 million registered users. (The company has not given out more detailed information, including the number of those users who are active.) Morin's theory for the app was based on research by Oxford University psychologist and anthropologist Robin Dunbar. Dunbar opined that our brains only have the ability to maintain 150 stable relationships. Anything above that, and the relationship becomes more superficial. ""Some social media sites have become so large that, ironically, the social component is now lacking,"" said Itai Himelboim, a University of Georgia telecommunications professor who studies the role of social media in news and politics. ""One cannot maintain relationships with more than a couple of dozens of friends, online or offline."" For many, sites like Facebook and Twitter have become ""personal broadcast tools"" that allow them to inform big groups about events in their lives, but not really share much, he said. ""Smaller social media spaces, especially specific to an area of interest or a skill, can become an alternative, where users can create a manageable social network, where they can invest in interpersonal relationships,"" said Himelboim, who teaches a course in social media analytics. Some people have reported fatigue from the effort required to maintain their social presences on big sites. ""Twitter and Facebook ... are like giant auditoriums where we put on 'public performances.' And those have grown exhausting,"" Brian Moore, co-founder of Cloak, a privacy app, told CNN. ""That's why Snapchat felt so refreshing."" Snapchat lets users exchange photo-based messages that disappear after a few seconds, easing the pressure some feel to compose posts that will be widely liked and shared. That's a topic author and marketing consultant Jay Baer was tackling back in 2011, around the time the ""small social"" surge was starting. In a piece titled ""Social Media, Pretend Friend and the Lie of False Intimacy,"" he quoted social media buzz phrases like ""Social media makes a big world smaller"" and ""LinkedIn is for people you know, Facebook is for people you used to know, Twitter is for people you want to know."" ""All of these chestnuts are passed around like a flu strain because they make intuitive sense,"" Baer wrote. ""But common among them is the underlying premise that interacting with more people is inherently better than interacting with fewer people. I have always believed this to be true, and in fact have delivered the lines above in presentations and on this blog. But today, I'm no longer convinced.""","In the Facebook age, many users are turning to smaller social media .

"London (CNN) -- Violence isn't always physical -- and UK Home Secretary Theresa May's recent announcements on all things extradition fell one after another as devastating blows to an already beaten and broken Muslim community. The extraditions of five Muslim men to the United States on October 5 followed by the blocking of computer hacker Gary McKinnon's extradition this week has made the Muslim communities of the UK wake up to a glaring reality many tried hard to avoid. It is something other communities in the UK have lived and understood for decades. Some Muslims have taken the beatings, repeated anti-terror laws, stops and searches, detentions without charge, demonization of beliefs and values, denigration of the personalities and principles most loved by us, and unrelenting social discrimination -- often believing that by showing more love they will somehow change the attitude of their aggressor. Campaigners against the extradition of some of the men waved Union flags at protests and called on a concept of citizenship, that clearly wasn't shared by the powers that be. Others have called out state and institutionalized racism for what it is. Others still, left without good leadership have just tried to get by, aggrieved, but without outlet for their legitimate concerns, pariahs in a society whose legal system has been exported worldwide through colonial endeavor, and continues to oppress in the name of freedom and now human rights. This may sound overly angry, but it captures a new mood -- one that has been a long time coming. The differences in treatment are so stark and spring from long-rooted (mis)representation of all things Muslim. The British media discussed ad infinitum the violation of Gary McKinnon's human rights by the proposed extradition, but when the Muslims were extradited all discussion revolved around why it took so long. There is no doubt that McKinnon and his family have suffered inordinately and very few in the UK would begrudge the decision to block his removal to the USA. But, as the families of all those awaiting extradition will testify, it is a shared experience. While McKinnon was granted bail during his decade-long ordeal, Abu Hamza al-Masri, Khaled al-Fawwaz, Adel Abdul Bary, Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan endured from six to 14 years in prison without charge. They suffered too, as did their families, yet they are rarely named. On the day of their final legal challenges, all reporting focused on the case of ""Abu Hamza and four others."" Abu Hamza, for many years an exemplar caricature for most of the stereotypical attributes of Muslims, is the poster boy for successive governments' capitulation of sovereignty and equality in the UK-U.S. extradition treaty of 2003. Demonization of Muslims preceded 9/11, in the UK as elsewhere. IHRC is just one of many organizations, academics, journalists highlighting anti-Muslim bias and depictions in everything from news media to literary classics, through Hollywood movies and even Bridget Jones. The normality of such depictions -- violent men, compliant highly sexualized oppressed women, irrational beliefs and exotic behavioural codes have had serious impact. The extradition of Talha Ahsan and the reprieve of Gary McKinnon are just two of the products of this process. As one of the ""four others"" it has mattered little that Talha Ahsan's case has more in common with Gary McKinnon's than Abu Hamza's, except that McKinnon admitted he did hack into the Pentagon's computers, whereas Ahsan denies guilt of the cybercrimes he is accused of. Both suffer from Asperger's Syndrome, both were assessed as a suicide risk, one is seen to have his human rights violated by the extradition treaty, while in the other it is clear he is not deemed to be human. In short, the one word answer to the question ""Why Talha, not Gary?"" Racism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arzu Merali.","UK extradited 5 Muslims to U.S. on Oct. 5, but let computer hacker Gary McKinnon stay .

"(ArsTechnica) -- Even a watered-down version of the law couldn't pass muster: San Francisco's ordinance requiring retail outlets to inform consumers about the (alleged) effects of cell phone radiation has been blocked by a federal judge. Upon passage, San Francisco's ordinance was challenged by industry trade group CTIA-The Wireless Association, which claimed the ordinance's requirement that retailers post messages about cell phone safety violated the First Amendment. San Francisco initially agreed to amend the ordinance after the CTIA filed suit, and made some changes, but they weren't enough. Judge William Alsup found that the ordinance failed the sniff test on both scientific and First Amendment grounds. ""Whether or not cell phones cause cancer is a debatable question and, at this point in history, is a matter of opinion, not fact. San Francisco has its opinion. The industry has the opposite opinion,"" wrote Judge Alsup. The fact-sheet required by the ordinance is ""misleading and must be corrected,"" notes the judge. ""Although each factoid in isolation may have an anchor in some article somewhere, the overall message of the fact-sheet (and the poster, for that matter) is misleading by omission in two important ways. The overall impression left is that cell phones are dangerous and that they have somehow escaped the regulatory process."" The World Health Organization issued a report that seemingly butressed San Francisco's position in May when it labeled cellphones ""possibly carcinogenic,"" meaning that there is ""limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals."" But results of a massive, 15-year-long study released earlier this month showed absolutely no link between cellphone use and cancer, echoing the findings of numerous other studies. The judge left the door open to the possibility that a revised ""fact sheet"" could pass muster and stayed the enforcement of the law until November 30 so that both sides can file appeals. San Francisco has already promised to do exactly that. COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM .","CTIA contests ordinance for consumers to be informed about cell phone radiation hazards .

"(CNN) -- A rebel group now in control of a key city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo announced Wednesday that it plans to ""liberate"" the entire country. CNN iReport: Desperate situation as families flee, says charity . A spokesman for the rebel M23 group said its successful operation to take Goma on Tuesday, the culmination of several days of heavy fighting against government forces, was just the beginning. ""We will push on to Bukavu, then Kisangani, and finally take Kinshasa and overthrow the government,"" Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarama said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred at Goma's stadium, according to a Congolese reporter there. Kazarama said that once the rebels overthrow the government, they will call for elections. Rebels seize control of Goma amid clashes in Democratic Republic of Congo . Kinshasa, the country's capital, lies nearly 1,000 miles to the west of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. On Wednesday, M23 consolidated its control of Goma, calling on policemen and the remaining government soldiers in town to integrate with the rebel group. Activity started to return to normal, with shop owners restarting their businesses -- some after closing their doors for several days because of the tense situation. M23 has called on schools and banks to reopen as early as Thursday. The front line, according to the rebel fighters, has moved to the west of Goma, to Mugunga. The U.N. special representative for DR Congo, Roger Meece, briefed the U.N. Security Council on the ""extremely serious crisis"" in North Kivu by video link from Kinshasa on Wednesday. ""The security situation in North Kivu as well as in other areas in the east of Congo has seriously deteriorated over recent days, and this is compounded by a vast humanitarian crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of Congolese citizens,"" Meece said. He also warned that violent protests against the Congolese authorities, as well as U.N. facilities and its staff, might spread to other parts of the country. The M23's occupation of Goma and another nearby town, Sake, had been in the face of ""significant resistance"" by the Congolese army, supported by MONUSCO, the U.N. mission in DR Congo, he said. The rebels were initially held in check but were able to come back with ""sophisticated tactics,"" he said, with their capabilities apparently bolstered by ""external support."" ""As we have seen in other areas occupied by M23, the occupation of Goma also poses a major risk of increased serious human rights violations, including killings and forced conscription of civilians, including minors,"" Meece said. The United Nations has already received numerous reports of targeted summary executions of those who try to stand in the rebels' way, he said, and there is an increased threat of sexual violence. Meece said he believed it was possible to roll back the rebels' gains and restore stability, but only with a strong commitment from the international community. The U.N. Security Council backed a resolution Tuesday calling for sanctions against the rebel leadership and ""those providing external support to the M23."" The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation. CNN iReporter Aimee Manimani, an aid worker with humanitarian group World Vision, told of her grief as renewed violence in Gisenye, just outside Goma, forced her to flee across the border to Rwanda. ""Yesterday, when I heard the sounds of the bombs and mortar, I just got depressed. I started crying. I couldn't control myself. I had to leave home again,"" she said. ""Like most of my Congolese, I feel humiliated by everything that we are forced to go through. I feel disgusted to leave everything behind and flee ... We had a normal life; we could face poverty and many other difficulties; we could manage all with the hope that everything will be fine one day. ""But now we must flee. Parents and children have to hide under the bed, in the bushes or wherever they would feel safe. Now thousands of parents can't even protect their children ... this makes me very sad."" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that the United States was ""gravely alarmed by the rapid deterioration of the security situation in eastern DRC"" and that it supported the U.N. Security Council's call for additional sanctions against the M23 and its backers. Security analysts say the rebellion in eastern DR Congo has dangerous regional implications, including the risk that it could lead to renewed conflict with neighboring Rwanda. Civilians are also suffering, observers say. Though 1,500 United Nations peacekeeping troops are in Goma and have control of the airport there, a U.N. spokesman said late Tuesday that the situation is at a ""critical stage."" ""Reports indicate that the M23 has wounded civilians, is continuing abductions of children and women, is destroying property and is intimidating journalists and those who have attempted to resist their control,"" said Eduardo del Buey, the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general. A total of 6,000 troops from MONUSCO are in the wider region of North and South Kivu, patrolling areas of particular insecurity, del Buey said. The United Nations, the African Union and countries in the region are demanding that M23 immediately stop its attacks, del Buey said. France and Britain also expressed their concerns Tuesday. The British Foreign Office said its minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds, was traveling to Rwanda, DR Congo and Uganda to support efforts to end the crisis. The eastern part of DR Congo, which includes Goma, has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide. Soldiers from the M23 group were part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009. They broke away from the Congolese army in April, however, complaining of a lack of pay and poor conditions. Tens of thousands of Congolese, already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region, have fled camps around the edges of Goma, according to UNICEF and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. CNN's Christina Zdanowicz, Mick Krever and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NEW: U.N special representative for DR Congo warns of ""vast humanitarian crisis""

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will confront the profound impact of new location-tracking technologies on Americans' privacy. The case, U.S. v. Jones, presents the question of whether law enforcement needs a warrant before planting a GPS tracking device on a person's car. The answer to this question is important in its own right, but the case is likely to have broader implications. Attaching a GPS to a car isn't the only way the government can track people's movements. In fact, everyone with a cell phone is already carrying a device that the government can use to track his or her location. As a result, the principle at stake in this case may well shape our privacy rights in the years and decades to come. The police in the current case suspected Antoine Jones of drug violations and tracked his movements continuously for one month by installing a GPS device on his car. Increasingly, though, law enforcement agents are tracking our movements by tracking the cell phones that most people are already carrying around. It doesn't matter whether your phone is a smartphone or whether you use it to make calls; as long as your phone is turned on, it registers its location with cell phone networks several times a minute, and all U.S. cell phone companies hold on to that data, some of them for years. This kind of tracking is extremely invasive, because if the government knows where you are, it knows who you are. As the Jones appellate court explained in its ruling that the government violated the Fourth Amendment, ""A person who knows all of another's travels can deduce whether he is a weekly churchgoer, a heavy drinker, a regular at the gym, an unfaithful husband, an outpatient receiving medical treatment, an associate of particular individuals or political groups -- and not just one such fact about a person, but all such facts."" Cell phone tracking can reveal our private associations and relationships with one another. The government could make note of whenever people being tracked crossed path or spent time together, showing who our friends, associates and lovers are. The Justice Department sometimes gets warrants to track location, and some local police departments make it a policy, which shows that it's not an unworkable requirement. But state and federal judges across the country have made conflicting rulings on what standards are required for the government to obtain tracking information from cell phone companies. New technology provides the government with a powerful and inexpensive tool to follow individuals as they travel through both public and private areas. Unless the court concludes that such tracking requires a warrant, anyone's movements could be subject to remote monitoring and permanent recording at the sole discretion of any curious police officer, without any judicial oversight. And while it may not be realistic to think that the government will install a GPS device on every car, it's not at all implausible to think that the government will ask cell phone providers to turn over location-tracking information en masse -- and it may well be the case that the government is doing so already. It was revealed last month that the London police have a system that lets them track hundreds of phones in real time in a targeted geographic area, a technology that could easily enable the government to identify everyone at an Occupy protest, tea party rally or any other political gathering. The genius of the Constitution is that its limits on the government can still be applied in a modern world that the framers could scarcely have imagined. Anyone who values privacy should hope that the Court ensures the government cannot use technological advances to undermine the liberties this country was founded on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Crump.","Should law enforcement need a warrant before planting a GPS tracking device on a car?
Yes, the Supreme Court ought to decide that they should, says Catherine Crump .
The principle at stake in a current case may well shape our privacy rights, she says .
All of us can already easily be tracked through our cell phones, Crump says ."
"(CNN) -- This week, I had the chance to sit down and speak to Joel Osteen, pastor of Lakewood Church, the largest church in America. If you don't immediately recognize the name, you will certainly remember his perfectly coiffed thick head of hair, megawatt smile and most of all his optimism, which I would best describe as indefatigable. You feel good just being around a guy like him. I did. If you watch him closely during the interview, you will often see him look up to the sky when answering a question. While I know many people who have difficulty maintaining eye contact, that wasn't the case for Osteen. Instead, it almost appeared as if he was seeking out some divine inspiration for the answers to the questions I was about to ask him. We covered a lot of ground. Despite what you see on television, Osteen does have bad days. He has found that the start of any day will determine what kind of day you are going to have. So, he spends a few moments every morning thinking of all the things for which he is grateful. He also cleanses out the negative thoughts, from ""I am not talented, and nothing good is in my future,"" to ""I am a person of destiny, headed for greatness."" He also took time to remind me that ""sacrifice"" around the holidays will be rewarded. We were talking about the festive nature of the season, but also the particular challenges for people in the sandwich generation -- those taking care of their children and their parents. ""We're not always going to have our loved ones,"" said Osteen, whose father passed away in 1999. It was powerful stuff, and it made us both just a little misty-eyed. It immediately conjures up images of your own parents and their mortality. Dr. Gupta: Saving Emma in the storm . Listening to all Joel Osteen has to say, of course you will agree with him, despite the fact he doesn't often take a stance on hot-button issues, instead deferring to God as the ultimate decision-maker. Surely, these are not new messages, but they do need frequent reminding and refreshing, especially when times are tough. It was the next topic, however, that I really wanted to explore with Joel: the intersection between faith, science and healing. He started by telling the story of his own mother, Dodie Osteen, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer back in 1981. She was told ""there was no treatment that could be given to her."" It was liver cancer, and she was just 48 years old. Osteen told me, ""She prayed, she believed, and she quoted scripture. Thirty-something years later, she's alive."" Osteen is describing a sort of faith healing or at least the power of prayer, and it is an issue that deeply divides the medical community. According to Gallup polls, 92% of Americans believe in God. And 80% believe in the power of God or prayer to improve the course of their illness. We know that many people turn to God during times of illness, either in public or private. It is a profoundly human response, but also based on belief in some mechanism that we can't explain. Critics worry that studying prayer relies on the assumption of supernatural intervention, which will always place it outside the realm of science. At its worst, they say, people may rely solely on prayer instead of proven, effective treatments. It is not that science hasn't tried to prove and even describe the impact of prayer on healing. A review of nearly 50 studies involving 125,000 people showed those with low levels of religious involvement had odds of early mortality that were 1.29 times higher than for those with high levels of religious involvement. Religious groups such as Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists and Amish have lower rates of heart disease and cancer. Dr. Gupta: Better health not about Obamacare, it's about you . There has also been a fair amount of research into the mechanism of psychoneuroendocrinology, the relationship between psychology, endocrinology and neuroscience -- in other words, the interactions between the mind, hormones and brain. That could account for the results Herbert Benson cites about the positive impact of prayer on heart disease. Part of the conflict for the medical community is that many of the studies show variable results even within the same groups of people. Critics worry aloud that you simply can't make prayer consistent -- or ever ""dose"" it like a medicine. When it comes to the power of prayer, though, proponents and critics do find some common ground. They both cite evidence that when it comes to our health, prayers and faith may have less to do about God than it does with optimism overall. It's the same optimism that Osteen embodies. It may have more to do with the resulting social network, improved coping skills and health activities promoted by many churches. We are more comfortable explaining the impact on health by remembering that religious people are less likely to engage in smoking and alcohol abuse. They are more likely to inquire about each other's health and remind their loved ones to get checked out. While writing this, I realized it is quite possible we will never have the answers we want, because the intersection between religion and science can never be fully explored. That would require trying to ""reduce it to basic elements than can be quantified, and that makes for bad science and bad religion,"" according to Dr. Richard Sloan, author of the book ""Blind Faith."" It doesn't mean, however, that we will stop trying. This intersection will capture our imagination as human beings as long as we are around. I did want to point out one of the more remarkable findings in a study from the American Heart Journal on this topic. It showed people were more likely to suffer complications if they knew someone was praying for them. Go ahead, read that sentence again. No matter your point of view, how do you explain that? Nobody knows for sure, but it could be that those people didn't typically have prayer or faith in their daily lives, and only relied on it when things had become particularly bleak or desperate. They may have thought, ""I must be close to death,"" if they were now resorting to prayer. When I asked Osteen about that, he immediately nodded and agreed with that explanation. But he immediately reminded me, that is the nature of faith -- the belief that it will work -- and the benefits of that optimism flow from it. It turns out that truly understanding optimism and relying on it to help you during tough times requires practicing it on a daily basis, and that may be the most important message Joel Osteen gives us this holiday season.","Many people turn to God during times of illness .

"(CNN) -- From the conversations you've had, what is your sense about how Iraqis feel about the prospect of any greater U.S. involvement? Nic Robertson: They're divided. Certainly on the Sunni side, in Anbar province and among the tribes that are supporting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, they would see it as the Americans backing the Shia. That wouldn't put the Americans in a very good position to play a mediating type of role, although it would be different if, through American influence, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was replaced by someone who was more tolerant and less sectarian. Here in Baghdad, if you go and talk to the guys who are being recruited and who are volunteering to join the Shia militias, they are happy to have American support for their government. And there was perhaps a week ago more of a fear that ISIS might arrive in Baghdad and that they really needed to be stopped in their tracks. But I would also say that there's caution, because everyone knows what American involvement looks like here. For example, one Sunni politician we talked to said that if the Americans come in, they would have to put right what they did wrong last time. What they mean is they left a sectarian leader in charge of the country, so if there's any chance of keeping Sunnis onside if there are airstrikes against ISIS, then it will have to involve getting rid of al-Maliki. The Americans have got to be seen to be giving something to both sides, if you like. What kind of support is al-Maliki seeing in Baghdad? Robertson: It depends who you ask. He has taken a tough line, and a lot of people in the Shia community are answering the call to stand up and join the fight against ISIS. But I think if you asked most moderate, middle-class people, and certainly anyone in the Sunni community, they would say that he isn't a guy for the future. They say that the way al-Maliki has responded thus far to the crisis -- one that many people feel he created through sectarian policies -- has further alienated the Sunnis he should be trying to build bridges with. Have you seen many visible signs around Baghdad of a city preparing for a possible assault? There was talk last week of Baghdad being a target for militants -- how fortified does the city appear? Robertson: The area has been fortified for some time. It's kind of like it was when I was here in 2007, 2008, 2009, back when it started to get more heavily fortified. I would say there are perhaps even a few more checkpoints than back then -- there are certainly a lot of checkpoints at all the main roads, all the main intersections, every few hundred yards. Victoria Eastwood: Yes, as you're driving along the roads, at virtually every street corner there's a man in a uniform sitting there with a gun. The other thing that's quite noticeable is how many blast walls there are -- these very high concrete walls that are outside people's houses, or across roads. And you'll see someone's house, but it's surrounded by barbed wire and high walls. Robertson: The other thing we experienced just today was when we were driving down the street by the river, and we saw an army patrol. And they will just suddenly close that street you are driving on, so you have to go another way -- there's no way to talk them out of it. So street closures come at random. What has it been like trying to report from Baghdad, on the street? Robertson: The hardest thing for us has even been getting permission to film on the street. We've been here for a week and we're still trying to get that permission. As a Westerner in Baghdad you stand out very clearly when you're on the street, and you attract a lot of attention with a camera. So unless you have permission to be using it, you will be shut down very quickly. Hundreds of thousands of residents from cities like Mosul that have come under siege from militants have been fleeing the violence. Where are they going? Is the government offering any provision for the internally displaced? Robertson: The government not so much, it seems, and we don't see this so much in Baghdad. Most of the people that fled out of Anbar have found accommodation with families, friends and others that have taken them in. They are very dispersed -- it's not like they have collected in a particular area. The people that have just fled out of Mosul, for example, have mostly fled to the Kurdish region where it's safer and where there are displacement camps being set up. But in Baghdad, even though the fighting is only about a 45-minute drive northeast of the city, people fleeing Baquba, for example, aren't arriving here in perceptible numbers. Eastwood: We just did an interview with someone from the (International Committee of the Red Cross) office, and what he said is that what happens for people in Baghdad who have been internally displaced from areas where there is fighting is that they get brought into their ethnic communities -- they are seeking shelter in these places because they feel safer, rather than necessarily going to NGOs. Many are seeking sanctuary in their ethnic neighborhoods, and these are very closed neighborhoods. How optimistic are people here that Iraq can be prevented from falling apart as a unified nation? Do Iraqis you speak to care whether the country ends up being divided? Robertson: I think people want to be safe. I think the Kurds, for example, have been able to take advantage of the situation and have taken control of the last big town that is important to them, Kirkuk, and they have no intention of giving it up. So I think whatever the Iraq is of the future, the Kurds are going to want the Kurdish region, which has had some autonomy, to have even more autonomy and greater separation from Baghdad. I think as the sectarian tensions rise -- and you've already been seeing this over the past decade -- you will have, as Victoria just said, people fleeing to their communities. And this means you're going to have even more sectarian division -- the fault lines are opening up over sectarian lines. And at the moment there's no indication that this government has the ability to roll back wholesale the gains by ISIS and the Sunnis. Anbar and Falluja are a prime example of that -- they took control of these places at the beginning of the year, and the government has been incapable of taking them back. It has basically just built very big checkpoints on the roads, essentially cutting them off. The government has just walled off connections to large Sunni areas. And that's probably quite symptomatic of the way this is likely to play out. But what this means is that any political compromise in the future is going to be short-lived, and may never be able to bring back the country to the way it was before. Eastwood: From what we've been told, people that can afford it are trying to leave the country. We have just done an interview with someone Nic has known for a very long time -- he has reported on her story, and that of her family, over the course of a decade. And in that time, her husband was shot dead in early sectarian violence, her daughter was kidnapped. She only managed to get her daughter back by kidnapping another senior militant who then allowed her daughter to be released. And yet despite all this, it's only now that she says she has had enough and that she sees no future for this country. Robertson: Her eldest daughter is a Shiite who is going to get married to a Sunni, and so they need to get to the Kurdish region so it is safe. Then they are planning to leave the country. She has been through hell. And now for her this is it -- there's no hope for the future of the country.","Iraqis are divided about greater U.S. involvement in their country .

"(CNN) -- The Segway. The Bluetooth headset. The pocket protector. What do these three technologies have in common? They all pretty much work as promised. They all seem like good ideas on paper. And they're all too dorky to live. Now, far be it from me to claim that nerdiness equals lack of popularity potential. But I contend that dorkiness and nerdiness are two different qualities. While nerdiness implies a certain social awkwardness that's ultimately endearing, dorkiness connotes social obliviousness that opens you to deserved ridicule. Guess which category Google Glass will fall under when it goes ""mainstream?"" Forget about the privacy concerns for a second. I don't think you have to get that serious to recognize the inherent antisocialness of Google Glass. All you have to do is look at the guy in the picture at the top of this post. Or any of the rest of the guys on White Men Wearing Google Glass, a new Tumblr that serves up the data needed to transform the hypothesis ""Google Glass is too dorky to succeed"" into a proven scientific theory. Disagree? The floor is open for falsification. Start your own Tumblr: People Who Look Cool While Wearing Google Glass. Before its release, some of the smartest people in tech predicted that the Segway would change the world. And even when the world joined in a collective ""Huh?"" when the much-hyped secret Ginger project was revealed to be a gyro-balanced scooter, the idea still kind of made sense. If we were all riding around on Segways now, cities would probably be better places to live compared to the car-infested streets we still endure. But that transformation hasn't happened. And it won't. Why? Because Segways are lame. They're too rational. They fail to acknowledge all the irrational reasons people love their cars. Similarly, Google Glass fails to acknowledge that walking around with a camera mounted on the side of your face at all times makes you look dorky. Think of the Bluetooth headset: it's a really sensible way to use your phone without having to take it out of your pocketâ€”so sensible that there's really no reason not to keep that headset in your ear most of the time. But you don't, do you? There's a reason that Saturday Night Live put a Bluetooth headset on Jason Sudeikis in its recurring ""Two A-Holes"" sketches. Google Glass, like the Segway, is what happens when Silicon Valley spends too much time talking to itself. Maybe that's even overstating the case: The rhetoric around Google Glass is what happens when important tech people spend a little too much time congratulating each other. There's really nothing wrong with Google Glass as a technological experiment. The future will include some kind of wearable smart technology, and it's important for Google to be experimenting in that direction. But Google co-founder Sergey Brin's presentation at TED, in which he characterized wearing Google Glass as somehow more macho than pulling your smartphone out of your pocket, underscores the tone-deafness that can envelop Silicon Valley when VIPs get a little too excited about the Next Big Thing. Brin, after all, is a guy who thinks nothing of engaging in spontaneous yoga in the middle of a crowded tech conference. This isn't a bad thingâ€”on the nerd to dork scale, it definitely tilts toward ""nerd."" But if you're one of the shareholders helping to keep Google's shares trading above $800, the dork factor of Google Glass should give you pause. Google is still trying to crack the secret of monetizing mobile technology, which so far hasn't proven as lucrative as its desktop search business. Google Glass may be a fun experiment in building another mobile platform to attract as-yet-unimagined revenue streams. But making money on consumer technology requires that consumers embrace that technology. If Google Glass makes you look as cool as the guys in that Tumblr, that embrace is about as likely to happen as you hugging a Segway. Or Robert Scoble in the shower.

"(CNN) -- Deep in my heart, I do believe that we shall overcome someday: This is the refrain that guided the hearts and hands and voices of the '60s generation. At the LBJ Library, April 8-10, the Civil Rights Summit will begin -- the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the great 1960s civil rights laws. It was legislation that changed America forever and for the better. There were four great laws, each building upon the other. The 1964 Civil Rights Bill, also known as the Public Accommodations Act, ensured that people of color could use the same water fountains, toilets, public transport and seats in restaurants and hotels as white people. The 1965 Voting Rights Act ensured people of color the right to vote. The 1968 Fair Housing Act made it possible for people of color and all religions to be able to buy a house where they could afford to. The 1968 Immigration Act eliminated racial and ethnic quotas. These laws opened the doors of liberty and justice for all as never before. No matter how imperfect they were, they made ours a more just society. For me it was all so very personal. My father, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act on my 17th birthday. The only handwritten note I have from my father was his birthday letter written at 12:10 p.m. that day. Daddy didn't have time to go to the pharmacy to buy a Hallmark card. At 6 p.m., he was signing a bill into law that would liberate my generation from the shackles of legalized apartheid. It was the best birthday present anyone could ever receive. Many doubt 1964 Civil Rights Act could pass today . When I questioned why he gave the first pen used to sign the bill to the Republican leader Sen. Everett Dirksen instead of one of the great civil rights leaders, he shook his head in disappointment that I hadn't gotten the obvious lesson. He told me, ""Luci Baines, I didn't have to convince one of the great civil rights leaders to be for that legislation. They were already for it. But because of Everett Dirksen's decision to support this law and bring his supporters with him, the great civil rights leaders and I have a law, not just a bill. That's why Senator Dirksen got the pen. He deserved it."" When I questioned why we had gone to the Capitol Rotunda for the signing, Daddy shook his head in disappointment again. ""Luci Baines, we have to go to the Rotunda of the Capitol. ""There will be many brave men and women not returning to these hallowed halls because of their courageous stand for voting rights. And there are many brave men and women who will be able to serve here only because of the courage of this Congress. That's why we must go to the Rotunda to let the world know how grateful we are to this Congress."" I was on ""Daddy duty"" on August 6, 1965, and stood behind him in the Rotunda as he signed the Voting Rights Act into law. That day he taught me not only about the justice of the act; he taught me the importance of his favorite biblical passage, ""Come, let us reason together."" These lessons of social justice have changed our country forever, for the better, although their work is far from done. The lessons of coming and reasoning together remain a cry we need to answer now more than ever. It was all so very personal. I grew up in Washington in an area fondly known as ""Hanukkah Heights."" We lived in ""Hanukkah Heights"" because there were no restrictive covenants as there were in other areas that discriminated against buyers based on their color or religion. My first employer and forever friend was one of the first Jews able to buy a home in what had been a restricted neighborhood. The Fair Housing Act was not just a bill for justice to me. It was all so very personal. There are 25 members in my immediate family. We are of mixed race, mixed ethnicities, many nationalities. We are Catholics, Protestants, Jews and others. We are a family of immigrants with all the diversity that Lyndon Johnson celebrated. At the head of the stairs in the LBJ Library is one of my favorite quotes of my father. ""Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact."" Much was accomplished when our nation ""came and reasoned together."" But there are still laws that make it harder for the poor to have access to the voting booth. And there are laws that still exist that bar equality based on whom you love. There remains much to be done. Generations of Johnsons are so grateful that four presidents are coming to the LBJ Library to celebrate this Civil Rights 50th anniversary with a new generation committed to social justice. It is our hope that by coming and reasoning together once more, we can renew our commitment to making ours a country ""blind to color, where education is unaware of race and opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins."" Only then will our proclamation for emancipation become a fact. Only then will we overcome the bondage of social injustice that hurts us all. But with a new renewal to the needs of social justice, I do believe, deep in my heart that we shall overcome someday!","Civil Rights Summit April 8-10 at LBJ Library honors 50th anniversary of civil rights laws .

"(CNN) -- From India to Las Vegas, superstitious lovebirds and numbers geeks are reveling in a once-in-a-lifetime event: the date 12/12/12. Sure, it might be just another set of numbers for some. But unlike the past 11 years, this will be the last such triple date for almost a century -- until January 1, 2101. That means one last chance for couples to get hitched on such an easy-to-remember wedding date (read: anniversary date). Those tying the knot at the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel have 40 different 12/12/12 wedding packages to choose from. Six of those options include an Elvis impersonator. Others include pirate, gangster and gothic themes. ""Besides a traditional wedding, the most popular is Elvis in a pink Caddy, where Elvis drives the couple down the aisle in a pink Cadillac,"" said general manager Brian Mills, who doubles as an Elvis impersonator. From midnight to midnight, more than 100 couples will walk or ride down the aisle at Viva Las Vegas. That's more than 10 times the number of couples who get hitched there on a typical Wednesday in December, Mills said. ""The charismatic and fun-loving couple that gets married on a 12 day is lucky and balanced, but seeking constant goals to achieve,"" the chapel's website explains. ""The 'go-getting' 1 and the 'sensitive' 2 make this a very balanced number. ""1 is the vibration of 'new beginnings' and starting things afresh. The 2 vibration is about seeking 'balance' and that's certainly something that many will struggle with -- balancing the bank balance, balancing the food and beverage intake, balancing the emotions ... balancing in every way."" For professional numerologists, 12/12/12 isn't just a cool repetition of digits or a lucky day for lovers. It's a fantastic day to start a new business venture or make a significant purchase, Indian numerologist Swetta Jumaani said. According to numerology, 12 is considered a ""three"" number because the digits add up to three. And three is a very good number because it corresponds with the largest planet, Jupiter, in addition to wealth. (In case you're wondering, Jumaani says the No. 1 ""planet"" is the sun, and the No. 2 ""planet"" is the moon.) ""If you're in a business of trading money, or the buying and selling of anything, (Wednesday) is a good day to make investments,"" Jumaani said. ""If you want to buy something -- property, if you want to buy gold -- it'd be a good day."" But Wednesday is a terrible day to wear black, she said. ""Black is a very inauspicious color. Something bad always happens."" Halfway across the world in Alabama, Kiam Moriya will turn 12 on 12/12/12 -- at exactly 12:12 p.m., AL.com reported. ""It's like one minute out of a whole lifetime,"" Kiam told the news site. ""You know, it's all 12s."" Wednesday also marks a milestone for the Vatican, where Pope Benedict XVI sent his first official tweet to the world. It's unclear whether the pope chose 12/12/12 for the digits or for some other reason. But more than 600,000 followers waited to see what message @Pontifex would offer in 140 characters or less. Despite the weddings, superstitions and inaugural papal tweet, underwhelmed Twitter users griped about all the brouhaha. ""Ladies and gentlemen, it's 12.12.12 and...... Nothing happened,"" Aazief Khalid of Malaysia tweeted Wednesday. And nothing like it will happen again for almost 100 years.

"(EW.com ) -- Neither the World Cup nor the Stanley Cup finals kept moviegoers out of the theater this weekend as a pair of box office newcomers both opened strong. ""22 Jump Street"" was the big winner, grossing an estimated $60 million its opening frame—a massive 65% higher than the original's $36.3 million in 2012. The bumbling cop duo of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum turned in the second-highest-grossing opening weekend for an R-rated comedy, ranking just below ""Hangover II"" ($85.9 million), but besting both ""Ted"" ($54 million) and ""Sex and the City"" ($57 million). ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" brought the heat as well, with an estimated $50 million opener. That's 14% above the original's opening gross of $43.7 million from 2010. The well-reviewed film from Dreamworks also earned an A Cinemascore from audiences and should hang on well as families flock to the movies over the next couple of weeks. In third place ""Maleficent"" only fell 45% despite the arrival of the dragons. The re-imagined fairy tale, which didn't score too high with critics but resonated with moviegoers, now has a three-week cume of $163.5 million. It even topped last weekend's two debuts, outgrossing the Tom Cruise-starrer ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" which lost only 44% of its traffic in its sophomore session, coming in at an estimated $16 million. (The film's strong reviews have surely helped it hold its value.) That puts its two-week total at an estimated $56.6 million. Then there's last weekend's top earner, ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" which saw its ticket sales drop by 67%. It earned an estimated $15.7 million for a 10-day total of $81.7 million. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" landed outside of the top five this weekend, yet with an additional $9.5 million, it surpassed the $200 million mark. Twentieth Century Fox is the big winner this weekend, with three of the six top movies belonging to the distributor. In limited release the Robert Pattinson, Guy Pearce-starrer ""The Rover"" performed strong, grossing $14,000 per theater for a $70,000 cume, proving that Pattinson is a draw outside the ""Twilight"" franchise. That said, the real test will come next weekend when distributor A24 expands the film nationwide. Here is how your top five looks this weekend. 1. 22 Jump Street — $60 million . 2. How to Train Your Dragon 2 — $50 million . 3. Maleficient — $19 million . 4. Edge of Tomorrow — $16 million . 4. The Fault in Our Stars — $15.7 million . Despite this being only the fourth time the box office has had two films grossing more than $50 million in their debuts, the overall yield was down 7% compared to the same weekend last year, when Man of Steel had a $116.6M debut and This is the End bowed to $20.7M. Yet the strength of these two openers (22 Jump Street also scored well with audiences, earning an A- Cinemascore) coupled with minimal drop-off from previous weeks' releases has done a lot to keep the summer box office happy and healthy.

"(CNN) -- If you think you were confused and challenged by the famously labyrinthine plot of ""Chinatown,"" imagine how the screenwriter felt. In ""Chinatown,"" Jack Nicholson played detective J.J. Gittes, whose nose has been slashed by some thugs. ""I did lose my way many times,"" said Robert Towne in a recent interview. ""It took an ungodly amount of time to work on it -- it was 10 months of solid work, and before that, there were several months of letting it gel enough to write it."" The process was worth it to Towne, however -- he walked away with an Oscar for best original screenplay, the only one the film received in a year mostly overrun by ""The Godfather Part II."" Director Roman Polanski's film, starring Jack Nicholson as a 1930s detective who gets in over his head with intertwined scandals of murder, sodomy and real estate development, has become a modern classic. The film, which receives a 35th-anniversary DVD edition October 6, is now hailed as one of the gems of the early-'70s Hollywood golden age: ""Masterful filmmaking from beginning to end,"" wrote Salon's Andrew O'Hehir in 2000. The film is No. 21 on the American Film Institute's 2007 list of the greatest American movies.  Towne talks about inspiration for location of film » . Despite being brightly lit, Towne says the film was always intended to be dark in tone. Polanski -- whose wife, Sharon Tate, was killed by the Manson Family and who insisted on its downbeat ending -- made it even darker. ""He certainly highlighted [the darkness] and made it very credible. I think that was a ... vital element to making the film work,"" Towne said. In the following exchange, which was conducted before Polanski's recent arrest over a 1977 rape charge, Towne talked about the development of the script, Polanski's sense of evil and why it was important to slap Faye Dunaway's character, Evelyn Mulwray, around. The screenwriter could not be reached for comment about Polanski's arrest. The interview, which does contain spoilers, has been edited and condensed. CNN: You wrote the role [of detective J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes] for Jack Nicholson. He'd worked with you before, as Buddusky in [the Towne-penned] ""The Last Detail."" What suggested him for this role, as a hard-boiled detective? Robert Towne: We were very close friends, and I think that his kind of insouciance suggested itself for a very cocksure detective who was cynical but with a hidden idealistic streak, who really thought he knew all the answers but in fact had no notion how evil somebody could be. CNN: This is famously part of an uncompleted trilogy about the development of Los Angeles -- this, ""The Two Jakes"" [made in 1990] and ""Cloverleaf."" Is ""Cloverleaf"" ever going to be made? Towne: Well, it actually wasn't called ""Cloverleaf."" I don't know where that came from. It was to be called ""Gittes vs. Gittes."" And Gittes was involved in his own divorce, as it were. CNN: The script is so intricate. How did you go about creating a script like this without losing your way? Towne: Well, I did lose my way many times. ... How to unfold [the] story took some trial and error, until I realized that the main thrust of the story should be following the water scandal and then the other [relationships] kind of bubbled up through it. ... There were lots of back stories that never made it to the film, but I think the suggestion of those made the narrative probably richer. CNN: There is always talk of how movies reflect their times, and this movie can be seen as reflecting Watergate. But it came out in '74 and was shot before that and was written before that, which dates it back to the late '60s and early '70s. Towne: That's right. But these things are in the air. There was ... that sense of the disparity between what you were told was happening and what was really going on. It was kind of natural. ... It was definitely something that was part of the past and part of the present at the same time, which I guess is serendipitous. Or maybe not serendipitous -- it's what led one to creating the story. CNN: Had you immersed yourself in [detective writers] Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett before doing this? Towne: Yes, I had. I hadn't actually read Chandler before I started doing it, but Chandler had a real love of Los Angeles -- or a love-hate relationship. And I absorbed that. On the other hand, his character Philip Marlowe -- the tarnished knight who wouldn't do divorce work and was very principled and not very concerned about his appearance -- led me to look for what a detective was really like. And the successful ones, like Freddie Otash and people like that, did nothing but divorce work. So while respecting the genre, I tried to bring to it a character who was a little bit different from the way characters like that had been dramatized. CNN: You talk about the love-hate relationship with Los Angeles. I'm wondering if Roman's view of Los Angeles, based on what had happened to him, brought an extra degree of darkness to the script? Towne: Well, that darkness was in the script, but he certainly highlighted it and made it very credible. ... He had a sense of evil, and [John Huston's tycoon character Noah Cross] was nothing if not evil. And between Huston and Roman, there was a level of belief in the fact that people were capable of things that most people at that time would not have imagined they were. CNN: How did ""My sister, my daughter"" [spoken by Cross' daughter, Evelyn Mulwray, as she's being slapped by Gittes] come about? Towne: I think it was part of the fact that we needed, in order for that confession to be credible, we needed to have it basically beaten out of her, because it was such a shameful confession.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Three Al Jazeera journalists were among eight who appeared at a hearing in a Cairo prison court Thursday, accused along with 17 other defendants of spreading ""false news"" and having links to the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt declared a terrorist organization in December. ""Tell her I love her. Big wedding when I get out,"" Al Jazeera English journalist Mohamed Fahmy told journalists in a message to his fiancee, appearing in high spirits on the first day of his trial, despite a worsening shoulder injury. Fahmy, a former CNN freelance producer, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group and airing false news about Egypt to give the impression of a civil war. A prosecutor has also charged Al Jazeera English correspondent Peter Greste, producer Baher Mohammed and 17 others. Al Jazeera said nine on the list were on its staff. The charges were read out Thursday as the case opened, but no evidence was read in open court. The prosecution had been expected to outline the evidence supporting the charges. The case against the journalists comes amid a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after the ouster of the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy. The accused have denied the allegations against them, with the journalists saying they were simply doing their jobs. On the stand at the police academy in the Tora Prison complex, Fahmy, Greste and Mohammed appeared with five others. ""We didn't even know their names until we met them here,"" Fahmy told reporters asking about their relationship with the other defendants. They include Anas El Beltagy, son of jailed Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed El Beltagy. His mother, Sanaa Abdel Gawad -- standing outside the court wearing a badge with a picture of his sister, who was killed in August -- said their arrest was ""a vendetta against his father."" Sohaib Saad, a student defendant claiming no relation to Al Jazeera, told reporters he was receiving ""repressive treatment"" at the Aqrab (Scorpion) Maximum Security Prison, including a ban on food and visits. Fahmy and Mohammed were originally in solitary confinement in that prison. In their new prison, the Tora Farm Annex, they share a cell with Greste, allowed one hour of outdoor time a day and no books. They complained that conditions inside are ""psychologically unbearable,"" but they remained defiant. ""If justice happens, we will be free soon,"" Greste said. Speaking in a metal cage and separated from journalists by rows of wooden benches and a line of police conscripts, his voice was barely audible. ""We need everyone's support,"" he said. Fahmy had to repeat his words in a louder voice. ""Tell my parents I love them,"" he said. Mohammed told journalists to tell his wife to stay away because she's pregnant. Along with other relatives of the defendants and other reporters, she stood outside the prison complex early Thursday morning with their two children. She and Fahmy's family couldn't get inside. 'It's just ridiculous' In an interview, Andrew Greste told CNN how he had visited his brother Peter in Egypt's notorious Tora prison. ""There was the ability to communicate,"" he said. ""I guess that's the only way we feel we can get through this: is trying not to get too bogged down in the emotions and the conditions that Peter is enduring, because that becomes paralyzing for us."" The family was shocked by what has happened, Andrew Greste said. ""I mean, a journalist of Peter's credibility, it's just ridiculous,"" he said. He said he had taken food and clothing into prison for his brother, since it was not provided by the state. Peter Greste, an award-winning journalist, was in Egypt only to cover for a colleague, his brother added. The Egyptian government has faced a tide of criticism about the case, from professional journalism organizations and human rights groups. Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, last month described the prosecution as a ""major setback for media freedom in Egypt."" He added, ""The move sends the chilling message that only one narrative is acceptable in Egypt today -- that which is sanctioned by the Egyptian authorities."" Apparent mix-up . The case relies on simmering sentiment against Al Jazeera TV, deemed biased to the Muslim Brotherhood. One lawyer told the court that there is a mix-up in investigations and other case documents between the Jazeera Mubasher Masr, banned by Egypt, and Al Jazeera English. ""Which Jazeera?"" the judge asked before taking notes. ""We believe that we have not been distorting Egypt's image at all,"" said Heather Allan, head of Al Jazeera English newsgathering, before the trial started. ""They said we fabricated footage before they even looked at my camera,"" Fahmy said. 'It is a matter of breaking the law' Salah El-Sadek, chairman of Egypt's State Information Service, said the Al Jazeera journalists did not have the proper legal documents to work in Egypt, creating suspicion about their activities -- although their reports aired nightly on TV. ""We have 1,100 correspondents and journalists accredited here, legally representing 200 agencies in this country,"" he told CNN. ""None of them have been exposed to that because none of them have broken the law. So it's not a matter of freedom of speech in this case. It is a matter of breaking the law."" The Al Jazeera network has said its employees were not accredited in the country but argues that is no excuse for imprisoning them. ""Lack of credentials is not a criminal offense. ... Usually you get a slap on the wrist and a walk to the airport,"" Allan said. Criticism from journalists . The case has put Egypt in the spotlight, further fueling criticism about freedom of expression and the challenges facing journalists. ""Egyptian authorities in recent months have demonstrated almost zero tolerance for any form of dissent, arresting and prosecuting journalists, demonstrators and academics for peacefully expressing their views,"" Human Rights Watch said in a prepared statement released Wednesday. The Committee to protect Journalists listed Egypt as third deadliest country for journalists in 2013. Journalists face deadly police force and violence by mobs on the street. ""Things are getting worse on so many levels,"" said Lina Attalah, chief editor of Mada Masr, which describes itself as an independent Egyptian news website. ""On a practical level, we are not able to do the job. But also on a formal censorship level, with the prosecutions that are politically motivated as we all know. It just makes us think that we can be targeted from any side and by any means."" The journalists' trial was a reminder of what awaits dissent or different voices, Attalah explained, and it has become an ""embarrassment"" to the state and the judiciary. But the chairman of Egypt's State Information Service disagrees about such a crackdown on dissent. ""Who said they are punished for criticizing the government? If you watch the private and even the formal or the governmental channels, you will find criticism that has been said about the government and its actions and it was way of running things more than we've ever had in our whole life,"" El-Sadek said. For others, the media has been almost unanimous in its support of the current military-led government, which is often blamed for fueling xenophobia and polarization to violent levels. International support . The trial has also garnered international solidarity with protests in Nairobi, London and other cities in support of Egypt's arrested journalists, not all of whom are included in this trial. Greste, Fahmy and Mohammed were happy to hear the news of such demonstrations. Fahmy raised his fist in the air in excitement. ""Wait until I get out,"" he shouted. The three have been in detention for more than 50 days. The procedural hearing was adjourned to March 5, to bring in prosecution witnesses, provide a translator for Greste and allow lawyers to acquire case documents. Evidence will be examined at the March hearing, and lawyers have requested an independent expert to examine the footage the prosecution said was edited to portray a false image. They praised the work of the Canadian and Australian embassies in Cairo but wanted the governments of these two countries to do more. 'They want to shut us up' Besides the three detained on December 29, a number of Al Jazeera journalists were charged in absentia. Among them is Briton Sue Turton, who has previously worked for Britain's Sky News, ITN and Channel 4. Speaking at a protest against her colleagues' detention in London, she said the Egyptian authorities' actions were an attempt to silence reporting of views opposed to theirs. ""Certainly we are one of the only channels in Egypt that's watched widely that gives very much an opposing view to the military-backed government,"" Turton said. ""The domestic media doesn't, the domestic press and TV doesn't. They want to shut us up, and the best way to do that is to arrest some of our people in the hope that that will stop others from reporting from there."" CNN is among the journalistic organizations that have signed a petition asking for the release of the Al Jazeera journalists, two of whom have worked for CNN. CNN's Sara Sidner reported in Cairo and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. Journalist Sarah Sirgany contributed to this report.","Three detained Al Jazeera journalists appear in court as their trial opens in Cairo .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The trial in Egypt of Al Jazeera journalists accused of terrorism-related offenses was adjourned Thursday until May 22. Correspondent Peter Greste, producer Mohammed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed have been in jail since December 29. Their request for bail has been denied. The three are charged with joining what the government says is a terrorist group -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- as well as broadcasting false information and working in Egypt without permits. The journalists -- who are among a number of people arrested, not all of them Al Jazeera staff -- have denied the allegations against them, saying they were simply doing their jobs. The lawyer for Fahmy told the Cairo court that the prosecution had asked the defense lawyers to pay 1.2 million Egyptian pounds ($169,000) to see five CDs containing alleged evidence against their clients -- but refused to give them an official document indicating such request. ""The actual cost of copying five CDs doesn't exceed 5 Egyptian pounds,"" lawyer Khaled Abu Bakr told the court. He told CNN that he has never come across such exorbitant fees. The judge ordered the prosecution to provide a document stipulating the fees. Apart from Abu Bakr, all the defense lawyers and defendants want final arguments to begin. Fahmy, who is a former CNN producer, told reporters that the prosecution is already stalling and won't present the evidence purported to be on the CDs. Other defendants in the case, not including the three Al Jazeera journalists, told reporters they had been beaten and intimidated in prison after the last court hearing, when they complained to journalists of torture and abuse. One of the defendants, Anas El Beltagy, son of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed El Beltagy, said he had been put in solitary confinement. Another, Khaled Abdel Raouf, who has been on hunger strike for 55 days, said he had had no access to medical care. The two lawyers representing Greste and Baher Mohamed quit the case Thursday, claiming in court that Al Jazeera was not concerned about the defendants and only wanted to tarnish Egypt's image. The lawyers were hired by Al Jazeera to represent the two journalists. Assem Ghorob, Mohamed's brother, told CNN that Al Jazeera has given assurances that the network will hire new lawyers for the case. ""It was weird what happened in court today,"" Ghorob said. ""I'm fine with getting new lawyers but I'm surprised the lawyers who quit criticized Al Jazeera in court. That could obviously hurt the case."" Human rights groups have criticized the trial, saying the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- On the stand for drug trafficking, Talina Prieto Vazquez tearfully insisted she didn't know that when her husband brought her to Hong Kong she would be taking part in one of the city's largest ever cocaine trafficking cases. Prieto Vazquez, 29, had been caught with 538 kilograms of cocaine (about 1,285 pounds), worth some $65 million. She was among a group of five Mexicans and one American - including her husband JosuÃ© Mario Bravo Galindo - that police arrested in Tuen Mun, northern Hong Kong, in September, 2011. Their three-year-old son was also taken into custody following the raid. ""My baby is the most important thing in my life,"" Prieto Vazquez said during her trial in May. The drug case highlighted the role Hong Kong plays as a staging post in a booming trade between Latin American drug producers and a growing illegal drug market in mainland China. Judge Gareth Lugar-Mawson, presiding over the case, said during the trial that the ""majority of that cocaine would most likely go out of Hong Kong into the mainland."" Authorities have seized increasingly larger illegal drug shipments over the past few years as the mainland's appetite for so-called luxury drugs like cocaine grows. Since the 2011 bust, Hong Kong's record was broken in 2012, with a 649 kilogram seizure, which was worth $98 million. While Hong Kong has strong sentences for drug trafficking, there is no capital punishment for offenders unlike in mainland China, making the city a favored transit post for drug traffickers, experts say. The number of smaller traffickers, called mules, has also sharply increased in local prisons. A year ago, 20 Colombians were caught at Hong Kong's borders carrying smaller amounts of narcotics on them. Since April 2012, the local consulate recorded 45 new arrests. Prieto Vazquez claims that hardship forced her family into the drug trade. During the two-week trial, her husband told the court he had gotten into a $35,000 debt with loan sharks in Mexico. Unable to repay and under threats of violence, he was offered the opportunity to ""work off"" the debt. ""I was told that I had to come to Hong Kong and, here, I'd receive further instructions,"" Bravo Galindo said from the witness stand. But it ended with the whole family in custody in Hong Kong, according to Prieto Vazquez' defense. Her husband was trying to deceive the police behind the faÃ§ade of a family tour, Prieto Vazquez' defense lawyer Keith Odeberg said in court. ""Bravo Galindo pressured [his wife] to come to Hong Kong and use [his family] as cover -- that was his secret agenda,"" Odeberg said in his closing statement, to justify his client's claim she didn't know about the narcotics. Prosecutor John Murray asked why their trip to Asia was to take seven weeks, as this would mean Prieto Vazquez would have needed substantial holiday time from her nursing assistant job in Mexico. Mexican law allows six to 12 days yearly paid leave for people at the beginning of their careers. Murray questioned the family's story during his cross-examination of Bravo Galindo. ""I'm going to put to (you) that you are lying,"" he told the 33-year-old witness. Bravo Galindo, through a Spanish translation, denied it. During her statements in court, Prieto Vazquez maintained her innocence. Authorities arrested her walking out of a warehouse in northern Hong Kong where hundreds of kilos of cocaine were found and six kilos of the drug were in her purse. ""I cannot prove that I didn't know there were drugs in my bag, but I will not give up, because God knows it and I didn't know anything,"" Prieto Vazquez insisted in court. The all-female jury, however, brought back a verdict of guilty. She was sentenced to 27 years in prison. Her husband, Bravo Galindo, received a lighter sentence for his guilty plea and was jailed for 24 years and eight months. Meanwhile, their toddler will be raised by relatives of the father in Mexico. He will spend time with different members of his family, but will not know a stable family life, Odeberg said in court.

"(CNN) -- Egyptian security forces have arrested four Al Jazeera journalists, with the government saying at least one of them met with members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Correspondent Peter Greste, Bureau Chief Mohamed Fahmy, producer Baher Mohamed and cameraman Mohamed Fawzy were taken into custody Sunday evening in Cairo, the network said. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said on its Facebook page that security forces arrested a Muslim Brotherhood member and an Australian journalist at a Cairo hotel. Greste, an Australian, previously worked for CNN, Reuters and the BBC. The ministry said the Muslim Brotherhood member used the hotel to meet with other members and as a media center to broadcast damaging news about the government for Al Jazeera. The network demanded the journalists be released. Calling the arrests arbitrary, Al Jazeera said the network ""has been subject to harassment by Egyptian security forces,"" including having its equipment confiscated and offices raided, despite the network not being banned from working in Egypt. The arrests occurred the day before the Committee to Protect Journalists issued a report saying Egypt, Syria and Iraq have become the deadliest countries for journalists. Seventy journalists were killed in 2013, with six of those deaths in Egypt, the CPJ said. Egypt's current round of political turmoil began when former President Mohamed Morsy was removed from office in a July 3 coup. Last week, the military-backed government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. Police and members of the Muslim Brotherhood have clashed in the streets since then.","NEW: Four Al Jazeera journalists were arrested, the network said .

"Pader, Uganda (CNN) -- Pauline Oto still wears her faded yellow and green school dress, but she hasn't been to school for years and she can't comprehend what to do with the pen the community nurse has just given her. ""Write on my hand,"" says the nurse. Pauline just sits on the reed mat, her legs pulled to one side, and stares. She has just had an attack and can't speak. She struggles to comprehend her surroundings. Pauline, 13, has been struck by the dreaded nodding disease. Her mother, Grace Lagat, says it will take her at least four hours to recover from the seizures, and after each attack she seems less like the daughter she remembers. ""Her personality has changed greatly from before. She was normal when they were born. Now she just moves around and serves no purpose,"" Lagat says. Pauline, like more than 3,000 other children in Northern Uganda, has been struck by the mysterious syndrome that has doctors and scientists puzzled and has shattered lives in this rural community. Nodding disease gets its name from the strange nodding-like symptoms that children display in the first stages of a seizure. But doctors on the ground and at the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that is the least profound effect. Severe epilepsy-like seizures grip the children, they struggle to eat, and they become shells of their former selves. It is a progressive and debilitating syndrome that robs children of their future. The seizures are triggered in strange ways, say community members, such as when unfamiliar food is brought to the children or when the weather changes. There are other bizarre symptoms. Often the children will wander off by themselves and get lost in the bush. And other children will start fires, according to parents and medics in the field. Others appear confused and traumatized. We were told that several houses in areas we visited had been burnt down by children suffering from nodding disease. More than 200 deaths have been reported from these 'secondary' incidents. Once, Pauline vanished for five days. Now, to protect her children Lagat ties them up when she leaves. She pulls Pauline and her brother, Thomas, who also suffers from nodding disease, inside her hut and ties them with a colorful, local fabric. First, she ties their legs to a wooden pole and then their hands together like handcuffs. Thomas tears at them with his teeth. ""When I am going to the garden, I tie them with cloth. If I don't tie them I come back and find that they have disappeared,"" she says. Liberia, Sudan, and Tanzania have all suffered outbreaks of nodding disease over the years, but it first came to the attention of Ugandan authorities in 2009. A team from the World Health Organization team visited the region of Gulu and Kitgum and noticed a high incidence of the disturbing symptoms. ""It was quite desperate, I can tell you,"" says Dr. Joaquin Saweka, the WHO representative in Uganda. ""Imagine being surrounded by 26 children and 12 of them showing signs of this. The attitude was to quickly find a solution to the problem."" Saweka and the Ugandan government mobilized teams from WHO, CDC, and local health teams. Right now there is no real solution. Nodding disease leads to epilepsy like symptoms, says the World Health Organization, but the cause is unknown and there is no cure. But there are clues. WHO officials say 93 percent of cases are found in areas also with the parasitic worm Onchocerca Volvulus, which causes river blindness and is carried by the Black Fly. And many cases show a deficiency in Vitamin B6. Nutrition also seems to play an important role. ""At first we cast the net wide. We ruled out three dozen potential causes and we are working on a handful of probabilities,"" says Dr. Scott Dowell, director of global disease detection and emergency response at CDC. While nodding disease hasn't triggered the response that, say, an outbreak of Ebola would, the CDC has conducted field investigations and extensive lab work, says Dowell. This outbreak in Uganda is confined to the north and is not believed to be contagious, but from a public health standpoint it still has to be taken seriously. ""We know from past experience an unknown disease could end up having more global implications,"" says Dr. Dowell. For Ugandan children in the region it is having massive implications. In the first three days of registering children at the Atanga health center in Pader district last week, more than 400 possible cases showed up. One extended family had seven children afflicted with Nodding Disease -- all of them severely stunted physically and mentally. Nodding disease seems to only affect children between 1 to 19 years, with the worst affected at ages 3 to 11, based on anecdotal evidence gathered by health workers. It is unclear how many fatalities have been caused by the disease itself, but its victims are left unable to function in any meaningful sense and profoundly dependent on others for care. And all this is in a region where many families suffered for decades from the brutality of the Lord's Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony, which abducted thousands of children and pushed civilians into mass camps. Almost every household in Pader district seems to be affected. We follow the nurse into cluster of huts, where another child, Francis, has just passed out. He lies in a pool of his own urine, saliva pouring out of his mouth, still twitching from the last affects of a seizure. The nurse tries not to touch him and doesn't want to take his pulse. There is just too much mystery surrounding the illness. ""I feel, because I don't know what causes it, I don't even know how it transmits, when I touch them I feel that I can also get the infection because I don't know what causes it,"" says Elupe Petua, a local nursing officer. So Francis is left alone. Only his mother, Agnes Apio, helps to clean him up with a bucket of water and waves away flies from his face. ""I feel dark in my heart. This boy has become nothing,"" she says. Francis can only move by dragging himself along the dirt, but she still ties him up when she leaves the homestead. ""Everyone is affected. In the household everyone and in the larger community setting the whole community is also suffering, trying to understand why them at this particular time,"" says Simon Anyanzo, of the Ugandan Red Cross. Doctors are using drugs for controlling epilepsy with some limited success. But they say it only slows the progression of symptoms, rather than stops them. After months of delay, Uganda did last week begin the drive to register cases. One health outpost in the Pader told CNN they hadn't received anti-epilepsy drugs for four months and they had been forced to turn away desperate families. Now the health center has received drugs, but they fear the high number of cases could overwhelm them. One local member of parliament was so desperate to get attention for the disease that in early March he transported 25 suspected cases by bus to Kampala for treatment at the country's main referral hospital. Uganda's health ministry says they are doing enough. They say they have switched to a more effective epilepsy drug and they are training local health workers to deal with the disease. Saweka says: ""People complain that it looks like the lives in developing countries have less value than the lives in the western countries. When you know the root cause, you address the cure. Now you are just relieving the symptoms. We don't expect to cure anybody.""","More than 3,000 children suffer in outbreak of mysterious nodding disease in Uganda .

"Cairo (CNN) -- An Egyptian judge on Monday said he would announce the verdict in the trial of three Al Jazeera journalists on June 23. The prosecution had argued that channels like Al Jazeera brought down Iraq and were planning to do the same in Egypt. One of the defendants, Al Jazeera bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, argued that ""a TV channel can't destroy a country."" He held up a copy of a book by U.S. President George W. Bush, then slammed it down on the judge's elevated desk, telling him he had ""underlined the parts in which Bush admits to invading Iraq based on misinformation."" The prosecution told the court in final statements on June 5 that the three Al Jazeera journalists' reports ""included footage of clashes between police and protesters, but why? In order to bring down the regime. But no, Egypt won't fall. Who added this footage? These defendants."" ""Mercy with these (defendants) leads to drowning, the drowning of the entire society in darkness,"" one prosecutor added, asking for the maximum sentence, which could go up to 25 years in prison. The three Al Jazeera journalists -- Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed -- face charges of spreading false news that harms Egypt's national security and social peace and having membership in an illegal organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. Seventeen others claiming no affiliation to the channel are facing similar charges. Only nine defendants are in custody. Since its start in February, the case has been entangled in domestic and world politics. In Fahmy's final statement to the judge, he said it was a political case. He has told journalists repeatedly that it was the result of a feud between Qatar and Egypt. The Qatari-owned channel backed the Muslim Brotherhood during the rule and after the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy last year. Its 2011 popularity plunged as supporters of the new regime saw it as a political adversary rather than an opposing network. National Security officer Ahmed Hussein, who did the initial investigation, told the court that the link between Al Jazeera and the Muslim Brotherhood was enough for him to consider the defendants to be members of a terrorist organization. The then-interim government declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization in December 2013, days before the arrest of the defendants. For five months, defense lawyers picked apart the case, stressing that the prosecution failed to provide hard evidence that the defendants altered facts or misrepresented reality, especially in a way that would endanger national security, social peace, and unity as the charges claim. When the prosecution first presented video footage and pictures it said were collected from defendants' devices and cameras in March, defendant Peter Greste told reporters he was angry ""that we spent two months in prison for such flimsy evidence."" Video footage and pictures, which were displayed twice again in court, included 2012 reports by Sky News Arabia, reports from Greste's original base in Kenya, and personal images and pictures of guns and ammunition, in addition to raw footage for some reports about demonstrations shot in Cairo. It also included photos and videos from Fahmy's work with CNN in 2011 and 2012. The requirements of a journalist's work were often at the center of the argument. Defense lawyers focused on questioning the procedure, starting with the initial investigation and up to viewing the evidence in court. They said the prosecution charges refer to a different Al Jazeera channel, Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr, which was banned by an Egyptian court. ""Once the officers made the arrest, they realized this was an English channel, rendering the investigations and everything that was built on it null and void,"" lawyer Shaaban Saeid told CNN. He was optimistic about the judge's decision to announce the verdict in a week, an unusually short period for a process that traditionally could extend to weeks and months. ""It means the judge doesn't need time to write reasons for a conviction,"" Saeid said. An acquittal could be on the horizon, but others are holding back their excitement, fearing the politicization of the case, and public opinion that doesn't view Al Jazeera favorably, could lead to a conviction. Later on Monday, in a separate case, Egypt's prosecutor ordered the release of Al Jazeera Arabic journalist Abdullah El-Shamy, arrested last August and on hunger strike since January, due to his deteriorating health condition. CNN's Ian Lee contributed to this report.","Three Al Jazeera journalists face charges in Egypt of spreading false news .

"(CNN)  -- A year ago, few outside of Wasilla, Alaska, had ever heard of Levi Johnston. All that changed last summer when Gov. Sarah Palin accepted the Republican vice presidential nomination. On ""Larry King Live"" on Wednesday, Levi Johnston talks about his relationship with the Palin family. Soon after she entered the national spotlight, it was learned the conservative governor's teenaged daughter, Bristol, was pregnant with Levi's baby. The Johnston-Palin family saga has been in the news ever since. In a ""Larry King Live"" exclusive interview Wednesday night, Johnston, along with his mother, Sherry, and sister, Mercede, talked about baby Tripp, why he's not seeing much of his son, what his legal intentions are and the Johnstons' ambiguous relationship with the Palins. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: How are you handling all of this attention? Levi Johnston: We've got people camped outside the house and in front of my sister's school and that kind of thing. It's pretty crazy. King: Are you surprised at it? Johnston: I lived back in a small town. So I mean I never thought that would ever happen to me. And when she [Sarah Palin] finally told, everybody that Bristol was pregnant and stuff, I didn't think it was going to get this rough. King: Did the Palin family seem close-knit? What was it like for you dating in the atmosphere of the governor's daughter? Johnston: They always treated me like a son. They were real nice to me. And I thought of her [Sarah Palin] as like my second mother. You know, Todd was always a great guy and helped me out with a lot of things. King: When it began to be sexual and romantic [with Bristol], did the governor know? Johnston: You know, I'm not sure. That's a question I can't really answer. But, you know, I think... King: What do you think? Johnston: You know, she says she [didn't] know. But I don't know. I think she'd probably know, you know?  Watch Levi Johnston's interview with Larry King » . King: What about her husband? Do you think he knew? Johnston: I would think so. King: Where did sex occur? In their house? Johnston: You know, Larry, that I'm a gentleman. And I don't kiss and tell. So I don't think that really matters. King: You said you practiced safe sex most of the time, right? Johnston: Right. King: We know that one time that didn't happen. Were you surprised at the pregnancy? Johnston: A little bit, yes. It came as a bit of a shock. King: How did you tell Sarah? Johnston: We went over there and we had one of Bristol's friends over there. And we all kind of sat down on the couch and we ended up telling her that way. King: What did she say? Johnston: She was shocked. I mean she probably didn't really know what to say. No mother wants to hear that her her daughter is pregnant at 18 years old. King: When the baby, Tripp, was born, was there ever a thought that you would not be the active father of that child? Johnston: No. King: So what happened? Johnston: I don't know what happened. I think somewhere along the lines, we just weren't hitting it off anymore and... King: But they won't let you see your kid? Johnston: No. I can go over there and see him. But it's kind of an uncomfortable thing for me to go over there. You know, I want to be able to take him and do that kind of thing, go do the father thing with him and I can't. King: Why can't you? Johnston: You know, I'm not sure. King: Do you have a lawyer? Johnston: No. King: Why not? Johnston: We're not in a big fight with the Palins. I still like the family very much.  I think we can work things out. I don't think either one of us want to go to lawyers and try to fight for custody and stuff like this. King: But then why can't you take your baby for a weekend? Johnston: I don't know. King: But you're not interested in finding out legally why you can? Johnston: I am. If it keeps going like this, I think we're going to have to. ... King: Now, [upon] further reflection, you might have a lawyer? Johnston: Yes, I do. King: OK. So are you afraid that saying you have a lawyer might anger the Palins? Johnston: I don't want to stir anything up ... King: When was the last time you saw Tripp? Johnston: A couple weeks ago. King: Do you call the house to see how he is? Johnston: Yes. I call and check up on him every once in a while. And, you know, she [Bristol] keeps the talk short, you know. But I do check up on him. King: She [Bristol] seems to be really ticked. Is there something you did? Johnston: That might be the case, but I don't see what it would be. King: In other words, you have no idea why she's angry? Johnston: No. I think it has a lot to do with her and my sister. She [Bristol] doesn't trust who she hangs out with. King: Have you spoken to the governor? Johnston: I haven't talked to her for quite a while, actually. King: Well, wouldn't you want to know what part she's playing in not letting her daughter see your son? Johnston: Yes, that would be nice. I mean, my dad talks to Todd a lot. And after we did that first interview with Tyra [Banks], he hasn't -- he hasn't called, you know. And they just pretty much blew us off. So it's just getting worse. King: Is there any chance the two of you could get together again? Johnston: You know, I don't see that ever happening. I just hope that we can come to an understanding and become friends and raise this baby together. King: We told the Palin camp that Levi Johnston would be our guest tonight and asked for a comment. We got this response today from Megan Stapleton, the Palin family spokesperson: ""Bristol is focused on going to college, raising Tripp and advocating abstinence."" [Levi's mother and sister join the interview] . King: All right, Sherry, What do you make of all of this? Sherry Johnston, Levi's mother: It's a whirlwind. I still haven't grasped my whole mind around all this. King: Were you mad at the pregnancy, angry? Sherry Johnston: No. No, I wasn't. King: Why not? Sherry Johnston: He's talked about babies a lot since him and Bristol has been together. And he's always been playing with kids. And I've always wanted to be a grandma ever since mine grew up, so ... King: What went wrong, do you think? Sherry Johnston:  I'm still trying to figure that out. King: Do you think you might have been in the equation, Mercede, since Levi said that Bristol didn't like you? Mercede Johnston, Levi's sister: I'm not too sure. I think it's a big part because of my friends. But I don't understand why. King: What kind of friends? Mercede Johnston: Friends that have previously dated my brother, they still talk. And there's kind of a jealousy issue between her and my friends. King: Somebody is not letting your son see your grandson. You've got to go somewhere with that. Sherry Johnston:  Well, that's what we're all trying to find out, what to do. King: Have you contacted them? Sherry Johnston: Not personally. I have talked to Bristol, seeing if I could take Tripp, come over and get him, bring him to the house. But that hasn't happened. King: What did she say? Sherry Johnston: She said that she would call me back. King: And didn't? Sherry Johnston: No. King: Do you have a guess as to why they're being this way? Sherry Johnston: I don't know. Things started changing different, I would say, I noticed in November. Things were starting to chill down, not getting as friendly and I'm not sure [why]... King: Now, he says you do have a lawyer? Sherry Johnston: Yes, we do. We want to keep this on the lowdown and, you know, not start trouble. But, obviously, if things don't change, that's our next action when we get back ... King: An e-mail question from Russell in Wilson, Oklahoma, ""Levi, how much child support do you have to pay each month?"" Levi Johnston: I'm not doing any child support right now until we go to court. I have everything my boy needs back home: diapers, toys, everything. King: Sherry, in December, shortly before Tripp's birth, you were arrested on drug charges, right? What is the status of that case? Sherry Johnston: I can't go there right now. When I have my day in court, then I would love to be able to set the record straight. There's a lot of misconception out there, but I can't go any further than that right now. King: And you're through with high school, right? Or aren't you? Levi Johnston: No, I haven't taken my final test, no. King: Are you going to do that?

"Cairo (CNN) -- The trial of three Al Jazeera journalists held on terrorism-related charges in Egypt was adjourned to May 15 after a brief appearance in the Cairo court on Saturday. Correspondent Peter Greste, producer Mohammed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed have been in jail since December 29. Their request for bail has been denied. The three were arrested at a Cairo hotel room and later charged with joining what the government says is a terrorist group -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- as well as broadcasting false information and working in Egypt without permits. The accused have denied the allegations against them, saying they were simply doing their jobs. Their case has drawn widespread international condemnation from human rights groups. Saturday's hearing coincided with World Press Freedom Day. ""I would like to remind you that today is the international day for freedom of press. The world's eyes are on us,"" Fahmy said. ""I hope the court is merciful with us."" 'We want to get out' Addressing the court, Fahmy described the nature of journalism work. He added the journalists were ""tired in prison."" ""We want to get out. We want to get out before the elections,"" he said. When the judge asked if the detained team wanted to cover the May 26-27 presidential elections, Fahmy replied: ""No, we don't want to cover election, just to get out."" Human rights groups have criticized the trial, saying the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press. The case comes amid a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after the military's overthrow of Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, in July. Morsy, of the Islamist movement, was ousted after mass protests against his rule. He was elected in 2012, a year after a popular uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Egypt as the third deadliest country for journalists in 2013. Reporters Without Borders said 80 journalists were arrested from July to September last year.","Journalists were arrested on December 29 at a Cairo hotel .

"San Pedro Sula, Honduras (CNN) -- Tossed in a truck, robbed. Dumped at a house. Held for ransom. The 14-year-old traveled alone by bus from his home in Honduras, through Guatemala, into Mexico, where his dream of reaching the United States was cut short by a band of criminals. Nehemias said his family was forced to pay $2,000 for his release. He had nowhere to go. ""I turned myself over to (Mexican) immigration authorities. I didn't have any more money. They took all the money. They took everything I had,"" he told CNN in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Dressed in jeans and a black T-shirt, the teen spoke softly. ""I was told (by the kidnappers) that if I ever came back, the fine would double -- that it was dangerous -- and I wouldn't make it back to my home country,"" he said. While the Obama administration is focused on unaccompanied minors who make it to U.S. soil, Nehemias -- one of dozens of children Mexican authorities sent back to Honduras this week -- represents another, larger, problem. 'I want to be with my mother' Thousands of children never make it as far as the United States. This year alone, 4,500 unaccompanied minors from Honduras have already been detained in Mexico and deported, according to the Honduran Institute for Children and Families, or IHNFA. They end up here, at an IHNFA facility in San Pedro Sula, Honduras' most violent city. The processing center is surrounded by a 6- or 7-foot cinder block fence topped with rings of barbed wire. The children arrive by bus and, once inside, wait for family members to claim them. Only legal guardians with proper documentation can cross the fort-like fence and walk out with a child. Unclaimed children stay in on-site dorms until a family member can be reached. The beds are simple; the ceiling is open. There is no air conditioning, but at least it's safe. ""I want to be with my mother. I haven't seen her in eight years,"" said Francy, a 15-year-old girl, who cried as she spoke about her trek north. She made it as far as Veracruz, Mexico, and was about to hop on the final bus ride to the U.S. border when she was detained by Mexican immigration authorities. They sent her back to Honduras. ""I was scared because as a woman traveling alone, I didn't know the intentions of the men in the group,"" she said. CNN is not publishing her last name, nor that of Nehemias, because they are underage. Francy says her mother, who lives in Memphis, Tennessee, had paid someone $3,000 to take her across the border. ""We are told to say we are traveling alone,"" she said. And if Mexican officials asked for documentation, Francy was supposed to bribe them with pesos. Her trip ended, she says, when the bribe fell short. 'I don't want to go back' Why are so many children risking their lives to move to the United States? A recent United Nations report that interviewed 400 young immigrants points to a difficult and complicated web of reasons, including violence, poverty and the desire to reunite with their parents or other family members. ""We are trapped because of the thuggery in our communities,"" said Natalia Lopez Manuelez, who lives in Las Brisas, a neighborhood in San Pedro Sula. She said her community of about 3,000 residents was constantly raided by gangs looking to assault, rob and kill. Her neighbors described horrific tales of of men stripping homeowners of everything they owned and even killing for the thrill of it. ""If you were held at gunpoint and you didn't give up everything you owned, they would kill you,"" said security guard Mario Aquino Vasquez. Las Brisas residents got so fed up with the violence they created a neighborhood watch group and built gates. Today, armed guards stand at the entrance, blocking people who don't live there from getting in. ""Little by little we cleaned up the neighborhood,"" said Vasquez. But poverty remains. Dirt roads connect homes that are patched with corrugated iron. Many of the houses have no windows or doors. The residents are part of the more than half of Hondurans who live in poverty. It was that lack of opportunity that Nehemias was trying to escape. He wanted a better life, but said he won't try again. ""I don't want to go back."" the teen said.

"(CNN) -- If Massachusetts' strangely arcane Alimony Reform Act were to become the law of the land, the financial well-being and security of married women could be seriously threatened. The law dramatically changes the way judges grant alimony for nonworking ex-spouses. It is written in gender-neutral terminology, but because 97% of the people who seek and require alimony are women, the effects on women will be substantially greater. First the (oversimplified) basics: The new law decides whether alimony will be granted, if at all, based not on a wide variety of criteria -- such as the value of the nonworking spouse's contributions to the marriage -- but on how many years the couple stayed married and how much money the working spouse made during the marriage. And it won't last a lifetime. If a marriage lasted 15 years, a woman will receive alimony, at most, for only 10Â½ years. It's craziness. The Massachusetts legislature has effectively embraced a policy declaring that being married is roughly akin to working in state government. The more years you log, the bigger your pension, and if you make it to certain cut-off periods, you get a larger sum. Specifically, five years of marriage or less gets the dependent spouse alimony for a period equal to 50% of the number of months the couple was married. So, if a couple stays married for two years, the dependent spouse will receive alimony for no more than 12 months. A marriage that lasts at least 15 years, but less than 20, entitles the dependent spouse to alimony for 80% of the number of months of the marriage. If it weren't such a dangerous bill, it might be worth only a few snarky remarks about how people are not widgets, and human relationships should not be subjected to mechanical valuation systems. But this is a bill that threatens serious consequences and will affect women in ways that transcend economic concerns. For example, one woman told me she's afraid of becoming homeless if her ex-husband invokes the new law to stop her alimony payments. She gave up a career in banking to stay at home and raise the couple's child. When that child went off to college, the husband filed for divorce. She is surviving on a modest alimony payment, but under the new law, payments will stop in two years. Having left a profession, she stands no chance at being hired for a well-paying job in that career. A minimum wage job would pay less than public assistance. Victims of domestic abuse face an inhumane choice. Those who worry about homelessness if they leave a violent spouse might feel pressured to stay in an abusive relationship to make it to a particular cut-off period. At the same time, men who want to get out of a marriage cheaply can run to divorce court on the eve of the next cut-off period. Click here for a viewpoint in favor of the new law: Ending forever alimony . Similar bills have been proposed in other states, but women's groups have been deafeningly silent, perhaps because some aspects of the new law seem fair, at least superficially. For example, a judge can consider the income of a new partner in measuring a dependent spouse's assets. In the past, a divorced woman who was granted alimony would lose it only upon remarriage. This prompted lots of women to simply move in with a man and benefit from his financial support without having his income considered part of her assets during a court assessment of whether her need for alimony has changed. Lifetime alimony, in such circumstances, is terribly unfair. But it's also rare, especially these days. It happens, but so infrequently and usually in such unusual cases -- where the dependent ex-spouse is financially desperate and unable to work -- that it doesn't merit the restructuring of all alimony laws for all purposes. Massachusetts divorce lawyer Elizabeth Clague says she's seen a judge grant lifetime alimony only a few times in her 16-year career. ""The cases involved unusual circumstances. One woman was living in a shelter; in another case, the husband had been hiding assets,"" Clague said. ""Lifetime alimony awards are disfavored in Massachusetts and have been for a long time."" Judges ordered alimony under the previous, more flexible, rule based on a holistic view of each case rather than in accordance with arbitrary lines that reward or punish stay-at-home spouses based on years spent in the marriage. Among other things, a mechanical approach to a woman's value disregards entirely the value of a woman's lost career. If she finished medical school, for example, then stayed home to raise children and care for her family, a judge should be able to take into account this lost opportunity and income. Instead, the new law dictates that a woman's value is based solely on the length of time she spent enabling her husband to earn a certain income while she cooked, met with teachers and took the kids to soccer practice. Judges in Massachusetts do retain some discretion to grant alimony beyond the guidelines, in unusual cases, but the stated purpose of the new rule will compel most judges to simply dole out discounted alimony awards based on an awkward calculation of numbers, years and percentages, rather than full valuation of a woman's worth. Lifetime alimony has been a problem, but the system mostly self-corrected when judges stopped routinely ordering it. For those few men whose payments were unfair, a law granting a more generous standard of review on appeal would have fixed it. The Alimony Reform Act is too broad, and other states should beware. Lawmakers motivated to please special interest groups would be wise to remember they represent the public interest, not only the interests of wealthy men with lobbyists.

"(CNN) -- With every passing day, the wait for the kidnapped Nigerian girls gets more agonizing. Boko Haram seized the nearly 300 schoolgirls and vanished into a dense forest last month. Their abduction sparked a global movement as throngs took to the streets demanding their rescue. Officials say 276 girls remain missing. Here's why their rescue is a risky, complicated effort. It's been more than three weeks . The ticking clock could mean the girls are getting farther away. Militants herded the girls out of bed on April 14 at a school in Chibok in northern Nigeria. A few escaped and shared harrowing tales of fleeing a nearby forest. At the time, relatives roaming through the forest searching for the girls said there were no signs of soldiers in the area considered a militant hideout. ""In a hostage situation, time is of the essence,"" said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby. ""We lost some time."" Missing girls likely separated . Kirby said the missing girls may have been broken up into smaller groups and taken out of the country. Local residents say they've heard reports of cars filled with girls headed to neighboring Cameroon. The forest is near the Cameroon border, which is porous and doesn't require much to pass through. In some cases, a simple monetary bribe will get you waved into neighboring nations, in this case a list that includes Chad and Niger. ""The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad to see if we can find information,"" said Gordon Brown, a former UK Prime Minister and the U.N.'s special envoy for global education. Location and number of hostages are factors . The girls' abduction occurred in an area where the government doesn't have a firm grip. The school is about 600 miles from the capital of Abuja. And the large number of hostages means airstrikes may not be an option because they can kill captives. A ground assault isn't a great option either -- not when it is done in unfamiliar terrain against entrenched, well-armed fighters. Nigerian military isn't the most trustworthy . Hours after the girls went missing, the Nigerian military faced criticism for its handling of the kidnapping. It said it had rescued all but eight of the girls, a claim it later recanted after their parents said most remained missing. Ensuing attacks have shown that the security forces don't have the capability to protect civilians, which will make many think twice before providing intelligence. It's also ill-equipped . Numerous attacks in recent years make it clear that Nigeria does not have the most sophisticated programs to battle terrorism. In addition, it's lacking in intelligence gathering, a crucial element in the search for the missing girls. This has prompted the United States, Britain, China and a host of other nations to step in to fill the gap. The U.S. offer to help includes the creation of a ""coordination cell"" to provide intelligence, investigations and hostage negotiation expertise, the U.S. State Department said. Boko Haram beheads negotiators . While negotiations may be an option in some hostage crises, this case may not be so clear cut. Rights groups have accused Nigeria of using heavy-handed tactics such as illegal searches, torture and extrajudicial killings to crack down on the militants. As a result, it has eroded trust between the two sides, prompting Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau to say he ""will not enter a truce with infidels,"" U.S. lawmakers said last year. Boko Haram members who try to negotiate with the government get beheaded. ""Reports of beheadings seem to go up when there are talks of negotiation. It is plausible that many of these beheadings, which rose in frequency in early 2012, are purges of moderate members who have complained or attempted to negotiate,"" U.S. lawmakers said. If there are negotiations going on, they have not yielded results so far. Its members are always on the move . The militants don't sit still for long, making them even more elusive. Members hop from one location to another to avoid an intensified government crackdown. They leave their wives behind when they scamper into hideouts deep into forests, forcing the girls and women kidnapped to perform chores and sexual services. Shekau is a cold, ruthless monster . The Boko Haram leader took credit this week for the Chibok kidnapping. ""I abducted your girls,"" he taunted with a chilling smile. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell."" He operates in the shadows, leaving his underlings to orchestrate his repulsive mandates. And they have been busy. Days after his video surfaced, details emerged of another abduction of eight girls between ages 12 and 15 on Sunday night in the northeast. And a grisly assault on a local village left hundreds of people dead. The bounty on his head may not help much . Shekau has been on the U.S. radar since he came to power five years ago. The United States offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his location. But that may not yield immediate results. ""African warlord Joseph Kony's had a bounty for years. Osama bin Laden was not given up because of the $25 million bounty. And who knows whether this will be the case,"" said Christiane Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent. 310 people killed in latest Boko Haram attack while hundreds of girls remain missing .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the defenders of a besieged Bosnian town prepared to retreat, the prisoners of war held captive in the local jail feared the worst. An ICRC aid vehicle in Colombia in 1998. The ICRC says the conventions make its work in war zones possible. ""The prisoners were saying, 'If the town falls they will shoot us before they leave,'"" recalls Charlotte Lindsey, a Red Cross field worker in the Balkans during the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. ""We went to the prison authorities and we said, ""Look, you cannot let this happen. You are responsible for these prisoners."" Forty-eight hours later, after the town had been captured, Lindsey and her Red Cross colleagues returned to find the prison empty. But the prisoners had all been found alive and liberated by the incoming army. ""We interviewed some of the prisoners and they said the director of the prison and his deputy had stood in front of them to protect them,"" says Lindsey, now deputy director of communication for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). ""They told us: 'They wanted to kill us but they wouldn't let it happen.'"" Even 15 years later, Lindsey is unable to reveal specific details about where the 1994 incident took place or the identities of the protagonists because of the ICRC's strict policy of confidentiality and neutrality. But for her the story serves to illustrate the lasting impact of the Geneva Conventions -- the set of universally ratified ""rules of war"" governing the conduct of armed forces and protecting non-combatants -- even in the heat of one of the most brutal and ethnically charged conflicts of recent decades. ""On a daily basis, living in a war zone, you see examples of the conventions being applied. Every time a soldier is captured and moved to a prison, or a wounded soldier is collected by an ambulance, that is an application of the Geneva Conventions,"" Lindsey told CNN ahead of Wednesday's 60th anniversary of the signing of the conventions. ""People forget that they are rooted in the law because they seem such evident needs and evident rights that people have.""  See photos of the ICRC's work in the 60-year history of the modern Geneva Conventions » . Shaped in the aftermath of World War II, the 1949 conventions were drafted in an effort to prevent a repeat of the mass destruction of the era of ""total war"" in which entire nations and civilian populations had become targets for indiscriminate slaughter. In particular, the Fourth Convention established rules, adopted for the first time, protecting civilians in occupied territory. The conventions also formalized and enhanced the ICRC's role as a neutral presence in conflict zones, allowing the organization access to assess and monitor the treatment of captured and wounded combatants and civilians on both sides of front lines. But in an age when conflicts are more likely to be sprawling, chaotic civil wars involving disparate armed groups -- not to mention nebulous and shifting terror networks such as al Qaeda -- some have questioned whether the 60-year old conventions still hold relevance. Are the Geneva Conventions still relevant? Sound Off below . In particular, the legal ambiguity of the conventions on the status of detainees captured and incarcerated at facilities such as Guantanamo Bay as part of the so-called ""War on Terror"" -- and allegations of their mistreatment -- has prompted legal wrangling between Pentagon officials and human rights groups in the U.S. Philip Spoerri, the ICRC's Director of International Law, admits that international humanitarian law -- a legal field with the 1949 agreement at its core -- remains an ""embryonic"" endeavor and concedes that violations of the Geneva Conventions, such as the mass displacement or indiscriminate targeting of civilians, remain all too commonplace. He adds that the rules governing the conduct and status of armed groups engaged in non-international conflicts could be honed and expanded to reflect the 21st century realities of warfare. But he told CNN that the conventions, which have been ratified by 194 states, remained emphatically relevant -- and that enforcing compliance, rather than recodifying their core principles, was where progress was needed. ""Compliance, or better implementation, has always been the Achilles' heel of the conventions,"" Spoerri said. ""Even with the rudimentary rules on non-international conflict that we have today, if you had a very effective implementing mechanism for them that would be a huge step."" Richard Goldstone, formerly the chief U.N. prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, agrees that greater international compliance with the conventions is key but argues that important progress has already been made through both those tribunals and the establishment in 2002 of the International Criminal Court. ""The tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia recognized that all serious violations of the Geneva Conventions are criminal offences and that is a huge advance,"" Goldstone told CNN. He added that the vast majority of provisions in the conventions had become customary international law -- and therefore binding on nations and non-state actors whether they had ratified the conventions or not. ""It's a question of implementing the law, not of any weakness of the law itself,"" said Goldstone. ""It's the practical nitty-gritty things of getting arrests and getting the cooperation of governments, because without that neither the Geneva Conventions, the ICC nor any international tribunal can succeed."" In the meantime, Spoerri, like Lindsey, takes heart from concrete examples of how the conventions make the work of the ICRC possible in war zones which would otherwise be deprived of humanitarian aid. He cites the efforts of the organization in persuading Taliban and other militant groups in Afghanistan's volatile south to allow U.N. aid workers to conduct a polio immunization throughout the region in 2007. ""If we did not have these conventions and also the principles embodied in them, our work would be a lot more difficult,"" Spoerri said. ""They are the backbone of our operation.""","August 12 marks 60th anniversary of the signing of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .

"(CNN) -- Access to affordable and high quality higher education should be a universal right. A free and prosperous society needs an educated citizenry to innovate and thrive. Today in America, we're a long way from that goal. Unfortunately, the highly touted plan from Starbucks to provide increased tuition assistance doesn't really help -- and might hurt. On Monday, Starbucks announced that it would help cover much of the cost of two years of education at Arizona State University Online for its employees. The rhetoric, driven by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, has been lofty. On ""The Daily Show,"" he said, ""Today we will become the first U.S. company to provide free college tuition for all our employees."" The crowd went wild. On CNN, Schultz and Dr. Michael Crow, president of ASU, positioned it as a way to attack the national student debt crisis. Crow said, ""Can it tackle these national issues? The answer is absolutely yes."" Secretary of Education Arne Duncan attended the announcement of the plan and said, ""Think of the example you can set for the rest of the nation,"" Duncan said. ""If you guys can do this well ... you're going to change the trajectory of the entire country."" Schultz, Crow, and Duncan seem to believe they are on the cusp of a new education revolution, disrupting their way to a better American higher-ed landscape. In fact, it would be a terrible thing for education to become another employer-dependent benefit. This new program may help some Starbucks employees by providing access to online classes, but it will do nothing to attack structural problems such as the national student debt crisis or skyrocketing tuition rates (1,200% in 30 years!). Rather, the need for such a benefit is a confirmation that the system is broken. First of all, the Starbucks plan does not really ""provide free college tuition"" for every employee. What it does is offer reimbursement for a certain number of credits completed at ASU Online. Most large employers, in fact, offer various kinds of tuition reimbursement, but the scale and specific relationship between Starbucks and ASU is unusual, especially because ASU is absorbing considerable upfront costs by discounting its tuition. Starbucks is, of course, a for-profit company. ASU Online, meanwhile, functions as a profitable educational institution nestled within a large public university. Therefore, the new policy needs to be viewed not as a public service, but as a deal struck between two companies interested in their image and profit margins. Starbucks is gaining lots of great PR from the roll out of the policy. It also will likely improve employee morale and actually help some of them get educations. ASU, in the meantime, gets access to potentially thousands of new students it does not have to recruit, all of whom will eventually bring additional revenue to the university through student loans, federal grants and Starbucks. So long as Starbucks employees get good advice both from within the benefits office and access to good college advising, I think it's a net positive for both institutions and the employees. The margin, though, is slim. Sara Goldrick-Rab, professor of educational policy studies and sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argues that wholly online education is of questionable value for low-income students. This is especially a problem when such students are required to pay for those first 21 credits before they qualify for reimbursement. Moreover, most of the money here is coming from the government and loans, not Starbucks. As Tressie McMillan Cottom, writer and sociologist, notes, the use of public funds to support online for-profit education has a long and shady history. None of these concerns has stopped the Starbucks PR team from trumpeting their great accomplishment. In one telling moment, Schultz compared the tuition benefit to Starbucks' decision to give health care to its workers. That's a comparison worth exploring. The development of health care as an employee benefit rather than a universal right has been a disaster for America, leading to high costs and poor results. Yes, the employees are much better off with health care than without, much as some workers will benefit from the new tuition policy. But if making college affordable becomes a job perk, rather than a societal goal, we're collectively worse off. Instead, wouldn't it be great if employees could just pay for college with their wages, rather than needing a special, highly restrictive, benefit? We can rescue higher education in America from its current cost spiral, and we should, by acting at the national level. We need to change the structure of how we pay for college, a process that will take hard work across party lines. Unfortunately, last week a bill that would have radically reduced student loan interest rates for everyone stalled in the Senate. And so, while we wait for the government to act, we're stuck relying on Starbucks.","David Perry: Starbucks launches college program for its employees .

"(CNN) -- King Juan Carlos I is stepping down from the Spanish throne after nearly 40 years, handing power to his son after a series of scandals that has dented the royal family's popularity. The King said Crown Prince Felipe, a former Olympic yachtsman, has ""the maturity, the preparation, and the sense of responsibility necessary"" to serve as king and ""to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation."" Prince Felipe, 46, is regarded as being untouched by the accusations of corruption and excess that have plagued the royal family as many Spaniards continue to struggle to find jobs and pull themselves out of financial ruin. Princess Cristina, the Prince's older sister, is embroiled in a tax fraud and money laundering investigation. She and her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, have denied allegations that they diverted public funds from Urdangarin's foundation for private use. Spaniards have long held Juan Carlos, 76, in high regard for shepherding the country into democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. But his popularity took a hit in 2012 over a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Africa while the nation was mired in a deep economic crisis. Prince Felipe, the third child and only son of Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, has been preparing to be king his entire life. He attended his father's coronation before parliament in 1975, and reportedly stayed awake late into the night to witness what is considered to be the King's finest moment -- his decisive put-down of an attempted coup by a section of the military in February 1981. Felipe studied international relations at Georgetown University in the U.S. and trained as a Spanish military officer. He was also a member of Spain's Olympic yachting team at the Barcelona games in 1992. The Prince has increasingly stood in for the King at a variety of official engagements in recent years as his father's health has faltered. Felipe also presides over the annual Prince of Asturias awards, prestigious accolades presented by his foundation for achievements in the fields of science, the humanities, and sports. In 2004 Felipe married Letizia Ortiz, a famous former TV anchor who worked for Bloomberg TV, Spain's state-run TVE, and CNN+, a Spanish CNN station that is no longer on the air. The Prince's marriage to Princess Letizia, a divorced commoner who left her own career behind to join the royal family, has made the monarchy seem more modern and accessible to ordinary Spaniards. Letizia is ""someone who has travelled on the subway, taken out a mortgage to buy an apartment in a Madrid suburb, and brought emotional baggage to the relationship,"" according to Tereixa Constenla at El Pais. The couple have tried to create a normal living environment for their family, according to El Pais, regularly taking their two young daughters to school and putting them to bed at night themselves. And despite his family's recent troubles, Felipe remains a very popular figure in Spain. Two-thirds of Spaniards see the Prince in a favorable light, according to a survey by El Mundo in December. The King's approval rating in the same poll was just 41.3%. Felipe's biggest task, in light of the recent scandals, will be to make the royal palace more transparent. His family has a relatively austere reputation when compared with other European monarchies, but there has been increasing resentment in Spain over the cost of the royal family to the public. The crown's budget -- more than â‚¬7.78 million ($10.5m) in 2014 -- has been cut nearly 13% over the past five years, and the monarchy has begun publishing yearly breakdowns of its annual spending in an attempt to curb criticism, according to the UK's Daily Telegraph. The overtures, however, have done little to silence a vocal minority in Spain who want to see the crown abolished altogether. After Juan Carlos' announcement Monday, thousands poured into the streets to call for a nationwide referendum on the future of the monarchy. Lawmakers have largely ignored those calls, and the soon-to-be-named Felipe VI is expected to be sworn in as king sometime after June 18 at a ceremony in front of Spain's Congress.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The Thai military continued to hold former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra on Saturday, a source close to her told CNN. She was ordered to report a day earlier to the junta that took charge of the country this week. The National Council for Peace and Order summoned 35 others to report by 1 p.m. Saturday, a military spokesman told reporters. More than 100 people were previously summoned. Around 150 people will be required to appear, the spokesman said in English. They come from all sides of Thailand's political divide. Not all of them are to be detained, just those directly involved in Thailand's raucous political conflicts, the spokesman said. Some of those held previously, including opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva and members of Yingluck's Pheu Thai Party, were later released. That also happened to Panthongtae Shinawatra -- the nephew of Yingluck and son of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- according to a source close to his family. Saturday's list included academics and one of Yingluck's chief opponents, ""Yellow Shirt"" movement leader Sondhi Limthongkul. The politician suffered a gunshot wound to the head during unrest in 2009 but later recovered. Some no-shows . Some of those summoned have yet to heed the council's call. On Saturday, it gave them another chance to do so and announced that those who did not comply would be taken in by ""law enforcement."" The military has banned more than 150 prominent figures from leaving the country and threatened to arrest politicians who disobey its orders. Security forces have arrested ""many people"" suspected of possessing ""military grade weapons and explosive devices,"" the spokesman said. The armed forces seized power in a coup Thursday after months of turmoil that paralyzed much of the government and caused deadly clashes in Bangkok. It has imposed martial law, which includes a curfew, and shut out independent media reporting. CNN International's broadcasting has been blacked out in Thailand. It also dissolved the Senate, according to a statement from the military chief read on the country's broadcast outlets. On Saturday, a number of major TV stations were back on air, including MCOT, TPBS and NBT. 'Time to think' Detentions are not expected to last much longer than seven days. ""We want to give them some time to relax and have time to think over the problem,"" the spokesman said. The council wants to ""adjust their perception and make them think about the country, think about the Thai people as a whole, not just one particular group."" The military council wants both sides to ""listen to the other side"" and stop being ""self-centered,"" he added. Detainees determined to have no significant link to conflict and who find ""common ground"" for the good of the country will be released, the spokesman said. He asked that the public not worry about their treatment. ""We look after them very well,"" he said. He did not say what would happen to those whose attitudes did not change or who are found to be more deeply involved in the country's friction. Regular coups . The United States and other countries have criticized the military's intervention, the latest in a long list of coups in Thailand, and called for the swift restoration of democracy. The U.S. State Department expressed concern about the military's actions. ""It has dissolved the Senate, detained a number of people, called in some academics and journalists, and continued to restrict the press,"" deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said. ""We again call on the military to release those detained for political reasons, end restrictions on the media, and move to restore civilian democracy through elections."" Yingluck, whose government was in power when the unrest began in November, was removed from office this month by the country's Constitutional Court over the appointments of top security officials. Yingluck arrived around noon Friday at a military compound in Bangkok with one of her sisters. She was being detained at a military barracks outside Bangkok, the Thai government's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, said late Friday. Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the head of the military, has assumed the powers to act as Prime Minister until a new one takes office, the military said Thursday. How the government will operate remains unclear, given that the military also has thrown out the constitution it drew up in 2007 after a previous coup, except for Section 2, which acknowledges that the King is the head of state. The last six months have been marked by large-scale protests, both by those backing Yingluck's government and those opposed to it. There have been periodic outbursts of deadly violence in the streets. Protesters clearing out . Protest camps of both sides in Bangkok have been cleared away since the coup. Under the new order, schools will be closed nationwide between Friday and Sunday, the military said. A curfew is in place between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The military has warned against posting misleading or critical comments on social media platforms. In a speech Thursday, Prayuth said that these actions were necessary to restore order and push through reforms. Life in most of the city's center appeared normal during the day Friday, with shops open and people going to work. The military presence around the city remained subtle, with few soldiers in view, except outside the Defense Ministry and military sites. Protesters dismantled their camps. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has updated its guidance for Americans traveling to Thailand. It ""recommends that U.S. citizens reconsider any nonessential travel to Thailand, particularly Bangkok, due to ongoing political and social unrest and restrictions on internal movements, including an indefinite nighttime curfew."" 'Red Shirt' reaction? The question many analysts are asking is how the popular ""Red Shirt"" movement, which supports Yingluck and her exiled brother Thaksin Shinawatra, will respond to the coup. The Red Shirts, whose support base is in the rural north and northwest of Thailand, were already angered by Yingluck's ouster this month, a move they viewed as a judicial coup by Bangkok elites. Senior Red Shirt leaders, as well as prominent figures from the anti-Yingluck protesters, were still being held Friday by the military, according to Paradon, the national security adviser to the government. Thaksin, a business tycoon who built a highly successful political movement through populist policies benefiting the rural masses, was deposed as Prime Minister in a military coup in 2006. In 2010, when the pro-Thaksin party was out of power, the Red Shirts mounted large protests in the heart of Bangkok. An ensuing crackdown by security forces resulted in clashes that killed around 90 people. Thailand martial law: A cheat sheet to get you up to speed . Soldiers, selfies and a military coup .

"(CNN) -- Even when working at his father's gas station when he was a boy, Baz Luhrmann had an eye for great stories. ""The gas station itself was like an island, and the variety of humanity that would stop, each person had a story... whether there was a family arguing, whether there was a love affair or Christians trying to convert people,"" he told CNN. Luhrmann has gone from observing those road-side slices of life to making big screen hits, like ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Australia"", and made a name for himself as an imaginative filmmaker with an eye for the spectacular. ""As a little kid in the middle of nowhere in a tiny country town, I had no problem ... imagining the big story, the big myth, the big adventure.

"(CNN) -- When growing up, Monisha Kaltenborn wanted to go into space, but as the first female CEO of a Formula 1 team she's arguably reached greater heights. Breaking into the male dominated sport wasn't the 40-year old's first ambition then, but the trained lawyer has embraced her trail-blazing position. ""It feels good and I'm a bit proud about that,"" said Kaltenborn. ""But again it's not my doing, it just so happened that I've done a lot to be in the position."" As a young girl Kaltenborn moved from her native India to Austria with her parents. Taking Austrian citizenship and studying law, Kaltenborn first became involved with motor racing in 1998 when she joined the Fritz Kaiser Group, a shareholder of the Red Bull Sauber F1 Team. She went from looking after the team's legal and corporate affairs, to taking a place on the Sauber Group's management board in 2001. In 2010, she took over the business operations of the whole team. ""Certainly it's not easy,"" she said of working in a hugely competitive industry and being the sport's most high-profile and influential woman. Kaltenborn has been adjusting to her role during perhaps the team's most difficult period. After four years BMW pulled out of Formula 1 in 2009, leaving a large amount of uncertainty surrounding the development of Sauber's racing cars and among personnel. ""The biggest risk you have here is... people don't see the future in the team and then they want to leave and if you start losing your key people at that time, the whole process comes to a standstill. It's only later that you'll realize that insecurity amongst your personnel has a strong influence on the development of the car,"" she said. ""We had to make sure that we could keep the company going, secure funding."" With two young drivers, Kamui Kobayashi and rookie Sergio Perez, Sauber have had a number of points-scoring results this season and currently lie seventh in F1's constructors' world championship table. In helping to steer the team to safety, as a team and business, Kaltenborn has also been involved in moving forwards the attitude to women in the sport. ""I think people, not the teams but others especially media, they don't ask a woman a question relating to performance,"" she said. ""The questions I get are normally very strategic questions about the company, the team, where F1 is going but never how the race was and what I feel about the drivers. But that's changing now. It's interesting to see how people take a while to get used to these kinds of questions to women."" When she set another first last year -- the first woman to attend an FIA press conference -- many men from other teams told her they were embarrassed that it had taken so long. Realizing the gender gap needed to be closed the sport's governing body, FIA, set up the Women and Motorsports Commission last year, in which Kaltenborn is taking a leading role. ""We are realizing that to a certain age there a lot of young girls driving in car series and then suddenly, when it gets into the next category, it drops off. A lot of that is to do with the whole social set up they have,"" she said. Bernie Eccelestone, the head of Formula 1, has said a woman could be his successor, but Kaltenborn intends to be with Sauber for a long time to come, improving the team's performance. It's also possible a woman could be behind the wheel of an F1 car in the not-too-distant future. Maybe even with Sauber. ""From the physical side of it, I don't see why a woman cannot be in Formula 1,"" she said.","Austrian-Indian CEO of Sauber is F1's first female boss .
Trained as a lawyer before moving through ranks of Sauber .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- The battle for control of the eastern Ukrainian town of Slovyansk has intensified in the past 24 hours, with civilians caught in heavy crossfire between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. Each side blames the other for mortar and rocket fire that has struck apartment buildings and homes in the town, which is now also suffering acute power and water shortages. Social media video from Slovyansk uploaded Sunday and apparently filmed in the past two days shows extensive damage to an apartment block in the center of the town, which appears to have taken a direct hit to the third floor. Another building was engulfed by fire. Other videos showed people hurrying to basements, with the sound of artillery and rocket fire in the distance -- and at times much closer. The charred ruins of cars littered the streets, and windows in a number of buildings had been blown out. The office of President Petro Poroshenko, who was inaugurated Sunday in Kiev, said he had opened the first meeting of a three-party contact group on implementing a peace plan he had discussed with French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the margins of the D-Day commemorations on Friday. In an apparent reference to the fighting around Slovyansk, Poroshenko said: ""We have to stop fire this week. For me, every day of people dying, every day of Ukraine paying such a high price is an unacceptable one."" The talks involve Ukrainian ambassador to Germany Pavel Klimkin, a special envoy with the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe and Russian Ambassador to Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov, the President said. Slovyansk -- normally a city of some 130,000 people -- was taken over by separatists early in April. The Ukrainian army first attacked separatist blockades on its outskirts later that month but subsequently withdrew. Only in the past week have Ukrainian troops moved decisively to bottle in the separatists, using tanks, artillery and rockets against their defenses. A spokesman for the Anti-Terrorist Operation told CNN from outside Slovyansk that the army was not shooting at residential areas and that separatists had launched a counterattack early Sunday. Separatist officials in the town told the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS that artillery fire had been aimed at the city administration building, the former Security Service compound and Police Department -- all of which are occupied by the separatists. ITAR-TASS quoted a local militia official as saying that ""there were victims among civilians as many were injured by shrapnel."" CNN was unable to confirm the account, but one social media video appeared to show a pool of blood close to the impact of a shell. Overall casualties in Slovyansk are impossible to quantify. A health official with the Donetsk regional administration, Elena Peteyaeva, said 140 bodies had been collected -- but it was not clear over what time span. Peteyaeva said there were only three ambulances at work in the town and very few people were able to get out. A CNN team that reached the area Thursday found all major roads into Slovyansk blocked and deserted. During an extensive tour of the region, only two cars, piled high with belongings, emerged from country tracks. South of Slovyansk, separatist groups have consolidated their hold of several towns in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A CNN team on Sunday visited Shnizhne, Krasny Luch and Antratsyt, all on or close to the main road east to the Russian border. Separatist roadblocks guarded the fringes of each town in a heavily industrial part of the Donbass region, and dozens of well-armed fighters were seen in the center of Shnizhne. The main administration building in Antratsyt was surrounded by sandbags. One nearby border crossing at Marynivka -- which was the scene of clashes last week when separatists of the so-called Vostok Battalion tried to bring heavy trucks and an infantry fighting vehicle across the border -- had been reinforced by the Ukrainian Border Guard, with additional troops deployed on nearby hills. Even so, the troops deployed at the border admitted it was impossible to patrol the 1,200-mile border effectively, much of it unfenced amid rolling, empty countryside.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly 200,000 U.S.-supplied rifles and pistols meant for Iraqi security forces are unaccounted for in Iraq, according to a report to Congress. Loose record-keeping caused the Pentagon and the U.S. command in Iraq to lose track of about 110,000 AK-47 rifles and 80,000 pistols provided to the new Iraqi national police and army, the Government Accountability Office told Congress. The investigative arm of Congress, the GAO also found that 250,000 pieces of body armor and helmets can't be accounted for. The report also says a review of the 2007 property books shows continuing problems with missing and incomplete records. The report, issued July 31, follows an October accounting by the Defense Department's special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, which put the number of weapons missing at close to 500,000. Auditors were unable to determine whether the weapons -- which included heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers -- were stolen, being used by insurgents or still in the hands of Iraqi units. A Pentagon official in Baghdad, who asked not to be identified, said some of the weapons went back to Iraqi forces and some were destroyed. But he conceded some of them may be missing. Asked whether they ended up in the hands of insurgents, he said there was no hard data, but ""anything is possible."" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Monday he is not aware of any reports that show U.S. weapons designated for Iraqi security forces have been found in the hands of insurgents. The missing weapons mostly dated back to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's rule, and none had serial numbers, the official said. Coalition commanders have tightened procedures for tracking the weapons, including using biometric data from Iraqi soldiers and police -- and since June, Iraqi units have been issued U.S.-made M-16 and M-4 rifles, which are electronically tracked, the official said. Officials with the U.S. training command blamed insufficient staff and the lack of a ""fully operational distribution network"" for the poor record-keeping, the GAO report states. Coalition trainers did not keep centralized records of the equipment they issued to Iraqi police and troops before December 2005, and the coalition ""has not consistently collected supporting documents that confirm when the equipment was received, the quantities of equipment delivered, or the Iraqi units receiving the equipment."" The report said the U.S. commander in charge of training Iraqi forces reported about 185,000 AK-47 rifles, 170,000 pistols, 215,000 items of body armor, and 140,000 helmets were issued to Iraqi security forces as of September 2005, while the accounting books from the U.S. military contained records for only about 75,000 AK-47 rifles, 90,000 pistols, 80,000 items of body armor, and 25,000 helmets. The GAO recommended the Pentagon set accountability standards for the training program and make sure it has adequate staff and technology to oversee the program. The GAO also recommended the Secretary of Defense determine what DOD accountability procedures should apply to the program and ensure sufficient staff, functioning distribution networks, and proper technology are available to meet the requirements. The Defense Department concurred with the recommendations and has begun a review ""to ensure proper accountability is in place for the Iraq train-and-equip program,"" the report states. Pentagon officials said Monday the accounting systems should be ""continuously improved upon and refined."" According to the report the United States has provided $19.2 billion to develop the Iraqi security forces and the United States has asked for another $2 billion to continue training and equipping Iraqi troops.

"(CNN) -- Family, food and faith have guided Kylie Kwong to where she is today. The 41-year-old chef has been cooking up a storm with her TV shows and restaurant for over a decade, adding a dash of color and flavor to Australia's cultural life. A third generation Chinese who grew up in the suburbs of Sydney in the 1970s, Kwong left High School to work for an advertising agency. She soon realized, however, that making people feel bad in order to make them buy things they didn't want wasn't for her. Making people happy through good food was much more appealing. After leaving the advertising industry she worked part-time for a caterer where she saw a way to combine the love of cooking she inherited from her mother with a growing interest in creating her own business. She opened her first restaurant ""Billy Kwong"" 10 years ago and it has since become a fixture on the Sydney restaurant scene. ""When I opened the goal was very simple. I wanted to fill it every night and serve really fantastic, amazing, fresh Chinese food out of this funny little arty place,"" she told CNN. ""And I love running a business. It's so challenging. And I love what it brings out of you. You find these hidden strengths you find that you didn't know you had."" Since then Kwong has developed a larger profile through her cooking shows and recipe books. She also let cameras follow her to southern China and the village where her great grandfather once lived; the first time a member of Kwong's immediate family had been there in 90 years. It was a world apart from the suburban Australia that Kwong knew. Coming from the only Chinese family in her suburb, Kwong says she always felt different from other children. ""I certainly felt different when I'd go to school and open the lunch box and there I'd have last night's rice and soy sauce chicken wings and my friend had the Vegemite sandwiches,"" she told CNN. ""And that point it was very good to be different because our food was so much more interesting. Yes, I felt different, yes, my brothers felt different. But it really didn't affect us negatively at all."" In touch with her roots and a vast extended family (family reunions number in the hundreds) Kwong is also a practicing Buddhist who cooked for the Dalai Lama when he visited Australia in 2009. ""It was one of the great weeks of my life. I still can't believe that it actually happened. We spent all week with him backstage in Sydney,"" she said. ""His practice just really encouraged me to keep practicing and doing what we're doing, and to always try harder and harder in everything we do. And to know every single thing that we feel, or think, or do, makes a really big difference.""","Kylie Kwong is an Australian TV chef and restaurateur .

"(CNN) -- What do aluminum sheeting and life insurance have in common? Very little unless you're Kumar Mangalam Birla, industrialist and CEO of Aditya Birla Group, the India conglomerate with companies that produce the metal for car manufacturers and the insurance for those who will drive them, as well as a raft of other commodities, products and services. At 43, Birla is one of India's richest men, inheriting control of the company in 1995 that was founded by his father, and has increased the overall turnover from $2 billion to $29 billion by 2010. Birla hopes to more than double that figure by 2015. ""I know that sounds audacious but to put it in context, we were a little under $10 billion four years ago,"" he says. ""So we have a track record of doing audacious things. I generally believe that the quality of your future is entirely dependent on the quality of your imagination."" Running a company is in Birla's blood --- the family business itself goes back four generations - but he admits that when it was his turn to become chairman after the unexpected death of his father, it was a trying time. ""(It) was a very difficult time, emotionally... I was pretty much in a fishbowl, as you can imagine. I was only 28, limited experience but a lot of exposure, high quality exposure, to the world of business. The only thought in my mind was to carry forward his work. I decided that I would just put my head down and hang in there and just keep at it."" Apart from a family tradition of being business-minded, Birla has continued the legacy of largesse as Aditya Birla give 3% of its net profits to charity. ""It is this whole philosophy of trusteeship, of plying back part of your profits in terms of giving back to society. So the social arm... is run with the same rigor and intensity and precision as our businesses are. Essentially we work out of 3,000 villages and the work that we do touches about 7 million people every year."" While he continued family traditions in the company, Birla has displayed a keen eye when it comes to acquisitions, overseeing the purchase of 20 companies across the world, boosting revenues and, he hopes, India's image as an emerging business heavyweight abroad. ""I think the India story is now much better known the world over, I think India as a nation is far more respected,"" he says. ""It's gained the respect of people as an intellectual powerhouse, as a serious business destination, as people who are a very enterprising lot. I think it's the sheer spirit of enterprise that Indians bring to the table.""","Kumar Mangalam Birla is one of India's wealthiest industrialists .

This photo of Adan Hashi Ayrow was posted Thursday on a Web site that supports Somali insurgents. U.S. officials confirmed that an American missile targeted Adan Hashi Ayrow in the pre-dawn attack in central Somalia but could not confirm that he was killed. He had worked with Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, a former leader of the Islamic Courts Union, U.S. officials said. The militant group is believed to have harbored those responsible for the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Ayrow, a slight man in his 30s, was the target of an American airstrike last year that U.S. officials believe wounded the Al-Shaabab military leader. In a rare statement after the January 2007 attack, the camera-shy Ayrow lashed out at American and Ethiopian leaders for ordering the strike. ""For two weeks, U.S. and Ethiopia were saying that they killed the poor Adan Ayrow,"" he said in an audio clip released to Somali media. ""What crimes did I commit against them? Have I been to the United States or Ethiopia? Whatever [the Americans] do and whatever missiles they fire at me, I am confident that I will only die my day when God judges me."" Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. The current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. But the presence of the Ethiopians has united various Islamic militant groups in Somalia, including Al-Shaabab, who are trying to oust the Ethiopian forces and gain control of Mogadishu. Local sources said the American missile hit a house in the town of Dhusomareb about 3 a.m. Thursday (8 p.m. ET Wednesday), during a meeting of Al-Shaabab commanders. Town elder Elmi Arap said the house was demolished. He said that 10 bodies had been counted but that the death toll could be higher because body parts were strewn about the rubble. Ayrow was among those killed, he said. Hours after the attack, Al-Shaabab spokesman Mukhtar Robow held a telephone news conference with journalists from an undisclosed location in Somalia and confirmed that Ayrow and another high-ranking militia member were killed. U.S. officials said the missile was launched from a Navy submarine or a ship in the region. The U.S. classified Al-Shaabab as a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda in March. ""Al-Shaabab is a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda,"" according to the State Department Web site. ""Many of its senior leaders are believed to have trained and fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan."" Ayrow had been tracked in Somalia with the help of U.S. agents there, according to U.S. officials. Western intelligence agencies believe that he became associated with al Qaeda during a trip to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s for explosives training. Later, officials said, he started working with Aweys, whose Islamic Courts Union seized control of Somalia and its capital, Mogadishu, in 2006. The organization was deposed in December of that year, after Ethiopia's military invasion. Aweys, a prominent Islamist, is himself on a United Nations list of al Qaeda associates. The Islamists have denied that they are harboring suspects in the U.S. bombings in Tanzania and Kenya.  See a map of terrorist havens » . The Islamic Courts Union was linked to the murders of several aid workers, including Annalena Tonelli, a 60-year-old Italian nurse who was shot to death in 2003 at the tuberculosis hospital she founded in Borama, in northwestern Somaliland, according to the United Nations. As the Islamic Courts Union grew in strength, taking on the warlords that controlled Mogadishu, so did Ayrow's group. Soon after the Islamists seized the capital in 2006, a cargo plane arrived at the newly reopened airport carrying weapons, some of which may have gone to Ayrow and his Al-Shaabab fighters, according to a U.N. report. A Somali journalist described his meeting with Ayrow at the Mogadishu airport as it was being reopened two years ago. ""When I entered into the car, my colleague introduced me to the driver, who, to my surprise and shock, was Adan Hashi Ayrow,"" according to the journalist, who did not want to be named for security reasons. ""He greeted me by raising his eyebrow, and I did the same. He was so quiet ... and looked so vigilant with the movements in his eyes. I noticed that he was wearing a handgun on his waist."" The journalist said Ayrow did not talk much. ""[My colleague and I] rode in the car 15 minutes, and [Ayrow] said very few words like 'I don't like cameras' and 'The warlords were so funny: They didn't want to open this airport while they were controlling the city.' "" Since the Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union leaders, Ayrow and other Islamist militants have been hiding out. Al-Shaabab fighters are waging fierce battles across Somalia, seizing control of some small towns and battling for control of Mogadishu in recent days. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Valentine's Day is terrible for two kinds of people -- those who are single and those who aren't. For single people, the day is a disappointing reminder they don't have that ""special someone"" in their life. Not a fun feeling -- believe me, I've been there. But personally I think it's worse for people in a relationship. Single people can choose to ignore Valentine's Day. However, if you're in a relationship, the last thing you want to do is ignore Valentine's Day -- believe me, I've been there, too. What may have started out as a holiday intended to bring couples together has been transformed into a commercial spectacle peddled to us by florists, greeting card companies, jewelry stores and makers of stuffed animals. My issue is not with being romantic or expressing your feelings to the person you love. My issue is being required to do so on February 14. This date has zero connection to us. Each year on February 14 we are in essence commanded to be ""romantic."" Shouldn't romance be organic -- sort of like a ""Cialis moment""? That's the ""moment"" in the TV commercials for Cialis, the drug designed to combat erectile dysfunction -- where the couple is lifting a table together, their eyes meet, and bingo: It's a ""Cialis moment."" It may be drug-enhanced, but at least they chose the moment. I understand that Valentine's Day earnestly purports to bring couples closer together. Great idea, but let's be honest, how many of you have had fights on Valentine's Day because of Valentine's Day? I certainly have had my share, usually when one of us in the relationship (namely me) didn't buy a nice enough gift or put in enough time planning a special ""VDay"" activity -- thus, transforming Valentine's Day from a romantic evening for two into a scene from the film ""The War of the Roses."" See also: Romantic restaurants with a view . Recently I posed this simple question on Twitter: Do you love or hate Valentine's Day? I expected to find a divide by gender: men bemoaning it and women cheering it. But the findings of my less-than-scientific survey surprised me. For the most part, men were silent on the issue. But women not only responded in large numbers, they answered in a way I never expected: They too hate Valentine's Day. Overwhelmingly, women were the ones who attacked the pomp and circumstance of this ""day of love."" Here is a sampling of a few of the tweets I received from women: . I hate the colors, I hate cheap chocolate, I hate the pressure it puts on couples and singles, and Cupids are stupid . If you can't tell me you love me with flowers or candy on any day but Valentine's Day, see ya around buddy . To be honest i hate it cuz i dont have one! It's one big commercialized scheme to buy overpriced red&pink crap, I never liked it nor will I ever . And then there's this woman's objection: I have to wear leopard lingerie although I hate it. Ahh, the sacrifices we make for love. ... Now, it's true that some men and women did express their support for the day. But they were far outnumbered by those who lamented Valentine's Day as artificial, contrived and absurdly overly commercialized. Valentine's Day has a muddled history. Some historians claim it was created in 469 when Pope Gelasius declared February 14 a day to honor St. Valentine. One legend contends that Valentine was a Christian martyr executed for standing up to the Roman emperor who wanted to ban soldiers from getting married. Yet another tale claims he was executed because of his Christian beliefs and signed his farewell note to his beloved: ""From Your Valentine."" While a third and more accepted belief is that the holiday marks the day that ""birds begin to pair,"" which is the day they choose their mate. So somehow because birds picked February 14 to ""get it on,"" I have to spend $100 on roses? This tweet best sums up my sentiments: Why program couples into thinking Feb 14 is the only day they can express their feelings to 1 another? I would love to organize an ""Occupy Valentine's Day"" movement. We would hold protests outside flower shops, Godiva chocolate factories and Build-A-Bear stores. The protests would continue until these businesses stop bombarding us with commercials or until Valentine's Day is moved -- from February 14 to February 29 so that we are only compelled to observe it once every four years.

"(CNN) -- As Hawaii and Illinois join the list of states approving same-sex marriage, the United States crosses a big mark on the issue: More than 1 in 3 Americans will live where same-sex marriage is legal. It's a dramatic shift in a short period of time -- one not seen on other social issues. Hawaii's Legislature passed the measure Tuesday. Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed it into law Wednesday morning. It will go into effect December 2. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn plans to sign legislation for his state November 20. It will take effect June 1. In all, 16 states and the District of Columbia now have legal same-sex marriage. It's banned in other states, except New Mexico, which has no state law either way. Some counties in New Mexico have begun allowing same-sex marriage. The facts - same-sex marriage . The change in laws across the country comes as support for same-sex marriage has doubled in less than 20 years. A 1996 Gallup poll found 27% of Americans thought same-sex marriage should be legal. In 2013, that figure was 53%. President Obama's shift on the issue reflects that change. ""With today's vote, Hawaii joins a growing number of states that recognize that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters should be treated fairly and equally under the law,"" Obama, a native Hawaiian, said in a statement Tuesday. In his first presidential election campaign, in 2008, Obama opposed same-sex marriage. Groups opposed to same-sex marriage fear the steady change could lead to same-sex marriage being legalized nationally. After the Senate last week passed the Employee Non-Discrimination Act -- which would protect gay, lesbian, and transgender employees in the workplace -- National Organization for Marriage President Brian Brown said the act ""could be a Trojan horse that enables the marriage redefinition agenda to be forced on the entire nation through the courts."" ""We've seen how marriage redefinition leads to those who believe in traditional marriage being punished, labeled 'bigots' and 'haters' in the public square, and forced to be silent about their deeply held beliefs or face repercussions,"" he also wrote in a recent blog post. ""And their children? They're taught in schools that the values planted in them at home are bigoted and outdated, the equivalent of racism!"" Illinois legislature OKs same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Artist Yue Minjun is the man the behind the rictus grin that has become his work's motif. Part self portrait, part parody, part social commentary, his paintings have made him one the most instantly recognized contemporary artists in China. Born in 1962, Minjun graduated from the Hebei Normal University in 1989, the year that authorities cracked down on student protests in China, most notably in Tiananmen Square. Minjun admits that those events and the subsequent changes in Chinese society have had a major effect on his life and work. ""Politics is part of my daily life. It is there every day,"" he told CNN. ""The paintings reflect it and I can't escape it...it affects me greatly."" ""I also ask why after China experienced so many changes and so much progress we're still so immature politically. Why is it that we cannot resolve some of our daily problems politically? It seems like we're still struggling. ... I have a feeling that our nation is the most politically immature nation."" Art critics have often labeled his early work ""critical realism,"" a term that encompassed a number of Chinese artists in the early 1990s that used satire to juxtapose capitalism and consumerism with Chinese communism. Minjun says that the laughing character of his work was developed in response to the changes that China experienced since 1989. ""It has a lot to do with the changes brought about by China's reform. The changes cause the changes in people's behavior, very fast changes too. People's emotions are different too, full and stimulating. The laughing faces represent the emotional feelings of the people."" Many of his pieces painted in the early 1990s have become highly sought after. ""The Execution"" became the most expensive painting by a contemporary Chinese artist when it was sold in 2007 for $5.9 million. While that record is now held by another artist, his earlier works still attract high prices from collectors.""On the Lake"" was sold for $1.8 million in Hong Kong on April 5, 2010. Subsequently he's become a forger's favorite. ""I don't know who is copying me so there's no reason to be mad at anybody. There are too many of them. Maybe they like my work. It's OK. From the intellectual property point of view, they should not sign my name and sell them. It's not good for customers. It'd be fine if they sign their own names,"" he said. While that famous smile may remain in some of his work in the future, Minjun believes that China could do with slowing the pace of social change. ""Just slow down a bit maybe, so as to let people catch up with the same pace and so to live in a rather stable way. Going too fast would just make people lose balance, and somehow feel being abandoned or isolated, which is not good to the society as a whole,"" he said.","Artist Yue Minjun is the man behind the grinning face paintings in Chinese art .

"(CNN) -- While playing the part of Aung San Suu Kyi in biopic ""The Lady"", Michelle Yeoh felt as if she had ""lived"" with the Burmese pro-democracy leader for years. But when it came to actually meeting the real Nobel Peace Prize Winner in 2010, Yeoh didn't have a ready line. ""I wasn't quite sure how I should react or what I should do,"" she says. Yet on meeting her, Suu Kyi immediately put her at ease. ""We hugged and then she said 'Oh I'm so sorry for the mess, it's been non-stop, things are happening, people are coming to see me all the time'."" Yeoh had visited Suu Kyi at her home soon after her years of house arrest in Yangon had ended, but she says that she didn't discuss the film she was making. Yeoh says that was in order to protect her as it wasn't known how the ruling government in Myanmar would react. ""It wasn't an interview or an interrogation to that point. It was just an indulgence on my part to be able to see someone that I admire and learned to love."" ""So we sat down on the couch and she's very affectionate. Even though she's so petite and slim, you feel a great inner strength and a sense of ease about her."" Michelle Yeoh is better known for her parts in action films, from playing opposite Piece Brosnan's James Bond in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" to martial arts blockbuster ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" To try and portray such a renowned and revered figure was one the biggest challenges of Yeoh's life. To accurately play the part she had to learn Burmese to ensure the gravity of Suu Kyi's speeches were not lost. ""This was the role of a lifetime,"" says Yeoh.

"(CNN) -- Film director Feng Xiaogang may have made China's biggest box office hit, the disaster movie, ""Aftershock"", but he built his reputation in comedies, comparing himself to American director, Woody Allen. ""I wasn't sure what kind of comedy to do. I didn't think I'd be any good at doing Jim Carrey kind of slapstick comedies. I'm more like Woody Allen."" His ""Annie Hall"" moment came with 2001 comedy ""Big Shot's Funeral"" that featured Donald Sutherland and gained international recognition. But last year's ""Aftershock"" has elevated the 53-year-old to the position of the most bankable director in China. It took over $147 million at the box office in China making it the highest grossing film in the country's history. It will also be China's official entry into the Academy Awards this year. The film is based on the devastating earthquake of 1976 that killed thousands in the city of Tangshang, northeast of Beijing. ""I knew from the very beginning that this will become a film that would attract a big Chinese audience. It's a collective memory for everyone here in China so I knew the movie would touch everyone... This movie is also very relevant to many people's daily lives,"" he said. Feng's screen career began in television, directing and occasionally acting, before moving into filmmaking. He tested the limits of the censors along the way. ""We walk a very tight rope, we have to strike balance otherwise we're going to fall,"" he said about censors in China. ""Some of my earlier films might have been a little too edgy for a mainstream audience, at least that what the censors thought."" One of Feng's targets in his earlier films has been commercialism, including ""Big Shot's Funeral"" where a film director sells his funeral to advertisers. However some have criticized Feng for becoming too commercial in his own filmmaking, especially with overt product placement in ""Aftershock"". In response he told Xinhua News that product placement will be an increasingly important part of the Chinese film. He prides himself on having the common touch to attract big audiences. ""The biggest advantage is that I know what audiences want... of course not all of them, but at least I know what most of them want,"" he said. ""I don't think that the audience is God. Nor do I think we are above them. I just think that we are on a level playing field.""","Feng Xiaogang is director of China's biggest grossing film, ""Aftershock""

"(CNN) -- Nancy Kwan is the actress who immortalized ""The World of Suzie Wong'"" in the 1960 film. That fictionalized account of Hong Kong's red-light district helped create the cultural stereotype of the prostitute with a heart of gold, but for Kwan it launched a career in Hollywood. ""I'm kind of glad the film held up, and Hong Kong looks great ... And the film too, I think it's very enduring for me. It was my first film,"" she told CNN. Born to a Chinese father and British mother, Kwan grew up in Hong Kong. Her parents separated while she was a young child, and it was her father who smuggled the young Nancy and her brother out of Hong Kong in a wicker basket when Japanese troops occupied the former-British territory in the Second World War. Moving back to Hong Kong after the war, she landed the role of Suzie Wong after being asked to screen test for the film by the movie's director while she was watching auditions. The role propelled Kwan to international stardom and she had parts in musicals and was able to work alongside Hollywood great William Holden and crooner Dean Martin. She also formed a friendship with Bruce Lee. ""I did a film with Dean Martin, and Bruce was the stunt coordinator. We had some fight scenes and he taught us,"" she told CNN. Kwan's own life was documented in ""To Whom it May Concern: Ka Shen's Journey"" and it's now been fifty years since she made the film that changed her life. ""I don't know how my life would have turned out if I didn't do ""Suzie Wong."" But I just know that that was my choice, that was what I wanted to do, and that was my journey,"" she said.","Actress Nancy Kwan played lead role in 1960 film 'The World of Suzie Wong'

"(CNN) -- Before the match even starts, there's already one clear winner in the U.S.-Portugal match Sunday: American sports bars. Sure, they may be teeming with Americans who didn't know anything about the World Cup before USA's stunning victory over Ghana last Monday. But Sunday's game has enough drama and story lines to excite both fair-weather fans and diehard followers. Behold ... Ronaldo . Any confidence gained by beating Ghana will be tempered when USA faces Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. U.S. goal keeper Tim Howard is bracing for a serious challenge. ""He's the best in the world with the ball at his feet, good striker, left and right foot, dominant in the air ... the list goes on and on,"" Howard told reporters Saturday. ""We're going to do the best to bottle him up."" But even Ronaldo has an Achilles' heel -- or in this case, knee. The 29-year-old injured his left knee in the opening game against Germany. Portugal suffered a stunning 0-4 loss. But there's more to the team than just Ronaldo. ""Portugal is not only one player ... they have a lot of good players, and we have to be completely 100% with the whole team to stop this team and to win that game,"" U.S. midfielder Jermaine Jones said. ""Group of Death"" If USA wins Sunday, it's guaranteed a spot in the next round. If it draws or loses, the team still has one more game to try to escape the so-called ""Group of Death."" The Americans will have to play without Jozy Altidore, who will sit out because of his strained left hamstring. But the Portuguese have their backs against the wall. A loss to the Americans would eliminate Portugal. Rumble in the jungle . As if both sides didn't have enough challenges, they'll be playing in a giant sauna. Sunday's match will be in Manaus, a notoriously hot and muggy city in the Brazilian jungle. But U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said he's not too worried. ""We are thrilled to be here in Manaus. We're thrilled that this game is coming closer and closer,"" he said. ""I think we were very well prepared for this climate here. We have similar climates to play in."" Howard said he hasn't prepared any differently for the game in Manaus. ""I think we're fit and we're conditioned,"" he said. ""As long as we've got good sleep and we stay hydrated, we should be fine."" CNN's Jill Martin and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","The match will feature superstar Cristiano Ronaldo .

"(CNN) -- Artist Damien Hirst doesn't have a problem with money. The multi-millionaire is estimated to be the wealthiest living artist, but believes he remains true to his artistic integrity. ""I've always tried to be in the situation where money's a by-product of what I'm trying to do. No matter how big the money gets, you always have to make sure you're not using the art to chase the money, you're using the money to chase the art,"" he says. ""I've always been able to take all the money in the bank and put it on one sculpture."" Entitled ""For Heaven's Sake"" the platinum and pink diamond-studded infant's skull is the glistening centerpiece of Hirst's latest exhibition at Hong Kong's new Gagosian Gallery. Displayed alongside a series of photorealistic butterflies, it's a more upbeat show that perhaps he's known for. ""I just wanted to show things I've been working on more recently. There are a few things from 2008. We just had a crazy financial meltdown so I thought I'd do a show that's a bit more optimistic than my usual shows."" Hirst has never been far from controversy -- his earlier work has included dead animals suspended in formaldehyde -- and he's equally happy to go against convention in the business side of the art world. In 2008 he took a gamble by auctioning his work rather than going though a dealer. It paid off making $198 million, but Hirst is modest about the move. ""Lots of people say I was a genius and I was very clever when I did that. But I think it was luck,"" he says. ""Another week later and it could have failed miserably. It was sort of an idiotic move in a way. I say 'phew' rather than 'genius'."" Some have also criticized Hirst, like many other big name artists, for not actually making much of his own work. The diamond-encrusted skull was made by London jewelers Bentley & Skinners and the butterfly pictures produced by Hirst's artisans. ""People have always said things like that, and no matter how many times I answer the question people will always go but you didn't make it,"" he says. ""(It's my work) only in the same way that a Frank Gehry can be described as a Frank Gehry house. I'm sure that Mrs. Prada doesn't make the jackets either, but we all call them Prada and are happy to buy them. And maybe if you bought one that was actually made by Mrs. Prada we might not like it as much.""","Damien Hirst is thought to be the wealthiest living artist .

"(CNN)  -- A cricketing icon and sporting hero in his native Australia, Shane Warne's life off the cricket pitch has almost been as well documented as his career on it. Since he emerged on the international cricket scene in 1992 he's been credited with reviving spin bowling and has reached numerous milestones including taking over 1,000 international wickets. One ball he bowled to England's Mike Gatting in an international match in 1993 became known as ""the ball of the century."" ""I thought it was a pretty good ball ... when we saw it on the replay, we looked up on the big screen, and saw it, and I thought 'Hang on that wasn't too bad actually that was pretty cool,'"" Warne told CNN. It had commentators cooing, but it also alerted Warne to a whole new world of media scrutiny. ""I supposed it was something that changed my life, not just my cricket. Suddenly everyone wanted to know what I was doing, where did I go to the pub, which restaurant I went to, who was I hanging out with, all those different types of thing,"" he said. ""So really, it opened up another thing that I wasn't used to it at that stage."" From marital infidelities and taking banned substances to betting scandals, at times Warne's life was reported as an ongoing soap opera. Yet his engaging character and events on and off the cricket pitch led to acclaim, too, and art imitating life with ""Shane Warne: The Musical"" -- something that initially had the real Shane Warne cringing. ""At first, I was a bit reluctant to go and see it ... I'm not sure if I can sit there and watch my life. I didn't know what to expect,"" he said. ""The only person that knew that I was there was Eddie Perfect, the lead actor,"" he continued. ""I was seeing this blonde sort of hair here and he's got his phones, he actually ... he actually looks okay ... It was me on a bean bag when my mum was vacuuming and I thought, 'how does he know some of this stuff?'"" As well as getting used to his celebrity, Warne says he's put the well-documented controversies behind him and set up The Shane Warne Foundation to assist ill and under-privileged children. He's also extended his own cricketing career by focusing on the abbreviated version of the game in the Indian Premier League and captaining the Rajasthan Royals for the third year. ""I think when you're growing up you make mistakes. I made my fair share, I've made more than probably some,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- As Japan's fifth prime minister in four years, Naoto Kan hopes the revolving door of Japanese politics will remain closed long enough for him to reinvigorate the country. ""The Japanese economy has remained stagnant and suicides have remained 30,000 or so per annum for many years now. So, Japan as a country has lost its vigor, it feels very much closed in for various reasons,"" he told CNN in his first interview with a non-Japanese broadcaster. Kan indicated five areas that he and his government have been addressing to help open up the country since he succeeded former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in June. ""The first is that we need to grow the economy, the second is to strive for fiscal consolidation and the third is to reform our social security system, and the fourth is to achieve what I call regional sovereignty to change the shape of this country and the fifth is for the Japanese people to actively, with ownership, engage in diplomacy. ""Ten years down the road I believe that Japan will emerge stronger and more vigorous economically, socially and otherwise."" Considered a man of the people, Kan came to prominence in the 1990s when he exposed a government cover-up of HIV-infected blood distributed to hemophiliacs. He stepped down as leader of the Democratic Party of Japan six years ago after being embroiled in a pensions scandal, but his political revival was complete this summer when he succeeded Hatoyama as Prime Minister. Since he arrived in office, Kan has had to deal with a number of issues, among them the recent clash with China over the territorial claims of islands in the East China Sea. ""I believe in any country, matters that relate to its territory would, of course, provoke strong sentiments amongst the people of that country. But I trust that five years, ten years down the road, when people look back at how we dealt with that, people then will appreciate that my cabinet dealt with the issue in a calm manner,"" he said. ""[A]s far as Japan is concerned, there is no territorial issue connected to the Senkaku Islands. In fact, the Senkaku Islands are...inherent territory of Japan that is recognized in our history and also by international law."" The islands are known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. ""China has become a major presence for most countries around the world but notably for its neighboring countries in Asia. So I think it is a common position for Japan and its Asian neighbors that we certainly would strive to maintain as much as possible friendly relations with China. But at the same time seek China to behave in accordance with international rules."" Kan's predecessor resigned after failing to hold an election pledge to move an unpopular U.S. military base away from its current location on the island of Okinawa. While Kan told CNN that plans have been agreed to move the based, he reiterated the strength of the Japanese-U.S. relationship. ""I believe the Japan-U.S. relationship is in very good shape today. I have met President Barack Obama twice and in both of these meetings we have agreed that we should further deepen and advance the Japan-U.S. alliance and more specifically we have agreed that we should further deepen our relations on three pillars, that is security, our economy, and cultural, and people-to-people exchanges,"" he said. A strong yen, cause for concern for many Japanese companies and workers, was in part blamed by Kan on the state of the U.S. economy. ""I believe one of the basic causes for that situation is the fact that the U.S. economy, whilst undergoing some changes, if anything, is being steered toward a weaker dollar,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A Portugal player embarrassed himself Monday with his crazy decision to use his head the wrong way and he got panned for the way he lashed out at an opponent. That, and Portugal's play in a humbling 4-0 loss, were two of the lowlights on the fifth day of play in Brazil. As was a 0-0 draw that produced very little excitement. But then there was the stunning goal by a U.S. player whose inclusion in the game was a surprise to many. Here are a few of the day's big developments. That's not nice . Pepe, Pepe, Pepe. Bad boy!

"Washington (CNN) -- Top American officials harshly criticized Russia on Friday for its continued support of pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine following the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner. President Barack Obama said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has the ""most control"" over the situation in eastern Ukraine as intelligence indicates that rebels most likely shot down Flight 17 from an area they control with a surface-to-air missile. Nearly 300 people were killed in Thursday's disaster, including one American. Obama said the rebels' sophisticated weaponry and training needed to shoot down aircraft ""is coming from Russia"" and said the United States could ratchet up sanctions on Russia if it continues to support the rebels. But he stopped short of blaming Russia or Putin for the debacle in eastern Ukraine. But Senior Republican lawmakers, most outspoken on foreign affairs and often critical of Obama's foreign policy, didn't hold back. They were quick and direct in blaming Putin and called for additional, more stringent sanctions against Russia. ""I think he is responsible,"" said Sen. John McCain, a member of the foreign affairs and homeland security committees. ""I mean, it wasn't Vladimir Putin that pushed the button to launch the missile, but the whole scenario, including the buildup of Russian troops across the border ... I think that he gave them the material and wherewithal to do it -- or facilitated it."" Those calls come after Republicans have criticized Obama for months for not taking a harder line on Russia or meeting Ukrainian demands for more military assistance as it battled rebels. But now McCain said he sees ""no separation"" between Putin and the Ukrainian rebels, calling that movement ""clearly orchestrated"" by Moscow. And U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said investigators can't rule out the possibility that Russia may have helped the separatists operate the complex missile system. Power also emphasized the crucial role Russia has played in the conflict in Ukraine, as well as the role the country can play to bring peace to the region. ""Russia can end this war. Russia must end this war,"" she said. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois said he believes operating the missile system ""would need backup from a nation-state like Russia."" ""That would mean that Russian armed forces are directly involved in this wrongful death of roughly 300 people,"" Kirk asserted. Russian officials rebutted even the suggestion of Russian involvement and instead blamed Ukraine for creating a volatile environment in eastern Ukraine. And while there are conflicting reports over whether the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been taken to Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would ""insist on the most objective, most open and independent investigation"" into the incident. Still, Kirk called for the Justice Department to file a wrongful death lawsuit ""against Russian assets in the U.S."" and said the United States should target those assets to show Moscow that ""tens of millions of dollars will be lost."" Rep. Peter King, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, drew similar conclusions. He called Putin ""largely responsible"" for the downing of the passenger act, which Ukrainian officials have labeled as a terrorist act. ""If you're a world power and you give this type of sophisticated weaponry to insurrectionists, you're responsible for what happens after that,"" King said. ""This violates to me all norms of international behavior by a world power."" U.S. officials have not yet concluded whether separatists obtained the missile system used to down the Malaysian airliner from Russia, though Obama confirmed that Russia has supplied heavy weaponry to the separatists. King said Russia's arming of the rebels with sophisticated weaponry amounted to ""almost criminal negligence,"" even though he does not believe Putin wanted the passenger plane to be downed. And though the tragedy came a day after additional U.S. and European Union sanctions were leveled against Russia, McCain, King and other Republican lawmakers renewed calls for tougher sanctions. As retribution, King said the United States should consider further action such as preventing the Russian airliner Aeroflot from landing at U.S. and other Western airports. And King claimed such a ban would have a ""devastating effect on the Russian economy."" King's comments came after Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole called for a ""stronger response"" during an interview with CNN because ""pinprick sanctions aren't going to get the job done."" Cole also called for direct military assistance to Ukraine, which he said is ""fighting for its survival."" That's a request the Kiev government has voiced to officials in Washington, asking for armament and military advice. ""I think that's an unmistakable sign that we're going to support them, that we're going to try to give them the wherewithal to defend their territorial integrity."" Even before U.S. officials confirmed the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Russian or separatist involvement would be a ""game-changer."" Graham said that kind of information should trigger tougher sanctions from the United States and more support from other countries. Malaysian plane shot down in Ukraine: What happened?

"(CNN) -- Glenn Greenwald, the reporter who broke the news about secret U.S. surveillance programs, said the authorities who took his partner into custody at London's Heathrow Airport ""are going to regret what they did."" ""I am going to write my stories a lot more aggressively now,"" the Guardian reporter told Brazil's Globo TV on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. ""I am going to publish many more documents now. I am going to publish a lot about England, too, I have a lot of documents about the espionage system in England. Now my focus is going to be that as well."" Greenwald's partner, 28-year-old David Miranda, was held for nearly nine hours. He was reportedly passing through the airport on his way home to Brazil after leaving Berlin. Authorities seized his laptop, phone, and other materials. The White House knew the move was coming. ""There was a heads up that was provided by the British government,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday. So the United States knew it ""was likely to occur, but it's not something that we've requested and it's something that was done specifically by the British law enforcement officials there,"" he said. He would not comment on whether the United States has obtained material from Miranda's laptop -- and would not say whether President Barack Obama condemns the detention. Agents asked 'about my entire life' Miranda, also speaking to Globo TV in Rio, said agents were asking him questions ""about my entire life."" ""I was in a room, there were six different agents coming in and out and talking to me,"" he said. ""They took my computer, video games, cell phone, everything."" The detention was reported by The Guardian. Before releasing him, authorities seized Miranda's laptop, cell phone, video game consoles and USB sticks, Greenwald wrote for The Guardian. ""This is obviously a rather profound escalation of their attacks on the news-gathering process and journalism,"" he said. ""It's bad enough to prosecute and imprison sources. It's worse still to imprison journalists who report the truth. But to start detaining the family members and loved ones of journalists is simply despotic. Even the Mafia had ethical rules against targeting the family members of people they felt threatened by."" A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that a 28-year-old man was detained Sunday at Heathrow. The spokesman said the man was held for close to nine hours under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. 'Grave concern' Brazil's foreign ministry issued a statement Sunday expressing ""grave concern"" over the incident. Anger had erupted in Brazil when citizens learned of U.S. National Security Agency spying on Brazil. ""This measure is without justification since it involves an individual against whom there are no charges that can legitimate the use of that legislation. The Brazilian government expects that incidents such as the one that happened to the Brazilian citizen today do not repeat."" According to The Guardian, nine hours is the maximum time allowed before authorities must either release or arrest a detained individual. Miranda was returning to their home in Rio de Janeiro. While in Berlin, Miranda stayed with filmmaker Laura Poitras, who has worked ""extensively"" with Greenwald on his stories about the National Security Agency, the reporter wrote. The Guardian reported that it paid for Miranda's flights. ""Miranda is not a Guardian employee but often assists Greenwald in his work,"" the newspaper said. Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, in an editorial, wrote that ""Miranda is not a journalist, but he still plays a valuable role in helping his partner do his journalistic work."" He added that Greenwald's work on the reams of material provided by Snowden has been ""immensely complicated by the certainty that it would be highly unadvisable for Greenwald (or any other journalist) to regard any electronic means of communication as safe. The Guardian's work on the Snowden story has involved many individuals taking a huge number of flights in order to have face-to-face meetings."" Miranda is quoted by the Guardian as saying: ""So they think I have a big connection. But I don't have a role. I don't look at documents. I don't even know if it was documents that I was carrying. It could have been for the movie that Laura is working on."" ""If the UK and U.S. governments believe that tactics like this are going to deter or intimidate us in any way from continuing to report aggressively on what these documents reveal, they are beyond deluded,"" said Greenwald. ""If anything, it will have only the opposite effect: to embolden us even further.""","The White House knew the move was coming, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Contemporary and often abstract, Minsuk Cho's buildings can baffle, delight and dazzle. The 44 year-old South Korean is one of the world's foremost architects who is drawing upon different ideas while trying to convey a modern form of Korean architecture. ""Korea is a peninsula culture which contrasts from the big land culture of China, which is incredibly rich, and also the island culture of Japan,"" Cho told CNN. ""We've been very influenced; it's almost like a bridge country to observe the many other influences of the past. Also, there is some tough history."" Trying to distill amorphous concepts of Korean-ness into physical form was Cho's task when he designed the South Korean pavilion at the recent Shanghai Expo. For an architect who had spent a large part of his professional life outside of South Korea it was a unique experience. ""I'd been influenced by many other cultures, so that was a big challenge to address this Korean quality in a contemporary way,"" Cho said. ""We had a time challenge situation because they selected the design very late and most of the other pavilions had designs already. So -- bigger and faster -- and we had to deal with the economic situation. The combination of those three was tough -- a bigger, faster and cheaper situation -- which has become almost default situation in Asian cities."" Many of Cho's buildings are in South Korea, but some of his temporary structures, such as the ""Air Forest"" set up in Denver, U.S., in 2008 and ""Ring Dome"" seen in Milan and Yokohama, have made it abroad. Cho grew up believing he would be an artist, but it was only after he picked out a book from his father's library that he was inspired to follow in his father's footsteps and become an architect as well. That was when he was 12 years old and after he graduated from Yonsei University in South Korea he moved to the Graduate School of Architecture at Columbia, New York. From New York he moved to the Netherlands to work for OMA, an architecture firm led by Rem Koolhaas. His time working with Koolhaas, who is often called a ""starchitect"" as one of the industry's best known names, had a great affect on Cho. ""I think that what I learnt from him is that sometimes you get impatient with limitations but limitations can be a leverage... it just takes more patience and intelligent investigation about these limits,"" he said. ""He's really a positive role model. But usually [the term ""starchitect""] has a negative term for people that have plateaued at their creativity and start selling their brand name which is also happening a lot here. [Koolhaas] is constantly visiting and learning and observing from this country and enriching his own work."" It was not until 2003 that Cho made it back to South Korea to set up his firm, Mass Studies, so some questioned if he was the best candidate to design South Korea's pavilion at the Shanghai Expo. But for Cho his time abroad and work in general is much more than just a national concern and forging a singular identity. ""As an architect it's not about replacing one identity but more about enriching our work,"" he said.","Cho is a contemporary architect from South Korea .

"(CNN) -- Money has changed the game of golf -- and for the better, says Jack Nicklaus. The golfing legend, who holds the record for the most PGA major tournament wins, heartily approves of the big money that top players command and vast prize pots available to them. ""When we played, we had to play to win, to make a name, so that we could go make a living,"" Nicklaus told CNN. ""We didn't make a living playing golf. Today... we've got a couple of hundred guys who can actually make a living on the golf course, which is kind of neat. They don't have to go out and do a bunch of other things to be able to take care of their families."" After a professional career that lasted more than 40 years, Nicklaus now plays golf only once or twice a month. ""I'm done playing golf. And my record is there. And do I enjoy it when I play? Yeah sure. I enjoy it when I play. I have fun. But most of my efforts now are basically with my business."" Designing golf courses is Nicklaus' business, and China is a large part of where his company, Nicklaus Design, is finding opportunities. Talking at Pine Valley, a vast Nicklaus-designed 45-hole course outside of Beijing, Nicklaus believes that China will be home to future champions as well as millions of recreational players. ""I was asked a question when I was here on a trip. And it was before golf became an Olympic sport. And they said, 'Jack, do you ever see a time when you will see a Chinese player maybe be one of the top 10 players of the world?'"" ""I said, 'I won't be surprised in 10 or 15 years to see maybe half of the players in the world, come from this part of the world.' Because I do believe that they will. I think you're going to have a tremendous amount of players come from over here."" Nicklaus also believes golf's becoming an Olympic event at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in 2016 will give the game a boost, especially in countries like China and Brazil that are relatively new to the sport. ""Will the gold medal ever compete with the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open? Well, if you look at it, the rest of the world has never ever really worried too much about those. Now these emerging golf countries, you know what's big in these countries? Gold medals. The gold medal for the Olympics golf will be a major, major event.

"(CNN) -- Chinese actress Zhou Xun is a face recognized by millions, but so far, little known outside of China. The self-effacing 33-year old has recently graced the covers of China's editions of Harper's Bazaar and Elle magazines, but bringing her face to an audience away from China's mainland remains elusive. Zhou is demur on the topic of international acclaim, preferring only to say that she hopes to become a better actress rather than rival Zhang Ziyi as the face of Chinese cinema abroad. Her latest film is ""Confucius"" also starring Chow Yun Fat, but Zhou made her breakthrough on the big screen in 2000 appearing in ""Suzhou River,"" and was soon hailed by the Chinese media as one of the country's four best young actresses along with Zhao Wei, Xu Jinglei and Zhang Ziyi. Since then Zhou has taken on a number of alternative roles -- from a nerdy lab technician in ""All About Women"" to an alcoholic spy in ""The Message"" -- that have marked her out from her peers and attracted plaudits from critics and fans. She won best actress awards at the Paris Film Festival in 2000 and numerous awards in China for her role in 2005 film ""Perhaps Love"" and more recently, ""The Equation of Love and Death."" Coming from a middle class family, she was a young girl at a dance academy when spotted by a film director and encouraged to become an actress. ""Being an actress in China, I'm actually a very lucky actress... Especially now that Chinese movies are becoming more diverse with more viewers overseas,"" she told CNN. ""I think it's the same to be an actress anywhere because the profession is about attitudes towards events -- it is a process to try to understand life. I think this is the case for actors across the world. ""It all comes down to how you try to be a good person, and act responsibly."" Acting responsibly, that is, except when the role demands it. Her clean-cut image was tarnished, on-screen at least, when she took a method approach to her part as a hard-drinking spook in ""The Message."" She admits to turning up on the set intoxicated in order to get into character. Even though she lends her face to a number of products and high-end brands, she's honest enough to admit she has her flaws in real life as well. ""I think there are many faces to everyone. I also have my bad sides. Also I think everyone is trying to improve their shortcomings to become more wholesome. I have a lot of shortcomings, so it's 50-50,"" she said.","Zhou Xun is one of the most famous actresses in China .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A 9-month-old Pakistani boy who was booked in connection with an attempted murder case is no longer wanted by police, his family's lawyer said. Days earlier, the baby had bawled as he was fingerprinted in Lahore after his family members allegedly threw bricks at police trying to collect an unpaid bill. The ordeal started February 1 when several police officers and a bailiff went to a home hoping to get payment for a gas bill, said Atif Zulfikar Butt, a senior police official in Lahore. A scuffle ensued, during which the infant's father, one of his teenage sons and others in the residence severely injured some of the officials by tossing bricks their way, according to Butt. That led authorities to seek out those in the house. An official document aired by CNN affiliate GEO News shows charges of stoning and attempted murder. How and why the baby was implicated was unclear, though the Lahore police official acknowledged that the child appeared in court Wednesday and was booked as his grandfather held him. Following media coverage of the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif directed police to immediately suspend a Pakistani official for registering the case against the baby boy, according to police.","The boy was previously booked and fingerprinted in Lahore .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday a sweeping final pilot fatigue rule governing how much time off commercial passenger pilots must have between work shifts, ensuring they have a longer opportunity for rest before they enter the cockpit. The new rule sets a 10-hour minimum rest period prior to a flight duty period, a two-hour increase over the old rules. The new rule also mandates that a pilot must have an opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep within the 10-hour rest period. The DOT said the proposal was science based, and would significantly increase public safety. The final rule will take effect in two years, according to the FAA, to allow commercial passenger airline operators time to transition, rearrange schedules and indoctrinate pilots. ""This is a major safety achievement,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. ""We made a promise to the traveling public that we would do everything possible to make sure pilots are rested when they get in the cockpit. This new rule raises the safety bar to prevent fatigue."" LaHood disputed criticism the changes in the rule took a long time. ""We wanted to make sure we got it right. We took time to listen to people. Every voice was heard,"" LaHood said. ""You can't implement overnight. It takes time."" ""Every pilot has a personal responsibility to arrive at work fit for duty. This new rule gives pilots enough time to get the rest they really need to safely get passengers to their destinations,"" said FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta. It was a point echoed by Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Florida, who released a statement saying, ""While the final rule provides improvement for aviation safety, pilots must take personal responsibility for coming to work rested and fit for duty. The government cannot put a chocolate on every one of their pillows and tuck them in at night."" The FAA said it ""expects pilots and airlines to take joint responsibility when considering if a pilot is fit for duty, including fatigue resulting from pre-duty activities such as commuting. At the beginning of each flight segment, a pilot is required to affirmatively state his or her fitness for duty. If a pilot reports he or she is fatigued and unfit for duty, the airline must remove that pilot from duty immediately."" The rule has been a long time in coming. In the mid 1990s, the FAA tried to update its flight and duty time regulations, but withdrew its rule under opposition from airlines. But momentum for change increased following the February 12, 2009, crash of Continental flight 3407 near Buffalo, New York, which killed 50 people. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded pilot fatigue contributed to the crash, although it said it could not be attributed solely to fatigue. The hearing, though, spotlighted the practice among some pilots to commute lengthy distances to their jobs. The pilot of Colgan Air 3407 commuted from Tampa, Florida, and the co-pilot commuted from Seattle, Washington, to their base in Newark, New Jersey. The new rule addresses potential cumulative fatigue by placing weekly and 28-day limits on the amount of time a pilot may be assigned any type of flight duty, according to the FAA. The rule also places 28-day and annual limits on actual flight time. It also requires that pilots have at least 30 consecutive hours free from duty on a weekly basis, a 25 percent increase over the old rules. The FAA said the rule also incorporates the latest fatigue science to set different requirements for pilot flight time, duty period and rest based on the time of day pilots begin their first flight, the number of scheduled flight segments and the number of time zones they cross. The previous rules included different rest requirements for domestic, international and unscheduled flights. Those differences were not necessarily consistent across different types of passenger flights, and they did not take into account factors such as start time and time zone crossings. Another component of the rule includes when a pilot's day begins. The FAA said, ""The allowable length of a flight duty period depends on when the pilot's day begins and the number of flight segments he or she is expected to fly, and ranges from 9-14 hours for single crew operations. The flight duty period begins when a flight crew member is required to report for duty, with the intention of conducting a flight and ends when the aircraft is parked after the last flight. It includes the period of time before a flight or between flights that a pilot is working without an intervening rest period."" The Air Line Pilots Association expressed its support for the new rule covering passenger flights. ""Today's pilot fatigue rule release marks historic progress in what must be an unrelenting commitment to ensuring the highest safety standards throughout the airline industry. The Air Line Pilots Association, Int'l (ALPA), is gratified that the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration have delivered on their pledge, and a Congressional mandate, to issue new flight- and duty-time regulations and minimum rest requirements for airline pilots,"" said Capt. Lee Moak, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, an independent aviation safety organization. Moak said while the new rule brings ""much-needed science improvements to flight and duty regulations,"" he expressed disappointment that cargo operations ""are being held to a lesser standard.""

"(CNN) -- There's no need to tell football fans in Seattle to take it up a notch. They're doing just fine, thank you. After setting a Guinness World Record for noise at an outdoor stadium in September, CenturyLink Field went seismic during Monday Night Football, registering as an earthquake at a recording station about a block from the stadium. How big, you ask? In the magnitude 1-to-2 range, according to John Vidale, a professor at the University of Washington and the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. Vidale said his staff recorded five separate seismic events during Seattle's 34-7 pasting of New Orleans -- a match-up of two of the NFL's top teams. The most intense episode came late in the first quarter, when Seahawks defensive lineman Michael Bennett returned a Saints fumble 22 yards for a touchdown. Seattle fans did this once before. In 2011, a Marshawn Lynch touchdown shook the earthquake recording station too. And in 1988, college fans at Louisiana State University rocked the bayou in a come-from-behind victory over 4th-ranked Auburn, registering on the campus seismograph.","Fans rock the stadium and show up on an earthquake recording system .

"(CNN) -- Stephen Fry is a comedian, actor and writer, who has become something rare in British public life; a national treasure. The self-effacing 53-year-old, who is renowned for his modesty as much as his wit, generally recoils at the unofficial title. If someone had told Fry when he was a teenage tear-away -- he was jailed for credit card fraud when just 17 -- that he would achieve his current level of success and garner so much affection he would have been shocked. ""I wouldn't have believed them for a minute. I think I would have almost exploded with hope and distrust, you know,"" he told CNN. ""It's like a child being told that they are going to see Willy Wonka, they think, 'It's not true, I will actually die. It'd better be true.' And I don't think I would have believed it, I do have to hug myself at how lucky I've been."" After some turbulent teenage years, Fry went to Cambridge University where he met Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson; forging friendships and collaborations that he admits helped to define the rest of his life. From his comedy writing with Laurie, Fry wrote and appeared in numerous TV comedies and shows, including the long-running comedy series ""Blackadder"". He's since gone on to appear in movies, host the cerebral celebrity quiz show ""QI"" and most recently appear in the hit U.S. series ""Bones"". While dividing his time between numerous projects, from acting and directing to writing and indulging his love of technology, one constant in Fry's life has been coping with manic depression. ""I swing from a hyper state in which, quite far from feeling self-disgust and self-hatred, you are grandiose... You have feelings of grandiosity and creative power and connection to the world and absolute empathy with all living and inanimate things and everything seems possible and it's very hard to sleep and your body's buzzing,"" he said. ""When you're depressed, the idea of there being a tomorrow seems insupportable, nonsensical and pointless and it's very hard to shake off. You don't want to connect to other people, you just want to pull the social duvet over your head and be done with it all. It can be very bad indeed and painful."" Through work with mental health charities and making the Emmy-award winning documentary, ""The Secret Life of a Manic Depressive"", he has gone some way to removing the stigma surrounding the illness and creating greater public awareness. ""I think of it as being the weather, the point of the weather is that it is not under our control, we can't make it sunny when it's stormy, we can't make it rain when it is dry and hot. But it is also true that it's real. ""The classic mistake is to somehow imagine that it's your fault and that it isn't really there and that if you snap your fingers then the dark clouds will rise. ""I think we're a long way from understanding manic depression, a long way. But I think we're at least now better able to understand its effect and begin to talk about it more openly.""","Stephen Fry is a British actor, writer and comedian .

"(CNN) -- A Beijing court has prosecuted more than a dozen people for organizing the illegal sale of 51 human kidneys worth about 10 million yuan (US$1.6 million) in one of China's biggest organ trafficking cases. The ring, headed by Zheng Wei, allegedly helped scores of customers find organs by paying mostly young and poor men approximately 25,000 yuan each. Their kidneys were then sold for about 200,000 yuan, according to the state-controlled People's Daily. The Beijing Haidian District People's Procuratorate prosecuted Zheng and 15 others involved in the scam, including some doctors from state-run hospitals. According to reports, an operation room from a township hospital in Jiangsu Province was set up between March and June of 2010, where more than 20 kidneys were removed from living ""sellers"" and sent to Beijing for patients suffering from kidney disease. Zheng then purportedly moved the operational base to Beijing in the second half of the year to ensure easier transportation of the organs and to minimize their spoiling. Police busted up the ring in December. One analyst believes the shortage of donated organs in China is the main motive for the growing practice, but added that the issue of ethics played its part. ""The involvement of medical staff in such illegal acts reflects management loopholes in hospitals. Strengthening professional ethics of doctors is important to wiping out the illegal dealings,"" Zhou Zijun, a professor at Peking University's School of Public Health, told the People's Daily.","Sixteen people allegedly helped sell 51 human kidneys worth $1.6 million .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Song Byeok had every reason to be pleased with his success. A gift for drawing led to a prestigious career as a propaganda artist and full membership in North Korea's communist party. Then the food shortages started. Like tens of thousands of other North Koreans in the mid-1990s, Song made forays across the Tumen River to find food in China. Despite witnessing a better material life across the border, he says, he never doubted that North Korea was culturally superior. He never considered leaving his homeland for anything more than food. ""I was a believer. I saw North Koreans as pure,"" Song said. ""And we needed the Great Leader to protect us from outsiders."" Today, Song paints in Seoul, South Korea, his art haunted by his former whole-hearted belief in the North Korean regime. Song's paintings chronicle a personal, often agonizing journey from child-like allegiance to the country's founder and ""Great Leader,"" Kim Il Sung, and his son, ""Dear Leader"" Kim Jong Il, to Song's life today as a contemporary artist. In his former life, he would paint boyish-looking soldiers with heroic features across an entire side of a factory to inspire workers with the same patriotism he believed in. His current paintings explore themes of freedom while skewering his former devotion to North Korea's leaders. He paints children in military uniforms, their heads bowed and eyes closed. His trademark work shows Kim Jong Il's face atop Marilyn Monroe's famous film pose on a sidewalk grate, holding down her skirt as it billows around her hips. The painting created a stir in South Korea, where American Greg Pence saw it and raised funds on Kickstarter to exhibit Song's work this winter in Washington and Atlanta. Song is passionate and sometimes brooding when discussing North Korea but gracious and open about his deeply personal passage from propaganda artist to painter who anguishes over oppression in North Korea. Obama: North Korea will achieve nothing with provocation . Song's journey to disbelief began the moment he watched, helpless, as his father was caught in a current during a river crossing to China and drowned. Song was halfway across when his father was swept away; he swam back but was unable to rescue him. Despondent, Song searched for his father's body along the riverbank but was captured by North Korean border guards. Despite his rank as a party member, getting caught meant questioning and torture by North Korean guards to confirm that he was not working for the South Koreans or the foreign missionaries based in China who proselytize among defectors. ""There were no exceptions,"" he said. ""All who are caught are investigated."" In North Korea, a brutal choice . The torment of not recovering his father's remains was much greater than the broken teeth and beatings, Song said. The beatings were so harsh, he said, he was close to death, and he believes that he was released so he would not die in custody. More than bones, the guards' treatment broke Song's belief in the regime. He describes the moment he left jail as if a veil had been lifted: He saw the world with a new clarity. As he hobbled through the streets, wondering how he'd get home, he decided he wanted a different life. He decided to defect. In a country of 25 million, only about 20,000 have defected and settled in South Korea, according to the South Korean government. There are no precise figures for how many defectors live in hiding in China; estimates from governments, researchers and non-governmental organizations vary from 25,000 to more than 400,000. ""When people are picked up in China and repatriated, they face prosecution back in North Korea if they are believed to have met with South Koreans or missionaries,"" said Marcus Noland, a North Korea specialist at the Peterson Institute. China labels North Korean escapees ""economic migrants"" and forcibly returns them despite accounts of torture and execution. So those hoping to defect must make their way across China to a third country. Of those North Koreans interviewed in China, only about one in 10 say they left because of a longing for freedom, according to W. Courtland Robinson, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University who has studied the issue for more than a decade. The vast majority who leave give the same explanation Song did for his pre-defector forays into China during the famine: the search for work or food. ""The (North Korean) system is so integral to who you are,"" Robinson said. ""People generally don't say 'I am frustrated, and I want out.' "" Song's paintings explore that theme: a devotion to serving North Korea's leaders so strong that citizens view it as part of their identity. ""Flower Children"" shows a gaggle of smiling, uniformed schoolgirls waving and holding North Korea's standard reading primers, ""The Story of Kim Jong Il's Childhood"" and ""History of Kim Il Sung."" The girls exude childish charm, but some faces show a weariness that only comes with age, and their eyes are all closed. Their shoes have holes. ""They believe they are happy,"" Song said. ""They believe they are so much better off than the rest of the world because of their two leaders, who are like two suns."" Song can still recite some of the pages from those reading primers, and he remembers walking to school in similar shoes. Such memories inspire him to paint, he says, and he hopes people find his interpretations of those memories compelling. ""Tumen River"" is done in classical Chinese style. At first glance, with its brushed mountain landscape, the painting looks like it could be from the Tang Dynasty. On closer inspection, its subtleties portray North Korea's crippling poverty. Peasants work fields with oxen while nearby, a broken-down tractor rusts. Soldiers fish for their dinner downstream from women doing laundry by hand. In the hills above the river are billboards common throughout North Korea, with phrases such as ""All Glory To Our Nation's Agricultural Independence"" and ""All Glory to Our Nation's Great Strength."" Near the billboards, peasants dig for edible roots, which are commonly steamed in a kettle before being eaten. ""The past and the present of North Korea are the same,"" Song said. ""There is no progress."" Despite the large and absolute devotion of most North Koreans to their government, Song is optimistic about their future under Kim Jong Un, who recently inherited the country's reins after his father, the Dear Leader, died. In a nation where every decision flows from the top, a change of leadership can transform everything. ""Kim Jong Un will want to try something new,"" Song said. ""You can not change the nature of youth."" If Kim Jong Un allowed the population access to television, websites and radio from Seoul, with its opulent lifestyle, change would be inevitable, and the emotional connection to the government would gradually wither, Song believes. Meanwhile, being caught with foreign media can mean public execution or three generations of your family being sent to prison camp. So few people outside the party elite dare to smuggle radios or DVDs from China. But if those punishments were ever removed, Song says, North Koreans would probably lose their devotion to the regime as quickly as their Japanese neighbors stopped worshiping their emperor after World War II. It would take only a clear view of the poverty and oppression in their life to spark cataclysmic demands for change, Song says. The spectacular failure of its command economy has made North Korea one of the poorest nations on Earth. By one plausible account, teenage defectors of the past decade are 5 inches shorter and 25 pounds lighter than their South Korean counterparts. ""I feel a great deal of anger now that I understand the problems"" in North Korean society, he says. ""I never felt it when I was there.""","Once a propagandist, defector Song Byeok now paints satirical works about North Korea .
His paintings dwell on miseries of life in his homeland, joy of the freedoms he found in the South .
From a country of 25 million, only about 20,000 North Korean defectors live in the South .

"New York (CNN) -- Abu Hamza al-Masri steadfastly denied Monday that he aided terrorists in incidents that span the globe, from a remote Oregon ranch to the dusty desert of the Arabian Peninsula. He described Osama bin Laden as a hothead, in charge of an unfocused organization that has betrayed the Afghan people. As for the Taliban regime, it doesn't need his money; it has ""millions,"" yet doesn't feed its own people, he said. But in Manhattan, by invoking 9/11 and bin Laden's name, al-Masri mused, ""you can convict a person of killing the Dead Sea."" Al-Masri testified on direct examination over three days in a federal courtroom less than a mile from the site of ground zero and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He's accused of aiding kidnappers during a 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen; facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan; supplying goods and services to the Taliban; and attempting to establish an al Qaeda-style training camp on the West Coast of the United States. The Egyptian-born cleric testified last week about his path to becoming the high-profile imam of a London mosque, whose sermons allegedly inspired several notorious terrorists, including 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta. Al-Masri said he went to London as a young man because loved the Western lifestyle, wanted to make money and have fun ""American style,"" he smiled. He worked as a bouncer and strip-club manager before bits of Islamic teachings from friends began to penetrate his mind and the hypocrisy of his lifestyle hit him like a slap in the face. The defendant broke down twice on the stand describing key moments that helped shape his ideology, like seeing a young Bosnian boy -- maybe 12 -- wearing camouflage and clutching a Kalashnikov, receive a hug from a grieving mother as thousands of other Muslim men and boys lay dead in the Srebrenica mass graves nearby. ""I wish I trained my son,"" the woman said. Al-Masri said he left Bosnia with the belief that training in physical jihad -- holy struggle -- even for children is crucial to the defense of Muslims when governments and outside forces fail to keep them safe. He's seen it from Afghanistan to Chechnya, he said: ""The West will not do the job."" The government's three-week case against al-Masri was an effort to connect the dots between the defendant and events thousands of miles away through key witnesses who often never met the cleric themselves, and are testifying as government informants in exchange for leniency or protection. The pivotal government prosecution witness was James Ujaama, a Seattle man who conceived the idea for a pay-as-you-go jihad training camp on a large patch of barren land outside Bly, Oregon, in 1999. He faxed a sales pitch to al-Masri from a local Kinkos, he said on the stand. ""It looks just like Afghanistan,"" Ujaama wrote to the prominent preacher, asking for trainers in both the physical and spiritual aspects of holy war to be sent from London so fighters could be readied for the Afghanistan front lines. Two men were allegedly sent by al-Masri to aid with the effort, carrying cash and training materials, but left once they realized Ujaama's promises were empty, according to testimony. Al-Masri said on the stand Monday that he scanned only the first few lines of the fax before tossing it in the trash and considered it a ""hallucination."" Unbeknownst to him, he said, the paper was fished out of the garbage by Oussama Kassir, a Lebanese-born Swedish citizen who lived at the defendant's London mosque periodically and was eager to make a name for himself. Kassir decided to pursue the idea of a camp without al-Masri's knowledge while trading on the prominent cleric's name, the defense claims. Kassir was convicted in 2009 on 11 terrorism-related counts relating to the Oregon facility and operating terrorist websites, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Prosecutors also allege that al-Masri sent Ujaama to Afghanistan in 1999 to deliver envelopes of cash and a young recruit for the front lines. Al-Masri maintained on the stand that he in fact had tried to talk the young man out of traveling to Afghanistan to fight, and that he still does not know whether Ujaama actually brought him along. He scoffed at the thought he'd use Ujaama -- a ""troublemaker"" and known liar who had never set foot in Afghanistan -- for such an errand, when any of the several dozen Afghani veterans in the mosque would have provided more reliable options. He conceded he gave Ujaama money to transport but said it was charity for a secret girls' school and widows of mujahedeen fighters, not the Taliban regime or al Qaeda -- something Ujaama's testimony corroborated. Ujaama admitted on the stand that his past is marred by a range of criminal endeavors, including picking up knock-off watches in New York City and passing them off as expensive brand originals; selling a stolen laptop during an airport bathroom rendezvous; and evading prosecution by fleeing to Belize. He spent approximately six years in prison for his role in the defendant's alleged crimes and testified as part of a deal with the government that allowed for a significant reduction in jail time. Federal prosecutors have also alleged that al-Masri aided kidnappers of a large tour group in Yemen in 1998 and called to the stand two survivors of the harrowing hostage drama that left four of their fellow travelers dead. While al-Masri conceded on the stand he supplied the satellite phone used by the hostage takers, he said the group's only plan that he knew of was to topple the Yemeni government. He'd been asked to act as the group's spokesperson some five months before the incident, he said, and bought the phone in his own name, because as a spokesperson in a politically charged climate ""you can't afford to do anything but what's legal, transparent."" When he learned of the kidnapping, he felt ""betrayed because of ignorance,"" he testified, and immediately issued a public statement to defuse the situation and discourage a disastrous, knee-jerk response by Yemeni authorities. In his only telephone contact with the kidnappers during the event, he urged them to let the hostages call their respective embassies and even called the satellite phone salesman to purchase 500 British pounds' worth of pre-paid minutes for that purpose, he testified. Asked what philosophy guides him as a cleric, al-Masri said he tries to defuse violent conflict with his impassioned sermons: ""The harshest of all talks is better than the easiest of all wars."" Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan will begin his cross examination of al-Masri Tuesday morning.","London-based cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri criticizes bin Laden, Taliban on the stand .

"New York (CNN) -- As a 9/11 widow, I understood my role on the memorial jury to have both a personal and a public component. At no time was the confluence of those roles more clear to me than when we discussed the placement of victims' names on the memorial. And nothing had a more profound effect on my feelings of closure than the decision to use the concept of ""meaningful adjacencies"" to determine the placement of those names. When I first heard the phrase ""meaningful adjacencies,"" I had no idea how powerful the concept would prove to be. At the time, in 2004, those of us who had the honor of serving on the jury that selected the winning design for the 9/11 Memorial had been struggling hard with how best to display the names. It was clear that arranging the names alphabetically or by company would be too cold and dispassionate, as if this were a listing you'd see in a building directory posted near the elevator. The alternative, displaying the names randomly, seemed at first to make more sense. After all, it was random, wasn't it, who lived and who died on that terrible morning 10 years ago? But ultimately, we realized, a random arrangement felt wrong, too. The deaths of our loved ones may have been random, but their lives were not. In the concept of meaningful adjacencies, we had at last found a powerful response to the senselessness of our loved ones' deaths. Placing names in thoughtful proximity to one another would give us the opportunity to bear witness to the shared care and concern, the labor and joy that bound these people together while they were alive -- whether as siblings or colleagues, as friends or family, or even as former strangers who turned to one another for comfort at that moment of cataclysm. In a profound way, we realized that meaningful adjacencies would convey both the disturbing appearance of randomness with a comforting underlying truth: We are all connected. The idea captured us all. Michael Arad, the designer of the memorial, came up with this simple yet powerful concept. I will always remember how he explained it to the jury: A memorial is a monument unless it lists the names of those lost. It was crucial that the names on this memorial be displayed, and displayed with purpose. And so although it would be a Herculean task to get the needed input from family members, we all felt strongly that the effort to evoke this underlying network of connections would elegantly and simply convey not only the way in which these precious lives were lost but, perhaps more importantly, how these precious lives were lived. It would be upon us, the family members, to decide who to list our loved ones near, and it would come from knowledge that only we could supply. When the 9/11 Memorial sent personalized letters to victims' next of kin across the globe, there were more than 1,200 meaningful adjacency requests. All of them were honored. Powerfully calling to mind the image of an invisible web linking those who perished, the reasons for some adjacencies will be fairly obvious to the general public. The Hanson family — Sue, Peter, and their 2-year-old daughter Christine, the youngest victim on September 11 — died together on Flight 175 and will be listed together. Their names might have been adjacent even in an alphabetical listing. But then there is a family that died on Flight 77 — Charles Falkenberg and Leslie Whittington, married for 17 years, and their children Zoe and Dana — whose names would have been separated by a simple alphabetical order. And then there are adjacencies that express connections that are more hidden, and yet profound. Abigail Ross Goodman lost both her father, Richard Ross, on Flight 11, which crashed into the North Tower, and her best friend, Stacey Leigh Sanders, who was working that morning in the North Tower on the 96th floor. For Abigail Ross Goodman, the names of these two loved ones will forever be linked in her memory and now also at the memorial. It's important to note that the memorial also launched a Memorial Guide, a digital tool to help family members and visitors locate any name. Not only does the guide show the exact place where a person's name will be, but it also provides background information on all of the victims and lists any adjacencies. People will be able to locate a name in advance via the 9/11 Memorial's website or use an on-site kiosk to find a loved one or learn more about any of the victims. In the case of my husband, David Berry, I requested that he and his trusted colleague and friend, Thomas Theurkauf, be listed near each other. Although we will never know for certain, Tom's widow and I are convinced that our husbands died together. There is no more powerful testament to the special bonds that could not be broken by the murderous attacks of that day. We are comforted to know that their names will be kept close, reflecting how they stood together on the morning of September 11. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paula Grant Berry.","Paula Grant Berry was one of the jurors who selected the memorial design .

"Washington (CNN) -- The most conservative Republicans are embracing some of the same campaign strategies -- decreased federal spending, lower tax rates and repealing Obamacare -- that many say led to the party's defeat in November. It may be a telling glimpse of the GOP leadership's ongoing gut check. The message: We may have lost the presidential battle but we can still win the war of principles. ""First, the Republican Party needs to be a conservative party with no apologies,"" Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said on Thursday to audience applause at the Conservative Political Action Conference. CPAC is an annual event which also serves as a way to check the pulse of the political right. This year's conference is being held along the banks of the Potomac River just outside Washington in Maryland. It is the same type of message House Budget Committee chairman and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan echoed earlier in the week. ""The election didn't go our way,"" said the Wisconsin Republican, who is slated to make an appearance at the conference this week. ""Believe me, I know what that feels like. That means we surrender our principles? That means we stop believing in what we believe in?"" For the most conservative wing of the party's faithful, the answer is a resounding ""no."" Such emotions are a deep undercurrent in the GOP's search for identity. That soul-searching is unfolding as party leadership braces itself for the next round of contentious budget battles and takes tentative steps toward working with a president whose very name is still a rallying cry for many in the base. Major conservative conference comes at crucial time for GOP . Agenda topics include ""Reversing Obamacare and Reaching Minority Voters: The Language That Works"" and ""Has Atlas Shrugged? Business in Obama's America."" Flying in the face of the old-time religion fervor, Republicans face the task of wading through internal divisions as they await the Republican National Committee's expected release of a post-mortem ""Growth and Opportunity"" report that dissects why the party lost the 2012 presidential election. The autopsy is expected to highlight issues like beefing up RNC technology, voting by mail, fundraising and other campaign mechanics, as well as outreach to specific demographic groups in hopes of identifying more effective ways to attract minority and younger voters. The report will deal with things that can be fixed, some Republican strategists say. The core message, they say, is solid. It just needs better packaging. In this, some party faithful see Ryan and his budget as an indication that the party is on the right path. Ryan's budget shows ""the Republican Party is sticking to its principles of fiscal responsibility,"" said Ron Bonjean, a veteran GOP strategist for several congressional leaders and partner at the communications firm Singer Bonjean Strategies. The lessons the overall party ""learned were more about the presidential candidate"" and less about the broader party, he said. White House charm offensive does not extend to Ryan budget . White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, essentially accused Ryan of misreading last November's election in releasing a spending plan on Tuesday that seeks to unravel much of the Obama domestic agenda. Ryan said repealing the president's health care law is critical to efforts to balance the budget. ""We will never be able to balance the budget if you keep 'Obamacare' going because 'Obamacare' is a fiscal train wreck,"" Ryan said on Tuesday. Ryan's budget and a Democratic plan by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray of Washington, which will likely include a tax increase for the wealthy and business and some spending cuts, are seen as partisan efforts unlikely to win congressional approval. And that's the problem, some Republicans say. Conservative positions â€” like those championed by Ryan on issues like trimming entitlement spending as a way of cutting the deficit -- are lost in messaging that reminds voters too much of a failed presidential platform. ""They should have learned from the 2012 elections, and stand by the issue that the debt is the main problem. But the language has to be different,"" said Maricruz Magowan, an economist and conservative political commentator. ""The Republican Party has problems in communication on a number of levels. The way he is communicating in a 'take it or leave it' way is not going to resonate with the American people,"" Magowan said. But the Republican Party needs more than a message makeover, political experts say. It needs a major overhaul. ""Now we know the messaging was bad. And we are getting to the second stage: the recalibration,"" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger wrote recently. ""'Think of it as a reappraisal,' one senior GOP strategist told me. I prefer to think of it as a matter of survival."" CNN's Jim Acosta and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Conservative Republicans revisiting core policies in search to redefine message .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A seismic researcher told CNN Sunday that he warned the owner of the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant two years ago that the facility could be vulnerable to a tsunami. The owner, Tokyo Electric Power Company, appeared to ignore the warning, said seismologist Yukinobu Okamura. TEPCO has not responded to Okamura's allegation. Okamura heads Japan's Active Fault & Earthquake Center. He said he told members of a TEPCO safety committee two years ago that data collected from layers of earth show that in the year 869 a massive tsunami devastated where the plant now is. The six-unit Fukushima Daiichi plant is located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Without adequate safety measures, a repeat of the first millennium disaster at the site of a nuclear power plant could be far worse, Okamura said he told the committee then. He said he raised the issue because no one else did. ""I found that odd so I really wanted to speak out and let people know about it,"" Okamura said. ""No one reacted in any way."" Instead, committee members discussed a 1938 earthquake in the region that killed only one person. Okamura said that is understandable because there was far more data available about that event. However, the power company should have considered the 869 tsunami, he said. TEPCO representatives have held frequent press conferences since the March 11 earthquake triggered Japan's nuclear crisis. However, critics say direct questions rarely get direct answers from the company. That includes Okamura's allegation. One critic is the Japanese government, which on Sunday pressed TEPCO for better information about the Fukushima Daiichi plant as it battled against criticism of its own handling of the crisis there. Yukio Edano, the government's point man for the crisis, issued what he called ""stronger instructions"" to the Tokyo Electric Power Company to fully disclose as much as possible about conditions at the plant. ""Every piece of information must be provided accurately and swiftly"" to Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, Edano, the chief Cabinet secretary, told reporters. ""Without this communication, it's very difficult for the government to (establish) proper safety measures."" Workers have spent more than two weeks trying to stave off potential meltdowns in three reactors at the plant. Edano said Tokyo Electric needs to be up-front with the Japanese people -- millions of whom get power from the company, and millions more have been affected by radioactive emissions stemming from the crisis. Tokyo Electric is Japan's largest utility. Both the company and the Japanese government have been criticized for failing to provide more detailed information about the situation at Fukushima Daiichi, one of three nuclear plants the company owns in northern Japan. A poll by Japan's Kyodo News Agency found the government is getting poor marks for its handling of the crisis, with 58% telling pollsters that they disapprove. Though 57% of Japanese approve of how the government has moved to provide relief for victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, the poll found, only 39% approve of how it has managed the situation at Fukushima Daiichi. Edano said the government has done ""everything possible."" ""But we also realize that many of the people in the affected areas have been very inconvenienced, and they are in a very serious crisis,"" he added. ""We understand that, and there may be more such difficulties ahead."" Edano said Prime Minister Naoto Kan has been talking with local leaders ""one by one"" to find out what they need. He declined to share details of those conversations, telling reporters, ""We are simply focusing on providing better assistance for the residents."" Yukuiya Amano, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, returned to his native Japan shortly after the crisis erupted to press Kan for more information. ""In the beginning, we had some difficulty,"" Amano told CNN Sunday. ""But I went to Tokyo and I talked to Prime Minister Kan and I asked him to facilitate the flow of information."" Kan ""promised me the highest level of transparency, and the flow improved,"" he said. The government has ordered residents within a 20-kilometer (13-mile) radius to evacuate and those living from 20 to 30 kilometers to stay indoors. But levels of radioactivity above the levels considered safe for infants have turned up in drinking water as far south as Tokyo, and the anti-nuclear environmental group Greenpeace said Sunday that it had found high radiation levels in Iitate, a town of 7,000 about 40 kilometers northwest the plant. Jan van de Putte, a radiation monitor for Greenpeace, said radiation levels ranged between .008 to 0.01 millisieverts per hour, or more than 50 times normal readings. Though that's a dose far below the levels that would cause radiation sickness, it presents ""a serious risk for developing cancer in the longer term,"" he told CNN. ""People living there -- and there are still people living there -- would exceed the maximum annual permitted dose in just a couple of days,"" van de Putte said. He said the town's mayor is seeking ""practical, correct information"" from the Japanese government. ""Without the right information, you cannot take the needed precautionary measures to protect yourself from radiation,"" he said. ""We think that, to the population, is really important."" Noriyuki Shikata, a Kan spokesman, said the government understands the nuclear crisis has become ""an issue of global attention."" Traces of radioactive iodine have been detected in China's Heilongjiang province, the U.S. state of Massachusetts and as far away as Sweden, authorities there announced over the weekend. None of those readings have been strong enough to harm public health -- and the United States, Hong Kong and Russia have put restrictions on imports of food products from some regions of Japan.

"(CNN) -- Violent attacks, the chanting of Adolf Hitler's name and anti-Semitic abuse -- not dark memories of the 1930s but four days in the life of English Premier Leage club Tottenham Hotspur. It has been an annus horribilis in football's fight against discrimination with Chelsea and Liverpool notably dragged through the mud, but Sunday's game against West Ham at Spurs' White Hart Lane stadium -- as fans made Nazi salutes -- gave the impression English football had reached a new low. As well as the salutes, there were also accusations of anti-Semitic abuse, including hissing to mimic the sound of gas chambers, a reminder of the deaths of six million Jews during the Holocaust. White Hart Lane is situated in north London, which is home to a large Jewish community, an association that has led some of Tottenham's fans identifying themselves as ""Yids"", a term which at different times throughout history has been used by Jews and also to abuse them. Some Spurs supporters have attempted to ""reclaim"" the word, using terms like ""Yiddo"" and calling themselves the ""Yid Army"". However, critics argue the word's use by Tottenham fans creates an opportunity for a dangerous undercurrent of anti-Semitism in European soccer to be exploited. Just days before Sunday's game, Lazio fans had chanted ""Juden Tottenham"" in a Europa League match against Spurs in Rome. ""There is a hardcore of racist and anti-Semitic fans in British football who really don't seem to have any regard for common sense or decency,"" Peter Herbert, the chairman of the association of black lawyers, a group which has threatened to take legal against Spurs fans who continue to use the term ""Yid"", told CNN. ""Despite the fact there are people in hospital having been abused on Wednesday night in Rome, they seem to add to that distress with these comments. We're in discussions with London's Metropolitan Police. ""I understand the FA have already reported it, which they should do with such incidents,"" added Herbert. ""There has to be zero tolerance -- if these people can be identified they should be prosecuted and banned from football."" ""As bad as the Holocaust"" That has already happened to one West Ham fan. ""Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed that five supporters were arrested during Sunday's match at White Hart Lane outside of the stadium for unrelated incidents and two more were cautioned for racially aggravated gesturing inside the ground.,"" said a West Ham statement. ""One of those fans has since been identified as a season ticket holder and has been sent a letter containing a banning order from the club. Any other individuals identified can expect a similar swift and robust response."" Given what had happened on Thursday in Rome, third-tier Scunthorpe United manager Brian Laws will probably wished he had chosen his words more carefully in describing his team's performance on Saturday ""as bad as the Holocaust"". ""Anti-Semitism has no place in football or society in general,"" said the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which works to promote and defend the religious and civil liberties of British Jewry. ""For football fans to use Holocaust imagery and chants glorifying Adolf Hitler is grossly offensive to the Jewish community and is a stain upon the character of British football."" Herbert, who reported the racism allegations recently made by Chelsea against Mark Clattenburg to the police before the investigation was dropped and the referee was later cleared by the FA, suggests the use of the term ""Yid"" encourages an extreme reaction from a vocal minority. ""What you have to understand is that if only one person is offended it's one too many.,"" said Herbert. ""All these chants, intentional or unintentional, have to stop. If this happened in athletics or rugby it wouldn't be tolerated, why should it be tolerated in football?"" ""We'll sing what we want"" But not all Spurs fans want to see the back of the word ""Yid"" and recent matches have seen the team's followers chant ""We'll sing what we want"" in direct response to Herbert's threat. ""I've never had any problem using it,"" said Spurs supporter Richard Arrowsmith, who is not Jewish. ""It's a word Spurs fans regularly shout to each other. If I'm wearing a Spurs shirt in the street, it's quite common for another passing Spurs fan to shout ' Yiddo' . ""I was probably about seven or eight and it was the first Spurs game I went to. We used to have a drummer at White Hart Lane and the song used to go 'boom, boom, boon, boom-boom-boom, Yids!' ""I looked around and saw pretty much every Spurs fans clapping along and joining in with it ... It's something we've really made our own, it's a collective term for our fans now. It's an accepted word for Spurs fans in the modern age."" Arrowsmith rejected the idea that Spurs fans' use of the term encourages anti-Semitism, saying that particular argument removes any responsibility from the abusers. ""It's a pretty weak argument,"" he said. ""It's been compared to another argument which suggests if girls wear short skirts they're inviting bad things to happen to them. ""No Spurs fan goes to the game thinking 'if I chant the word Yid I'm going to incite some racial hatred'. No one goes to the game thinking they are going to get some racial abuse."" But British comedian and author David Baddiel disagrees. ""The idea that Spurs fans are reclaiming the Y-word and are entitled to because so many of them are Jewish is simply not true,"" said Baddiel, who is Jewish and a Chelsea fan, recently writing in the Daily Mail. ""There are only 250,000 Jews in Britain as a whole and I'd say about three or four per cent of Tottenham's crowd is Jewish. ""That means well over 90% of those chanting 'Yid Army' are not actually Jewish and that is just one of several reasons why it cannot be right."" Poisonous atmosphere . As the FA investigate what happened on Sunday, academic Clifford Stott called for England's governing body to deliver a reasoned response. ""The authorities need to respond by empowering the majority of those fans who aren't abusing other supporters,""said Stott, who has advised governments and police forces internationally on crowd management policy and practice. ""If the lessons of the past are anything to go by, solutions reside in working with fans' grassroots organizations to respond constructively to any criminal action that occurred. The key message is that an indiscriminate response is counterproductive. ""Don't forget there is already sufficient legislation to deal with anti-Semitic or racist chanting at football grounds . ""Where this has happened then clearly it must be condemned and if the evidence exists for criminal sanctions to follow. ""But a knee-jerk response can escalate the problem and it is important to keep what happened in perspective."" Without attempting to excuse the actions of West Ham's fans, Stott explained how a unique set of circumstances had combined to create Sunday's poisonous atmosphere. ""Those chants -- inexcusable as they are -- followed the news about what happened in Rome and what the Society of Black Lawyers has been saying about the illegitimacy of Spurs fans' expression of their identity. ""In 12 months I doubt if and when this fixture is played again that those chants would be repeated."" Meanwhile, Herbert wants football's European governing body UEFA to use its regulations to empower referees in future to prevent a repeat of the abusive incidents that recently occurred in Serbia involving England's Under-21 team as well as Rome and north London. ""We'd like to see a proactive stance on this, a vigorous approach, prosecute where possible, ban people from grounds and if incidents like that do happen, call a halt to the game. ""There is a UEFA rule which is never used where a referee can call off the game. That's the sort of initiative which has to happen. ""Do you want to watch a football game or do you want to listen to this abuse?""","Anti-semitic abuse marred Tottenham's 3-1 win against West Ham on Sunday .

"New York (CNN) -- If all goes as planned, performance artist Marni Kotak will give birth to her first child within the month -- in front of an audience at a Brooklyn art gallery. Kotak calls most of her work, ""found performances"" because it is based on daily experience. In past work she has re-enacted: her own birth, losing her virginity in a blue Plymouth, and the dark aspects of her first marriage. She has also collaborated with her new husband, artist Jason Robert Bell, in a performance piece called ""The Wedding."" ""In my work, I aim to convey my real experience of life, while simultaneously engaging in authentic shared moments with my viewers who have likely gone through similar or related events,"" Kotak says on her website. Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood hosts Kotak's latest venture titled ""The Birth of Baby X."" On Saturday, she converted the gallery into a birthing room, bringing in her grandmother's bed and her old rocking chair, so through the month, she can be in the gallery preparing mentally and physically to have her child, according to Kotak. The exhibit also includes ""You are My Baby,"" first performed at Staten Island's Lumen Festival in June, in which Kotak filmed her audience and projected their faces onto her pregnant stomach. Sculptures and personal artworks by Bell, are also on display, according the gallery. ""Remnants from the final days of pregnancy and the birth will be added to the exhibition as it progresses,"" says the gallery website. The exhibit was coordinated around Kotaks's due date, and the gallery asks visitors to be prepared to witness a live birth. When the time comes, Kotak will have the aid of her husband, a midwife, and a doula as she delivers the baby. And this is only the beginning for Baby X. This month's exhibit launches Kotak's new conceptual work, ""Raising Baby X,"" in which Kotak ""re-contextualizes the everyday act of raising a child into a work of performance art,"" says the gallery. ""The long-term project will ultimately encompass the overall span of the child's life from birth through attending college and developing an independent life,"" says Kotak. ""I believe that our most intriguing performances occur when we are not aware that we are performing. It is only in these moments that we are capable of transcending the issues of spectacle that have come to dominate performance art and much of contemporary culture.""","Pregnant artist will give birth to first child at Brooklyn art gallery in front of audience .

"(CNN) -- For months now, the French-language twittersphere has lit up with a rash of racist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic tweets using the hashtags #UnBonJuif (a good Jew), #SiMonFilsEstGay (if my son is gay), and #SiMaFilleRamÃ¨neUnNoir (if my daughter brings home a black guy). Last fall, under pressure from French advocacy group Union of Jewish Students (UEJF), Twitter agreed to remove some offensive tweets. In October 2012, at Berlin's request, Twitter also suspended a German neo-Nazi account based in the city of Hanover, the first time the company had responded to such a government request. However, at the time, the UEJF also wanted identifying information of the perpetrators, which Twitter was not prepared to give up. So the group went to court to force the issue. On Thursday, the Grand Instance Court in Paris ordered Twitter to identify the authors of anti-semitic tweets by creating a mechanism (Google Translate) to alert French authorities to ""illegal content,"" on its French site ""in a visible and easily-accessible [way]."" If Twitter does not comply within two weeks, the American company faces fines of â‚¬1,000 ($1,336) per day. How ""free"" should ""free speech"" be? This isn't the first time that French courts and laws have butted heads over idiotic racism online. Less than a year ago, then-president Nicolas Sarkozy proposed a law that would make even viewing a hate site a crime. Here in the United States, we have a Constitutionally protected near-blanket right to free expression. Although incitement to violence is generally not protected, hate speech -- no matter how disgusting and awful -- is. As we've reported before, the operating principle in America has generally been that undesirable speech should be countered with more speech, not less. That's not the approach taken in Europe, where hate speech is most definitely not protected. Many European Union states (and even some non-EU countries in Europe) have various types of anti-hate speech legal mechanisms, in part to head off terrorism and far-right violence. ""We're not able to identify the individuals, only Twitter can do so,"" Sacha Reingewirtz, UEJF's vice president, told the French broadcaster, RFI. ""We've already tweeted the decision. And we see on Twitter that the decision has apparently triggered a new rise of anti-semitic messages directed against our organization, so there is still work to be done, both by us and Twitter, but we're happy the French justice is now changing the way it is.""

"(CNN) -- With the 10th anniversary of 9/11 just weeks away, the rebuilding of the World Trade Center in New York goes on round the clock -- reshaping the skyline. As one construction crane lifts steel beams atop One World Trade Center -- the skyscraper taking the place of the Twin Towers -- another simultaneously delivers loads of concrete a few floors below. The steel frame can be seen from miles around now rising stoically above lower Manhattan. Hundreds upon hundreds of construction workers below scurry about like little ants. They're putting the finishing touches on the 9/11 Memorial Plaza, building the new transportation hub and erecting 4 World Trade Center, another impressive office tower at the site. The redevelopment of the site is taking place at a fast pace; One World Trade Center rises at the rate of one floor per week. It's expected to be 80 stories tall when people gather on the plaza for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that destroyed the buildings and took the lives of 2,753 people. ""It is a towering building and it's a building of towering strength,"" said Chris Ward, executive director of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, which owns the site and oversees the construction. The new 1 World Trade Center will fill the void in the skyline left behind when the Twin Towers collapsed. ""I think it balances the New York City skyline,"" Ward said. ""The glass that it's sheathed in will be so bright and the mast going to 1,776 feet, I think, will be the point of reference for the entire region for the next hundred years."" Obama, Bush to be at 9/11 anniversary ceremony, N.Y. mayor says . While the building is taking the place of the Twin Towers, only time will tell whether it will be a fitting substitute for the monoliths that anchored lower Manhattan for the better part of three decades. Those two buildings were more than just concrete, steel and glass to so many people across the country, and especially to New Yorkers. ""When the Twin Towers were gone I felt disoriented in the city for a long time,"" said Brian Rose, an architectural photographer with a degree in Urban Planning. He started taking pictures of the Towers from just about every angle imaginable in the late 1970s. Some of those photographs appear in his self-published book titled WTC. ""I started photographing the Lower East Side and I saw distant views from the Lower East Side where the Twin Towers were there,"" said Rose. ""Then, I photographed Lower Manhattan as part of a project. ... The Twin Towers became very present in those pictures."" It was hard not to include the towers. Rose would see them as he drove toward the city on the New Jersey Turnpike. There was the view from Kennedy Airport of the buildings rising above the New York skyline way off in the distance. But he most liked the glimpses that he would catch of the Twin Towers rising between smaller buildings as he looked downtown on many of the city's streets. ""The buildings were really signposts. If you came out of the subway anywhere in the city and you were a little bit disoriented at first you could always look one way or the other and see the Twin Towers,"" Rose said. ""It was almost like a needle of a compass for me."" He called the destruction of towers ""a kind of civic vandalism on an epic scale."" Fire truck lowered into 9/11 Memorial in honor of its lost crew . On September 11, 2001, Rose found himself in Amsterdam helplessly watching on TV as the Twin Towers came down. ""It was gut-wrenching. I didn't even realize it until then that I had such a personal relationship with these buildings. I realized that I had been photographing them for much of my adult life."" He returned to New York as soon as flights resumed and he quickly made his way to lower Manhattan to see the destruction for himself. He had his camera in hand but he found it difficult to take pictures. The days and weeks that followed were filled with depression, anxiety and many sleepless nights for Rose. What's your 9/11 story? Share it with CNN iReport . As he spoke in the shadow of 1 World Trade Center, the building grew taller by the minute. ""I'm not unhappy to see these buildings going up,"" said Rose. ""I'm not sure in the end whether it's the right thing. I don't think anybody knows whether re-creating the World Trade Center is what should have happened or not."" At first, he agreed with most people that something needed to go up in the place of the Twin Towers to once again anchor the city. ""I was pretty certain that we needed to do that; there needed to be a very tall building with a spire downtown."" But Rose's feelings have evolved over time. ""I think I am in a wait-and-ee attitude right now. I want to see what this building, which is about two-thirds of the way up now, I want to see how it really functions on the skyline."" Spielberg part of 'Rising: Rebuilding Ground Zero' The destruction of the Twin Towers left behind a tremendous scar in the city's skyline and in the psyche of New Yorkers. Rose thinks 1 World Trade Center has the potential to heal that scar. ""I hope so. I don't think it's a sure thing,"" Rose said. ""I don't think building buildings is ever a sure thing -- how it's going to work out in a city, especially a complex city like this one."" But he is happy to see something new taking shape in lower Manhattan. Rose said after 9/11, ""The city moved forward and one way to move forward is to build. That's what New York has always been about -- not dwelling in the past and moving on. I'm not sure the rest of the country is ready to move on but I think New York is."" Rose is taking pictures of One Word Trade Center as it rise above Ground Zero. He sees it as a continuation of his work photographing the Twin Towers. But he's not sure the building can ever be a substitute for what once stood on the site.

"(CNN) -- Mitchell Guist, a star of the reality TV show ""Swamp People,"" died of ""natural causes,"" a local sheriff in Louisiana said. Assumption Parish Sheriff Mike Waguespack released the preliminary autopsy conclusion Wednesday, although he said final results will not be available for another four or five weeks. Fans pay tribute to 'Swamp People' star . Guist, 47, was working to build a houseboat when he appeared to have a seizure and fell backwards in his boat, said Assumption Parish Sheriff Mike Waguespack. He was with another person on the Intercoastal Waterway, about 75 miles from New Orleans, at the time of his collapse. That person, who did not want to be identified, got Guist back to a boat landing, performed CPR and called his wife, who in turn called 911, said the sheriff. Guist was transferred to the Teche Regional Medical Center in Morgan City, where he was pronounced dead Monday. Daniel Wiltz, with the St. Martin Parish coroner's office, declined to comment on the autopsy except to say that it was pending. What is 'Swamp People'?

"(CNN) -- Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Tuesday refused to apologize over damaging allegations that Australia's intelligence services spied on Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, tapping his personal mobile phone and those of his inner circle. ""Australia should not be expected to apologize for the steps we take to protect our country now, or in the past, any more than other governments should be expected to apologize for the similar steps they have taken,"" Abbott said in an address to parliament. ""Importantly, in Australia's case, we use all our resources including information to help our friends and allies, not to harm them,"" Abbott said, adding that Australia should not be expected to detail what it does to protect its country any more than other countries do. ""I want to make it absolutely crystal clear, Australia has deep respect for Indonesia, for its government, and for its people,"" he said. ""I regard President Yudhoyono as a good friend of Australia, indeed as one of the very best friends that we have anywhere in the world, that's why ... I sincerely regret any embarrassment that recent media reports have caused him."" He said that it was in everyone's interest that ""cool heads prevail"" over the spying scandal that has engulfed his new Liberal government. On Monday, the Indonesian government took what it described as ""the serious step"" of withdrawing its ambassador from the Australian capital Canberra. Jakarta also summoned Australian ambassador Greg Moriarty to voice its anger at allegations that Australia had been spying directly on the Indonesian president. Earlier on Tuesday, President Yudhoyono released a series of angry Tweets -- translated from Bahasa Indonesia into English and signed ""SBY"" to indicate they come straight from the president -- in which he attacked Abbott over a perceived lack of remorse over the revelations. ""I also regret the statement of (the) Australian Prime Minister that belittled this tapping matter in Indonesia without any remorse. *SBY*,"" the tweet read. ""These US & Australian actions have certainly damaged the strategic partnership with Indonesia, as fellow democracies. *SBY*,"" an earlier tweet read. Indonesia earlier this month expressed outrage over reports that Australia's Jakarta embassy was used as part of a U.S.-led spying network in Asia. In his series of tweets, Yudhoyono called on the Australian government to ""give us an official answer which can be understood by broader Indonesian society about the tapping."" While the direct attack on Abbott is likely to be a blow for the new Liberal government, which has made much of maintaining good relations with its populous northern neighbor -- a key ally and trading partner -- Abbott has been consistently unrepentant about the revelations. Speaking in parliament on Monday, Abbott had said: ""The Australian government never comments on specific intelligence matters. ""All governments gather information and all governments know that every other government gathers information. ""I will never say or do anything that might damage the strong relationship and the close co-operation that we have with Indonesia, which is all in all our most important relationship."" Indonesia's objections stem from reports in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Guardian Australia that said Australian intelligence tracked Yudhoyono's mobile phone for 15 days in August 2009, monitoring the calls he made and received. The intelligence agency also tried to listen in on what was said on at least one occasion. But the call was less than a minute long and could not be successfully tapped, ABC reported. The two media outlets cited documents provided by Edward Snowden, the U.S. national security contractor-turned-leaker.","Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott refuses to apologise over spy allegations .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday rejected two amendments to include a government-run public health insurance option in the only compromise health care bill so far. Sen. Max Baucus said the public option provision would ""hold back meaningful reform this year."" The amendments by Democratic Sens. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Charles Schumer of New York were opposed by all 10 Republicans on the committee and a few Democrats, including committee Chairman Sen. Max Baucus of Montana. Baucus explained that he liked much about the idea of a public option but that he knew a health care bill containing the provision would fail to win enough support in the full Senate to overcome a Republican filibuster. ""I fear if this provision is in the bill, it will hold back meaningful reform this year,"" Baucus said. Rockefeller said that unfair practices by insurance companies required a not-for-profit alternative that would give consumers a lower-cost option and, in some cases, the only coverage they could get. ""They're getting away with banditry. They revel in it,"" Rockefeller said of tactics by insurance companies to avoid covering high-cost or high-risk consumers. ""I feel so strongly about it because it makes so much sense,"" he said. ""The people I represent need this, because they're helpless"" in terms of health insurance. However, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said a public option means the government eventually taking over the health care system. ""A government-run plan will ultimately force private insurers out of business,"" Grassley said, adding that the federal government would run the plan and run the market in which the plan competes. ""It will come to a single payer,"" he said of a government-run system for all. ""That denies the American people choice."" Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey countered that such a characterization was ""absurd, and everyone knows it."" ""For patients, it will simply be one more choice,"" he said. The White House responded to Tuesday's actions with spokesman Reid Cherlin repeating both President Barack Obama's support for a public option -- and also his willingness to consider other proposals. Obama ""has said he is open to other constructive ideas of increasing choice and competition,"" Cherlin said. ""He will work with Congress to ensure that under health insurance reform, Americans who cannot find affordable coverage will always have a choice."" The Finance Committee is the last congressional panel to consider health care legislation before debate begins in the full House and Senate. Democratic proposals passed by another Senate committee and three House committees all include the public insurance option. Republicans unanimously oppose the government-run insurance option, saying it would drive private insurers from the market and eventually bring a government takeover of the health care system. Democratic leaders reject that claim, saying the public option would provide needed competition for private insurers while making health coverage accessible to millions of people currently lacking health insurance. Baucus and five other committee members -- two fellow Democrats and three Republicans -- negotiated the compromise proposal for months before Baucus brought the measure to the full panel. None of the three Republicans in the ""Gang of Six"" negotiators has backed the proposal before the committee.  Watch report on how plan would affect ""heart attack Harry"" » . However, Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate from Maine and one of the Gang of Six negotiators, has indicated that she could go along with the Finance Committee proposal if changes are made. Snowe voted with Democrats on the panel to defeat some Republican amendments last week, when the committee began debating the proposal. Obama and Democratic leaders, aware of a rockier political climate because of midterm congressional elections in 2010, insist that a bill must pass this year to address spiraling health care costs that are threatening economic stability. Republicans say they agree on the need to reform aspects of the health care system but oppose the overhaul proposed by Democrats as too comprehensive and costly. Both parties agree on major aspects of health care reform, including a halt to insurance company practices of denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and capping the annual out-of-pocket expenses of consumers for health care. They also agree on creating incentives for preventive health care to help lower overall costs. In efforts to bridge differences, the Finance Committee proposal dropped the public insurance option and a mandate for all employers to provide health coverage. It would require individuals to have coverage or face a fine of up to $1,900 for a family of four but includes subsidies to help low- and middle-income Americans obtain health care plans. The committee began debating the compromise measure last week, with arguments erupting over Democratic proposals to reduce subsidies for some Medicare coverage while eliminating fraud and waste in the government health care plan for senior citizens. Republicans argued that the changes would reduce benefits for senior citizens, but Democrats say the overall effect would be minor. Some advocacy groups cite reports that the amount of money involved is no more than 5 percent of overall Medicare spending and therefore won't adversely affect benefits for the elderly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Finance Committee proposal would cost $774 billion over 10 years, but amendments have probably increased the overall price tag. By contrast, the budget office said Democratic proposals would cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years. In the House, Democratic leaders planned a series of meetings beginning Tuesday on merging the three versions passed out of House committees while bringing down the overall cost by $200 billion. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that she expected a final version for consideration by the full chamber soon, but she was unable to provide a specific timetable. Fiscally minded ""Blue Dog"" Democrats in the House and conservative Democrats in the Senate are worried about estimates of how much the plans will cost. With prospects dim for any Republican support for a health care bill, the Democratic leadership wants to bring liberals, progressives and conservatives in their party together to use its majority in both chambers to pass a bill this year. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada needs 60 votes to overcome a possible Republican filibuster. There are 60 seats in the Democratic Senate caucus, but some are independents or moderates unlikely to support a public option or some of the most costly reforms. Reid could implement a legislative option known as reconciliation, which would require only 51 votes to pass a health care bill. However, Republicans warn against such a move as shortsighted legislative warfare that would sow deep and long-lasting division. Snowe has proposed a possible compromise: a ""trigger"" mechanism that would create a public option in the future if specific thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs are not met. The trigger has yet to be included in any proposal. CNN's Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","NEW: Finance Committee strikes down second amendment to bill .

"(CNN) -- OK, so it looks like something from a horror movie. But a customized silicone mask, fitted over the face, head and mouth of endurance swimmer Diana Nyad, was a key difference-maker in helping the 64-year-old complete the grueling, 100-mile swim from Cuba to Key West, Florida, on her fifth try. Nyad needed the mask for protection against box jellyfish, deadly creatures common to tropical waters and whose venomous sting cut short her fourth attempt to swim from Cuba last summer. Because the mask is cumbersome, she only wore it Saturday night when her support team feared jellyfish were nearby. ""I was grateful for it. I knew I wasn't going to be stung at all. I felt 100 percent prepared for the jellyfish,"" Nyad told reporters Tuesday morning after her record swim. But the design of the mask, with its narrow mouth opening, was not perfect. For 13 hours Saturday night and early Sunday, it caused her to swallow ""tremendous volumes"" of seawater, which in turn led to bouts of vomiting. Nyad grew dehydrated, weakened and discouraged. ""That night was hell on Earth, it really was,"" she said. The jellyfish dispersed by Sunday afternoon, however, and Nyad did not wear the mask again during the crossing. After Cuba-Florida feat, Nyad to swim 48 hours in New York . Venom from box jellyfish contains paralyzing toxins that attack the skin, heart and nervous system and is considered to be among the most deadly in the world. Twenty to 40 people die from stings from box jellyfish annually in the Philippines alone, according to the National Science Foundation. During last year's swim, Nyad wore protective gear over her face, hands and body. But the jellyfish still stung her repeatedly in the mouth, aborting her attempt about halfway between Cuba and Key West. ""Literally the only square inch exposed of my entire body was the lips. We just couldn't design a way to protect the mouth and still breathe while swimming,"" she said last month in a blog post on her website. ""Yet these animals ... are brilliant at finding animals to sting and they indeed found my lips. On both occasions, I suffered the paralysis, the otherworldly sensation of being burned alive."" So Nyad partnered with Stefan Knauss, a California prosthetics expert who spent a year developing the silicone mask. They tried many molds and different designs of the mouth area before finding one that worked best. Nyad tested the mask, along with her other protective gear, by swimming through a swarm of hundreds of box jellyfish in June. ""As difficult as the swimming was, I was not stung once,"" she said. ""Those deadly tentacles could not penetrate."" And indeed, the jellyfish were not a problem on Nyad's triumphant fifth crossing, which she completed Monday afternoon after nearly 53 hours in the water. Opinion: Nyad shows baby boomers so 'not over' But the jokesters of Twitter had some fun with her mask. ""Not only did Diana Nyad finish her swim, but that new mask of hers can double as a Halloween costume. One-stop shopping. Smart lady,"" wrote a Boston-based blogger on Twitter. And there was this, from a Kansas-based comedian: ""Somewhere under the sea the King of the Jellyfish yells at his men ""WE HAVE FAILED.

"(CNN) -- ""Dancing With the Stars"" has announced its new lineup of competitors, and at least two of them already know how to go for the gold. On ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday, the ABC dancing competition revealed that Olympic champs Meryl Davis and Charlie White, who just won a historic gold medal at the Winter Olympics in figure skating ice dance, are joining ""DWTS'"" 18th season. Instead of competing as a team the way they did at the Sochi Olympics, Davis and White are now up against one another. Davis will partner with returning ""DWTS"" pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who left the show in 2012 to pursue other opportunities. White has been set up with pro dancer Sharna Burgess. Here are the other stars Davis and White will face off against: . Candace Cameron Bure: The former ""Full House"" actress was rumored to be a potential ""star"" on this season of ""DWTS,"" and Tuesday's announcement confirmed the gossip. Cameron Bure, who recently released a book called ""Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose,"" will be paired with pro dancer Mark Ballas. NeNe Leakes: As with Cameron Bure, there was speculation that ""Real Housewives of Atlanta's"" NeNe Leakes was going to grace ABC's ballroom. Leakes, who's also branched out into acting on shows like ""Glee,"" is partnering with Tony Dovolani. Danica McKellar: Cameron Bure isn't the only child star on season 18's roster. Former ""The Wonder Years"" actress Danica McKellar is also going to perform each week, with help from pro partner Valentin Chmerkovskiy. McKellar's also created a career as an author, but she still acts here and there and has appeared on ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""The Big Bang Theory.""

"New York (CNN) -- Two of the three individuals believed to be involved in a potential 9/11 anniversary plot against New York or Washington are Americans of Arab descent who traveled to the United States last week, according to a U.S. government official. However, another law enforcement official said there is no evidence so far that any of the three individuals came to the United States or are here now. ""Nothing's really panned out yet,"" the official said. Still, authorities are operating under the assumption that two of the people have arrived on U.S. soil, and they have been piecing together clues gleaned from flight logs and manifests, among other sources, said the U.S. government official, who declined to be named. A third person is believed to have been traveling through Europe, though it is not clear whether that person has arrived in the United States, the government official said. It is still not apparent whether a plot is under way, officials say. ""It's still ongoing,"" New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said about the potential threat. ""Nothing significant has changed. The threat has been identified as being credible and specific and uncorroborated."" American spy networks had intercepted communications of a potential attack from an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan, derived from a source who has provided accurate information in the past, officials say. No other corroborating evidence of an attack has been uncovered, but it has prompted intelligence officials to sift through communications from other al Qaeda cells. The information suggests the plan -- thought to involve a vehicle-borne explosive device -- is meant to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The exact type of strike, however, is largely unclear and the plot still remains unconfirmed. U.S. officials rarely speak on the record about intelligence intercepts. And in the days following the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, officials indicated al Qaeda had gone to great lengths to avoid having its communications intercepted by the United States. While the precise nature of communication intercepts is rarely discussed, U.S. officials repeatedly have indicated their comfort with sharing the results of those intercepts. Authorities also say they have picked up ""chatter,"" or widely divergent communications, from extremists that suggest the newly tapped al Qaeda head, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is in some way involved in the current plot. Meanwhile, heightened security was visible Saturday in New York and Washington as intelligence officials worked to pin down information about the potential threat. Three stolen trucks were added to a New York Police Department database because of the threat, said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne. The database is connected to the NYPD's digital license plate readers. ""We're adding them in the interest of being prudent,"" Browne told CNN, emphasizing there is no known link to the terror threat. Commissioner Kelly echoed that point. ""We're not ruling it out, but there's nothing of significance right now that would connect these thefts to the threat that we're facing,"" he said. Two of the trucks were owned by a construction company that operates at the World Trade Center site. They were reported stolen over a week ago. A Budget rental truck was also stolen in a separate incident from a Jersey City, New Jersey, storage facility August 21. ""Whoever did it went to great lengths to cover their tracks,"" Browne said. ""They cut lines to phones and surveillance cameras."" Browne also said the city has experienced ""a three-fold increase in suspicious package calls,"" while suspicious vehicle calls have doubled. New York law enforcement officers, meanwhile, have been put on 12-hour shifts. In Washington, Police Chief Cathy Lanier reported that ""suspicious activity and suspicious vehicle reporting sky-rocketed last night."" ""I can tell people in this community (are) really on it,"" said Lanier, adding that her force had beefed up staffing. In neighboring Prince George's County, officials are trying to locate two missing U-Haul vans, though a police spokesman said authorities ""are not viewing this as terrorism-related."" Cpl. Evan Baxter said the vans were reported stolen Saturday. On Saturday, President Barack Obama met again with his senior national security team about the threat, according to a White House statement. The U.S. president has ""directed his team to pursue vigorously all threat information and to ensure a heightened state of vigilance and preparedness,"" the statement said. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in Friday, saying the information was at least in part gleaned from the May raid against bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. ""This is the first ... credible piece of information we've gotten,"" Biden told NBC's ""Today"" show. ""All hands are on deck."" It is not clear how the bin Laden raid helped authorities connect the dots to the prospect of an anniversary attack, but Biden downplayed the threat of a widely sophisticated plot involving multiple conspirators. He said the administration's principal concern is a plot from a ""lone actor, not some extremely complicated plan like it took to take down the World Trade (Center) towers or the plane in Shanksville (Pennsylvania) or the Pentagon."" On Saturday morning, police officers stopped and searched for a third day box trucks as they approached the George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey with New York, as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, connecting the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn. Police manned checkpoints in Midtown and downtown Manhattan, where they examined vehicles, particularly vans and trucks, for possible bombs. They are also sweeping parking garages for explosives and using digital license plate readers to check for stolen vehicles, officials said. Authorities say they are seeking people who could help disrupt the threat and are questioning individuals who have previously raised security concerns. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, meanwhile, has directed state police and asked National Guardsmen to help secure areas during the anniversary weekend, bolstering an already heightened level of security. ""We already had a great security plan in place, and in an abundance of caution, we're deploying more resources,"" he told reporters. ""We shouldn't allow this threat to diminish the importance of the 9/11 anniversary, because that would be doing just what the terrorists want us to do."" A senior U.S. administration official said Friday that it is the ""origin"" of the intelligence information that is causing particular concern. U.S. officials believe that operatives came out of the tribal Pakistan-Afghanistan border region -- a volatile semi-lawless area that is home to extremist groups -- and that they are part of al Qaeda ""central."" The official also noted a possibility that Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan could be involved. Intelligence officials believe al Qaeda ""likely maintained an interest since at least February 2010 in conducting large attacks in the Homeland timed to coincide with symbolic dates, to include the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks,"" according to an intelligence bulletin issued Thursday. Bin Laden's death and the ""removal"" of senior al Qaeda figures since then could add to the organization's desire to stage an attack on a symbolic date such as September 11, the bulletin said. In Washington, local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since September 1. ""I want to urge all of our citizens ... to remain calm and let our law enforcement professionals do their job. At the same time, we ask people to remain vigilant,"" Mayor Vincent Gray said. ""If you see something, say something."" Federal officials said they are taking the threat seriously, while trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace in connection with key dates. ""The FBI has been in a planning mode for months with the local and state police officers, as well as the other intelligence agencies, to prepare for this weekend,"" said James McJunkin, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office. ""What we have here is a little bit more of a public display than we normally have."" CNN's Mike M. Ahlers, Lesa Jansen, Allan Chernoff, Thomas Evans, Terry Frieden, Jessica Yellin, John King, Jim Barnett, Pam Benson, Fran Townsend and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","NEW: NYPD Commissioner Kelly says the possible threat is credible, specific and uncorroborated .

"(CNN) -- Swiss voters narrowly approved a referendum to place new limits on foreigners living and working in Switzerland. The country's Federal Council, which officially opposed the constitutional change, called the vote ""a reflection of unease with regard to population growth in recent years."" The council had warned that passage would make it harder for Swiss businesses to find workers and would harm relations with the European Union. Foreign workers from the EU have been allowed to freely commute from France and other countries into Switzerland to work, while there have been few restrictions on foreign nationals moving into the country to live. Switzerland, which is not a part of the European Union, will not have to renegotiate agreements with the EU, the Federal Council said. The European Commission issued a statement Sunday expressing ""regrets"" about the passage of the immigration quotas. ""That goes against the principle of free circulation of people between the European Union and Switzerland,"" it said. ""The European Union will examine the implications of this initiative with all relations between the European Union and Switzerland."" Foreigners make up about a fourth of Switzerland's workforce and 20% of its population. The immigrant community is dominated by Albanians, Bosnians and Turks, though most were denied a vote in Sunday's referendum because of the difficulty of gaining Swiss citizenship. ""The new constitutional provisions require that residence permits for foreign nationals be restricted using quantitative limits and quotas,"" the Swiss government statement said. ""These limits and quotas will apply to all permits covered by legislation on foreign nationals, including cross-border commuters and asylum seekers, and must be geared towards Switzerland's overall economic interests. Businesses must give Swiss nationals priority when hiring staff."" Before the vote, the Federal Council issued a statement saying the foreign workers ""make a significant contribution to Switzerland's prosperity. The Swiss economy has relied on foreign workers for decades. Manufacturing, construction, health care, academia and research, gastronomy and agriculture are dependent on workers from abroad.""","Vote reflects ""unease with regard to population growth,"" Swiss government says .

"(CNN) -- Two bombs hit a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in the war-torn South Kordofan region of Sudan on Monday, destroying the emergency room, pharmacy and hospital kitchen.

"(CNN)  -- Scary thought -- with more than 98 million single people in the United States alone, you're simply one of many fish in the sea. Even scarier -- after years of searching for that special someone, ""The One"" might reject YOU because you're not ""The One"" for them. British relationship expert Roy Sheppard has a new book, ""How to Be The One,"" explaining how to strengthen your emotional core through four pillars -- self esteem, attitude, happiness and kindness/compassion -- in order to make sure you're ready for that moment. ""Thanks to the internet, there's now a new addiction... dating,"" he said. ""It's never been so easy to get a date. But with so many people to choose from, there's always the possibility that there's someone out there who's 'better.' "" Sheppard says that if you focus on improving each pillar, you'll have a better chance of catching ""The One's"" attention when they meet you. Before you become, as he writes, the ex in ""next."" The following is an edited interview with the author: . CNN: Why is it important to focus on being ""The One"" instead of finding ""The One""? Sheppard: There are LOADS of books around that teach you how to get a date or find ""The One."" Yet men and women are still searching. Being ""The One"" doesn't ever involve being manipulative or deceitful to trap your target into a relationship. It's about being a decent human being and a trustworthy, committed best friend. You can't fake that. The book focuses on helping men and women recognize how to be a genuinely appealing person for a long-term, happy relationship with someone else. CNN: Sum up the book for us in a sentence -- how does someone become ""The One""? Sheppard: By choosing to be a more appealing person on the inside, learning the skills to acquire a healthy self-esteem, a great can-do, supportive attitude, an inner happiness that's not dependent on anyone else ""completing you."" CNN: Not to stereotype, but I rarely hear guys say ""The One"" in a serious context. Do you think many men will read the book? Sheppard: Most relationship books are written by women for women. In many cases they complain that men don't ""get it"" about relationships. The only problem is they don't invite men to be a part of the conversation. If you're a woman, why not mention this topic to guys. Ask them ""What would YOU do to be 'The One' for someone else?"" If their eyes glaze over and they're not at all interested in even talking about it, it could be an early indication that a long-term relationship isn't part of their agenda. CNN: Of the four emotional core pillars, which is most important and why? Sheppard: That's a bit like asking ""Which muscle in your leg is the most important? They are all important -- especially when they work together. Improved self-esteem leads to a more appealing attitude, which helps us all become happier people. It's only when you're happy can you be a kind person. As I write in the book, it is impossible to be unhappy and loving at the same time. CNN: You say in the book that dates are auditions for intimacy. What does that mean? Sheppard: I've defined dates as ""auditions for intimacy"" because if you think about it, that's precisely what dates are. When people date they assess whether they might want to be intimate with that person -- this week, month, year or for decades. Invest time developing your emotional core. You'll pass more ""auditions,"" which will open up far more options to you. You'll be able to share the limelight with an A-list partner in a blockbuster relationship, rather than a low-budget soap opera. CNN: You speak a lot about honesty, playing games and faking it. What's the bottom line there? Sheppard: Manipulation or game-playing is for desperately deceitful people who have convinced themselves that there's a shortcut to a long relationship. Long-lasting, happy and intimate relationships are always based on mutual honesty, respect, trust and commitment. CNN: What are the biggest complaints you hear from men about women and from women about men? Sheppard: Some men and women spend their entire lives insisting that they ""see the manager."" It's their default setting. Nothing is EVER right for them. They have a problem because invariably they have created what they think the scenario should be in their heads, then when reality fails to conform to that, they kick up a fuss about it! As far as specifics go, it's usually a variation on ""He/she won't do what I want."" This is what I describe in the book as ""first position"" thinking. Successful relationships are based on ""second position"" thinking and behavior. Second position is having the capacity to experience what it would be like being that other person. CNN: Throughout the book you talk about how no one else is responsible for how you're feeling, your attitude or your love. Why is that? Sheppard: So many people allow their downbeat emotions to dominate their lives. Human beings are much bigger than that. We can consciously decide how happy we are going to be. It's a decision -- give it a go. Someone who learns to think like that becomes more appealing to others ... and themselves. CNN: Once you've found ""The One,"" how do you keep them? Sheppard: A flippant answer would be -- you don't. THEY decide to keep you. In order to be someone a partner would choose to keep, you need to build up, over a long period of time, proof that you are dependable, considerate, reliable, supportive, kind and loving. This happens as a direct result of developing your emotional core. It's just like a career. Some people take their careers seriously, others don't. Those who want a successful career work towards acquiring the necessary skills to be the best they can be. They prepare for their interviews (or auditions!) and work hard. Those who can't be bothered don't get the best jobs, are forced to accept poor pay, and if over time they shirk their responsibilities, they usually get fired. A successful, long-term relationship requires effort from both parties. Every day. CNN: Why is there a goldfish on the cover of your book? Sheppard: Whenever you break up with someone, invariably a well-meaning friend will say ""Cheer up, there are plenty more fish in the sea."" That may be the case, but you want to be the only ONE fish! So many female friends tried insisting that the cover had an image of a swan or a pair of love birds because they all mate for life. But no guy is ever going to read a book on the subway with love birds on the cover! It therefore had to be something that was gender neutral.","British relationship author writes about how to be ""The One"" for someone .

"(CNN) -- CNN and Turner Broadcasting System founder Ted Turner says he's ""recuperating well"" after falling ill South America. Turner, 75, confirmed in a statement issued Monday that he ""underwent a minor surgical procedure due to appendicitis"" during a ""brief hospital stay"" in Argentina. Turner's spokesman previously declined to reveal why he was hospitalized last Friday, saying only that he was there ""for observation."" Argentina's state-run Telam news agency reported Turner was initially treated in Bariloche, a lakeside city near the Chilean border, about 1,500 kilometers (940 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires. He was suffering from acute abdominal pain, according to clinic spokeswoman Paula Redondo. Turner was flown later that morning to the capital of Buenos Aires to have surgery, according to Telam. ""I'm happy to report I'm recuperating well and looking forward to getting back to business as usual,"" Turner said Monday in his statement. ""The doctors and medical staff at both hospitals in Bariloche and Buenos Aires were amazing and took really good care of me."" He said he was heading back to the United States. ""To my family, current and former colleagues and everyone else who called, sent notes of encouragement and get well wishes, I can't thank you enough for lifting my spirits during my ordeal,"" he said. ""During moments like this I tend to reflect on the past, and while I have dealt with many difficult situations in my lifetime, I am humbled by this experience and will be forever grateful to you all."" Soon after graduating from Brown University and serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, Turner took over the family business -- Turner Advertising -- in 1963. Seven years later, he bought TV stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta to kickstart a media empire that would one day include TBS, TNT, HLN, Cartoon Network, TCM and CNN, which launched in 1980. In 1996, Turner sold Turner Broadcasting to Time Warner, though he remained active in the business for several more years.

"(EW.com) -- Assuming you've got two ears and a heart, chances are you loved The Colbert Report's star-studded ""Get Lucky"" dance party video — which Stephen Colbert debuted after explaining that Daft Punk's skittish Frenchmen had abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance on his show. But will you still appreciate the video after learning conclusively that it wasn't cobbled together in just two days? If the answer's ""no,"" you might want to close this tab right about now. If ""yes,"" read on. Almost immediately after Colbert's exuberant clip premiered Aug. 6, Internet naysayers began speculating that Daft Punk's ""cancellation"" was nothing more than an elaborate ruse. Their evidence: The same episode containing the ""Get Lucky"" montage also featured Robin Thicke performing his hit ""Blurred Lines,"" purportedly in Daft Punk's place. But according to Billboard, Thicke's performance was taped July 31, days before Daft Punk supposedly told Colbert they were out. Pitchfork picked up the story, wondering if the whole segment could have been a publicity stunt meant to promote the duo's upcoming appearance on the VMAs. (Viacom owns both MTV and Comedy Central.) EW: Stephen Colbert Daft Punks us anyway with a star-studded 'Get Lucky' dance party . Colbert addressed the Pitchfork post on his show Aug. 7, sarcastically ""admitting"" that the site was right all along. ""You got me!"" he said, adding that Colbert had flown in ""the disco Decepticons from Paris"" just to fool everyone — and ""to help someone else's show on another network a month from now."" But that wasn't his last word on the subject. During a recent out-of-character guest spot on comedian Paul Mercurio's podcast, the Comedy Central host admitted that many of the Daft Punk show's cameos and Robin Thicke's performance were filmed in advance. He also explained that they had to be — because while Daft Punk had agreed to an appearance, they were refusing to perform or be interviewed on the show. Colbert offered to accommodate the taciturn musicians by performing a six-minute monologue framed as interview questions. His team also put together a bit in which Daft Punk's manager would act as interlocutor: ""We had one joke, and I wish we could've done this joke... 'Paul, can I ask you — how do I even know it's them in the robot outfits? How do I even know it's them?' And he goes, 'Stephen, if it wasn't really them, they'd be doing the song.'"" EW: Music review - 'Blurred Lines' Alas, nothing seemed to take; the ""robots"" weren't happy with a script that focused so much on their lack of performance. And as Colbert continued trying to convince Daft Punk to give him something — anything — to work with, he also began filming celebrities dancing to ""Get Lucky"" as a fallback. (Hearing this shouldn't be a surprise; EW noted on Aug. 2 that Colbert had been filming his guests grooving to the song.) In the meantime, the show also shot Robin Thicke doing ""Blurred Lines;"" the plan was always to have Thicke ""save the day"" after Daft Punk's silent appearance. And eventually, Daft Punk canceled altogether — leading to the show that ended up airing.

"(CNN) -- Does a week go by without news of federal bureaucrats outrageously extending their tentacles of authority over more of society? Earlier this month it was the Environmental Protection Agency, announcing its plan to introduce on its own the carbon dioxide limits that Congress specifically rejected. Then it was the Food and Drug Administration, insinuating itself into the centuries-old process of aging cheese. Last week it was the IRS trying to shed at last the inconvenience of congressional oversight. Now the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is claiming sweeping authority over our smartphones, asserting the right to approve any software that might be used in a car. This would likely make the smartphone the first object ever to be regulated both as a medical device and as a piece of motor vehicle equipment. Yet surprising as it may seem to consumers, the matter is clear to NHTSA regulators, who ""maintain that they already have the authority over navigation aids and merely want it clearly written into law,"" according to The New York Times. NHTSA, the Times reports, believes that apps like Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze pose threats to highway safety that entitle the agency to demand changes to their user interfaces -- matters which are far outside the auto regulator's zone of expertise. Under the same principle, of course, NHTSA's control could soon creep beyond the navigation apps. Any software that might theoretically be used while driving could fall under the agency's regulatory powers: music applications, news alerts and e-mail notifications, even the phone function itself could be construed as threats to highway safety. What's next? Atlases? AAA maps? Printed directions? Coffee cups from the McDonald's drive-through? NHTSA has already pushed car manufacturers to adopt ""voluntary"" regulatory standards for their in-car navigation systems, but technology companies have not been so willing to hand federal regulators the keys to one of their core products. If they're smart, companies like Google and Apple will fight to keep it that way. For my book ""Breakout,"" I interviewed Robert Norton, a former assistant general counsel for Chrysler who spent much of his career negotiating with NHTSA, including stints at each of the American Big Three auto companies. ""There's so much soft power that NHTSA has over the industry,"" Norton told me, ""because you're always needing extensions and exemptions and 'Can I have 60 more days to give you this report?' And generally you are expecting to get the 'Mother-may-I' permission on that."" When manufacturers ignore NHTSA's advice or skirt its ""voluntary"" guidelines, however, they're likely to find it a lot more difficult to do business. ""If they get really irritated at you,"" Norton said, ""they say, 'No, actually you can't. We want this now, and we're not going to look at this, and we're not going to consider that.' So you really are encouraged to play ball because you're counting on them for your existence."" Norton's experience explains why the automakers' support for the proposed rules doesn't mean much. (And besides, free navigation apps on smartphones pose a threat to the expensive systems they sell as upgrades in their cars.) Subjecting every Google Maps update and fast-food app to this kind of prison-guard behavior would be an enormous blow to a thriving area of innovation. The pace of innovation in smartphones is so fast, in fact, that it is solving many of the safety concerns NHTSA raises before the agency even gets around to regulating the technology -- and there is no chance the bureaucrats will ever keep up. Their ""voluntary"" guidelines require each interaction with the software to take two seconds or less. But on the latest Android phones, users can simply say, without taking their hands off the wheel, ""OK Google, navigate to McDonald's on 108th Street in Omaha, Nebraska."" This takes longer than two seconds but is far safer than anything NHTSA's rules imagine. Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, who has led the way in defeating the FDA's attempt to regulate health-related apps, was quick to respond to NHTSA's similar encroachment with an amendment last week to prohibit the agency from ""regulating, adopting guidelines with respect to, or prescribing the design of"" mobile software. Such explicit denials of authority may be the only way to deal with a federal bureaucracy that thinks it should have a say about everything.

"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old boy appeared in a California juvenile court on Tuesday in connection with a small fire that occurred during several wildfires last week in San Diego County, authorities said. No further details were available on the nature of the juvenile court appearance for the teen, said spokeswoman Tanya Sierra of the San Diego County District Attorney's Office. The juvenile court judge closed Tuesday's proceedings to the media, and authorities weren't releasing details because of the individual's juvenile status, Sierra said. The 17-year-old boy was arrested last week with a 19-year-old man, but the older teenager was released and there will be no charges filed against him, Sierra said Tuesday. Both individuals are from Escondido in San Diego County, and the small fire that prompted their arrest Thursday was extinguished, authorities said. ""We can only file charges when we believe we can prove them beyond a reasonable doubt, and in this case, after a thorough review of the case, the district attorney's office declined to file criminal charges"" against the 19-year-old man, Sierra said. Authorities have already charged Alberto Serrato with arson in connection with another small fire last week. He is accused of adding brush onto an existing small fire in the San Luis Rey riverbed area in Oceanside, authorities said. Serrato, 57, pleaded not guilty on Friday, Sierra said. Serrato is the only person charged with arson in last week's wildfires, which at one point numbered about three dozen. In all, nearly 26,000 acres, or about 40 square miles, were burned the past week by nine major fires in San Diego County, Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said Tuesday. On Tuesday, all but three wildfires were completely contained. The Cocos Fire in San Marco burned 1,995 acres and was 93% contained Tuesday, Cal Fire said. The Pulgas Fire on the Marine Corps base Camp Pendleton burned 14,416 acres and was 99% contained Tuesday afternoon, Cal Fire said. The San Mateo, or Combat Fire, also on Camp Pendleton, burned 1,457 acres and was 99% contained Tuesday afternoon, Cal Fire said. The two fires and others on Camp Pendleton last week burned 21,900 acres, almost 18% of the base, the Marines said. San Diego County authorities have formed a task force to investigate more than a dozen wildfires from last week, said Jan Caldwell, spokeswoman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. ""The purpose of the task force is to be a clearinghouse for investigators to look for similarities in these cases,"" Caldwell said. ""They will do trend analysis and look for patterns."" A second task force with the district attorney's office and state insurance authorities was also warning homeowners on Tuesday to be wary of criminals who prey on victims of natural disasters, the district attorney's office said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration and many of its national security critics agree that it's time to revisit the war authorization that Congress approved a week after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But when to end it and how to replace it is another matter. The House defeated an amendment by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, that would have ""sunsetted"" the so-called ""never-ending war"" a year from now. Attention now turns to the Senate and whether a proposal will emerge there. The law authorized a military response to the terrorist attacks by striking back against al Qaeda and associated forces, including their Taliban allies, who at the time ruled Afghanistan. Its scope is broad enough that it has been used by successive administrations to carry out military attacks as far afield as Africa and Yemen. When to end it is a prickly enough issue that the White House has done little to move ahead with President Barack Obama's promise, as described in a 2013 speech at the National Defense University, to work with Congress to ""refine and ultimately repeal"" the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF. As in other national security policy fights -- that of drones, for instance -- the rise of tea party-affiliated libertarians and Obama's sagging popularity have scrambled some of the traditional alliances on the war authorization. Liberals and right-leaning libertarians who criticize the war authorization as too much of a blank check to the President are uniting to support a repeal of it as a way to assert congressional authority. Some conservatives -- who not long ago supported extending the current AUMF -- now suggest replacing it with a law that specifies the groups the U.S. is fighting. ""I think we have abdicated our responsibility to define the nature of the conflict we're in,"" Schiff said in an interview. His amendment appeared to have gained steam, in part because the White House has struggled to make clear what it thinks should happen. At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday, senior lawyers from the Defense and State departments said repealing the law would do no harm to national security or affect military operations, because the President's executive powers allow a military response to any threats to the nation. And yet, they wouldn't say whether the administration supported ending the war now. ""We're not here to say it should be repealed today,"" said Mary Mcleod, deputy legal adviser at the State Department. The issue matters because U.S. forces are exiting a war in Afghanistan that lasted more than twice as long as World War II. Some legal experts believe that development adds some pressure to replace the existing AUMF, in part, because the main al Qaeda forces that attacked the U.S. have been decimated, even as new offshoots have metastasized the terrorist threat to parts of Africa, Syria and the Arabian Peninsula. Michael Mukasey, attorney general under President George W. Bush, said at the Wednesday hearing that he supports the idea of Congress revisiting the authorization to clarify its intent. Harold Koh, the State Department's top lawyer under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said the law should be narrowed and eventually repealed. Administration officials say part of the complication lies in ongoing negotiations with Afghanistan over whether the United States will retain forces in that country after this year, a deal that can't be reached until after Afghanistan elects a new president in June. ""As we work with the government of Afghanistan to identify an appropriate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014; as we continue to make progress towards the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay; and as we continue to work with our friends and partners around the world to provide assistance and training to counter al Qaeda and its associated forces, we will engage further with Congress and the American people on efforts to ensure that the legal authorities for our counterterrorism and detention operations are appropriately tailored,"" said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council. ""In keeping with our ongoing efforts to realign our forces and capabilities after the drawdown in Afghanistan, we look forward to engaging the Congress on the President's goal of refining and ultimately repealing the AUMF,"" she added. Only three years ago, Congress was being pressured to expand the authorization. In 2011, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, tried to pass a new AUMF to reaffirm the war against al Qaeda and to try to restrict the President's hand on issues such as the plan to close the Guantanamo prison. McKeon's push to give the existing war authorization more life has partly influenced the Obama administration's effort on the issue. Two administration officials told CNN that part of the reason for the White House's hesitation is the fear that some congressional hawks would use the opportunity to expand the so-called War on Terror. Or that the administration could end up without any authorization at all. In his State of the Union speeches this year and last, Obama said he aimed to pull the United States back from its ""permanent war footing."" Some congressional critics say Obama's policies appear to prematurely declare victory over al Qaeda's core leadership, and ignore the growing threat from affiliates such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and groups fighting in Syria, Iraq and Libya. With partisan bickering sowing gridlock in Congress, passing any law on the war authorization is a tall order. Congress is also debating surveillance law changes in the wake of the leaks about the U.S. government's spying activities by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Schiff scoffs at the notion it's too hard to tackle. ""We drafted the AUMF in days after 9/11; we should be able to do this in a year,"" he said. After all, ""one of the most important things that Congress does is to declare war and define the focus of that war.""","The Authorization for Use of Military Force was approved in 2001 .

"(CNN) -- Federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the August 1, 2007, bridge collapse in Minnesota that killed 13 people and injured 145. Thirteen people were killed and 145 were injured in the August 1, 2007, Minnesota bridge collapse. The gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, causing the collapse, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. There were 111 vehicles on the portion of the bridge that collapsed, dropping them 108 feet into the 15-foot-deep river. An NTSB report released Friday said the board's investigation found that 24 ""under-designed"" gusset plates were not discovered in reviews during the bridge's design and construction. The bridge opened in 1967. Substantial increases in the weight of the bridge because of modifications through the years, along with increased weight on the bridge due to construction equipment and rush-hour traffic the day of the collapse, likely contributed to the faulty plates' collapse, the board said. The board's investigation determined that other possible reasons for the collapse, including corrosion found on the plates and preexisting cracks in the bridge, did not play a role in the collapse. ""We believe this thorough investigation should put to rest any speculation as to the root cause of this terrible accident and provide a roadmap for improvements to prevent future tragedies,"" said NTSB acting chairman Mark V. Rosenker.  See diagram of bridge » . Several victims of the crash have filed lawsuits against a consulting firm that evaluated the bridge and the construction company whose equipment was on the bridge the day of the collapse. As a result of its investigation, the safety board made nine recommendations to the Federal Highway Administration and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials dealing with improving how bridges are inspected and how bridge designs are reviewed.","Faulty support plates led to Minnesota bridge collapse, according to NTSB .

"Toulouse, France (CNN) -- The disruptive days of thunderous, fuel-guzzling planes hovering in our skies could be a thing of the past. So too could the tortuous queues and endless boarding process, if futuristic flight concepts become reality. Since the first commercial passenger flight in 1914, 65 billion passengers have taken to the skies and another 65 billion are expected to do the same before 2030. And experts say efficient, greener performance is what will steer aviation into the next century. ""A major breakthrough in an airliner will bring half a percent, 1% greater fuel efficiency, which doesn't sound like much -- but to an airline, it's huge. It's millions of dollars (in savings) a year,"" said Robert van der Linden, chair and curator of air transportation at the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum. The Airbus A380 is the world's biggest passenger aircraft, and its future depends on constant redevelopment and improving performance. The energy problem is one of the major drivers for the company, Gregor Dirks, corporate innovator for Airbus, told CNN's Isa Soares. ""We have to do something about it. Reducing fuel burn is one way, and we have been very successful in the past."" The Airbus vision of the future can be seen through its concept plane design, which is packed with the stuff made of engineering dreams. One concept feature is dubbed ""eco-climb,"" where take off is assisted by propelled acceleration for a steeper climb, so that planes reach efficient cruise altitudes sooner. In the concept cabin, seats will use body heat to power aircraft systems such as holographic pop-up pods, while a futuristic cabin membrane can become transparent to give passengers open panoramic views. What's more, Airbus has radical ideas for speedier boarding. ""We could think about city center check-in and actually transport little pods to the airport where the passengers are already in and just slide the pod into the airplane,"" said Dirks. Some of the full-blown features of the Airbus concept plane will become a reality later this century, according to Dirks, but parts of the vision are already being implemented in the current fleet. Titanium brackets used in the cabin have been made using 3-D printing, reducing the weight of the parts, and allowing the manufacture of ""organic"" shapes that would otherwise be too expensive to produce. ""This is going to be a big revolution in manufacturing,"" predicted Dirks. ""Passengers won't see it much but they get more choice and they got it cheaper and earlier.""","Aviation's future must be efficient, greener and easier as air traffic grows .

"(CNN) -- Given the country's aviation boom and pilot shortage, you might think this would be a good time to be a pilot in China. According to an open letter from pilots making the rounds on Chinese media, however, major issues within China's cockpits may eventually ""threaten flight safety."" Signed by dozens of Air China pilots last month, the letter criticizes unfair salary structures between Chinese and foreign pilots and complains about what the pilots call the airline's ""blind expansion"" policy and a ""destructive usage"" of pilots. The letter, whose authenticity CNN has not been able to independently verify, says that overwhelming demands on local pilots and more favorable treatment of foreign pilots is leading to extreme friction among flight crews and an unbearable work environment. The Chinese pilots say they're hoping a new leave policy will be implemented, given that the current workload has left their physical and mental health ""severely damaged."" Headquartered in Beijing, China's national flag carrier operates more than a thousand flights on peak travel days according to the airline's official company profile, and employs 3,700 flight crew, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. Demanding equal pay . Unequal pay and unfavorable treatment of local employees compared with expat hires is a major point of contention in the letter. ""[Foreign pilots] do not have a higher skill or standard compared to us, and are not able to enhance the overall technical skill of the airline,"" says the letter, claiming foreign pilots enjoy more days off, easier flight routes and much larger salaries than their Chinese counterparts. ""The sense of superiority in the bones of white people, plus unfair payments, has made the relationship between Chinese and foreign pilots intense, extremely unhelpful to cockpit management and will eventually threaten flight safety,"" says the letter, which has since mostly disappeared from Chinese news and social media web sites. The letter was initially picked up by local newspapers, but has not been featured in the national (state-run) media. While Boeing and Airbus have established pilot training schools in China and other Asian countries, the demand for pilots is so high that it's difficult for many Asian airlines to keep up. A Boeing report published in August 2013 predicted that the global explosion in demand for air travel -- mostly in the Asia Pacific region -- will require 192,300 new pilots by 2032. The report forecast that a staggering 40% of that demand -- 77,400 pilots -- will come from China. In recent years, Chinese airlines seeking quick solutions to pilot shortages have recruited foreign pilots with high salaries and enticing benefits packages. Although Air China declined to comment to CNN for this story, current job postings appear to confirm a wide discrepancy between salaries paid to Chinese and foreign pilots. A current recruitment posting on Aviationjobsearch.com by Air China for a foreign A330 captain lists a starting salary of $204,000. Meanwhile, Chinese financial news site Yicai (link in Chinese) reports that a local Air China pilot makes approximately $96,000. Can't quit . The report states that Air China pilots receive the lowest salary in China among nationalized and private airlines in terms of hourly wage. It's not just salary discrepancy that Air China pilots are unhappy with. Even when they wish to resign, Chinese pilots are prohibited from quitting, say Air China pilots in the letter. In China, pilots resignations must be approved by airlines, as pilots are considered assets too expensive to lose due to expensive training paid for by airlines. Chinese courts typically side with the airlines in such disputes, sometimes forcing pilots to pay exorbitant fines in order to resign.","To meet pilot shortage, Chinese airlines pay foreign pilots higher salaries than Chinese pilots .

"(CNN) -- Pop icon David Cassidy, in rehab after his latest DUI arrest, says if he ever takes another drink, it could be fatal. In an interview with Piers Morgan, Cassidy admitted that his latest drunken driving arrest was a wake-up call. ""If I take another drink, I'm going to die, physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I'm dead,"" Cassidy, 63, said. ""You know, they say it's a slippery slope. ... It's not a slippery slope. It's from 12:00 to 6:00 on the clock and the whole face is ice. One sip, one drink, because there is no such a thing, not to an alcoholic. You have one and you're -- you're done. I'd be done."" Cassidy said it was time to stop being in denial and be honest with himself. ""It's very painful, especially when I spent most of my life being what I would consider a very loving, caring charitable man and someone who has always protected my own image until the time, not wanting to disappoint the millions of fans that I have around the world. And, and it's very humbling and it's also humiliating."" Cassidy checked into rehab in South Florida after being arrested on a DUI charge on January 10 in Los Angeles after stopping for a drink on his way to the airport. He pleaded no contest and received a sentence of five years' probation and 90 days in rehab, although his manager said he will be credited for the time he has already spent in residential treatment . That incident followed DUI arrests in August 2013 in Schodack, New York, (that case is still pending) and one in St. Lucie County, Florida, in November 2010 for which he received a sentence of a year's probation and had his license suspended for six months. The singer also received community service and a fine in that case. His interview with Morgan was the first time Cassidy had publicly talked about his struggle to stay sober. ""I am most definitely an alcoholic,"" Cassidy said. ""And the interesting thing about it and the way you end up with multiple DUIs -- I never got arrested for anything until I was basically 60 years old. And I have very, very strong values about what I am and who I am. ""I've done an enormous amount of bringing light into people's lives, and I'm very proud of that and touching and inspiring people."" He admitted that until his latest arrest, ""I had been lying to myself and consequently lying to everyone else about my disease."" Cassidy came to fame with his role as Keith Partridge in the hit '70s TV show ""The Partridge Family,"" and toured the world singing his hit songs. At the time, his fan club was bigger than Elvis and The Beatles and he continues to perform around the country. The drinking began in 2002, he said, and then got worse over time. This is Cassidy's third stint in rehab. ""I certainly never drank or took any drugs or narcotics, contrary to whatever has been printed, when I was doing 'The Partridge Family' or thereafter for that matter,"" he said. In recent months, the former teen idol acknowledged that he was on a downward spiral. In addition to the most recent arrest, his third wife filed for divorce. Asked how she would react to how the drinking affected his behavior, he told Morgan, ""She'd just say it made me an ass. ... you know it made me a fricking d**k. And you know, I wasn't ... authentic, OK. It's because I have an allergy to it. My personality changes I'm not aware of it. I never stop talking, you know. ... it's obnoxious. It's embarrassing."" Despite all his recent setbacks, Cassidy said he had recently had a life-altering ""spiritual experience."" ""I dropped to my knees and I felt something go through me that was like, I felt this experience that was just, thank you God. I felt this relief. I begged it and I was crying and weeping like a little boy, like a, like a sobbing little infant, like I'm sure I did many times as a kid. And I felt this incredible sense of relief because I stopped lying to myself,"" he said.","The former teen idol says his latest arrest has been a ""wake-up call""

"(CNN) -- As I research my family history, preparing a book about my grandmother Madeleine Edison Sloane, ""Edison's Daughter,"" I occasionally come across holiday pictures of Glenmont. This was my great-grandfather Thomas Edison's home in West Orange, New Jersey, and in the pictures it's decorated for the Christmas and New Years' Holidays. Thanks to his invention, the home bursts with light in those pictures; the radiance is almost palpable. All the bulbs were incandescent, of course. There wasn't any other kind, and candles would have been way too dangerous. Light and safety, and low cost, were all great features of Edison's light bulbs. But come January 1, when a light-bulb law setting new efficiency standards is set to take effect, it's out with those old incandescents and in with the new. My great grandfather's 100-watt incandescent will be replaced with new energy-efficient versions, including CFLs, LEDs, and -- yes -- new and improved incandescent bulbs. When better lighting is fully implemented throughout our country, we'll be saving $13 billion a year in electricity costs and we'll eliminate the need for 30 large power plants, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. And my great-grandfather wouldn't have it any other way. For the record, Thomas Edison was a patriot, he was a futurist, and he was green. Edison's concern after the turn of the last century was with pollution and nonrenewable resources, not with freezing technological change at the level of 1879. He wanted the Swiss to harness water power in 1911; he wanted Ford and Firestone to recognize that oil was nonrenewable but the sun was infinite and free; he wanted to use goldenrod—a roadside weed—to serve as a cheap and independent source to replace imported foreign rubber. He wanted everything that today's eco-opposition want to undercut with ill-considered political posturing. Edison would have spurned the recent sleight of hand by Congress that leaves the new lighting standard -- under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007-- on the books but takes away its funding for nine months. How can inventor-entrepreneurs like Edison make a profit if every time they try to make a technological advance some nut in Congress pulls the rug out from under the them and their breakthroughs? And if investors are going to put their bets on more efficient technology, they have to know that a congressional holiday on common sense will not come along to undercut demand for their product. Thomas Edison would have been the first to support technological advances, that's the real, obvious message of his 1,000-plus patents. Let's invent the future. He would have embraced new tough standards as a way to move our antiquated energy policies forward, helping people save money when they most need it, and reducing carbon pollution that puts our future at risk. So where would Edison be tonight? He'd be in the lab inventing a better light bulb. Engineers sharing Edison's legacy are working on these better bulbs now—and with the advances in chemistry and materials since Edison's time—they're creating better lights and lower costs with more efficiency and far less pollution. Let's also not forget that most old incandescent bulbs manufactured today are imports from China. You remember them: The same folks who sent Louisiana and Mississippi polluted sheet-rock to rebuild their hurricane-ravaged houses and are using the profits to buy up American debt. Domestic sources of light would have been Edison's first priority. Upon his winter visit to the Edison winter home in Florida, Seminole Lodge, he would have heralded news of unemployed former NASA scientists being scooped up by Florida's Lighting Science Group to advance initiatives in LED technology. More jobs would have been another good result of technology in Edison's point of view. The future of the light bulb is bright. You can take that as straight goods from Edison's own great-grandchildren. Drop by my house and enjoy the two lighted deer on my porch roof. They sparkle with light. They are cheap to run. The lights are LEDs. And I love them. To my eye, they are just as bright as the ones in the Edison family's Glenmont home at Christmas, maybe brighter. When Edison died in 1931, the world found that it could not turn off the electricity to honor him for even a minute because it had grown so dependent on electricity in Edison's lifetime—they had to settle for just dimming the lights. As you turn off your lights December 31, remember that when you switch on the lights in 2012 they will be brighter and cheaper than ever, and safer. And they will also help America reclaim its place as a leader in technology, invention, and entrepreneurialism. That's Edisonian. Let's do our best in 2012 to help his technological children succeed in doing just that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Edward Edison Sloane.","David Sloane says his great-grandfather, Thomas Edison, would have liked efficient bulbs .

"(CNN) -- Spring has barely sprung, but Melissa Joan Hart is ready for beach season. The 37-year-old actress has lost 40 pounds with her gig as a spokeswoman for Nutrisystem, and she's eager to show off what she looks like in a bathing suit. ""It's not everyday I like to show a lot of skin, but these days, I'm feeling confidant (sic),"" she wrote on Instagram on April 8 along with a photo of herself in a revealing pink bikini that presumably will be seen in her upcoming commercial for the weight loss company. On Nutrisystem's website, Hart explains she first signed up for the program because she'd been carrying around an extra 30 pounds after the arrival of her third child, Tucker, who turns 2 in December. ""Simple things like bending down to pick up toys or walking up the stairs were difficult,"" she says. ""I just wasn't able to keep up with my active boys. ... Everyone thinks that when you live in Hollywood, you have an entourage of people doing everything for you. ""The truth of the matter is, I'm a working mother of three. I don't always have time to go to the gym; I don't always have a trainer available to me. So it's important for me to eat right."" Hart's been working on weight loss for more than a year, as she first revealed that she'd dropped two sizes in April 2013. But it wasn't until now that she's felt comfortable enough in her skin to wear a bikini.

"(CNN) -- When is bug spray more than just bug spray? When it's a compound that, according to researchers at Vanderbilt University, is thousands of times stronger than DEET, works on many different insects and could very well save lives. Scientists at the school say they've developed just such a repellent. Known merely as VUAA1 for now, they say it works not just on mosquitoes, but also ants, flies, moths and a host of other bugs that, at best, are a nuisance and, at worst, carry deadly diseases like malaria. In fact, the project began as an effort to curb malaria, which will probably be contracted by as many as 500 million people this year, said Laurence Zwiebel, a professor in the biological science department at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. But researchers soon discovered the chemical compound they'd created could have wider uses. ""It turns out if we found the world's greatest mosquito repellent, no one would care,"" Zweibel said. ""So we needed to find something that would work against all insects."" The trick, Zweibel says, was taking the way bug spray as we know it works, then doing the exact opposite. Most commercial insect repellents target the bug's olfactory system -- the way it smells -- to make it harder for them to find us and consider us as targets for a meal. ""We decided to take a more aggressive approach and, rather than turn off the mosquito's olfactory system, we could look for something that would turn it too far on, to see if we could design a new generation of insect repellents based on overloading their smell system,"" Zweibel said. ""They hate, just like we hate, overstimulation. They will move away from too much smell."" The researchers, who were funded in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, say that, so far, VUAA1 has worked on every insect they've tested it on. That widens the possibilities for it. Potential uses range from shooing away bugs that eat crops to a commercial product that can be used to keep pests out of the home. But the original goal, helping prevent a deadly disease that, according to the Centers for Disease Control killed more than 660,000 people in 2010, remains foremost for Zwiebel and his team. ""Our hope is that we're able to help develop a product that can be sold for profit in the developed world, and use that profit to leverage distribution in the developing world,"" he said. ""Our hope is that every time we spray on a mosquito repellent here in America, we're subsidizing malaria reduction in Africa and Asia."" The team has patented the compound. But there's no word yet on when it might hit the shelves. For now, they're doing tests to make sure it will be safe for people to use. ""So far, we don't see any toxic effects,"" Zwiebel said.","An insect repellent from Vanderbilt works on mosquitoes, ants and other bugs .

"Rome (CNN) -- Amanda Knox should receive a 30-year sentence for the 2007 killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher, an Italian prosecutor said at her retrial Tuesday. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini also called for a 26-year sentence for Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. The retrial at an appeals court in the Italian city of Florence began in September . Sollecito and Knox were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed in November 2007 in the villa that she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Their convictions were overturned in 2011 for ""lack of evidence."" But Italy's Supreme Court decided last year to retry the case, saying that the jury that acquitted them didn't consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. Both Knox, 26, and Sollecito have maintained their innocence. The retrial began on September 30 without either of them present in court. The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini, read out the details of the case, including the conviction of Ivory Coast citizen Rudy Guede for his role in Kercher's murder. In his second day of closing remarks, Crini said both Knox and Sollecito should be convicted and handed a 26-year sentence for homicide, with an additional four years for Knox for slander. The slander charge relates to Patrick Lumumba, a Congolese bartender whom Knox originally accused of Kercher's murder. Lumumba spent several weeks in jail after Knox accused him, and he won a defamation suit against her. On Monday, Crini recapped the evidence against Knox and Sollecito and highlighted what he said was suspicious behavior by Knox after Kercher's killing. Knox has not been in court for the retrial. She returned to her hometown of Seattle after her acquittal and has been living there since. She says she is afraid to return to Italy, where she spent four years behind bars. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","A prosecutor calls for Amanda Knox to be given a 30-year sentence at her retrial .

"(CNN) -- Gaby Ortiz was just 15 years old when she left her home in Mexico and emigrated to the United States in the late 1990s. She was young, newly married and thought achieving the American Dream would be instantaneous. But her life in Atlanta, Georgia, didn't quite start out that way. She was scared, didn't speak any English, couldn't find a job, and was pregnant with her first child. Over the next few years, Ortiz gave birth to two children, Ramiro and Alondra. She says she stayed home all the time and she only associated with the Latino community in Atlanta because it was the only place she felt comfortable. However, her life changed when Ramiro began kindergarten in 2004. Ortiz still didn't speak English and had no idea how she was going to be able to help Ramiro with his schoolwork. Ortiz says she was determined to learn English and fast. ""We put everything aside. No Spanish TV. It was just English. So, Ramiro whatever he brought from school I was learning with him, helping him, and learning and going to classes."" Opinion: Economy and immigration linked to American dream . That same year, Ortiz heard about LaAmistad, a nonprofit after-school tutoring organization specifically geared to Latino students and their families. She enrolled Ramiro to make sure that someone could help him with his schoolwork. She was mainly concerned that he wouldn't speak English well and would fall behind in school. LaAmistad is different from most after-school programs because it also provides classes and workshops for parents. In addition to English as a second language classes, there are also workshops on finance, health, nutrition and parenting. Parents learn everything from balancing a checkbook to how to cook healthy meals on a limited budget. ""The La Amistad families have been able to acclimate here in the U.S. so much easier because we've given them the tools. They are very comfortable in social settings. They are comfortable participating in the PTA. They are comfortable going to the grocery store and having a conversation with the checkout lady,"" says La Amistad Program Director Cat McAfee. Opinion: How American can fix its immigration system . ""What we've noticed is the parents are then more invested. They will go into the school and advocate for their children and it makes for a well-rounded family."" The program started in 2001 at Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta with a couple dozen students and a handful of volunteers. Since then, the program has helped more than 100 students and their families, says McAfee. LaAmistad has also opened two other campuses in Atlanta and one in Mount Pleasant, Texas. It plans on opening a dozen more campuses over the next five years in Atlanta and other locations in the United States with a high Latino population. Ortiz and her children have been a part of LaAmistad for eight years. Now 30, she is a single mother raising three children. Ortiz says that thanks in part to LaAmistad, she is fluent in English, has a full-time job, takes GED classes, and is active at her children's schools. Her daughter Alondra, in sixth grade, and younger son Marco, now in kindergarten, have received full scholarships to an Atlanta private school, she told CNN. Ramiro is in the eighth grade and plans to go to college to become a cardiologist or a lawyer. LaAmistad, says Ortiz, is helping her family make their American dreams come true.

"(CNN) -- Facebook's computer systems will soon be able to recognize familiar faces. Facebook is making changes to the process for tagging friends in photos uploaded to the social network, the company announced on Tuesday. Starting in a few weeks, the system will scan all images posted to Facebook and suggest the names of people who appear in the frame. Last year, Facebook began rolling the facial-recognition feature out to a test group. Facebook's more than 500 million users have been automatically included in the database, but the company is allowing each person to choose whether to be identified by toggling a pane in the account's privacy settings. The option is called ""suggest photos of me to friends"" within the ""customize settings"" page. The tool would still scan that person's face and figure out who it is, but it won't display that information. People can still manually tag friends. The news sparked a small brushfire of media hostility. Bloggers characterized the tool -- and Facebook's decision not to ask before including everyone -- as unsettling while others urged readers to opt out. Facebook said on Wednesday it had made mistakes with the release. ""We should have been more clear with people during the roll-out process when this became available to them,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Tag Suggestions are now available in most countries, and we'll post further updates to our blog over time."" Google recently decided not to release an application that would let someone snap a picture of a person's face using a smartphone in order to find out who the subject is, Eric Schmidt, the search giant's executive chairman and former CEO, said at a conference last week. Schmidt believed it to be the first time Google engineers had completed a project and decided to shutter it for privacy reasons, he said. The work on Google's facial-recognition technology has not gone to waste. It's used to preserve privacy by blurring faces in Google's Street View mapping project, Hartmut Neven, the engineering director for image recognition, said in a recent interview. When asked whether he would be frustrated if Facebook beat his team to releasing a face-recognition product, Neven said: ""Let them get burned first. There would be some backlash."" Photo-management software such as Google's Picasa and Apple's iPhoto provide a similar feature. They pore over a person's snapshots in an attempt to group each person together by facial features. Google has not enabled this feature on the online version of its photo software, called Picasa Web Albums. Limited to a small sampling of the few hundred photos on a person's computer, these systems aren't very accurate. With the largest photo-sharing service in Facebook scanning millions of pictures daily, these algorithms are no doubt learning quickly. More than 100 million photos per day are uploaded to Facebook, according to a company statement. The face-scanning feature actually runs counter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments to reporters in November. ""Before people-tagging came out, I think most people would have said that the best way to figure out who's in photos was to have some face-recognition algorithm,"" he said. ""But it actually turns out that the best way is to just have people tagged."" Some experts agree with Zuckerberg's apparently outdated statements. ""Face technology will never work in gigantic-large databases,"" said Ipplex CEO Orang Dialameh, who has worked with Neven in the past. However, ""if you limit the database -- say, I'm trying to recognize someone in the 400 contacts that I have on Facebook,"" then face scanning could be effective, he said. Facebook users who have installed an app called Photo Finder can already have faces in their photos scanned and identified. The 3-year-old app has looked at more than 23 billion images, said Gil Hirsch, the CEO of Face.com, which develops the service. With Facebook poised to offer essentially the same functionality, Face.com will instead focus on partnerships with developers, Hirsch wrote in an e-mailed statement Tuesday night.  ""As long as their products provide value to consumers while protecting their privacy, we will always be supportive of companies using this technology,"" he said.","NEW: Facebook apologizes, says tag suggestions are available now ""in most countries""
Facebook will start scanning and identifying all pictures uploaded in the next few weeks .
Users can now opt out by clicking a few buttons on their privacy settings pages .
It's unclear how well Facebook's facial-recognition software works ."
"(CNN) -- Defending champion Rafael Nadal is through to the final of the Rome Masters after comfortably seeing off Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals. The world No. 1, who battled past Andy Murray in three sets on Friday, made lighter work of his Bulgarian opponent on Saturday winning through in straight sets 6-2 6-2 in just over an hour and 20 minutes. ""I played a solid match and was very good with my backhand,"" Nadal said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. ""Yesterday I played a great match and today was a good confirmation that I play better, that the forehand starts to fly again, the top spins as well. A lot of positive things."" The Spaniard, who will be going for an eighth crown in the Italian capital, will be fresher than his Serb adversary who navigated a slightly more circuitous route to a fifth final in Rome. The world No. 2 was out on court nearly three hours against Canada's Milos Raonic but eventually prevailed in three sets 6-7 (7/5) 7-6 (7/4) 6-3. ""It was a big win,"" said Djokovic, ATPWorldTour.com reported. ""Because it gives me a lot of strength and belief that I hope I can carry into tomorrow's final and the rest of the season. ""He played at a high level, especially on his serve, and I cannot recall the last time when I felt so helpless in the return games. I couldn't really read his serve."" Over in the women's draw, Italy's Sara Errani is through to Sunday's final. The world No. 11 saw off Serbia's Jelena Jankovic 6-3 7-5 and now has a shot at becoming the first Italian winner since Raffaella Reggi triumphed in 1985. Standing in her way is world No. 1 Serena Williams who needed three sets (6-1 3-6 6-1) to see off another Serb, Ana Ivanovic. The American has a 6-0 record against Errani with only one of those matches -- a second round tie on the hard courts in Dubai -- going to three sets. But Williams, who is looking to clinch a third title in Rome, isn't underestimating her opponent. ""I think she's improved immensely, even in the just the last two weeks,"" Williams said of Errani, WTATennis.com reported. ""She's taken her game to another level and has a lot of confidence having beaten two really good Top 10 players (Li Na and Jankovic).

"(CNN) -- Instagram is a decidedly modern invention, but back in your great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents' day, ""Photochroms"" were the functional equivalent. Photochroms combined emerging photographic technology and the painterly techniques of the old masters to provide technicolor glimpses of the Great Lakes, Old South, Wild West, and Pacific coast. These dreamlike vistas have been collected for the first time in a volume called An American Odyssey by Marc Walter and Sabine ArquÃ©. The oversize, $200 book is a sampling of the 100,000 Photochroms created by the Detroit Photographic Company between the company's formation in 1888 and its closure in 1924. The Photochrom Process . Photochrom photographers would start the process by coating a printing plate with a light-sensitive emulsion and then exposing a glass plate photo negative onto it. Unlike modern four-color printing process that can represent millions of colors by overlapping tiny dots of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink, the inks mixed for Photochroms were mixed by hand in an attempt to perfectly match the yellow-green sunblasted scrub brush that surrounds the Grand Canyon or the aquamarine ocean water of the Bahamas. The photographers would erase the entire plate except for the area reserved for that specific color and make 10-15 more plates to fill out the composition. Photographic details were preserved, but an emotive, if slightly artificial, range of color was added. The Detroit Photographic Company toured large Photochroms on trains and the U.S. Government supercharged their spread by passing a law that allowed Photochromic postcards to be sent for a penny, rather than the going rate of two cents. Like the locomotives of that era, labor-intensive Photochroms lost steam as the first color film debuted in 1907, and Kodak made color snapshots widely available with the release of Kodachrome cameras in 1935. However, as a testament to the charm of the technique, the last Photochrom factory didn't close its doors until 1970. An American Odyssey is available from Taschen.

"(CNN) -- Conventional wisdom can be a dangerous thing. The media and political chattering class are rushing to explain how Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor could lose his primary election to a relatively unknown challenger. No one saw it coming. And apparently it's not enough to just bask in the shock. We need answers. But this loss is not just about immigration reform or even the tea party. It's about the insanely unpopular Republican leadership in Congress and one of its figureheads, who increasingly made little legislative progress for America or for his district. Yes, in the waning hours of the campaign, immigration was a key issue. But a poll taken on election night shows that fully 72% of Cantor's very Republican district support immigration reform including a path to citizenship. Conservative commentator Erick Erickson tweeted Tuesday night, and followed up with a blog post today, confirming that Cantor's loss had nothing to do with immigration reform -- though conservatives would happily exploit that narrative. Indeed, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a far stronger and more consistent supporter of immigration reform, handily won his primary last night in a much more conservative voting bloc. Spreading the myth that Cantor lost because of his (wavering, undefined and weak) support for immigration reform not only does harm to the truth but serves to create a self-fulfilling prophecy in which immigration reform is now dead in Congress. It need not be and should not be if voters have any real say in our country -- or if Republicans hope to show leadership on our nation's challenges and win over the future of the American electorate. But alas, this thinking reflects what really suffered in this race: The shell of our political system, already dreadfully hobbled by Republican intransigence, will further grind to a halt. This is also not necessarily, as noted, because Cantor's challenger Dave Brat was backed by the tea party. Brat was overlooked and brushed aside by most of the national tea party infrastructure -- they hardly showed up. Brat himself Tuesday night on Fox News boasted himself as a traditional Republican. Certainly Brat was supported by local tea party enthusiasts, but he was not exactly waving nor wrapping himself in their Gadsden (""Don't Tread on Me"") flag. Arguably, the reasons for Cantor's demise are more subtle -- and ultimately hold even more danger for the GOP and the nation. As Brian Beutler wrote Wednesday for New Republic, Cantor had largely abandoned his constituents in favor of growing his national profile. Remember that Cantor had radically undermined disaster funding just before a surprising and deadly earthquake rocked his own district. And Cantor was too busy trying to slash all government funding to use any constructively for the other need of his constituents. Meanwhile on issue after issue, there was a sense that voters couldn't trust Cantor -- because he, like his party, constantly flip-flopped on every issue in a vain attempt to placate his increasingly vocal right flank. Beyond that, there's a conflation of gripes here. Conservative Republicans were increasingly frustrated by GOP leadership in general and Cantor in specific, not courting and honoring the more ideologically entrenched voices within their rank. At the same time, Americans of all political stripes -- including arguably moderate Republicans -- were increasingly frustrated by a do-nothing Republican Party solely committed to political grandstanding while utterly refusing to solve any of the nation's pressing problems. And this is where the Republicans -- not to mention the good of our country --- are really in long-term danger. We need (at least two) political parties in the United States that wrestle over the big challenges and needs of Americans and, yes, at times actually pass legislation and get things done. Voters are extraordinarily frustrated that's not happening, and they rightly blame the gridlock on Republicans. It will now only get worse. Absolutely no one, not even Republican voters, likes what this Republican Congress is doing to this country. Cantor wasn't conservative enough for the increasingly extremist Republican base but was simultaneously too extreme for the mainstream of voters. Now his party will move further to the right and away from responsible leadership. That's bad for Republicans and bad for America.","Sally Kohn says Eric Cantor's surprising loss doesn't mean what you think it means .

"(CNN) -- Since the December 14 mass killing in Connecticut, we've seen a lot of finger pointing. Too many guns. Not enough guns. Powerful lobbyists. Insufficient mental health services. Discussion of possible explanations is often neither civil nor constructive, and based on a closed-minded and entrenched belief that those who disagree with us have their facts wrong. The victims in Sandy Hook, Aurora and Fort Hood -- all killed or wounded by gun violence -- deserve better. There are two major ways we can zero in on facts and foster a more informed discussion. The first is to further develop and meaningfully consider high quality scientific research on violence prevention and mental health. The second is to create more opportunities for public policy discussions that incorporate this research. Politics: New Congress, new push for gun laws . The scientific literature regarding violence prevention is considerable. Yet important research that focuses on gun violence has been shut down for political purposes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention once considered gun violence a public health issue. The science agency had the freedom to ask important questions: Does having a gun in the home make a family safer? Do concealed carry laws increase or reduce gun fatalities? But in 1996, the National Rifle Association pressured its many supporters in Congress to put the squeeze on the CDC by cutting funding that went to gun research, with the stipulation: ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" Gun-related research ground to a halt. In 2009, scientists funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism looked into whether carrying a gun increases or decreases the risk of being shot in an assault. In 2011, Montana Rep. Denny Rehberg inserted a provision into a funding bill that extended the CDC restrictions to the rest of the Department of Health and Human Services, ending that similar research. Even Obamacare has been touched by the NRA: The new health care law restricts doctors' ability to collect data about patients' gun use. ""Criticizing research is fair game,"" Drs. Arthur Kellermann and Frederick Rivara wrote in opposition in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month. ""Suppressing research by targeting its sources of funding is not."" Science and engineering research can answer important questions. For instance, can we cost-effectively engineer firearms to be used solely by the registered owner? What's the best way for law enforcement agencies to share gun violence data? Does media attention focused on the killers encourage copycat crimes? Does better access to mental health services reduce criminal activity? Some findings could lead to policy choices that aren't yet on the table or help determine where we should best focus our attention. Republicans and Democrats alike are warming up to the idea that adequate research can lead to more informed policy decisions. Former Rep. Jay Dickey, the Arkansas Republican who led the charge against the CDC in 1996, recently expressed regret for suppressing firearm safety research. Just as important, how do all these pieces of the puzzle fit together? Having an informed debate means relying on credible syntheses of expert studies. To come up with answers, scientific organizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences, could convene independent panels to piece together what is known and what is not known and to evaluate various policy options. The commission set up after the 2010 British Petroleum oil spill is one such example. The 9/11 Commission is another. Analysis: Guns and the law . When independent experts who are free from conflicts of interest come together in good faith to study an issue, they can have a profound and constructive influence on government policy. At a more basic level, national and state legislative committees should hold more hearings designed to study evidence rather than using hearings as theater to advance a political point of view. Nongovernmental organizations, including the one where I work, can redouble their efforts to bring scientists and policymakers together. This is especially important after the demise of the Office of Technology Assessment, a research office within Congress that, until the mid-1990s, provided independent analyses on issues up for congressional debate. In the absence of a reliable base of information we can all agree on, we guess. We interpret the facts to suit our beliefs. We put our faith in the institutions or individuals we trust, whether it's the NRA, religious leaders or gun control groups. And we keep on having the same broken debate. Of course, the evidence can only take us so far. Moral, economic, legal and political arguments can and should carry weight. But robust research can set the baseline for a discussion and help us make the best decisions for society. The more polarized, caustic and poorly analyzed an issue, the more intractable it becomes. We need to develop venues for rational discourse about research that is resilient to political pressures. More robust partnerships among scientists, policymakers and the public can help us work together to address critical challenges, even after they fall from the headlines. Vice President Joe Biden is leading a task force to address our country's problem of gun violence. One critical step the task force should embrace is to lift restrictions on the research public health scientists can do. And we can all reject attempts to discredit evidence that challenges our beliefs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Halpern.","Michael Halpern: We need scientific research on gun violence to inform policy .
Halpern: The NRA pressured Congress to end gun violence research at CDC .
Researchers free from conflicts of interest should work with policy makers, he says .
Also, we must open our minds to findings that disagree with our beliefs, he writes ."
"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- A perilous face-off intensified Saturday when Russia state news complained that Ukraine had mobilized 15,000 troops in the suburbs of Slavyansk in eastern Ukraine ""in order to wipe out the city and its residents."" Quoting a Russian Defense Ministry source, RIA Novosti said satellite photos showed the force forming around the city that has become a friction point between the Ukraine military and pro-Russian militants. The Defense Ministry source said the number of Ukraine troops put the pro-Russian militants at a disadvantage because the latter are ""armed only with small amount of pistols and shotguns."" Many eastern Ukraine residents have Russian roots and sympathize with Moscow. The source said the photos showed about 160 tanks, 230 infantry combat vehicles and armored personnel carriers, mine throwers and multiple-launch rocket systems. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly criticized Kiev's use of force against Ukrainian civilians. Developments in Ukraine have come at a rapid pace in recent days: . -- Russia, which already had 40,000 troops on its side of the border, started new military drills a few days ago after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants. Ukraine launched the second stage of an ""anti-terrorist operation"" against militants in Slavyansk. -- On Friday, a team of European and Ukrainian military observers were seized Friday by pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk. -- Russian military aircraft ""crossed and violated"" Ukrainian airspace seven times overnight, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told reporters in Rome on Saturday. The Russian Defense Ministry denied the accusation, according to the state news agency Itar-Tass. -- Yatsenyuk met with Pope Francis while in Rome on Saturday. The meeting has been seen as a sign of support from the Vatican for his government. -- G7 leaders said they would impose new sanctions on Russia over its role in the crisis. The Ukrainian Prime Minister urged Russia to pull back its security forces and not to support pro-Russian militants in eastern and southern Ukraine. ""We urge Russia to leave us alone,"" he said in televised remarks. Ukraine's government has promised constitutional reforms and protections for Russian speakers in a bid to ease the tensions in its eastern regions. Inspectors seized in Slavyansk . On Saturday, the fate of the military inspectors preoccupied world leaders. The inspectors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were detained Friday as they entered Slavyansk, along with five Ukrainian military representatives and the driver of their bus, Ukraine's Interior Ministry said. Ukraine's Security Service, the SBU, said the group is being kept under ""inhumane conditions"" in the basement of a building held by the militants. The self-declared mayor of Slavyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, told reporters that one of the ""prisoners"" has diabetes, but he has the medicine he needs and will be given his own quarters overnight. Separatist leader Denis Pushilin, self-declared chairman of the so-called ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" told CNN he doesn't believe they are from the OSCE, but that some are NATO spies. The German Foreign Office said it had set up an emergency task force to find out what has happened to the team members, four of whom are German. The others are from Denmark, Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, Russian state media said. The OSCE mission in Ukraine is tasked with helping to implement an international agreement signed nine days ago in Switzerland, which called for illegal militia groups to disarm and leave occupied buildings, among other provisions. In a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asked the United States to use its influence to secure the release of pro-Russian leaders being held in Ukraine. Kerry urged Russia to support efforts of the OSCE and the government of Ukraine to liberate the inspectors and their Ukrainian guides, according to a senior State Department official. Targeted sanctions . Against the backdrop of increasing volatility in Ukraine, leaders of the G7 industrialized nations on Friday announced they would ""move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia"" over its actions in Ukraine. The statement from the group -- which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States -- came hours after U.S. President Barack Obama threatened Russia with new sanctions. CNN's Gul Tuysuz reported from Kiev and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Andrew Carey and Nick Paton Walsh in Slavyansk and journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev contributed to this report. CNN's Alex Felton, Bharati Naik, Ben Brumfield and Boriana Milanova also contributed.","Russian state news says 15,000 Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- After officially hosting a single guest -- Croatia, which its national team ungraciously greeted with a 3-1 drubbing -- Brazil opened its doors wide on Friday, the World Cup's first full day of competition. That meant welcoming the last World Cup's finalists, not to mention tens of thousands of fans in the stands and millions more tuning in on TV. Here are a few big developments -- from both on and off the pitch -- from Friday in Brazil: . Reigning champ goes down, hard . The last time Spain and the Netherlands dueled on soccer's biggest stage, in 2010 in South Africa, they went scoreless for 90 minutes of regulation, then 25 more minutes of extra time. Andres Iniesta broke the deadlock, giving Spain its first ever World Cup title. But Friday's rematch was an oh-so different ballgame. Things started off well for Spain in the European powers' Group B showdown in Salvador, as it jumped ahead midway through the first half on a penalty call in the box. The Dutch notched up the score just before the break on a pretty diving header by Manchester United striker Robin van Persie. Then the onslaught began. Netherlands pumped in four goals within 30 minutes in the second half, crushing the reigning World Cup champs en route to a convincing 5-1 decision. Netherlands thump Spain . Interpol eyes alleged match-fixing . Considering Spain's success in recent world tournaments, one might think that Friday's rout is impossible to believe. While there's no indication of any fix in the Spain-Netherlands' matchup specifically, Interpol Secretary General Rob Noble did tell CNN's Richard Quest on Friday that members of his international investigative agency are in Brazil and other places due to serious concerns about match-fixing and illegal betting during this year's tournament. During the interview in France, Noble said that whenever ""there are organized groups engaged in illegal betting"" -- as is happening in connection with the World Cup -- there are worries they might try to impact results. ""With illegal betting, there's a greater likelihood that there could be an influence on the outcome of the match or an influence on what happens on the pitch, based on a bribe or some kind of corrupt act,"" Noble said. FIFA slaps Beckenbauer over corruption probe . The idea of corruption in international soccer is unfathomable, you think? Well, you might want to think again. The latest scandal that has embarrassed the sport has to do with the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, setting the stage for a tournament in that small, dry and scorching (if the event is in summer, as it usually is) Middle Eastern nation. So far, there's been no official finding this decision wasn't aboveboard -- though the whole process has already claimed a few high-ranking officials in Nigeria's Amos Adamu and Oceania representative Reynald Temarii. In addition, Mohammed bin Hammam has been banned for life in connection with another bribery scandal, while FIFA Vice President Jack Warner quit after being implicated in the same case. The latest official in the sport to be ensnared in all this is also one of its biggest names: Franz Beckenbauer. Beckenbauer banned by FIFA . The only man to win the World Cup as a team captain and coach has been provisionally suspended from all soccer-related activity for 90 days, FIFA announced Friday. He was one of the 22 FIFA executive committee members who voted on the 2022 site. The sport's world governing body claimed that the 68-year-old Beckenbauer failed ""to cooperate"" with a probe of Qatar 2022 and its bidding process ""despite repeated requests for assistance"" in answering questions either in person or in writing. Last week, Beckenbauer told German media that he did not respond to the questions because they were in English and he did not understand them. FIFA said in its statement that the questions were presented in German as well as English. Latin American teams win again . But enough of these downers. Let's get back to Latin America, where the fun has begun -- especially for teams from there. Brazil, by virtue of its tournament-opening win, was the first to join the party. Then Mexico, out of North America, took center stage in the next contest in Natal. The game wasn't always pretty or clean, with three controversially disallowed goals (two by Mexico, one by Cameroon). It certainly wasn't dry, with a persistent, pelting rain drenching everything in sight. But Friday's matchup was successful for El Tri, which earned a 1-0 victory to even Mexico up points-wise with Brazil in Group A. The final contest Friday pitted Chile against Australia in the inland city of Cuiaba, which is closer to the Bolivian capital of Sucre than Rio de Janiero, Brazil. The Chileans pounced on the Socceroos from the get-go, notching two goals within the first 14 minutes. Australia got within a goal and narrowly missed several chances to tie it up, only to give up another score late to fall by a 3-1 margin. Tuning in, from Thailand to the Vatican . While only eight countries have taken the stage so far, that doesn't mean the rest of the world hasn't been watching. Some 3.2 billion people watched the 2010 World Cup, according to FIFA. And while ratings aren't in yet about the current edition, the expectation is that these numbers will grow. Brazil 2014 set to smash TV records . This despite the fact that there's a lot of other stuff going on. Not just things like work, chasing after kids or making a sandwich, but dealing with war, famine and other harsh realities that plague our world. The people of Thailand have been dealing with the aftermath of a military coup, which followed months of unrest that destabilized the elected government and spawned outbursts of violence. The Asian nation's leaders subsequently instituted a nighttime curfew to keep things in check. But on Friday, they lifted that curfew in more than 30 provinces and districts, including tourist havens Phuket, Pattaya and Krabi.

"(CNN) -- For years, Jean-Philippe Kayobotsi's work meant business trips, investment plans and high-level meetings with powerful politicians and top corporate executives. Having worked at Deloitte, the African Development Bank and even as an adviser to the president of Rwanda, Kayobotsi's illustrious career had taken him to Europe, Latin America and Africa. And then his hibernating entrepreneurial spirit kicked in. Last May, Kayobotsi swapped business suits for casual clothes, and strategic pitches for delicious pastries as he decided to go into business on his own, opening up Brioche, a high-end bakery and coffee shop in Kigali, the bustling capital of Rwanda with some one million residents. ""My friends said I was a bit crazy to leave a well-established institution and job to venture into business -- I guess maybe they are right partly but I really felt it was what I wanted to do,"" says the 38-year-old entrepreneur. ""For some reason, I always had this entrepreneurial drive so I decided to walk the talk instead of preaching for private sector development,"" he adds. ""I looked for an opportunity that both made business sense and would excite me. A quality coffee shop was both a gap in the market and something I was really interested in -- I love good food, good drinks and good service."" Drawing inspiration from successful international chains like Starbucks, Le Pain Quotidien and Paul, Kayobotsi says he wanted to start what he calls a ""boutique"" bakery in Rwanda that could fit in any country in the world. And when it came to naming his new venture, the entrepreneur didn't have to think too hard -- he just trusted his taste buds. ""Brioche is a very popular bread in some parts of Europe and it is definitely my favorite kind of bread,"" says Kayobotsi, who is half Rwandan, half Belgian. ""We have it with sugar, plain, with chocolate or with raisins."" Big dreams . Inside the Brioche store, a group of black-shirted workers line up in front of a small kitchen counter to prepare a wide range of bakery and pastry products -- from chocolate mousses and croissants to tuna sandwiches and cakes made of locally produced strawberries and mangoes. Different types of bread and pasta are also on offer here, as well as a variety of coffees and juices. ""We have about 20,000 items that are being sold each month -- and it is increasing,"" says Kayobotsi. Currently, Brioche employs 12 people but that number is expected to increase as Kayobotsi plans to open more stores in Kigali and beyond. ""This is the first of many boutiques we want to spread across Rwanda, the region, and Africa,"" says Kayobotsi. ""We want to be the Starbucks of Africa!"" Easy to start a business . Rwanda, a tiny landlocked country of more than 11 million people in central east Africa, has made remarkable economic progress since the end of a brutal genocide that claimed 800,000 lives in 1994. According to the World Bank, the country has moved from a reported poverty rate of about 78% in 1995 to less than 50% in 2012, a year when its economy grew by 8%. A series of legal and administrative reforms also mean that the process of creating a company in Rwanda is fast and affordable. As a result, the country is ranked today number nine of 189 economies across the world by the World Bank index that measures the ease of starting a business -- a sentiment echoed by fledgling businesspeople such as Kayobotsi. ""You can actually create a company in the morning and receive your incorporation certificate in the afternoon of the same day,"" he says. Yet, there are still many risks that budding entrepreneurs in Rwanda need to navigate. ""One of the challenges I see not just for a bakery but for many businesses in Kigali is the fact that we are landlocked and transport costs are huge,"" says the Brioche founder. ""We do purchase some flour locally but the bulk of it comes from France and Belgium,"" he adds. ""Electricity is also very expensive."" 'No need of aid' Despite such challenges, Kayobotsi has big plans for the future. Although Brioche has yet to make a profit, because of the startup costs, Kayobotsi eyes bigger growth and has already purchased two more store locations in Kigali. He is also planning to build a massive central kitchen so he can maintain quality control and supply all of his Brioche bakeries in the city. ""I am a firm believer that Africa -- and Rwanda -- is in no need of aid or government programs but of private sector investments,"" he says. ""Only private sector investments, in my view, can have the magnitude in terms of scale and creativity that is required to create the millions of jobs that Africa needs for its young generation.""

"(CNN) -- ""What kind of coffee do you have?"" ""Well, black, or with milk,"" comes the grumpy reply. This is the delightfully retro Bambi bar, where the interior and the grumpiness of the service haven't changed for 50 years. Nor has the coffee -- a drink that's always played a central role in Budapest life. Through the communist years those shots of dark, bitter coffee in small glasses, served by scowling waitresses, were a staple start to the day. While coffee's importance hasn't changed, a new wave of coffee bars -- where competitive baristas know their ristretto from their cortado -- is shaking up the scene. The buzz word is ""kezmuves"" -- it roughly translates as handmade, or craft. There are three keys to the new craft coffee bars -- talented staff (with the certificates to prove it), slick design and carefully chosen ingredients. The coffee is sometimes described locally as ""third wave,"" meaning it's fairly sourced and roasted on a smaller scale, giving it a lighter, less bitter taste than Italian beans. ""In new wave coffee you discover the real qualities of the coffee beans, like the fruity, citric qualities of African beans or the chocolate of Brazilian beans,"" says Peter Repka, manager of the Madal craft coffee bar. Despite the interest in new wave, both old- and new-style coffee houses compete to deliver Budapest its caffeine kicks. Here are some of the best: . New wave coffee . Madal . Indian philosopher Sri Chimnoy, whose childhood name was Madal, must have loved his coffee. Inspired by his calmness, the friendly, capped baristas here earnestly go about their work, explaining the different beans and roasts available and serving beautifully presented cups. They also bake their own sweet and savory croissants. Madal, 3 Hollan Erno St.; +36 1 796 6287 . Espresso Embassy . This is one of the largest and best designed craft coffee bars -- it's staffed by an array of award-winning baristas. The brick-vaulted interior was done by the firm that designed two of the stations on the city's new metro line. An excellent cake selection includes croissants, cheesecakes and brownies. Espresso Embassy, 15 Arany Janos St.; + 36 30 864 9530 . My Little Melbourne . Pioneer of the craft coffee movement, this minute coffee bar in the center of town is a busy breakfast place. Inspired by the Australian travels of owners Dia and Peti, it serves some of Budapest's best coffee and pastries. My Little Melbourne, 3, Madach Imre St.; +36 70 394 7002 . Fekete . This one's even smaller than My Little Melbourne, but aficionados speak of Fekete with great respect. With a couple of tables on the pavement in front, Fekete (meaning ""black"" in Hungarian) is all about coffee, and very little else. Fekete, 5 Muzeum korut . Tamp & Pull . This is the smaller of the T&P shops, but it's the most central, down the road from the Central Market Hall. The name refers to two moves in the barista's work -- tamp and pull -- which they do so well here they run courses on the art of coffee. A board on the wall details the beans on offer each day -- where they were grown, who farmed them and at what altitude. Tamp & Pull, 3 Czuczor St.; + 36 30 668 3051 . Old wave coffee . Cafe Alibi . Breakfast is the best time to visit Cafe Alibi, a quietly hip square in the heart of Budapest. It's often buzzing with the local students enjoying the superb coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. Cafe Alibi has its own roasting machine, offering customers a choice of beans and coffee type. Cafe Alibi, 2 Egyetem ter; +36 1 317 4209 . Cirkusz . At this large cafe/restaurant in the heart of Budapest's partying Seventh District, the baristas roast their own beans. The coffee is superb, and so is the food -- after all those small coffee bars, you'll enjoy the space. Cirkusz, 25 Dob St.; +36 1 786 4959 . Coffee Cat . There's no craft coffee here, but the baristas in this busy breakfast joint know how to make an excellent brew. There's also a great selection of baguettes, with fillings such as caponata, roasted squash or chicken salad, from the sandwich specialists at the Delibaba Workshop. Coffee Cat, 44 O St.; +36 1 708 0170 . Zokni . Zockni, or ""Socks,"" isn't the obvious name for a cafe, particularly one placed across the road from one of Budapest's big tourist draws -- the magnificent Great Synagogue. It was the owner's nickname in his taxi driving days. More importantly, the baristas turn out top coffee and the cakes are delicious. Zokni, 1/b Dohany St.; +36 1 785 6765 . Bambi . Finally, across the Buda river to old Budapest, to the glorious Bambi. No new coffee here. No fancy baristas, either. The retro feel hasn't been put together in a design studio -- it's always looked this way. It's one of the great survivors of the past. Here you can enjoy a strong black coffee in an old-style glass, sit on red plastic seats and watch old men playing cards. Just don't ask for a cortado.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An explosion outside a political rally in northwest Pakistan Monday killed five people and wounded 10, officials said. The Tehrik-e-Taliban, or Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the blast. ""We carried out the attack,"" said Asim Mehsud, the Taliban spokesman for Pakistan's South Waziristan region. ""We will also target upcoming rallies of the Awami National Party, as it is a secular party. We will also target any other rallies conducted by secular political parties in the future."" The chief minister and provincial leaders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the rally was held, attended the event, which was hosted by the Awami National Party. They left the vicinity shortly before the explosion, provincial spokesman Mian Iftikhar Hussain told a local news channel. The Awami National Party is often targeted by the Taliban. It is part of the governing coalition led by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's Pakistan Peoples Party. In November, party member Hanif Jadoon and his bodyguard were killed in a suicide attack. Jadoon had just finished morning prayers on the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha when a bomber approached his car and detonated his explosives. The attack took place in the Swabi district of the province, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Islamabad. CNN's Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","NEW: The Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for the blast .

"(CNN) -- A drone strike took place early Friday in Pakistan's northwestern tribal region of North Waziristan near the border with Afghanistan, a Pakistani military official said. Authorities are trying to determine the number of casualties, said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Pakistani Army. ""Right now, the area has been cordoned off,"" he said. North Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border and widely believed to be a haven for the Haqqani network and other militant groups that are fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. The attack Friday targeted an area of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan. The United States rarely acknowledges its drone program publicly, although President Barack Obama commented on such strikes in January and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta acknowledged the use of CIA predator drones in the region last year. Pakistani lawmakers are currently debating a parliamentary committee's report that recommends that the United States stop drone strikes inside its territory and apologize unconditionally for airstrikes last year that killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers near the Afghan border. There has been a sharp drop in the number of suspected U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan since those fatal airstrikes.","A drone attack occurs in North Waziristan, a military official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two videos and an audiotape of a terrorism interrogation that were found by the CIA in 2007 show September 11 suspect Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, a knowledgeable U.S. source told CNN on Tuesday. On the tapes, Bin al-Shibh is seen sitting at a desk answering questions, according to the source, who said the tapes do not show any use of ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques such as waterboarding. The tapes were recorded in Morocco and found under a desk at the CIA Counterterrorism Center in Langley, Virginia, in 2007, according to the U.S. source. An October 2007 letter from federal prosecutors to U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema confirmed the existence of the tapes. However, the letter did not reveal the identity of the person being interrogated. The Associated Press first reported that Bin al-Shibh was the subject in the tapes. Bin al-Shibh was captured in Pakistan in 2002. The exact date of his interrogation on the video is unclear, but it is believed to have occurred within months of his capture. Bin al-Shibh's lawyer, Thomas Durkin, said Tuesday that he was unaware until now that the tapes involved his client. ""I was rather dumbfounded to think that we had litigated as long as we had in Guantanamo without knowing there were tapes of Mr. Bin al-Shibh,"" Durkin told CNN. Such a lack of disclosure by prosecutors in a death penalty case is ""shocking,"" he said. Bin al-Shibh is one of five September 11 suspects, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who originally were scheduled to be tried in New York in connection with the 2001 terror attacks on the United States. According to Durkin, the status of the case is unclear because the Justice Department and the Obama administration have yet to decide where the trial will occur, after protests arose over holding it in New York City. The U.S. source noted that Bin al-Shibh has been considered mentally unstable, and Durkin said the interrogation tapes would set a ""baseline"" for his client's mental state at the time. CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said Bin al-Shibh helped plan the September 11 attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center, damaged the Pentagon and killed almost 3,000 people. ""He applied for an American visa,"" Bergen said Monday. ""He wanted to be one of the hijackers. He was turned down. He's a Yemeni. He then basically assumed a quite important role in coordinating all the acts of the hijackers. He was a liaison between the hijackers in the United States and Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan."" The tapes are believed to be the only ones left that show a ""black site"" interrogation in a third country. The CIA announced in 2007 that other tapes showing enhanced interrogations of suspects Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri were destroyed. CNN's Dugald McConnell contributed to this story.","NEW: Source says terror suspect has been considered mentally unstable .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Militants killed a driver of a container truck carrying supplies for NATO in Pakistan's tribal region on Monday, a government official told CNN. Three gunmen in a car opened fire on the truck in the Jamrud area of Khyber Agency, a district in Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, said Bakhtiyar Khan, a government official in the district. Khan said three members of the truck crew were also injured in the incident as the vehicle moved towards the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Several anti-American militant groups, including the Taliban, are active in the region. Pakistan reopened routes into Afghanistan a month ago after closing it to NATO traffic in anger at the killing of 24 Pakistani troops by coalition forces. The Pakistani Taliban threatened to attack NATO trucks when the border reopened, saying the supplies are used to target its members fighting against occupation in Afghanistan. Taliban have attacked NATO supplies in the past, and killed drivers and other crew. On July 5, trucks carrying supplies to NATO troops crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the first time in seven months, officials said. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants have to be trucked in from Pakistan. On July 3, Islamabad decided to reopen the crucial supply routes shut down on November 27, a day after coalition forces mistakenly killed the 24 Pakistani troops. The Pakistani routes offer a shorter and more direct path than ones through Russia and other countries which NATO was forced to use when the border was closed. It has cost the U.S. an extra $100 million a month to use the alternative northern routes. Journalist Aamir Iqbal contributed to this report.","The driver of a container truck bringing NATO supplies to Afghanistan is killed .

"(CNN) -- If most new moms would breastfeed their babies for the first six months of life, it would save nearly 1,000 lives and billions of dollars each year, according to a new study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. ""The United States incurs $13 billion in excess costs annually and suffers 911 preventable deaths per year because our breastfeeding rates fall far below medical recommendations,"" the report said. The World Health Organization says infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life ""to achieve optimal growth, development and health."" The WHO is not alone in its recommendations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all agree that breast milk alone is sufficient for newborns and infants until they are 6 months old. However, a 2009 breastfeeding report card from the CDC found that only 74 percent of women start breastfeeding, only 33 percent were still exclusively breastfeeding at three months and only 14 percent were still exclusively breastfeeding at six months. Dr. Melissa Bartick, one of the new study's co-authors, says the vast majority of extra costs incurred each year could be saved ""if 80 to 90 percent of women exclusively breastfed for as little as four months and if 90 percent of women would breastfeed some times until six months."" Bartick is a hospitalist -- a doctor who specializes in the care of hospitalized patients --  at Cambridge Health Alliance, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a mother of two. Bartick and her co-author Arnold Reinhold found that most of the excess costs are due to premature deaths. Nearly all, 95 percent of these deaths, are attributed to three causes: sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); necrotizing enterocolitis, seen primarily in preterm babies and in which the lining of the intestinal wall dies; and lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of all of these and seven other illnesses studied by the study authors. Bartick calculates $10.56 million for each of the estimated 911 children's deaths. Researchers also included the direct costs of health care and parent's time missed from work. They did not include the cost of formula, which is another added cost for moms who don't breastfeed. There are a lot of factors contributing to low breastfeeding rates in the United States, and Bartick says moms shouldn't be blamed, because they receive mixed messages and often lack support from the moment their babies are born. She says the biggest priority should be to improve maternity care practices. Bartick refers to a 2007 CDC survey of hospitals and birthing centers, which scored each facility to determine how well it complied with recommendations meant to encourage women to breastfeed. According to that survey, Bartick says, ""U.S. hospitals scored a 63 - that's a D."" Bartick says many hospitals delay immediate urgent skin-to-skin contact between mom and baby, which can make things harder for the newborn to act on its natural instincts to suckle. Moms also need to be better educated about the importance of breastfeeding and they need adequate support after they leave the hospital in case they run into problems because the newborn isn't properly latching on and therefore not getting enough food. Dr. Alan Fleischman, medical director for the March of Dimes, was not surprised by the findings of the report. Fleischman, who did not work on this study, says if a new mom is struggling with breastfeeding, she may end up in a situation where ""grandmother suggests to stop the silliness and give formula instead."" He believes the mothers and grandmothers of new moms also need to be educated about the benefits of breastfeeding because for their generations, feeding their babies formula was the norm.","Study urges infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life .

"London (CNN) -- With his fate at home hanging in the balance, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani repudiated U.S. claims that Pakistan was falling short on fighting the war on terrorism and said instead that his nation was operating on a trust deficit with Washington. ""There's a trust deficit between both the countries, between both the governments,"" Gilani said in an interview with CNN in London. ""That is the reason we are wanting to work for new terms of engagement and cooperation with the United States."" Pakistan has been a key U.S. ally, but relations between the two nations have been strained in recent months, especially after last year's killing of Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil and a NATO airstrike in November that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. Amid a lack of harmony, the Obama administration has said it is not convinced Pakistan is pulling its weight. At the end of an Asia tour Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Pakistan ought to do more in fighting extremism. Gilani countered that his country was doing all it could in partnership with the United States. ""If there is any credible, actionable information, please share with us, because are already working with you,"" he said. ""My ISI is working with the CIA. What else do you want?"" The ISI, or Inter-Services Intelligence, is Pakistan's powerful spy agency, which some U.S. officials have charged is protecting militant groups. How can relations between the two nations, strained in recent months, improve? ""One point,"" Gilani said. ""That is mutual respect and mutual interest."" A lack of trust is not the only stain marring a critical relationship. Pakistan has said it wants an end to U.S. drone strikes on its territory, and Gilani made the point again Tuesday. ""We always take drones as counterproductive, and it's not lawful,"" Gilani said. Back at home, Gilani faces myriad national woes: a faltering economy, widespread poverty and corruption. And now, his own future. He was convicted last month of contempt for his refusal to revive old corruption charges against President Asif Ali Zardari. Some analysts predicted the conviction would plunge Pakistan into crisis, perhaps even spark another military coup. But on a five-day visit to the United Kingdom, Gilani remained confidant and defiant as ever about stepping down, saying that only parliament had the right to force him from office. ""If I'm disqualified, notified by the speaker, then yes I have to,"" he said about leaving his job. Pakistan's Supreme Court issued a detailed verdict Tuesday that made it clear it held Gilani in contempt of court for defying the highest judiciary in the land. Gilani defended himself just as strongly as he defended Pakistan and the course it has taken in battling terrorism. ""Whatever I have done is according to the constitution,"" he said. ""It is not on any moral turpitude or financial corruption."" He said information about the most wanted terror suspects is shared with Washington. In the case of bin Laden, Gillani said Pakistan was not aware of the al Qaeda mastermind's residence in Abbottabad. ""That was intelligence failure of the whole world. It was not just an intelligence failure of Pakistan,"" he said. Pakistanis, of all people, know the consequences of terrorists on their soil, he said. However, Clinton said this week that the United States believed Ayman al-Zawahiri was hiding in Pakistan. Al-Zawahiri inherited the al Qaeda leadership after the death of bin Laden, who spent years on the lam in Pakistan, fleeing from safe house to safe house, according to one of his widows. Clinton also touted the Rewards for Justice program, aimed at obtaining information that could help convict suspected terrorists. Rewards go as high as $25 million for information on al-Zawahiri and $10 million for information about Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, a Pakistani man wanted by Indian authorities in connection with the 2008 assault on Mumbai, India, that killed 166 people. Asked why Saeed remains a free man, Gilani said Pakistan was still ""waiting for some concrete sort of information and evidence"" that could be used against him in court. CNN's Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani says Pakistan wants ""new terms of engagement"" with U.S.

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- Several times a week, a 74-year-old grandmother drives into the murder capital of the world to help keep a sanctuary for its citizens alive. Guadalupe Arizpe De La Vega insists on returning to her hometown to preserve the Hospital de la Familia, a health center she started more than 30 years ago. ""It's very, very important to keep that place open, giving good services"" to the people of Juarez, De La Vega says. ""Because it's their hope."" But her journey from El Paso, Texas, to Juarez has seared some painful images into her mind. ""We were going under a bridge and there was a body upside down without a head, hanging there with all the blood flowing,"" she recalls. ""It was something like a horror movie."" Such sights have become increasingly common in Juarez, as Mexico's drug war has intensified. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed so far this year, including 34 members of the municipal police. That's on top of the 2,623 deaths last year and 1,908 deaths in 2007-08. Despite the violence, De La Vega's hospital and its staff -- which treats about 900 patients daily, regardless of their ability to pay -- have remained unharmed. ""Our hospital has not been touched. Our doctors have not been kidnapped. This is a miracle of God, believe me,"" she says. ""Everybody knows that [it's a] safe place for healing, for loving, for empowering people. Why would they be against that? We have been working there for 37 years with the community,"" she says. ""We don't turn anybody away."" De La Vega, who is married to a prominent businessman from Juarez, lived there for decades, but the escalating violence, murder, crime and corruption recently forced her to move to El Paso. She says the tipping point came when her family was threatened. ""They called and they said that they had kidnapped my daughter. They wanted us to send the money, but my daughter came into the room while we were talking to them. More than anything I wanted to protect my three children,"" she says. De La Vega says she has lost friends and neighbors in the conflict, but she insists she's not afraid -- and she's determined to help the people of Juarez continue receiving the medical care they need. De La Vega has always been passionate about health care, volunteering with the Red Cross when she was 8 years old. She became an advocate for maternal and infant health in the early 1970s after reading a newspaper article about an impoverished mother of nine, pregnant with her 10th child, who tried to kill her fetus by stabbing herself in the stomach. De La Vega went to visit the woman in jail and asked her why she did not practice family planning. Shocked to learn the woman lacked the most basic knowledge about preventing pregnancy, De La Vega helped her obtain legal counsel and began a quest to educate other women. She partnered with community health volunteers called ""promotoras"" in villages across Mexico to help educate women about family planning and support maternal and infant health. ""We want the baby to have a good beginning in life. From there, you can do everything else,"" she says. One of De La Vega's first clinics was built in the early '70s where the Hospital de la Familia sits today. It was just a few rooms and was not equipped for delivering babies. But when De La Vega opened the doors to a desperate woman in labor, it started a decades-long expansion process that recently resulted in the birth of the facility's 100,000th baby. The hospital does far more than deliver babies. With a staff of 144 doctors and 192 nurses, Hospital de la Familia performs emergency care as well as routine and specialized surgeries for adults and children. Six months ago, specialists were brought in to perform the hospital's first successful heart surgery. And De La Vega is always looking for ways to provide more services to the community. ""Every year is a little bit bigger and a little bit better,"" she says. ""We want the poorest people to have the best care because they need it and they deserve it."" Although the Hospital de la Familia does charge patients who are able to pay, it does not currently make a profit -- though it hopes to be sustainable one day. For now, the hospital is funded entirely by a nonprofit organization called FEMAP-SADEC that was founded by De La Vega. The Hospital de la Familia is just one of the organization's many health care facilities. In addition to seven hospitals and 32 FEMAP-SEDAC clinics across Mexico, the organization also started a microfinancing program and nursing school. For De La Vega, who frequently visits patients and is active in administrative, operational and financial aspects at the hospital, her work not only saves lives but has given meaning to her own life as well. ""I just love it. Because it's my life, it's my passion. I get the privilege of experiencing the magic moment of change from sickness to health, from darkness to light, from apathy to enthusiasm. This is what gives me meaning to my life."" Want to get involved?

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities have started legal proceedings against the widows of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for allegedly entering Pakistan illegally and alleged forgery, Pakistan's interior minister told reporters Thursday. The widows are in the custody of Pakistani authorities, Minister Rehman Malik said.

""And there were many other incidents where deception and forgery was committed,"" Malik told reporters. The widows have already been presented in court and are now in custody, the minister added. ""The most important thing is that the women are kept in a proper manner, and keeping this in mind they have been kept in a proper house which has been declared a sub-jail,"" Malik said. Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency initiated the proceedings against the widows three days ago. ""They can have their own lawyers, and they will have the whole liberty to defend themselves in the court,"" Malik said. The children of the widows aren't included in the proceedings and are free to live in the country, he explained. ""There is no case on the children. Only the adult family members, who knew the law and who abetted Osama, have had a case registered against them,"" Malik said. ""A five-bedroom house has been given to them, so the children feel they are in their own home and have been given every type of facility, food and shelter, as though it were their own home,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Seventeen Pakistani soldiers who were kidnapped last week are shown beheaded in a video released by the Taliban. A senior Pakistani military official confirmed to CNN that the bodies shown in the video, their identifications flashed before the camera as evidence, indeed belonged to members of the Pakistani army and a Pakistani paramilitary force. Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan provided the video, which restates the militants' goals -- to sever Pakistan's alliance with the United States and to bring sharia law to Pakistan. The names of the dead are recited in the video. ""We are not the enemies of Pakistan and its people. In fact, we are enemies of the infidels and the democratic system that has been imposed upon us,"" the video says. The Pakistani military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the soldiers were kidnapped last Friday. The soldiers were on a routine patrol in the Upper Dir district of Pakistan, near the Afghan border, when more than 100 militants who crossed the border from Afghanistan attacked, the official said. Fifteen militants were killed in the fight, but the 17 soldiers were captured, he said. The militants, who belong to the Pakistani Taliban and other groups, then crossed with their prisoners back to Afghanistan, the official said. Militants based in Afghanistan have killed more than 100 Pakistani soldiers in cross-border attacks since 2010, the official said. ""It was very sad but it won't demoralize our troops,"" he said. The official said that NATO and the Afghan government have ""badly failed"" at stopping militants from entering Pakistan. CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","A Taliban video claims to show 17 beheaded soldiers .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's prime minister named a new head of Inter-Services Intelligence, the country's powerful spy agency and a critical element in the U.S. fight against insurgents in both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Lt. Gen. Zahir Ul-Islam, who is currently serving as an army corps commander in the region of Karachi, steps into the new post, the office of Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Friday. The current ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, is retiring March 18, Gilani's office said. The appointment has been approved by the head of Pakistan's military, Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. Kayani submitted three names to the prime minister to select from for the appointment. A spokesman for the Pakistani army would not comment on the matter. ""Obviously, the army chief is close to all three of the individuals he recommended for the position, but we don't comment on why he chose those names,"" said Maj. Gen Athar Abbas, the army spokesman. A U.S. official who was not authorized to speak for attribution said Ul-Islam ""is close to Kayani"" and has served in key positions in both the Pakistani army and at the ISI. The official also said Ul-Islam is familiar with the United States. ""During his career, (Ul-Islam) traveled to the U.S. to participate in U.S. military sponsored training and international fellowship programs,"" the official said. It remains to be seen how Ul-Islam's appointment affects the country's intelligence relationship with the United States. However, the U.S. official said, ""We would expect (Ul-Islam) to continue cooperation with the United States in our mutual fight against terrorism."" The United States relies on the cooperation to aid its efforts to target al Qaeda and the Taliban, especially as Pakistan-based insurgents continue to provide critical support and manpower to the insurgency in Afghanistan. The appointment comes as Pakistan is reconsidering its ties to the U.S. intelligence service after a tense 2011 in which Pakistan was kept out of the loop as U.S. intelligence tracked al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden to a Pakistani town, flew undetected into the country and killed him. That was followed by the killing of two dozen Pakistan troops when U.S. and NATO forces fired on two border outpost under the mistaken belief they were being attacked by Taliban. In addition, U.S. government and military officials have accused the ISI of aiding and protecting the Taliban. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, accused the ISI of protecting a key Taliban group, the Haqqani network, calling it a ""veritable arm"" of the Pakistan spy agency. The effect was to chill Pakistani cooperation with the United States. U.S. drone strikes targeting al Qaeda and the Taliban were paused for over a month after the border incident but have since resumed. Even with the tension, there continues to be a ""back and forth"" of information sharing, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, David Petraeus, said in January. He described the relationship as ""strained"" and ""fraught,"" but said there continued to be intelligence discussions. The Pakistani parliament is preparing an assessment of the overall U.S.-Pakistani relationship, including the intelligence agencies. That will then be used as basis for the Pakistani Cabinet to advise on how the country should move forward. CNN's Reza Sayah and Nasir Habib reported this story from Pakistan; Adam Levine and Pam Benson reported from Washington.","An army corps commander takes charge of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence .

"(CNN) -- As the United States commemorates a decade since one of the most tragic days in its history, there will be plenty of television programming to mark the occasion. Beyond the news coverage of the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, there are more than 40 specials, documentaries and other shows planned. The programs seemingly cover every aspect, from Animal Planet's ""Saved,"" about how the bonds with their pets helped two New York City families cope with 9/11, to Paul McCartney's documentary ""The Love We Make,"" about the benefit concert he organized after the tragedy. The latter was only recently completed and will air on Showtime. And McCartney won't be the only famous face weighing in. ""Access Hollywood"" will offer reflections from celebrities, and BIO will offer ""When Pop Culture Saved America,"" a two-hour documentary examining how ""Comedians, singers, actors, entertainers all did their part with concerts, telethons and specials to help bring the nation back to the new normal."" David Bushman, a curator with The Paley Center for Media in New York City, said the amount of programming is to be expected, given the magnitude of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. ""It's such a major event and story in our history that it's very hard to ignore it and seem relevant,"" he said. ""And yet there are lots of things that are difficult about it. One of the things, as crass as it sounds, is how do you do something that is distinctive from everyone else."" In the week leading up to the anniversary, CNN will feature four hourlong documentaries: ""Footnotes of 9/11,"" in which investigative correspondent Drew Griffin chronicles eight people mentioned in ""The 9/11 Commission Report""; ""Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: Terror in the Dust,"" which will examine the health effects of the attacks on responders; the Soledad O'Brien-helmed ""Beyond Bravery: The Women of 9/11""; and a special CNN/Time/HBO presentation: ""Beyond 9/11: Portraits of Resilience."" At NBC, ""Today"" will have coverage in the days leading up to September 11, and the network will air a ""Children of 9/11"" special on September 5 and ""America Remembers"" on the anniversary. MSNBC will offer ""Days of Destruction -- Decade of War,"" about how the country has changed, and Fox will have a two-hour special on the rebuilding of ground zero titled ""Fox News Reporting: Freedom Rising with Shepard Smith."" The Discovery Channel will feature the Steven Spielberg-produced documentary ""Rising: Rebuilding Ground Zero,"" and the Spanish network Telemundo will broadcast a five-hour show from that location. Even children's network Nickelodeon will feature ""Nick News with Linda Ellerbee: What Happened? The Story of September 11, 2001"" to explain the events to its viewers, some of whom weren't even born when the tragedy occurred. The National Geographic Channel will feature a week of programming starting August 28, including an exclusive sit-down with former President George W. Bush, who was in office on 9/11. Michael Cascio, senior vice president of production for the channel, said the abundance of programming just makes sense. ""Seems to me you probably could do more than a week and still not get at all of the issues and angles we need to get at,"" he said. ""We're actually concerned about making sure the viewer has enough information and a depth of it."" Robert J. Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, said such coverage is easily planned, as the anniversary is expected. ""You can't predict a tsunami, but anniversaries are kind of like royal weddings in that you know when they are going to happen and you can put them together,"" he said. ""And let's face it, this programming is for the most part relatively inexpensive to do. It's playing clips and putting stuff together and all the rest of it."" Anniversaries have always been important culturally, he said, and he points to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, which famously celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World. Coverage of anniversaries has exploded, in part because of cable television, Thompson said. ""There are so many hours of cable television to fit this stuff into,"" he said. ""Where it used to be you might recognize a special, but when there were only three networks, there weren't that many hours to fit it in."" Blogger Kelly West wonders how much coverage viewers can take. She wrote an article, ""September 11th Tenth Anniversary TV Specials Scheduled: How Much Will You Watch?"" for the site Cinema Blend, and said she hopes networks respect the commemoration. ""How much coverage we expose ourselves to and how we want to acknowledge the anniversary is our choice,"" West said in an e-mail to CNN. ""The advertisements for these programs could present an issue, however."" ""With so many 9/11 programs scheduled to air, I would hope that the networks take a tactful, respectful approach to letting people know what they have available,"" she added. ""9/11 isn't 'Shark Week' or some event that needs to be hyped up and sold to people in the days leading up to the anniversary."" At least one television drama will offer its interpretation of the painful look back. On September 7, The FX series ""Rescue Me"" will end its run after seven seasons. The show was inspired by the events of 9/11 and followed the lives of New York City firefighters. The series star and co-creator, Denis Leary, told Canada's Postmedia News that the timing fit. ""There's a natural summing up, of having the guys stop and think about where they are,"" Leary said. ""There are going to be memorials. We have to deal with 9/11 again. So it was only natural to end it this way.""","Television will mark the anniversary of September 11 with more than 40 programs .

"(CNN) -- After spending 125 days traveling over 8,000 nautical miles, the Plastiki is preparing to reach Sydney, its final destination, on Sunday. The Plastiki's arrival in Sydney will not, however, be the 60-foot catamaran's first time to reach Australian soil. Winter storms producing near-hurricane strength winds forced the vessel and its crew to take refuge in Mooloolaba, Queensland on Monday. Originally, the crew had hoped to land in Coffs Harbour, south from Mooloolaba, before heading to Sydney. After waiting out the bad weather, the Plastiki took off from its unexpected first port-of-call in Australia early Friday morning with hopes to reach Sydney in the next two days. Brutal winter storms in the Tasman Sea made the leg from New Caledonia the most challenging. One night winds gusting over 60-knots surprised the crew, leaving them battling to prevent the mast buckling and losing the sail for eight hours. ""I've always been apprehensive of the Tasman Sea and this was my own worst nightmare come to fruition,"" said Plastiki's expedition leader, David de Rothschild. Co-skipper of the boat, Dave Thomson called the waves some of ""the biggest you're likely to see."" Once in Sydney, the Plastiki will be harbored at the Australian National Maritime Museum. It will remain on display for a month as crew members hold special events aimed at raising awareness of plastic waste in the ocean. The general public will also have the opportunity to visit the vessel during an open day. Made of approximately 12,500 reclaimed plastic bottles and engineered using the most sustainable methods possible, the Plastiki is meant to be used as a platform upon which solutions to the myriad of environmental problems can be found. Particularly, the Plastiki is hoping to raise awareness about single-use consumer products that are filling landfills and the sea. The Plastiki has faced several challenges since departing from San Francisco in March. Engineering problems unique to a craft made of plastic water bottles forced the catamaran to make unscheduled stops, as has unpredictable weather.","Plastiki boat made from recycled plastic bottles reaches Australia .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- He once walked through fire; now, he's using fire to forge a September 11 memorial. Artist, sculptor and former Marine firefighter Curtis James Miller will unveil his memorial Sunday, the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, in an Atlanta suburb. He recently spoke to CNN about his work; here's an edited transcript of that interview: . CNN: Tell me a little about how this project started. Curtis James Miller: Doug Harms, who works with (the) DeKalb (County) Fire (Department), approached me about doing this memorial. I guess he saw my work online. So, he contacted me and told me about his idea to do a memorial outside the fire station using a piece of Trade Center steel. From the time we spoke, I kind of had one idea stuck in my head: the phoenix wing, rising out of the ashes. CNN: Where were you on September 11? Miller: I was somewhere in the middle-end of my firefighter training in the Marine Corps. So that day really put a picture of reality on the job I was doing both as a firefighter and as a Marine. CNN: How long were you a Marine? Miller: I joined the Marines around '99 and I had my last tour, my second tour of Iraq, back in 2008. So, I think around 10 years. CNN: How did you decide to make the jump to art after your service? Miller: I've always done art. I did it before I went into the military, and now I'm continuing with it. I went to (the Savannah College of Art and Design) when I transitioned back. I've graduated since then, and now I'm sort of a vagabond in life right now. It really gives me a great opportunity to do what I want to do. And this project is part of it. CNN: You've said you enjoy doing memorials. Why is that? Miller: I see myself, the artist side of me, as a storyteller. And I don't really see art as all that important. It's something I do, it's something I've done, it's always a part of me, and I enjoy it. But I'm not building bridges; I'm not saving people's lives; I'm painting pretty pictures. So the importance to me of art that I can do is to memorialize people who deserve it. So this is really a chance for me to say these people are important. With this memorial specifically, it kind of dawned on me the other day: It's not just about 9/11. It's not just about that day. It's about the people that lost their lives and that were affected and lost family, friends, but it continues, especially doing this 10 years later, it's about the people that continue to serve. Before 9/11, after 9/11, they're still important. And this memorial sort of brings that to light. And to me, that's important. To keep people's minds open. And that's kind of what art can do. CNN: What materials are you working with for this piece? Miller: It's steel. And it's handmade. It's been myself and my team working at all hours of the night. In all temperatures of the (summer) heat. And adding to that temperature, the forges and the heat and the welding and the leather protective gear we're wearing. CNN: Is there any significance with the number of feathers on your sculpture? Miller: My uncle called me in the beginning of the build and said 343. And I said, yeah. That's the number of firefighters that died in 9/11. He said 343 feathers. I kind of looked at my drawings and design. I said maybe I could maybe make it happen. But the feathers are too big, and there wasn't enough room to make it happen. But wings in general mean a lot. And everybody has their own connection to them. CNN: What will it look like when it's all finished? Miller: It will be set on a solid piece of granite that's in the shape of a pentagon. Not just to symbolize that building alone but the military and country. And having that ... phoenix wing coming out of the ashes with that piece of the trade tower there, that wing can incorporate some of the emotion of the planes that were hijacked. And then we'll have flight markers made out of granite. Four, one for each flight, with a timeline of all of the events for each flight on each marker. So the whole site is in a 52-foot circle in front of DeKalb County police and fire headquarters. To learn more about the memorial, visit the DeKalb 9/11 Memorial Project website.","Artist, sculptor and former Marine forging 9/11 memorial for Atlanta suburb .

"(CNN) -- The streak of light that blazed across southwestern U.S. skies and stoked burning curiosity across the social media landscape was probably a tiny and bright meteor known as a fireball, a NASA spokeswoman said Thursday. Veronica McGregor, spokeswoman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, called it a rarely seen and exciting treat for the legions of people who glanced to the heavens on Wednesday night. Law enforcement and media in Phoenix, Los Angeles and Las Vegas were fielding calls of the reported sighting. It quickly became a hot topic on a number of social media websites with most asking, ""Did you see it? What was that?"" ""For all the millions of people that called, they can scratch that off their bucket list. They are very lucky to see a fireball,"" McGregor said. McGregor told CNN the object eyeballed in the sky on Wednesday night was probably the size of a baseball or a basketball, based on descriptions reported to police and across the internet. The fireball was a tiny chunk of an asteroid that became a meteor when it hit the atmosphere, McGregor said. While it probably incinerated before it reached ground, it's not impossible that a pebble-sized meteorite survived the trip. McGregor said such small objects pose no danger but noted that scientists are regularly keeping their eyes on asteroids that could cause issues. ""Fireballs are actually extremely common,"" she said. ""They happen every day somewhere over our globe."" Many officials initially theorized the object was a meteor. Lt. Justin Griffin of the Maricopa Sheriff Department in Arizona was trying to guess what the strange light was and said he believes ""it was a meteorite travelling from north to south across Maricopa County. He said the 911 call center received a flood of calls, but there were no reports of impact or damage. ""People are, indeed, reporting they saw a light head from west to east across the sky. We got reports from CHP and the FAA about callers seeing the light. It is reasonable to say that it may be a meteor,"" Curt Kaplan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told CNN affiliate KCAL. There were no reports of aircraft incidents across Southern California, Ian Gregor, a Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman said. NASA officials have announced the now-defunct Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite is expected to fall back to Earth in the coming weeks, but that is expected to happen in a week to 10 days, NASA spokesman Steve Cole said. Fireballs generally go unnoticed because they whiz over oceans and uninhabited regions, according to the American Meteor Society. Also, the society said, ""those that occur at night also stand little chance of being detected due to the relatively low numbers of persons out to notice them."" But they can grab attention when they streak during the evening hours above a highly populated area. The society says ""the brighter the fireball, the more rare is the event."" McGregor said, ""We think everybody should have the opportunity to see a fireball."" CNN's Rosalina Nieves and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","The object was probably the size of a basketball or baseball .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A former engineer for Rockwell International and Boeing was convicted Thursday of economic espionage and acting as an agent of China, authorities said. A Delta IV rocket launches on March 10, 2003 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Dongfan ""Greg"" Chung, 73, was accused of stealing restricted technology and Boeing trade secrets, including information related to the space shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket. U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney convicted him on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage; six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country; one count of acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China; and one count of making false statements to the FBI, according to a statement from federal prosecutors. Carney presided over Chung's three-week bench trial last month. In a bench trial, there is no jury and the judge decides whether to convict a defendant after hearing testimony. Chung was free on bond after his arrest by FBI agents and NASA investigators in February 2008. He was taken into custody after Carney's ruling was read. Chung, a native of China who is a naturalized United States citizen, was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until Boeing acquired its defense and space unit in 1996, and by Boeing thereafter. He retired from Boeing in 2002, but returned as a contractor, a position he held until September 2006, prosecutors said. Chung held a ""secret"" security clearance, authorities said. ""For years, Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing relating to the space shuttle and the Delta IV rocket -- all for the benefit of the government of China,"" said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security, in the prosecutors' statement. ""Today's verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America's economic and national security to assist foreign governments."" The case against Chung resulted from an investigation into another engineer who obtained information for China. That engineer, Chi Mak, and several of his relatives were convicted of providing defense articles to the PRC, authorities said. Mak was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison last year. According to evidence presented at trial, individuals in the Chinese aviation industry began sending tasks to Chung via letter as early as 1979, federal prosecutors said. Over the years, the letters directed Chung to collect data related to the space shuttle and various military and civilian aircraft. In his letters back to China, Chung referenced materials he had already sent, including 24 manuals relating to the B-1 bomber, which Rockwell had forbidden for distribution outside the company and federal agencies. In addition, between 1985 and 2003, Chung traveled to China several times and met with government officials. His contacts in China discussed these trips in letters and recommended methods of passing information, authorities said. In a 2006 search of Chung's home, FBI and NASA agents found more than 250,000 pages of documents from Boeing, Rockwell and other defense contractors in the house and in its crawl space, prosecutors said. They included ""scores of binders containing decades' worth of stress analysis reports, test results and design information for the space shuttle."" Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, authorities said. The charge of acting as an agent for a foreign government carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage and making false statements to federal investigators each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Chung is set for sentencing November 9.","Dongfan Chung, 73, convicted of economic espionage; acting as agent of china .

"New York (CNN) -- A heavy security presence permeated lower Manhattan on Sunday, the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, as authorities continued their search for possible plotters of another terrorist strike. Information considered credible but unconfirmed indicated up to three attackers could be trying to use an explosives-laden vehicle for an attack in New York or Washington, according to various sources. Authorities stressed that while they were taking information of a possible attack plot seriously, there was no evidence so far that an actual terrorist operation was underway. ""We're looking into a number of leads,"" said John Brennan, the assistant to the U.S. president for homeland security and counterterrorism, on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""Again, it's not confirmed yet, but we're not relaxing at all."" Brennan said a security meeting took place Sunday morning at the White House to go over all the intelligence. A White House spokesman told reporters that no new information came out of the Sunday meeting. With President Barack Obama, former President George W. Bush and other dignitaries attending a ceremony at the former World Trade Center site, heavily armed police officers and federal security agents -- some wearing body armor -- deployed in the area. Roads were blocked and police checkpoints for both vehicles and pedestrians surrounded the memorial, with backpacks checked by bomb-sniffing dogs and put through x-ray machines. At the ceremony, Obama and the first lady stood behind bulletproof protection. Two of the three individuals believed to be involved in the potential plot on the 9/11 anniversary are Americans of Arab descent who traveled to the United States last week, according to a U.S. government official who spoke on condition of not being identified by name. Authorities have been piecing together clues gleaned from flight logs and manifests, among other sources, to try to trace the whereabouts of the two, said the U.S. government official. A third person is believed to have been traveling through Europe, though it is not clear whether that person has arrived in the United States, the government official said. However, another law enforcement official said there is no evidence so far that any of the three individuals came to the United States or are here now. It is still not apparent whether a plot is under way, officials say, maintaining the same stance they have taken since news of the possible plans for an attack first became public on Thursday. ""It's still ongoing,"" New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Saturday. ""Nothing significant has changed. The threat has been identified as being credible and specific and uncorroborated."" American spy networks had intercepted communications of a potential attack from an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan, derived from a source who has provided accurate information in the past, officials say. No other corroborating evidence of an attack has been uncovered, but it has prompted intelligence officials to sift through communications from other al Qaeda cells. U.S. officials rarely speak on the record about intelligence intercepts. In the days following the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, officials indicated al Qaeda had gone to great lengths to avoid having its communications intercepted by the United States. Authorities also say they have picked up ""chatter,"" or widely divergent communications, from extremists that suggest the newly tapped al Qaeda head, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is in some way involved in the current plot. Three stolen trucks were added to a New York Police Department database because of the threat, said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne. The database is connected to the NYPD's digital license plate readers. ""We're adding them in the interest of being prudent,"" Browne told CNN, emphasizing there is no known link to the terror threat. Two of the trucks were owned by a construction company that operates at the World Trade Center site. They were reported stolen over a week ago and had about $70,000 worth of tools on them, Kelly noted. Both vehicles were subsequently recovered, the NYPD said Sunday. One was discovered empty, unoccupied and unlocked in a residential area Saturday night by uniformed police on routine patrol. Police said they believe there is no connection between the stolen vehicle and any possible terror plot. The second vehicle, a van, was found in Queens, said NYPD Lt. John Grimple. It was unoccupied, he said. A Budget rental van also was stolen in a separate incident from a Jersey City, New Jersey, storage facility earlier this week, Kelly told CNN. He said none of the thefts had been tied to any terrorism plot at this point but were being investigated out of an abundance of caution. Browne said that whoever took the trucks ""went to great lengths to cover their tracks -- they cut lines to phones and surveillance cameras."" Browne also said the city has experienced ""a three-fold increase in suspicious package calls,"" while suspicious vehicle calls have doubled. New York law enforcement officers, meanwhile, have been put on 12-hour shifts. In Washington, Police Chief Cathy Lanier reported that ""suspicious activity and suspicious vehicle reporting skyrocketed"" over the weekend. ""I can tell people in this community (are) really on it,"" said Lanier, adding that her force had beefed up staffing. In neighboring Prince George's County, Maryland, officials located one of two missing U-Haul vans, though a police spokesman said authorities ""are not viewing this as terrorism-related."" Cpl. Evan Baxter said the vans were reported stolen Saturday. The security posture was evident elsewhere, too. A suspicious bag caused the shutdown of a security checkpoint Sunday morning at Kansas City International Airport. Four hours later, some gates on Terminal B remained closed but flights were operating from other gates, according to airport information officer Joe McBride. He said the incident began when a security guard at a checkpoint grew concerned about something in a man's carry-on bag. The guard asked the man to allow him to search his bag, at which point the man became uncooperative and was detained, McBride said. Because the man had already checked bags, Terminal B was evacuated and closed. A bomb squad and other officials located the man's bags, all of which were opened and inspected. No explosives were found, according to Bridget Patton with the FBI in Kansas City. She declined to provide any details on the man, who is being questioned. A Transportation Security Administration statement said the security steps were taken ""out of an abundance of caution."" On Saturday, Obama met for a second straight day with his senior national security team, according to a White House statement. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that information gleaned in part from the May raid against Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, helped reveal the possible new plot. It is not clear how the bin Laden raid helped authorities connect the dots to the prospect of an anniversary attack, but Biden downplayed the threat of a widely sophisticated plot involving multiple conspirators. He told NBC's ""Today"" show that the administration's main concern is a plot from a ""lone actor, not some extremely complicated plan like it took to take down the World Trade (Center) towers or the plane in Shanksville (Pennsylvania) or the Pentagon."" In New York City, police officers stopped and searched box trucks, as they approached the George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey with New York as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, connecting the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn. Police also were sweeping parking garages for explosives and using digital license plate readers to check for stolen vehicles, officials said. Authorities say they are questioning individuals who have previously raised security concerns. ""We already had a great security plan in place, and in an abundance of caution, we're deploying more resources,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters. ""We shouldn't allow this threat to diminish the importance of the 9/11 anniversary, because that would be doing just what the terrorists want us to do."" In Washington, local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since September 1. Federal officials said they are taking the threat seriously, while trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace in connection with key dates. ""The FBI has been in a planning mode for months with the local and state police officers, as well as the other intelligence agencies, to prepare for this weekend,"" said James McJunkin, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office. ""What we have here is a little bit more of a public display than we normally have."" U.S. officials believe that the plot could involve operatives who came out of the tribal Pakistan-Afghanistan border region -- a volatile semi-lawless area that is home to extremist groups -- and that they are part of al Qaeda ""central."" One official also noted a possibility that Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan could be involved. Al Qaeda ""likely maintained an interest since at least February 2010 in conducting large attacks in the homeland timed to coincide with symbolic dates, to include the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks,"" according to an intelligence bulletin issued Thursday. Bin Laden's death and the ""removal"" of senior al Qaeda figures since then could add to the organization's desire to stage an attack on a symbolic date such as September 11, the bulletin said.

"(CNN) -- Far too many leaders do too much. Does this include you? If you can't take a two-week vacation without your cell phone, your laptop and your tablet, it probably does. Don't get me wrong -- this is not unusual. Instead, it's natural: our ancestors -- the ones who survived and gave us the chance to be here -- were probably more active than their sometimes less fortunate colleagues were. Their activity was essential in the prehistoric era because it helped them overcome their inherent vulnerability and increase their chances at self-preservation. Add to this the fact that people get promoted into leadership positions because they've done good work -- and we all tend to repeat any action that gets rewarded -- and it's no wonder that leaders naturally do too much. See also: Switching off from the 24-7 work ethic . Unfortunately, this creates a serious problem: active leaders who are constantly involved in every aspect of their work come across as micro-managers. They don't think of themselves this way. (Ask yourself how many leaders willingly acknowledge that they are micro-managers!) But leaders' opinions of themselves as leaders are much less important than their team members' opinions, and proactive leaders inevitably step on their team members' toes. How can a leader get around these natural tendencies? Do Nothing! Or, at a minimum, do less: this will let your team members do more. As an experienced teacher at Kellogg, I have the opportunity to meet thousands of leaders every year in my executive courses. When I ask them whether they have gotten to the point of doing nothing, only about 1% raise their hands, with a big smile on their faces. See also: Focus on your results, not your hours . At the same time, everyone else in the class looks at them with envy. When I ask them how they have achieved this wonderful ideal, they always say the same thing: ""I have a great team."" This begs an important question: Did they have a great team first, which allowed them to do nothing, or did they do nothing first and a great team emerged? We don't have enough hard data to answer this question, but isn't it intriguing to think that the latter, rather than the former, might be true? Here are a couple more rhetorical questions: Don't we know that a leader's most important role is to lead and that team members should contribute? And that it's a leader's competitive advantage to facilitate and orchestrate rather than doing anything substantive themselves? See also: Why we pick bad leaders . Although the answers to these questions seem obvious, too many leaders have a hard time taking the steps to implement them. Here are a couple ways that you can move toward doing nothing and, in the process, be more effective: . First, identify the breadth and range of your team members' skills so that you can let them do what they do well. Second, do what you can to facilitate their performance. Think of it this way: what would your life be like if all of your team members lived up to their maximum potential? If you now have a very rosy image in mind, why not define your job as facilitating their performance? They will do better and your life will improve! Third, trust your people more. If there are good people on your team, i.e., trustworthy people who have skills, why not trust them to do what they can do well? People thrive on trust. As every professional I've ever asked has said, when a leader trusts them more than they expected, they step up to show the leader that they were worthy of her trust. Thus, if you work with professional people, i.e., individuals who want to do a good job, trust them more -- odds are extremely good that they will step up and exert even more effort than they have before. Fourth, think of yourself as a mini-CEO. You are the leader of your team; you are probably their most important contact in the firm. When you think of yourself as a mini-CEO, you should follow the first rule for a CEO: Walk the floor. Translated, this means being in touch with your team members and asking them how they are doing and how you can help make their jobs easier. They won't ask for a multi-million dollar piece of equipment and they'll appreciate the personal attention. Not only that, if you provide them with resources that they can use to do their jobs better, they will be motivated to do even more -- and an appreciative light will shine on you. See also: Want be a leader? Act like one . The moral of this story is simple: People love to be trusted; they dislike micro managers; leaders are naturally programmed to be pro-active, and this can get in the way of effective performance. The conclusion: give yourself a break; trust your team members more; and realize that you can actually achieve more by doing less yourself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of J. Keith Murnighan.","Murnighan: Leaders involved in every aspect of their work come across as micro managers .
He says it's a leader's competitive advantage to ""facilitate and orchestrate""

"(CNN) -- What do you get when you cross thousands of plastic water bottles with an adventure-loving entrepreneur? A boat, of course, designed to carry a team of scientists, adventurers and artists halfway around the world. Sounds like an interesting proposition? It clearly did to David de Rothschild, one of the youngest members of the famous banking dynasty, who has taken it upon himself to show the world how pervasive the global plastic waste problem has become. De Rothschild wants the public to start viewing waste as a resource, particularly plastic. To underscore his message, he and collaborators designed a boat made almost entirely of plastic bottles and recycled plastic. Later this month de Rothschild and the crew will begin a planned 11,000-mile (17,700-kilometer) voyage from the U.S. city of San Francisco to Sydney, Australia. The crew hopes to accomplish the voyage in 100 days. Almost four years in the making, the result of de Rothschild's environmental vision is a 60-foot catamaran-style boat named The Plastiki. Builders of the boat say it weighs in at 12 tons, with only 10 percent of the vessel made from new materials. Constructed mainly from 12,500 reclaimed plastic water bottles designed to keep Plastiki afloat, the main frame is made from self-reinforcing polyethylene terephthalate (srPET), a recyclable plastic material, and the sail has been hand-made using recycled PET cloth. Explore the technology of the Plastiki . Leaders of the voyage say the boat will be powered by renewable energy such as solar panels, wind turbines and bicycle generators. And crew members even plan to grow their own food aboard the boat with the help of a vertical garden attached to the mast. Put all this together, de Rothschild told CNN, and you get a boat which, its builders claim, is ""infinitely recyclable."" ""The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere or into our oceans for that matter, so everything on the boat will be composted. Everything will be recycled. Even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish,"" de Rothschild told CNN in a recent interview. The Plastiki's name is wordplay off the ""Kon-Tiki,"" a balsa raft made famous by Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl, who in 1947 sailed the vessel from Peru to the Polynesian islands. Learn more about the Kon-Tiki's historic voyage . Two of Heyerdahl's grandchildren, Olav Heyerdahl and Josian Heyerdahl, will be aboard during various legs of the Plastiki voyage. The former is familiar with some of the terrain, having previously replicated his grandfather's expedition using the original log books and diary used by Heyerdahl, and taking the opportunity to track changes in the Pacific's environmental conditions. Meet the Plastiki crew . The Plastiki's journey will spotlight current environmental issues. En route to Australia, Plastiki will sail through the infamous North Pacific Gyre, now home to ""The Great Garbage Patch,"" named due to the high levels of waste that have been drawn there by ocean currents. Estimated to be around the size of Texas, this contaminated area of ocean has by some estimates more plastic than food for marine life. ""I was astounded to hear that that there are places in our oceans where the ratio between plastic and plankton is 6-to-1,"" de Rothschild told CNN, referring to the area. Opinion: The reason for the Plastiki voyage . Expedition organizers say the boat will sail past the Midway Atoll en route to Australia. Its scheduled stops -- in places such as the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Kiribati -- will be symbolic too, allowing the team to raise awareness of places that are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, such as rising sea levels. The journey is expected to take the crew through the ""Doldrums"" -- equatorial regions in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans known for unpredictable weather patterns that include listless winds that can trap sailing vessels. Other questions remain. The New York Times recently pointed out that if the vessel breaks apart in the ocean it could send thousands of plastic bottles into the ocean. But Plastiki's skipper, British sailor Jo Royle says she is confident the team will be able to navigate their way to their final destination. ""We cannot look at other boats for reference, but we wouldn't leave unless we're completely confident we'll make it,"" she told CNN. Whether the boat completes its journey remains to be seen, but de Rothschild is resolved about the importance of his mission, regardless of the outcome. ""Even if Plastiki gets damaged or does not make it, the message will still be there,"" de Rothschild told CNN. ""The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere, or into our oceans."" CNN.com will be keeping close track of the entire voyage, offering insights each week on the Plastiki's progress. Don't forget to check back each week to see how Plastiki is progressing.","Boat made primarily from recycled plastic bottles set to sail Pacific Ocean .

"(CNN) -- Are one of sport's most high-profile power couples back together? Or did they never part? The sight of golf's two-time major winner Rory McIlroy and former World No. 1 tennis player Caroline Wozniacki striding down the fairways in Dubai certainly set a few tongues wagging. A mass of media reports had claimed the duo were no longer an item, both parties remaining tight lipped whenever they were quizzed about their relationship in recent weeks and months. But Wozniacki followed the Northern Irishman for all 18 holes of his opening round at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai -- the climax of the European Tour season. The Dane had tweeted a picture of McIlroy playing tennis the previous day as she begins her preparations for the new tennis season. Despite her support McIlroy occasionally cut a frustrated figure out on the Jumeirah course, carding an opening round of one-under-par, having been three under for his first four holes. McIlroy is five shots off the lead, held by Spain's Alejandro Cañizares, with Henrik Stenson -- who is aiming to be the first golfer to win the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup series as well as the Race to Dubai -- on four-under. ""It's much better than it has been the last few months and I am playing better, which is important,"" McIlroy told the official European Tour website. ""It's good that the game is back on track. I have this event and two more so it would be great to get a win before the end of the season."" Sweden's Stenson carded a round of 68 -- his only bogey of the day coming after he missed a short putt on the final hole. If making history wasn't enough motivation for Stenson perhaps his bet with another potential winner -- England's Ian Poulter -- might be. Some months ago Stenson agreed to act as drinks waiter for the pair on a night out should Poulter overhaul him and get the 345,000 points he needs to win the Race to Dubai title. At his pre-tournament press conference Stenson told reporters: ""That's probably my biggest motivation, not to become his servant for a day. He is certainly not going off that bet and I know he is up my tail."" But Stenson is well placed to fend off the challenge of Poulter, as well as other potential winners, 2013 U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, who won the U.S. Open in 2010. ""It has been a lot of hard work all season and I just let my focus slip on the last,"" Stenson told the official European Tour website of his solitary bogey. ""That sucks, but I am still in good shape and playing nicely. The guys are running on fumes so everybody is looking forward to getting done. ""You can't win a tournament on Thursday but you can certainly play your way out of it. I would have taken four-under at the start of the day so I just have to let the disappointment of the last slip away."" Poulter is only a shot further back but was frustrated he didn't make more of the opportunities he gave himself. ""I am annoyed,"" Poulter said. ""I made two putts which were outside birdie chances and took a couple more but the rest were missed. I am frustrated but happy to be only three behind. ""I need to continue to be aggressive and see if I can nick it at the end. It's a good mix to be really angry being three under par and still being in there for the next three days.""","Rory McIlroy and Caroline Wozniacki pictured together at Dubai Tour Championship .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court wrestled Wednesday with a familiar, if elusive, foe -- legislative intent -- when considering whether a California man should be compensated after the government violated his privacy by disclosing his personal medical history. The justices appeared torn over the meaning of two fuzzy words in federal law -- ""actual damages"" -- and whether Stanmore Cooper's claims of mental and emotional distress are covered under the Privacy Act. ""The argument you have made -- and I certainly understand it, that this is the Privacy Act and so it's precisely these types of damages that you would be concerned about -- really cuts both ways,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts to Cooper's lawyer. ""What you are saying is this (law) covers a really big chunk of damages, because this is what the whole act was about,"" Roberts said. ""And it seems to me that argument suggests that there is some weight to the government's point: that if you are going to get that, you really do need clearer"" language in the law that would immunize the government to some extent, from a flood of hard-to-disprove lawsuits. The ambiguity has divided lower courts for years, and privacy experts say the ease with which the government can collect and share information in the digital age makes the issue of personal privacy liability ripe for review. Cooper, 69, became a licensed recreational pilot in 1964, but two decades later the San Francisco man was diagnosed with the HIV virus. As his condition worsened over time, he let his private pilot's certificate and his airman medical certificate lapse. Cooper in 1996 then applied for long-term disability with the Social Security Administration. ""I was in bad shape, I didn't have long to live,"" he told CNN. But as his health improved, thanks to a cocktail of anti-retroviral therapy, he went back to work and wanted also to fly again. ""I found out they were issuing medicals (exemptions) and I reapplied"" to the Federal Aviation Administration ""without revealing my HIV status,"" he said. ""Big mistake."" He received his new pilot's certificate but, unknown to him, a joint local-federal initiative called Operation Safe Pilot was launched in 2002. Using a spreadsheet, the agencies shared and compared the names and personal data of about 45,000 pilots in Northern California, looking for those potentially medically unfit individuals who were also receiving federal benefits. Cooper was among four dozen or so pilots tagged as a ""person of interest."" When confronted by government agents, he admitted to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false report. He was sentenced to probation and fined, and his pilot's certificate was revoked. The retired business executive's name was listed in a federal press release and later, through his prosecution, Cooper's medical history suddenly was a matter of public record. ""I had been able to control those of whom I shared my information about my HIV status, limited to some co-workers, family, and close friends,"" he said ""And suddenly that was out of my control."" Cooper, who was eventually allowed to fly again, sued. ""I chose not to reveal my HIV infection and that was a very bad thing,"" he said. ""I took responsibility for it and I paid the price. I was punished. And I think now it's the government's turn to own up to breaking the law and take responsibility for what they did."" A federal judge found both the FAA and the Social Security Administration violated the Privacy Act with the information-sharing probe, but said under the law only ""actual damages"" could be collected by plaintiffs seeking redress. Since Cooper made no claims for economic harm, such as lost wages or medical expenses, he was therefore was out of luck. The judge found ""emotional injury"" alone did not qualify and dismissed the lawsuit. But a federal appeals court reversed, ruling for Cooper. The FAA then asked the high court to intervene. During a sedate hour of oral arguments, the justices stayed away from the specific claims of emotional harm made by Cooper, focusing instead on what the law says about qualifying for damages. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg repeatedly hammered away at the government lawyer arguing for the FAA. She said the federal damages provision in question is similar to state tort claims that include both emotional and financial harm. ""The person who is subject to this, to this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have out-of-pocket costs, but is terribly distressed, nervous, anxious, and all the rest,"" she said. ""The act that the Congress is reaching, the impact is of that nature. I mean, pecuniary [monetary] damages ordinarily attend conduct that embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental distress."" Eric Feigin of the Justice Department admitted the Privacy Act's language may be interpreted as allowing damages for such things as ""humiliation, embarrassment and mental anguish,"" but said because the phrase ""actual"" damages remains vague, the government should get the benefit of the doubt, tipping the case in its favor. ""Simply because a plaintiff may have suffered an adverse effect"" from the privacy violation, said Feigin, ""doesn't mean that the plaintiff suffered actual damages."" The bench expressed confusion over which similar but competing terms used in other laws dealing with damages -- ""general,"" as opposed to ""special,"" ""proven"" as opposed to ""presumed"" -- may apply in the Privacy Act's unique use of ""actual damages."" Getting that right in the justices' minds will mean the difference between whether Cooper or the government ultimately prevails. ""It's sort of odd,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, ""for Congress to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined term of art, 'special damages,' and not use it in the Privacy Act if that's what it intended."" She hinted that view would allow Cooper to collect for emotional distress. But Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to support the government, saying various agencies were being burdened with an overly complex and inclusive federal privacy law. He suggested it was not meant to cover the kinds of claims Cooper is seeking. ""All you have to know is that you shouldn't give it (the personal information) to the other agency, because you are not making it public. You are not doing the kind of thing that constitutes an invasion of privacy under state law. You just failed -- intentionally failed -- to follow the very detailed and picky, picky prescriptions contained in the Privacy Act. To say that you get emotional distress for that as opposed to what I would call genuine privacy incursions, which state law covers, is a different question."" Raymond Cardozo, Cooper's lawyer, pointed out his client's information was made public, and his name and HIV status are still posted on a federal government database. He also made a larger argument, that his client's dilemma is one that may affect all Americans. ""Congress passed this act to restore the citizens' faith in their government, and it made a solemn promise to the American citizens that in cases of intentional and willful violation, the United States shall be liable for actual damages,"" he said. ""Today, the government is proposing that ""actual damages"" be read in a way that renders this act virtually irrelevant. That makes a mockery of that solemn promise."" Cooper attended the public session at the court and expressed optimism he would prevail. ""They've betrayed my trust and I can't get that back,"" he said afterward. ""There was nothing to lose here. I had to do it. It was the right thing to do."" The case is Cooper v. FAA (10-1024). A ruling is expected next spring.","The court tries to figure out what Congress intended by the words ""actual damages""
