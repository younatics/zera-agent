"By . Richard Spillett . Former primary school teacher Martyne Airey has been told he could face jail after sniffing pupil's feet for 'sexual gratification' A primary school teacher is facing jail after playing games of 'sniff and tickle' with his pupils' feet. Martyne Airey, 51, told misbehaving children to stay behind after lessons and take off their shoes and socks before sitting them up at a table and smelling their toes or tickling their soles. He was caught after several pupils - all boys - were confronted by other teachers for being late to their classes. They explained that they had been with Airey and said what had happened to them. It emerged in court that Airey would get the pupils to pick a playing card from a deck. Depending on which card was picked he would then sniff or tickle their feet. He was suspended from his position before being charged in April this year. The court heard that the pupils have not reported any trauma from the incidents, but 'just thought he was weird'. Prosecutors said Airey, of Blackburn, Lancashire, carried out the offences for 'sexual gratification'. He pleaded guilty to eight counts of sexual activity with a child under 13 at Preston Crown Court and will be sentenced next month. At an earlier hearing before magistrates, prosecutor Miss Catherine Allan said: 'The defendant was working as a teacher at a school. 'The prosecution case is that he would play a game with children which involved him smelling their feet for sexual gratification. There is abuse of position, of trust, the age of children, numerous children.' At the latest hearing, prosecutor Miss Abigail Hudson said: 'Three of the boys came back from Mr Airey's class and were asked why they were late and, at that point, disclosed the game they had been playing. 'The . parents made this public and other parents asked their children if they . had played this game too. None of the children were particularly . disturbed, they just thought it was weird. The parents were of course . more perturbed.' Airey was caught after pupils told other teachers what he had been doing when he kept them back . After the court hearing, a parent of one of the pupils said: 'It was not normal behaviour. I was really angry and disgusted when it all came out. I'm just glad he has pleaded guilty and the children will not have to be put through another ordeal. 'Lots of us were really concerned over whether he would plead guilty so it is a real relief.' Another said: 'You normally expect your children to be safe with their teacher, but this fellow obviously needs some help. Parents in the playground have talked of nothing else except what he did.' Airey - who was given bail on condition he does not to have any contact with any children under 16 - was told by Judge Simon Newall that a jail sentence could not be ruled out. But, the judge said, his early guilty plea would be taken into account as it had helped to avoid a long trial. A judge at Preston Crown Court (pictured) told Airey he would be given credit for admitting his crimes .","Martyne Airey kept children behind after lessons to hand out punishments .

"By . Richard Spillett . Tyler Hawkins says he was told by his teacher to colour in his trainers black to fit with school uniform policy . A mother has hit out after her son was ordered to colour the white parts of his trainers with a black marker pen to comply with his school's uniform code. Tyler Hawkins, 15, was hauled out of a lesson when a teacher spotted the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes. Tyler says the teacher then handed him a black marker pen and asked him to 'colour in' the black footwear. His mother Gemma, 38, has been left furious by the incident and is considering removing Tyler and his 12-year-old sister from Newquay's Tretherras School and stopping her youngest son from starting there in September. She said: 'What makes me so annoyed is that he's been . wearing these shoes since September and nobody's said anything. 'Uniforms . cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get . any help. 'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and . making him buy an orange pair.' Tyler . was first given an old pair of black . plimsolls to wear despite them being a size too . small. His . mother, of Newquay, Cornwall, sent her lad back the next day in his . original footwear along with a note saying he wouldn't be changing them. But . staff at the school came up with an even more drastic solution - and . gave him the pen. The uniform policy at the 1,620-pupil secondary school . states that children must wear 'plain black shoes'. Tyler's mother insists her children are always neat and tidy and says the school's uniform policy is petty and 'over-the-top'. She . says her children have previously complained about being made to wear . jumpers and blazers during one of the hottest . springs on record. She added: 'These are petty little things that don't make any difference or get in the way of children's learning. 'What the school's doing is encouraging bullying by pointing out all the poor kids who can't afford to buy new uniforms.' Tyler's mother, Gemma, says the rules are 'petty and over-the-top' and could even encourage bullying . Headteacher Sarah Goswell said she was unable to comment directly on the complaint without speaking to the child and parent involved. But she said she was not aware of any teacher asking children to colour in items of clothing to meet uniform regulations. Ms Goswell said: 'It's not standard practice, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't happen because I don't know. 'It's very rare for us to be pulling students out of lessons. We've pulled students out of form time between 8:40am and 9am but it would be very unusual for us to do that. 'Details of the uniform are on our website, and in student planners, and we send out letters to parents on a regular basis. We're not petty about it, but we want our kids looking smart. 'We're very keen to keep up the standards of the uniform but we're very tolerant with it coming up to the end of term. There has to be a bit of give and take and we realise that.' Newquay's Tretherras school insists it is not being petty and wants to encourage students to dress smartly .","Schoolboy says he was told to colour the white parts of his trainers black .

"By . Richard Spillett . Care worker June Downer has been jailed for eight months after admitting mistreatment of patients . A former care assistant who systematically abused three vulnerable residents at a nursing home has been jailed for eight months. A court heard June Downer, 61, who was dismissed from her post in February last year, slapped a 65-year-old woman across the face, smacked a 58-year-old resident with learning difficulties and also hit a Down's Syndrome sufferer. Prosecutor Paul Reid told Bradford Crown Court that only four of the 17 residents at the Ashfield House nursing home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, were able to communicate and Downer's behaviour towards in 2012 them caused concern among other staff members. Mr Reid said: 'She would be loud and rough with residents. It is the prosecution's case that she would be violent towards them.' The court heard how the 65-year-old victim, who was unable to communicate, had been on a day trip when one member of staff jokingly described the resident as being a 'terror'. Downer then walked over and slapped the woman hard across the face with her open hand as she sat on the toilet, the court heard. Mr Reid said the woman lost her balance on the toilet and Downer then wagged her finger in her face saying: 'You better behave yourself the next time.' In a later incident involving the same victim, Downer slapped her hard on the thigh even though the woman was asleep in bed having been sick earlier in the day. Downer remarked herself that the slap was 'a bit hard' and the court heard that the slap left a hand-print on the complainant's thigh. On a further occasion, when the same complainant threw herself onto the floor because she did not want to go to day-care, Downer got a wheelchair, grabbed the woman by the back of her trousers and yanked her up before putting her in it. Most of the residents at Ashfield House nursing home in Bradford were unable to communicate . Mr Reid said as the woman tried to kick her shoes off Downer slapped her on the thigh saying 'keep those shoes on'. Downer, 61, of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty last month to three offences of ill-treating residents who lacked mental capacity. A fourth allegation involving another elderly woman was ordered to lie on the file. When Downer was questioned by police about the allegations she denied slapping any residents, but could give no reason why other members of staff would say she had. Her barrister Tony Kelbrick said he could not give any explanation for the offending and Downer herself had no real memory of doing what she had now admitted. Other members of staff at the home raised concerns about Downer after witnessing her violent abuse . He said: 'This is a lady who has been in the care profession for many years and I have calculated nearly 5,000 days employment in that particular field.' The court heard that Downer had no previous convictions but Judge Neil Davey QC said the series of offences represented the systematic abuse of elderly and vulnerable people. He said Downer's actions were a gross breach of the trust placed in her by the victims themselves and their families. 'The facts of these offences themselves are serious enough, but they are made all the more serious by the fact that the people you abused were in your care,' the judge told Downer. He said she had not shown any remorse and had to jail her as the public needed to be reassured that imprisonment awaited those who chose to ill-treat residents in their care.","June Downer slapped and hit disabled residents of a home in Bradford .

"By . Richard Spillett . An amateur football team raised eyebrows when they celebrated winning their local Saturday league by hiring an open-top bus for a 'victory parade'. London Box Sash FC splashed out hundreds of pounds on their big day, enjoying a five-mile bus ride in front of all 30 of their loyal supporters. Loaded up with balloons and specially-made banners, the squad knocked back champagne as their red open-top bus left their local Rose and Crown pub in south-west London on Saturday. The players then completed a circuit of Wimbledon, much to the amusement of the public, most of whom had no idea who the men were.

The men carried on their celebrations at a nearby restaurant where friends and family gathered for the club’s end-of-season awards. Manager and captain Matt Cook, 26, said they had decided to pay for the bus parade 'for a bit of a laugh' - despite only having a handful of fans. He said: 'Like our commitment on the pitch, we thought we would go that extra mile with our jubilation and soak up the fervent atmosphere that encapsulates Wimbledon at this time of year. 'Not only did we have the bus parade, we also held the team’s player of the season awards - it doesn’t get much bigger than that for sporting occasions in Wimbledon. 'We just . did it for a bit of a laugh really, we haven’t even got a big fan base - . just a man and his dog really. But we also raised a bit of money for . charity as well by collecting on the way round.'

"By . Richard Spillett . White Dee announced she is finally off benefits today and admitted the welfare system is far too open to abuse. The Benefits Street star had sparked anger by insisting she still deserves handouts while headlining bar crawls in Magaluf and pocketing fees for TV appearances. After reports that the Department of Work and Pensions was investigating her benefits, she revealed today that she is no longer receiving state support. Scroll down for video . White Dee has revealed she is no longer claiming benefits after raking in money from media appearances . Dee hit out at the welfare system on ITV's This Morning, saying it allowed some people to live 'too comfortably' After four years unemployed, she said too many benefits claimants are milking the system and have no motivation to get a job. She told ITV's This Morning: 'Maybe it shouldn't be made so comfortable for people on benefits. 'There are genuine people on benefits who do really want to find a job but then there's other people who are so comfortable that they are thinking: ""Well why should I find a job, because I'm perfectly happy living how I am?""' Despite presenter Phillip Schofield revealing Dee was getting £500 for the 20-minute appearance on the show, she insisted most the deals her agent got her were 'not that lucrative'. Dee - real name Deidre Kelly - claimed she still suffers from the 'bereavement depression' which has prevented her from getting a job, but hoped her new career as a reality TV star would mean she can now support herself. She said: 'It's something that's happened to me. I've been absolutely catapulted into a completely different world, but if now is a chance to provide a better future for my children then I'm going to do it, but I'll do it legally.' Dee renewed her war of words with Josie Cunningham, who recently appeared naked after demanding a boob job on the NHS. Dee, who Cunningham has attacked online, said Cunningham was openly mocking taxpayers . The mother-of-two also insisted she was only drinking shandy and water during an appearance in Magaluf . She added: 'I didn't go on them [benefits] with the view of staying on them for the rest of my life.' Dee renewed her hostilities with Josie Cunningham, who became famous for insisting she deserved a breast implant operation on the NHS. Showing off her gold-painted nails, Dee, 42, said: 'She's actually just rubbing it in the taxpayers' faces. I mean, fund it yourself, it does really make me angry.' The pair clashed after Cunningham claimed Dee was jealous of her youth. Dee replied: 'I'm perfectly happy with my life, thank you very much.' Dee's lifestyle came in for criticism when she appeared downing drinks and knocking back beers on the stage of a 'Carnage Magaluf' night earlier this year. Today, she claimed she had only been drinking water and shandy but had pulled the stunts as part of her appearance on the bar crawl night.","Benefits Street star has come off state support due to 'work in public eye'

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Vulnerable: Politicians claim Hollande's partner Valerie Trierweiler should not receive taxpayer-funded perks . France's First Lady Valerie Trierweiler was yesterday facing the prospect of becoming the first in history to be kicked out of the Elysee Palace. It follows humiliating revelations that her partner, President Francois Hollande, has ‘fallen in love’ with a woman almost 20 years his junior. Mr Hollande’s relationship with actress Julie Gayet, 41, was exposed by a series of pictures in French Closer magazine which show him travelling to see her on a moped. But beyond a new romance, opponents claim the scandal exposes publicly funded deceit, security lapses, and the huge cost of a first lady who no longer has any legitimacy. Mr Hollande, who turns 60 this year, was poised to make a statement to ‘clarify’ the position of 48-year-old divorcee Miss Trierweiler. She currently has five staff working for her at her office as well as numerous other taxpayer-funded perks, including homes across France, private jets and limousines. As anger at the scandal grew, politicians suggested Miss Trierweiler’s position was already untenable. ‘Is it normal that she stays at the Elysee on taxpayers’ money while the President has other relationships,’ said MP Daniel Fasquelle. He added: ‘So who is France’s first lady now?’ Georges Fenech, of the opposition UMP, even suggested that both Mr Hollande and  Ms Trierweiler should quit  the Elysee. ‘The question of the resignation of Francois Hollande needs to be posed, before the values upon which our nation is based are not completely destroyed,’ he said. ‘How can we not deplore this intolerable attack on the image of France?’ He said it was outrageous Mr Hollande was using ‘bodyguards paid for with public funds’ to attend secret trysts with Miss Gayet, who has two children with her estranged husband, Argentinian film director Santiago Amigorena, 51. Miss Trierweiler has made no official comment, but friends have confirmed that she is ‘incensed and humiliated’. Tryst: The scandal follows images published of actress Julie Gayet (left) and Francois Hollande (right) There were even claims that she and Mr Hollande have been living separate lives for months and that the president is keen to ‘formalise’ his relationship with Miss Gayet. Photographers from French Closer, who watched a Paris flat a few hundred yards from the Elysee for several days, said Mr Hollande regularly met his lover there, wearing a crash helmet when entering and leaving the building in a weak attempt at disguise. Both Mr Hollande and Miss Gayet have pledged to take action over alleged breaches  of privacy following the exposure of their affair, though  neither denies it.","Politicians claim 48-year-old should be stripped of taxpayer-funded perks .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . A dramatic double suicide in one of Paris’s most romantic hotels today led to renewed calls for euthanasia to be legalised in France. Georgette and Bernard Cazes, both 86, checked themselves into the Lutetia last Thursday and ended their days holding hands. The married couple, who had been together for more than 60 years, left a letter to the authorities 'demanding the right to die in a dignified manner'. Tragic: Georgette and Bernard Cazes, 86, were found hand in hand in a double suicide at the romantic Hotel Lutetia in Paris, pictured. They left a letter attacking the authorities for not letting them choose euthanasia . Mr Cazes wrote that 'it was cruel' that society did not allow law-abiding tax payers the 'freedom' to die when they wanted. One of their sons today said they had been 'planning their deaths for years' because they did not want to become a burden on their family, or the state. They also wanted to end their days united in happiness, rather than suffering a painful death alone. The Lutetia, one of the most upmarket hotels on Paris’s hugely romantic Left Bank, was chosen because the couple first stayed there in their youth. When found, the couple's room was perfectly made up, as they had found it when checking in. Illegal: Euthanasia is banned in all forms in France, forcing those who want to die to travel to clinics like Dignitas in Switzerland, pictured. Opinion polls show up to 92 per cent of French people want it legalised . The couple, from the Paris suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux, had asked staff to bring them breakfast in bed, ensuring their bodies would be found quickly. All their affairs were in order, including documents containing their final wishes, although it is not known whether they were suffering from any disease. The Lutetia was a favourite of great artists and writers including Pablo Picasso and James Joyce, who loved its romantic setting and architecture. Mrs Casez first visited the hotel in the 1940s when she met her father there when he was released from a prison camp after the Second World War. Euthanasia is currently illegal in any form in France, although in 2005 France approved a law that allows people to decline extreme medical treatment. Famous: Built in 1910, Hotel Lutetia was the first Art Deco hotel in Paris and is one of the city's most romantic. It was a favourite of early 1900s artists and writers including Pablo Picasso and James Joyce . Recent opinion polls show that between 56 and 92 per cent of French people want assisted suicide made legal for those suffering from an incurable or terminal illness. President Francois Hollande commissioned a six-month study on euthanasia last year, and has recommended that the government acknowledge public opinion on the issue. If attempts are made to introduce it, then the government can expect fierce opposition from conservatives, including the religious groups who protested against France’s same sex marriage bill.

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Three Roma gipsy couples have been arrested in France and accused of exporting a vast network of child thieves to countries including Britain. The centre of their Oliver Twist-style operation was Paris, where girls as young as 12 were taught how to steal, and often attacked if they did not bring in enough cash. They were threatened with beatings, cigarette burns to the face and even rape if they failed to steal at least £250 every day. A young pickpocket is caught by police in Paris earlier this year. Three Roma gipsy couples have been arrested over claims that they exported child thieves to the UK . Paris prosecutors believe that those taken into custody oversaw hundreds of robberies involving juveniles since 2010. All six have been charged with people-trafficking, forcing minors to commit crimes, money laundering and criminal conspiracy. Two of the accused – named only as Stejar B, 43, and Lucica T, 44 – are even said to have exploited their own four children as part of the racket. A young Paris pickpocket watches a lady at ticket machine. Girls as young as 12 were taught how to steal, and often attacked  if they didn't bring in enough cash . All were based in an illegal camp in La Courneuve, in the northern suburbs of Paris, but were in touch with Roma groups throughout Europe. The children were sent to neighbouring countries including Britain. It is not yet clear how many of the child thieves and pick-pockets may have been operating in cities such as London. A police source said: ‘They trained young woman how to go out on to the streets to make money illegally. ‘Scams included pretending to be deaf and dumb and asking for cash, and tricking people at cashpoint machines. Straightforward pick-pocketing was also a key. Two young boys target a man using a cash machine in Paris. Two of the accused are said to have even exploited their own four children in the racket . ‘These tricks could be used in any major cities or towns – hence some of the girls being trafficked abroad.’Such pick-pocketing networks are becoming increasingly common as Roma communities travel across Europe. Children arrested by the police can seldom be prosecuted, and are instead let off with a caution at most, leaving them free to carry on with their crimes. Romanian police officers are working with the French to try to control the growing problem. Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the minister for women’s rights in France, will next month unveil ‘a new plan to combat human trafficking and delinquency’. In September, Manuel Valls, the French Interior Minister, caused controversy by saying that most of the estimated 20,000 Roma in France had no intention of integrating into society and should be deported. The six arrested Roma are expected to face trial in the new year. In May, a Roma ‘Fagin’ called Fehim Hamidovic was sentenced to seven years in prison for controlling a network of up to 500 youngsters – the biggest ever discovered in Europe.","Girls as young as 12 were taught how to steal, and often attacked .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . At least 70 people were arrested at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris during violent protests against Francois Hollande as he commemorated France’s war dead. The disturbing scenes are a massive humiliation to the 59-year-old Socialist president, who is by far the most unpopular head of state in his country’s recent history. Armistice Day is a public holiday in France, and traditionally a time for solemn reflection as the country unites to remember the end of World War I, and those who have died in other conflicts. President Francois Hollande (centre) was booed as he laid a wreath during the Armistice Day ceremony . It was a humiliation for the president, who the most unpopular head of state in France's recent history . Trouble: Demonstrators held signs saying 'Hollande resign', as the president attended an Armistice Day service . But today the centre piece of the commemorations – the head of state laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier – turned into an unruly farce. As millions watched live TV broadcasts, protestors started booing and then shouted ‘Hollande resign!’ There were also chants about Hollande being in charge of a left wing ‘dictatorship’ in which unpopular laws were being passed without consultation with ordinary people. Fighting then broke out on the Champs Elysee as armed police tried to arrest those responsible for the disturbances. It was then that Hollande and his fellow ministers were rushed away in a waiting limousine, accompanied by police sirens and whistles. The protests turned the usually respectful ceremony into a farce. Pictured: Hollande shakes hands with veterans . Hollande (right) and fellow ministers were rushed away in a waiting limousine when fighting broke out at the Champs Elysee . ‘The atmosphere was extremely ugly,’ said one onlooker. ‘There were a lot of people showing a great deal of . disrespect for the president. This is unheard of on Armistice Day.’ Among those protesting were so-called ‘Red Hats’, a group of activists from Brittany who are furious at the number of factories closing down, particularly in the agricultural sector. One onlooker said the scenes of 'disrespect for the president' were 'unheard of on Armistice Day' Unemployment and the cost of living have spiralled since Hollande came to power last year, yet he is still threatening tax rises and other punitive measures. Many French are particularly angry about a proposed ‘eco-tax’, which has been suspended following outbreaks of violence at the end of October. Conservatives from a group angry at the Socialists’ same-sex marriage bill which was enacted this year were also out in force in Paris today. Supporters of the far-right National Front were also demonstrating, along with those who are opposed to their anti-immigration and anti-Europe views. Many blame Hollande’s failing policies for the rise of extremism within France. There were further ugly Armistice Day scenes in the southern town of Chateaurenard, near Avignon, when MP Bernard Reynes, of the an opposition UMP party, was stabbed three times in the back as he took part in commemorations. Two people, including a knifeman, have been arrested. Hollande has further November 11th public duties to attend to today, and security has been stepped up around him.","Francois Hollande booed as he laid wreath at Tomb of the Unknown Soldier .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Masked gunmen today shot a woman dead in an Alpine beauty spot just a few miles from where members of a British-Iraqi family were also gunned down in cold blood. The latest brutal attack took place in the village of Lathuile, a hamlet next to Lake Annecy, in eastern France. Two men wearing cagoules and gloves broke into the home of the owners of a private camping site. The womanm who ran a campsite near Lake Annecy (pictured), was shot by masked gunmen today . The latest murder in the village of Lathuile happened just a few miles from where the British al-Hilli were gunned down while on holiday . They attacked the so far unnamed woman and her husband, who managed the ‘Ideal’ holiday resort, which is used by hundreds of British people during the summer months. The woman was killed by a bullet to the chest at around 2am, while her husband was hit with the butt of the weapon. It was in September 2012 that 50-year-old satellite engineer Saad al-Hilli was mysteriously murdered along with his wife Ikbal, 47, his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist, close to the village of Chevaline, which neighbours Lathuile. The Al-Hillis were also staying at a lakeside camping site, and are believed to have been attacked by at least one man using a pistol after they went on a drive into nearby woods. Engineer Saad al-Hilli was killed along with wife Ikbal and mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf in the French Alps last year . One of their young daughters, seven-year-old Zainab, was left for dead after being pistol whipped, but survived along with her sister Zeena, four, who hid in the family BMW. According to early police reports, the woman killed in today’s attack had been watching television when she heard a noise outside and went to investigate. Her husband followed a few seconds later and found his wife arguing with the men. He was hit around the head with the butt of the weapon, and then a fight broke out before the couple managed to run back into their house. They pulled a door shut behind them as they disappeared underneath the stairs, but there was then a gunshot and the woman was hit in the chest. The husband saw the killers escape in a small car, believed to be a Sedan, before calling the police. His wife was dead before they arrived. The husband was released from hospital today and was said to be in deep shock. Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor who has become the figurehead of the enquiry into last year’s quadruple murder, which took place close to the village of Chevaline, would not rule out a link with today’s horrific killing. ‘All tracks remain open’ said Mr Maillaud, who noted that Chevaline was ‘located a few kilometres from the campsite’. But he said that the weapons were not likely to be the same, and the ‘circumstances of the attacks’ were different. The Annecy prosecutor said he would not rule out a link between today's killing and the al-Hilli shooting . Discussing today crime, he said: ‘One can think of a burglary gone wrong, or a settling of accounts.’ Murders are comparatively rare in the areas favoured by tourists in the French Alps, especially those involving gunmen. Zaid al-Hilli, Saad's 54-year-old brother who lives in Chessington, Surrey, was arrested by British police in June on suspicion of masterminding last year’s killings. He denies all the claims, and has been bailed to return to his local police station in January. French police and their British counterparts are otherwise baffled as to who carried out the attack, and why.","The woman shot in chest in village of Lathuile, near Lake Annecy .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was today cleared of corruption charges which could have seen him jailed for three years. The 58-year-old politician had been accused of accepting brown envelopes stuffed with cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress. But judges investigating the so-called 'Bettencourt Affair' have now formally dropped all charges.Mr Sarkozy still faces a number of other criminal enquiries, however - all of them related to alleged illegal funding. Charges dropped: Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy (left) was cleared of accusations that he accepted brown envelopes stuffed with cash from Liliane Bettencourt (right), the l'Oreal heiress . The Bettencourt case came to a dramatic head in March, when a judge in Bordeaux summoned Mr Sarkozy for a long grilling, after which preliminary charges were filed against him. It was said that he used Mrs Bettencourt's millions to fund his 2007 election campaign - a claim he always denied. Mrs Bettencourt's butler testified that Mr Sarkozy was a regular visitor to her home in the upmarket Paris suburb of Neuilly, where Mr Sarkozy was once mayor and still owns a home. It is alleged that one of Mr Sarkozy's aides made separate visits, picking up more envelopes full of money from the mentally and physically frail multi-millionaire, who is France's richest woman. Denies accusations: Mr Sarkozy (pictured with wife and former model Carla Bruni), who denies any wrong-doing, has also been accused of taking kick backs from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi . But Mr Sarkozy insisted that he only saw Mrs Bettencourt once during 2007, and did not ask her for any money. Investigators suspect that up to £3.5 million worth of Bettencourt's cash ended up with Mr Sarkozy's party, the UMP, and others still face prosecution. Money linked to an arms deal in Pakistan is thought to have funded the election campaign of former French prime minister Édouard Balladur, Sarkozy's employer at the time . Mr Sarkozy being cleared technically opens the way for him to stand again for president in 2017.He . lost his job as head of state to Francois Hollande, the Socialist . candidate, last year but is still popular with right-wing conservatives. However, a number of other enquiries are still active, including one known as the Karachi Affair. It involves a 2002 terrorist bombing in the Pakistani city that killed 11 French engineers - allegedly because kickbacks over submarine sales by France to Pakistan had not been paid. Money linked to the arms deals is said to have helped fund the 1995 presidential election campaign of former French prime minister Édouard Balladur - a campaign for which Mr Sarkozy was spokesman. Mr Sarkozy, who denies any wrong-doing, has also been accused of taking kick backs from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Since losing the presidential election, Mr Sarkozy has been living quietly in Paris with his third wife, the former model Carla Bruni. His mentor Jacques Chirac was found guilty in 2011 - the first modern French president to be convicted in a criminal court. He was found guilty of corruption dating back to his time as Paris mayor, and was given a suspended prison sentence. Mr Sarkozy was facing up to three years in prison, a fine of more than £300,000 and a five-year exclusion from politics if he had been found guilty.","Nicolas Sarkozy, the 58-year-old politician denies any wrong-doing .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Outspoken designer Karl Lagerfeld, pictured, also blamed 'fat people' for France's public health deficit . Outspoken fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld is facing legal action in France after saying ‘nobody wants to see curvy women on the runway’. The 80-year-old German, who is based in Paris, also blamed ‘fat people’ and their associated illnesses for his adopted country’s vast public health deficit. Now a women’s pressure group called ‘Belle, Ronde, Sexy et je m’assume’ (Beautiful, Rounded, Sexy and fine with it) want to see Lagerfeld fined for his views. Spokesman Betty Aubriere said they had filed a defamation complaint, saying Chanel’s creative director had displayed a ‘discriminatory’ attitude towards those with fuller figures. It was during an episode of French talk show ‘Le Grand 8’ (The Big 8) on Channel D8 earlier this month that Lagerfeld accused ‘fat people’ of wasting the country’s tax revenue through their ailments. He said ‘the hole in social security’ was all down to ‘diseases caught by people who are too fat’. Lagerfeld also repeated his long held belief that: ‘Nobody wants to see curvy women on the runway.’ Ms Aubriere told French news agency AFP: ‘These insults by celebrities must stop. We’re sick of it. ‘There are a lot of young girls who don’t feel comfortable in their skin, and for them to hear comments like that is terrible for them.’ Ms Aubriere said it might only be Lagerfeld who ‘finds us offensive today’, but ‘who will be it be tomorrow?’ She said 500 people had signed a petition against Lagerfeld’s views, and many of them were plump young women who felt stigmatised. Ms Aubriere said: ‘We’ve received messages from poorly young girls who are victims of insults at school and sometimes have to leave school. ‘We want to see preventative measures in schools so that people understand that curves are often an illness or are genetic, and are not a symptom of poor diet.’ Last year Lagerfeld caused outrage by attacking the British pop singer Adele, saying: ‘Adele is a little bit too fat, but she has a pretty face and a divine voice.’ The fashion industry is cutthroat over looks, but a Parisien pressure group is fighting back. Spokesman Betty Aubriere said: 'There are a lot of young girls who don't feel comfortable in their skin' (file photo) The fashion designer has also attacked pop singer Adele, pictured after she won an Academy Award for the James Bond theme Skyfall. She replied: 'I represent the majority of women and I'm very proud of that' In turn, Adele said in a magazine interview: ‘I've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines. I represent the majority of women and I'm very proud of that. ‘I'd lose weight if I was an actress and had to play a role where you're supposed to be 40 pounds lighter, but weight has nothing to do with my career.’ The cutthroat world of French fashion is notoriously discriminatory against fuller figured women, with only the very slim usually succeeding on the Paris catwalks. The row today came as Naomi Campbell revealed she had confronted her friend Victoria Beckham about the lack of black models in her shows. The supermodel, who has campaigned to expose discrimination in the fashion industry, wrote to several designers including the former Spice Girl, who included just one non-white model in her 30-strong London Fashion Week show. She told the Mirror: 'I called Victoria and I spoke to her. I don't want to pin-point anyone. It isn't a blame game. Everyone's name was on that letter because they'd done it. 'It could have been completely unintentional. She is one of the designers on there like everyone else.' The outspoken model was one of several who signed an open letter by the anti-racism Diversity Coalition, which also includes David Bowie's model wife Iman. It has been addressed to top figures in the fashion houses of London, Paris and New York to attack the lack of non-white models in New York Fashion Week. It lists 'fashion houses guilty of this racist act' and also includes Calvin Klein, Chanel, Armani, Gucci and Donna Karan.","'Insults' came a year after Paris icon said singer Adele was 'a bit too fat'

French president Francois Hollande has condemned the killing of Ghislaine Dupont, 51, and Claude Verlon, 58, who were covering elections in the volatile African state. Four gunmen struck at 1pm today in the northern town of Kidal, where the pair were seen being beaten before they were driven away in a 4x4 pickup truck. Dead: The bodies of French journalists Ghislaine Dupont, left, and Claude Verlon, right, were found 'riddled with bullets' today eight miles from Kidal, Mali, hours after they were kidnapped by suspected Al-Qaeda gunmen . The pair were beaten outside the home of a separatist leader. Pictured: Soldiers patrolling earlier this year . Both had been interviewing Ambeiry Ag Rhissa, from the Tuareg separatist group MNLA, on behalf of Radio France International (RFI) and were kidnapped outside his house. One source said their bodies were found riddled with bullets eight miles from the town, which was the birthplace of a violent uprising last year. Another source said the pair's throats may have been cut. Mr Rhissa said: . 'When they left, I heard a strange noise outside. I immediately went out . to see and when I opened my door, a turbaned man pointed a gun at me . and told me go back inside. 'I could not see how many men were there.' They had travelled to the town despite being warned not to by the French army, a defence official said.

Verlon was 'used to difficult terrain throughout the world,' it added, and staff members 'are all in shock, profoundly saddened, indignant and angry'. France opened a judicial investigation into the kidnappings and deaths 'linked to a terrorist enterprise,' the prosecutor's office said. The French Foreign Ministry said intelligence services are joining with Malian authorities to shed light on the circumstances of their deaths. ‘The kidnappers were driving a Toyota pick-up,’ said local governor Adama Kamissoko, who added that all were heavily armed.

A statement said: 'The French president expresses his indignation over this heinous act' Last week four Frenchmen held captive by Al Qaeda terrorists for more than three years arrived back in Paris. Pierre Legrand, 28, Thierry Dol, 32, Daniel Larribe, 62, and Marc Feret, 46 were all captured in September 2010 during raids on a uranium mine near Arlit, northern Niger, where they were working for nuclear giant Areva. The Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) group claimed responsibility and there were always fears that the hostages would be killed. There have been claims since then that France paid more than £17m for the hostage release, although Mr Hollande vehemently denied this, insisting that his country does not negotiate with Al-Qaeda. Mr Hollande launched air strikes and sent hundreds of soldiers into Mali in January to drive back Al Qaeda rebels, saying they would use the West African country as a base for attacks on the west. The global intelligence company Stratfor estimates that al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, has carried out at least 18 kidnappings since 2003, raising an estimated $89m in ransom payments.

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Jean-Marc Ayrault has backed plans for a Roma gypsy camp in one of Paris's most exclusive neighbourhoods saying there is no reason it wouldn't work . The prime minister of France has infuriated cabinet colleagues by backing plans to set up a Roma gypsy camp in one of the most affluent districts of Paris. Jean-Marc Ayrault, one of the most traditional Socialists in his government, said he could see no reason why the plan for the 16th arrondissement should not be a success. ‘Why not?’ he said, when told about the project put forward by elected officials from the Leftish Front. It would see thousands of mainly Romanian gypsies setting up their caravans and huts around a chic area renowned for its upmarket shops and restaurants. This is despite efforts by successive French governments to smash the camps to pieces and to deport the gypsies who live in them. Such issues will be of particular interest to Britain, which is preparing to welcome thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants next year when EU labour laws revised. Last month Mr Ayrault’s colleague Manuel Valls, the Interior Minister, said it was ‘an illusion to think that we can solve the Roma problem through integration.’ Mr Valls wants to do everything possible to keep the Roma out of France, as he associates them with crime and public health problems. His views were supported by a BVA poll . which revealed that 77 per cent of French people agreed that Roma were . inherently ‘different’. But . the more liberal Mr Ayrault said the gypsies could be integrated into . French life, adding: ‘Solutions can be found, as long as the people in . question respect the Republic’s laws.’ The Roma have long been victimised across Europe for their associations with poverty and crime . This is  the town of Yambol, a fomer attempt to integrate the Roma in Bulgaria that ended up by being demolished by the gypsies it once sheltered . The 16th arrondissement is the Paris equivalent of Hampstead in London – full of extremely rich residents and expensive properties. Ian Brossat, of the Leftist Front, said: ‘Ten thousand of the seventeen thousand Roma immigrants who live in France live in Paris in conditions of extreme poverty.’ Many are in shanty towns on the edge of the capital, from where they take public transport into the city to beg and steal. The news will alarm some in the UK who fear an influx of the travellers after boarder controls with Romania are relaxed next year . In France the irony has long been acknowledged that wealthy liberals want to integrate foreigners, but not near their own homes . Mr Brossat said putting them in the large, prosperous 16th would make them feel more integrated, especially as there was plenty of space for a new camp. Claude Goasguen, the conservative mayor of the 16th arrondissement, said the proposed plan was an ‘outlandish’ one, and should be opposed at all costs. Many have pointed to the hypocrisy of rich Paris liberals who call for more efforts to be made integrating immigrants, while refusing to have them anywhere near their own homes.","Proposed camp would be in 16th arrondissement .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Public outcry today led to the removal of a Princess Diana film poster placed at the exact spot where she was killed in a car accident. There was widespread fury at the decision to put the advertisement for ‘Diana’, which stars Naomi Watts, in such an insensitive place. But workmen were seen today removing it from above the Pont de l’Alma tunnel, in central Paris, after the movie’s distributor was shamed into action. Fury: A 'Diana' film poster placed where the princess died has been pulled down after a public outcry . A source at Le Pacte told French news agency AFP: ‘We asked for the removal of this poster after controversy in the British media.’ The 6ft x 4ft hoarding was directly above the underpass where a Mercedes Diana was travelling in ploughed into a wall in August 1997. Rosa Monckton, for many years one of Diana’s closest confidantes, was among those who attacked the ‘shameless attempt to publicise a film that should never have been made.’ Diana's friend and confidante Rosa Monckton was . among those who attacked the ‘shameless attempt to publicise a film that . should never have been made’. The lead role is played by Naomi Watts, . right . The film, in which Diana is played by Australian actress Naomi Watts, pictured, has already been panned by critics in the UK and France . She said the placing of the poster above the Alma tunnel was ‘despicable’ and ‘disgusting’. Diana . remains hugely popular in Paris, where she is still referred to as . ‘Lady D.’, but the film about her has already been panned by critics in . France and Britain. Jerome Garcin, of the Nouvel Observateur, said it was impossible to imagine anything ‘more stupid, more ugly’. The poster had been put up at the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel - exactly where she had died . The Princess died when the car she was travelling in crashed into the wall in the tunnel . The film is loosely based on the romance Diana had with Dr Hasnat Khan, which ended in 1997, just before she died alongside another boyfriend, Dodi Al-Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul. Paul was later found to have been drink-driving, and pursuing paparazzi photographers were also partially blamed for the deaths, although conspiracy theories about a murder plot persist to this day. The source at Le Pacte said the Alma poster was one of around 1000 which had been placed around Paris, and the rest would remain in place. The tunnel in Paris has become a place where tributes continue to be left in the princess's memory . Notes of remembrance are written above the Alma Tunnel  to commemorate Lady Diana's death 16 years ago .","There was public outcry in France and UK after insensitive poster went up .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . and Sara Malm . and Wills Robinson . These are the some of the men accused of recruiting children as young as 10 into a 'criminal army' of Roma immigrants. Twenty-seven gypsies squeezed into the dock at a court in Nancy, France, today, accused of hundreds of crimes ranging from people trafficking to robbery. Some of the men are also alleged to have bought 13-year-old girls for up to £170,000 and forced them to be their wives. Shamed: The Roma gypsy gang currently facing trial sit behind glass in a courtroom in Nancy, France . Exploitation: Twenty-seven people have been accused of selling women for stealing skills and using children like conscripts in a criminal army . Cramped: The group, who squeezed into the dock at the court in Nancy, France, have been charged with over 100 robberies in 2011 in France, Belgium and parts of Germany . Each of the group face up to 10 years in prison for their crimes, which included more than 100 robberies committed in various locations across France. The network, which is ran by a 66-year-old woman expected boys and girls to bring in at least £4000 a month through robbing people in the street or in their homes. Male leaders ‘bought young wives’ for the cash equivalent of up to £170,000 each from other families in Croatia, and selected them especially for their stealing skills. The better they were at stealing, the higher the price was,’ said Mr Weintz. ‘Young looking women also commanded higher prices because they had a better chance of passing themselves off as minors. The hearing comes the same day dozens of Roma families take up the . offer by the French government of a free ticket out of the country, while dozens of polices raided gypsy camps around the country and carried out identity checks. Huge numbers of Roma families checked in at an airport in Lille, northern France. The . Roma gypsies voluntary return to their home nation follows . controversial statements by two French ministers regarding the EU’s open . border policies. Last week, Interior minister Manuel Valls said that most Roma in France will never . integrate and should be sent back to their countries of origin. Long way home: Roma gypsy families check in at Lille's airport in Lesquin as they take part in a voluntary return to Romania . Shortly . after Mr Vall's controversial statement, Foreign minister Laurent . Fabius chimed in, saying Romanians and Bulgarians should be prevented . from travelling around Europe freely. Referring . to the Schengen Agreement, which allows people to move across 26 . European countries without passport checks, Mr Fabius said: ‘If there is . not a change in conditions, we won’t be in favour. ‘People coming from outside Europe could enter Romania and Bulgaria and then freely enter the rest of Europe.’ His comments followed the explosive words of Interior minister Mr Valls, calling for Roma gypsies to return to their home countries. In an interview on the France Inter radio station, Mr Valls said: ‘The Roma should return to Romania or Bulgaria.’ Time to go: The families exit follows several anti-Roma statements by senior French ministers . Au revoir: The Roma board the plane amid the controversy triggered by French Interior minister Manuel Valls's claim that most Roma in France will never integrate . Cast out: Manuel Valls has called for Roma to be 'gradually' moved across the border and back to their home countries, in most cases Romania and Bulgaria . The . Socialist Party member added: ‘Yes, we must tell the truth to the . French – these populations have a way of life that is extremely . different to ours, and they are obviously in confrontation with local . populations.’ Illegal Roma camps have sprung up on . the edges of major cities such as Paris and Marseille. All have become . associated with widespread crime and major health hazards. Mr . Valls, who was born in Barcelona, said: ‘It is unrealistic to think we . will solve the problem of Roma populations only through integration.’ [caption . He said there is ‘no alternative but to dismantle these camps and gradually move them across the border’. The European Commission immediately threatened sanctions against France for its policy towards the Roma community. A spokesman insisted everyone from Bulgaria and Rumania was a citizen of the EU and therefore had a right to travel anywhere. Three . years ago the Commission’s vice president, Viviane Reding, sent a . similar threat to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, saying that Roma . expulsions had to stop. Despite the fierce criticism, Mr Valls has remained defiant, insisting: . ‘The majority [of Roma] should be delivered back to the borders. We are . not here to welcome these people. ‘I’d . remind you of [former Socialist premier] Michel Rocard’s statement . “it’s not France’s job to deal with the misery of the whole world”.’ One . of Mr Valls’s own cabinet colleagues, Arnaud Montebourg, hit back, pointing . to the fact the minister’s family were migrants from Spain. Mr . Montebourg said: ‘A theory that such and such a person or such and such . a people will never, ever be able to integrate just doesn’t stand up. ‘Decreeing in advance that it is impossible seems to me excessive and is worthy of being corrected.’ But Mr Valls said: ‘I’ve got nothing to correct. My remarks only shock those who don’t know the subject.’ Raids: A French police officer enters a caravan as French police carry out identity checks at a Roma camp in Roubaix, northern France. Camps: Roma people stand next to police as they carry out checks. Their treatment has sparked controversy across France . Inspection: A Roman woman hands over papers as officers carry out checks on her car . Jean-Francois . Cope, the leader of the opposition UMP party, meanwhile told France . Info radio station that Roma criminals regularly  ‘harassed Parisians’. Referring . to the Schengen agreement which allows people to move across Europe . without passport checks, Mr Cope said both Romania and Bulgaria should . be excluded. ‘We close our . eyes to the French government to what is happening in our country – the . constant violence’, he said. ‘This is extremely serious and…it is out of . the question that Bulgaria and Romania enter the Schengen area until . the problem is resolved at the European level.’ There . are an estimated 15,000 Roma gipsies in France. Two years ago the then . interior minister, Claude Gueant, claimed the vast majority of street . robberies in Paris were carried out by Romanian immigrants. Controversial: France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he will ban those from Romania and Bulgaria, including gypsies, from the EU's passport-free zone .

She is thought to have fallen around 330ft (100m) after losing her footing on a steep path leading up to the Col de Vaurze, at around 2500m. The unnamed 52-year-old was hiking in the French Alps, pictured, when she fell to her death (file picture) It was at around 8am today that the other walkers came across the woman’s body, but there had been no emergency call beforehand. ‘This makes it clear that she was out walking alone,’ said a spokesman for the local mountain police, who said she would be identified when next of kin had been informed. The tragedy comes after four climbers were killed in separate accidents in the Alps yesterday. Two Italian women, aged 37 and 41, were killed by an avalanche as their climbing party tried to reach the top of Mont Blanc du Tacul in the Mont Blanc range early in the morning.

"By . Daniel Bates . George Clooney has persuaded the mayor of the Italian town where he is likely to marry his British fiancée to bring in draconian laws to guarantee his privacy. Anyone caught swimming within 100metres of his mansion on Lake Como will be fined up to £450 by the local authorities. Pedestrians will also be banned from stopping on the road outside the property, which is in the picturesque Lombardy area of Italy. The rules suggest that Clooney, 53, favours the property for his wedding to lawyer Amal Alamuddin, 36, over his villa at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Mr Clooney, 53, pictured with his fiancee Amal Alamuddin, 36, on April 27 in Santa Barbara, has been spotted with her near Lake Como . The laws announced by Laglio Council are in operation 24 hours a day until September 30. Notices have been stuck on lampposts in the area with a warning in red type. Laglio mayor Roberto Pozzi said that in the past there had been ‘unpleasant episodes’ when fans had gone up to Clooney’s windows and yelled out his name. The new rules were designed to stop them doing the same and to prevent paparazzi from getting too close to his home, he said. Lakeside view: George's £25million Italian house, Villa Oleandra, situated on Lake Como's south-western shores . Not welcome: Mayor Roberto Pozzi has banned non-residents to stay near the entrance of Clooney's home . Pozzi said: ‘It is now completely forbidden to stop outside the entrance to Clooney’s villa. It’s a question of traffic and security. It is very dangerous and it’s also an issue of privacy. ‘This type of action is designed to bring about a change in people’s behaviour and create a more peaceful environment.

"By . Daniel Bates . The sailor who had to be rescued by the Navy along with his family during their trip across the Pacific will be grilled by his own mother upon his return, MailOnline can reveal. Eric Kaufman will be questioned by mother Nancy Kopp when he gets back to dry and and she will say to him: ‘Are you done now?’ Nancy said that it might be time for Eric to rethink his adventurous lifestyle given that he has a wife and daughters Lyra, one, and Cora, three, who were on the trip. Scroll Down for Video . Safety: Rescuers plucked Eric and Charlotte Kaufman and their daughters, Cora, 3, and Lyra, 1, from a sailboat in the Pacific Ocean on Sunday and transferred them to a U.S. Navy frigate that will take them back to California, the U.S Coast Guard said . Grilling: Eric faces some tough questions from his mother on his return. She hopes his adventuring days are over. But his wife's sister said she wouldn't be surprised if they took off again . However, the sister of Eric’s wife Charlotte said that she believes they will probably go to sea again despite their disastrous voyage. Sariah Kay English said that she ‘wouldn’t be surprised’ if the family embarked on another odyssey and that they are ‘not embarrassed’ about the rescue. Eric, 35, and Charlotte, 34, were saved 900 miles off the California coast on Thursday when Lyra developed a fever and a rash. Their 36-foot sailboat Rebel Heart also lost steering and communication abilities. The California Air National Guard's 129th Rescue Wing flew a plane out to them and four pararescuers parachuted into the water where they used an inflatable life raft to get to them. The USS Vandegrift was then diverted from routine exercises to pick them up and they are now bound for their home town of San Diego, California later this week. Lyra’s fever is now under control and she is in a stable condition though she will be taken to hospital as a precaution. Nancy said that she was supportive of Eric’s actions and that what happened was a ‘worst case scenario’, though obviously the family are still alive. She accepted that she did not expect Eric to ‘sit on a couch your whole life’ but that ‘as a mother...these are things you worry about’. She said: ‘My first question to Eric will be: ‘Did you have a great adventure?’ My second will be: ‘Are you done now?’ Stranded: The family's boat, Rebel Heart, is photographed by the rescue team who parachuted in on Thursday . Rescue mission: Air National Guardsmen parachuted into the Pacific on Thursday evening to give medical aid to one-year-old Lyra . 'First, we would like to express how grateful we are to the men and women of the Coast Guard, California Air National Guard and Navy who rescued our family, especially the pararescuemen and crew of USS Vandegrift. We are very thankful to be safe and well. We also appreciate all the concern, thoughts and prayers of everyone back home for the health of our daughter Lyra. She is doing well now, and her medical condition continues to improve.'We understand there are those who question our decision to sail with our family, but please know that this is how our family has lived for seven years, and when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could. The ocean is one of the greatest forces of nature, and it always has the potential to overcome those who live on or near it. We are proud of our choices and our preparation, and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home, we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us. Thank you.' Nancy, 68, added: ‘I first heard about this on Saturday morning when a friend called me up and said: ‘Get ready for this’. We almost passed away on the spot. ‘As a mother you can’t stop them, you can’t try. What am I going to do? Take away his (Eric’s) ice-cream? ‘It’s unfortunate but what can you do about it? I’m sorry it happened and I’m sorry for the expense’. Eric’s step-father Lou, 78, added that he thought that sailing would have been a ‘fantastic education’ for Eric’s children and that the trip had been planned for years. He said: ‘These people who say they should not have done that (the trip) - why not? Why shouldn’t a person live his life to the fullest and do what they can do?’ Speaking to MailOnline Sariah, who has spoken to Charlotte as she sails back on the Vandegrift, said that her sibling feels that they ‘did everything right’. She said: ‘It’s just one of those things; people sail all the time around the world, they were just on the ship where it went wrong. ‘I would not be surprised if in the future there is another sailing trip, but that’s their choice.’ Sariah said that the trip was ‘not something that I would ever do’ but that Eric’s background in the Navy and their planning had reassured her. The couple’s main concern now is the fate of the Rebel Heart, which was sunk by the Navy as it was taking on water. Sariah said: ‘They are in shock about losing their boat. It was their home for six years. It’s the equivalent of somebody watching their house burn down.’ Sick bay: Charlotte and Lyra, who had a rash all over. It is believed she had a relapse of salmonella poisoning - which she had suffered from before they left . Day One  I can see the magic of being out to sea, but I can’t really taste it. Our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes, gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer, and a night sky dancing with laser beams of brilliance.Day Two Our foresail, stay sail, and main sail, hold fast, all strong and white, like our painted wooden mast, and I can feel their excitement to be used like this again; they were made for blue-water sailing, and apparently, so were we.Day Four Today started out sh**** too. It is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel awful.Day Six I can’t possibly describe the range of emotions I have felt so far: anger, joy, sickness, exhaustion, exhilaration, wonder, awe, contentment, peace.Day Eight I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [but] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in life.Day Eleven When I woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you can’t escape at night.Day Thirteen Thirteen days at sea ... We are in good spirits, as good as you can be, considering.Three days later the family contacted the Coast Guard for help . Eric and Charlotte’s odyssey began when they left San Diego in 2012 and went to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico to deliver Lyra. They had to wait another year for good weather to cross the Pacific. Critics have not been quite so charitable, however, and pointed out that Lyra was sick with salmonella just a week before her parents set sail on their trans-Pacific journey. A doctor had given her a clean bill of health but when the salmonella returned they had to call for help because the antibiotics they were using had no effect. The Navy and the Coast Guard have declined to reveal the cost of the whole rescue operation, which will be almost a week long once finished. Eric and Charlotte will speak to the media upon their return but for now have released a statement which they sent via the captain of the Vandegrift. It read: ‘We are proud of our choices and our preparation, and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home, we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us’. Critics called the family ‘reckless’ and said that they should have put their children first. Captain Alec Fraser, the former captain of the USS O’Brien and the USS Cape St George, told MailOnline: ‘My opinion is that that exercised poor judgement and that having to call for help could cause other ships to put themselves in danger. ‘They may be able to sail across the Pacific, but I would call into question their judgement.’ Captain Fraser added that if it was his ship that was responding to the emergency call and he found out what happened he would be ‘disgusted’ at the couple. Rough seas: Eric and Charlotte have faced criticism over their trip - not least from their family. But they have defended their actions . Eric and Charlotte are unlikely to have to pay for the rescue as the Coast Guard does not charge for search and rescue operations. Whilest the Navy has not revealed how much the operation cost, given the distances and the resources involved it will be hundreds of thousands of dollars.","Charlotte and Eric Kaufman deny they put their 1-year-old girl Lyra in danger by taking her on their round-the-world trip .

Steve Jobs was disappointed that Apple's share price did not go down more when he announced he had cancer, a new book claims. The late tech guru supposedly said: ‘That’s it?’ in 2004 when the company’s shares decreased two per cent following revelations he had undergone surgery, . Jobs apparently thought the reaction of the stock market was not enough to reflect his importance to Apple, author Yukari Kane claims. Her book on Apple after Jobs, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011, adds to the portrait of a man who was unafraid to be blunt and speak his mind. Jobs’ authorised biography already described how he rebuked even President Obama, and once said Microsoft founder Bill Gates should take drugs and live in an ashram as he had done himself. Kane’s book, called Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs, suggests that since Jobs’ death, Apple has floundered and its future is not secure. In an extract, published in the New York Post, Kane wrote that he is ‘really skeptical’ about the chance of a new smart TV succeeding because it costs too much. Consumers can buy a good TV for $600 so she is not convinced they would be willing to pay more than three times that for the Apple version. Kane dismissed the much-rumoured iWatch as a fashion accessory, too: 'I mean, would you want one?' Jobs¿ authorised biography already described how he rebuked even President Obama, and once said Microsoft founder Bill Gates should take drugs and live in an ashram as he had done himself . 'On the innovation front, I guess we’ll see. But I do think its going to be difficult.’ The problem Apple faces is that Jobs was a ‘disruptive innovator’ and new chief executive Tim Cook is a different kind of person, according to Kane. She said Cook is the right man for the job as Apple in a ‘new stage of life’: 'Tim Cook has to reset expectations for Apple. Right now Apple is caught in this spot where they’re saying: ""We haven’t changed. We’re as innovative as ever"" - when everything has changed.' Jobs’ official biography was written . by author Walter Isaacson who interviewed the notoriously private tech . guru 40 times and was granted unprecedented access to his friends and . family.

After five days he . backed down and grudgingly accepted the offer from one of Mr Obama’s . staff. But when he . eventually spoke to the U.S. President he had harsh words for him and . said: ‘You’re headed for a one-term presidency’. Jobs also erupted when Google launched its Android operating system, which is similar to iOS but has become more popular.

In the memoir Isaacson delved into . why Jobs did not undergo what could have been life-saving surgery . earlier for the cancer that went on to kill him. Instead he relied on alternative therapies for nine months whilst his wife and close friends looked on in horror. Isaacson . said in an interview: ‘I’ve asked Jobs why he didn’t get an operation . then and he said, ‘I didn’t want my body to be opened…I didn’t want to . be violated in that way’. ‘I . think that he kind of felt that if you ignore something, if you don’t . want something to exist, you can have magical thinking…we talked about . this a lot.

He continued: ‘Our lawsuit is saying, 'Google you f****** ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us off. ‘I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong.

Till Bechtolsheimer was allegedly shoved by reveller Daniel Kurkowski after he accidentally bumped into him on the dancefloor. Mr Bechtolsheimer’s girlfriend Julia Kadioglu is alleged to have retaliated by smashing a bottle of Stella Artois lager over Mr Kurkowski’s head, leaving him with a nasty gash.

The incident happened late on Saturday night - according to the criminal complaint filed at the Manhattan Criminal Court the assault took place at 4.15am on Sunday the 19th of January. On its website the Dream Hotel says that the Electric Room, which is underneath the Dream Hotel, is designed by New York night life impresario Nur Khan. It is described as an 'intimate room' for some 100 people with a 'distinct cool Britannia feel' with sofas that have the Union Flag on them and Banksy artwork on the walls.

"By . Daniel Bates . The parents of a girl who died of cancer at the age of 16 have published a heartbreaking series of letters written by the Massachusetts teenager as she came to terms with her disease. Esther Earl refused to be defeated by cancer and became an online celebrity after posting YouTube videos from her bed when she was too ill to move. Her support led to a $250,000 donation from her followers for a group of Harry Potter fans who champion social justice - and a letter of support from the books’ author J.K. Rowling. Scroll down for video . Journey: Esther Earl's struggle with cancer is documented in a book made up of her letters and diaries . Esther kept a journal of her struggle and sent letters to her family, in which she wrote: ‘God means so much to me, but I wish He could heal me.' She also wrote an email herself to be read when she turned 17, but she died before reaching that milestone. In it Esther wrote: ‘To be honest, I’m not even sure if future me will even be alive... ‘...There was so much more I wanted to say, and maybe I’ll send another one of these if anything happens. I love you, and I hope you turn out good.' The emotional book was put together by her mother Lori, an educator, and father Wayne, a minister, to inspire others and tell them of Esther’s amazing spirit. They set up the This Star Won't Go Out foundation in her name, to help families whose loved ones have cancer, and have raised thousands of dollars in Esther’s memory. Esther's family remembered her as a ‘punky, energetic, creative kid’ with blue eyes and blonde hair, who never let the disease get the better of her. Lively: Despite exhausting radiotherapy treatment Esther made the most of her short life . Campaign: The Harry Potter fan helped raise $250,000 for charity . She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, and had two older sisters, Abby and Evangeline, and two younger brothers, Graham and Abraham. Her parents moved around for work, and were living in Marseilles, France, in 2006 when Esther was diagnosed with metastasized papillary thyroid cancer at the age of 12. Her parents wrote that their ‘slim, . muscular, energetic, never-tired 12-year-old found she was fatigued . walking even a short distance'. Wise words: Esther's parents have published a book of her letters . That November, Esther underwent surgery to remove her thyroid gland and lymph nodes on her neck, but suffered complications. The family returned to Massachusetts where she underwent a grueling, almost weekly regime of radiotherapy at Boston Children’s Hospital because the cancer had spread through her body. In her diaries, Esther remains funny and incredibly upbeat, writing that she has a ‘great attitude about all this cancer thing’ and only has a ‘meltdown’ once a month. She describes her cancer as a ‘stomach clenching thing’ and described how she was given ‘sleeping medicine’ by the nurses when she had operations. In a letter to her mother on June 3, 2007, she wrote: ‘Your friendship is so very important to me and I wouldn’t have such a close one with you had it not been for all this. ‘And if I had the choice of going . back in time, somehow, and preventing the cancer, I wouldn’t, since it . would change so many things.' In another diary entry she wrote: ‘I’m so scared. God means so much to me, but I wish He could heal me.' Her bright days included a meal out to try lobster for the first time. Her family lugged five oxygen tanks with them to the restaurant to help her keep breathing through a nose filter. She talked of wanting to go on dates with boys and have her first kiss, like any regular teenage girl. Yet there were dark days too, when the teenager would sleep 12 hours a day from 2am to 2pm. Her parents wrote that their lives revolved around reports on her blood counts, the results of tests and the precious time they had together. Esther wrote: ‘I don’t ever cry during the day. If I have to, I hold it in and plan to cry that night.' In another letter to her parents, in Christmas 2008, she said: ‘I may only live a short time. It sucks, man. But I mean it’s the truth, and the truth is icky… . ‘...I do think about dying a lot but I don’t know. I feel like I’ve finally like, grasped that I’d no longer live on Earth. But I’m working on the actual progress of death and the people missing me part, you know?’ By 2008 Esther and her family agreed to try an experimental therapy in conjunction with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Over Thanksgiving her condition took a turn for the worse and her family were called to her hospital bed to say their goodbyes - but she pulled through. When she returned home her family turned the dining room into a bedroom as Esther could no longer walk up and down stairs. She had lost her hair and had to deal with nausea most days. Esther spent her days reading Garfield comics and watching her favorite TV shows, What Not To Wear and Jon & Kate Plus 8. Fun loving: The teenager was an internet hit thanks to her quirky YouTube videos . But she admitted to being lonely, and turned to the Internet where she created online identities, calling herself ‘crazycrayon’ and ‘cookie4monster4’. The blogs and YouTube videos she posted about her progress were viewed tens of thousands of times. She even started an advice column in which people would write in asking her for tips. As a result, Esther said: ‘I really do feel feel like I have so much more in my life.' The teenager founded a group of online friends called Catitude who became her closest confidants. She worked with The Harry Potter Alliance. Together they successfully campaigned for a $250,000 grant from the Chase Community Giving foundation, beating 10,000 other organizations in a Facebook poll. The outpouring of support for Esther was behind the surge in votes and it even drew the attention of the books' author J.K. Rowling. She sent a hand-drawn picture of the Sorting Hat from the books and wrote underneath: ‘To Esther, with love and best wishes always - Jo’. In February 2009 Esther’s MRI and CT scans showed the cancer had not spread to her brain, and by May that the multiple lung tumors had shrunk 15 percent after extensive chemotherapy. She started taking algebra lessons and, by January 2010, was going to school three days a week. But by April her health took a turn for the worse. She was able to keep talking to her friends from her hospital bed until the end, and some of them met her in real life for the first time as they came to say goodbye as a part of a Make-A-Wish day. Fans: Esther's fun-loving spirit touched thousands of lives and her videos helped the teenager feel less lonely . In her last video post recorded on . August 9, 2010, Esther said: ‘If you are a person with feelings, I kind . of urge you to, like, write this, write in your diary or your blog post . or a video or on a Post-it, like your feelings, because it feels good to . just like, kind of see what they are, and even if you can’t figure out . all of them, because, holy crap the brain has a lot of feelings! ‘...I will see you guys tomorrow. Probably.' Esther died on a warm summer’s night, August 25, 2010, surrounded by her family. Describing her final hours, her parents wrote how she woke from a sleep to say: ‘I’m going, I’m going.' They decided to turn off her respiratory machine, which had been keeping her breathing. They . wrote: ‘After several minutes of waiting, crying quietly and touching . our beloved Star, she breathed out one final, unusually long breath, . like she was giving it up, offering it, being pulled forward into a . newer, richer life. ‘Her . dying appeared to us more like a birth than a death, a kind of willing . submission, a sense that her struggle was complete and that it was OK to . finish this final battle.' Last word: In her final YouTube video, made a couple of weeks before she died, Esther urged others to write down their feelings too . Esther has already been the subject of another book, The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, who had befriended her. Green said that his book was fiction and those wanting to know the real story of Esther should read the new work. In his moving introduction to the book, Green wrote that Esther’s death showed him that a ‘short life can also be a good and rich life’. He wrote: ‘When we think of death, we often imagine it as happening in degrees: We think of a sick person becoming less and less alive until finally they are gone. ‘But even in her final days, Esther was wholly alive, as alive as anyone else, and so even though everyone who loved her understood she was dying, her death was still a terrible shock to me. ‘She did not leave slowly, but all at once, because even when she could not get out of bed, she found ways to be fully alive: to play with her friends, to crack jokes, to love and to be loved. And then she was gone, all at once.’ In an introduction to the book, Esther's parents paid tribute to their daughter as a ‘champion of the lonely, a welcomer of strangers, an inviter’. They wrote that her diary reflected the ‘perspective of a joyful young girl forced to navigate the monstrous reality of a cancer death sentence’. ‘Her life was a book. She didn’t get to choose the ending, but the way she filled the pages makes her story irresistible,' they wrote. This Star Won't Go Out, by Lori and Wayne Earl, is published by Dutton Juvenile.","Esther Earl wrote of her struggle as she tried to come to terms with her condition .

"By . Daniel Bates . The North Korean regime plied Dennis Rodman with an endless supply of liquor on his controversial tour of the secretive dictatorship that led to his latest stint in rehab, a friend on the trip told MailOnline today. Waiters circled the former NBA star and his teammates so that ‘when their cups were empty they would fill them up’ said Vin Baker, who was one of the players. Baker, who has overcome his own battle with booze and is now a church minister, said the alcohol consumption was ‘excessive’ and ‘difficult to watch’. Excessive: Baker, sitting to right of Rodman in spectacles, said the group were served an endless stream of hard liqour. He said Rodman's drinking was the 8,000lbs gorilla in the room' He told MailOnline that even in all his years of alcohol abuse he had ‘never seen it like that’. Rodman has now gone into a 30-day drink rehab program. He has also apologized to the family of Kenneth Bae, the American who is being held captive by North Korea, for suggesting in an hysterical interview that he was a guilty man. Rodman claims he was drunk at the time he spoke to CNN. Baker, who blew $100m during his basketball career but has been sober for nearly three years, said that during the trip Rodman asked him four or five times how he got clean. Baker said: ‘He wasn’t just asking about how I got clean for the sake of asking how I got clean. I think the negative attention (on the trip) really broke through. 'I don’t think the liquor was enough to make the pain and embarrassment go away’. Baker said that while staying in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, they had no nightlife and only one chance to leave the hotel outside of games and training, which was for an excursion to a water park. Help: Dennis Rodman sought treatment after his controversial CNN interview during his North Korea visit . Cooped up for days on end there was nothing to do apart from order endless rounds of room service or hit the hotel bar - something which Baker did not do. during hi stay he was even presented with bespoke bottles of vodka, decorated with hand-drawn illustrations of Rodman and the dictator. He described Rodman’s drinking problem as ‘the 8,000lbs gorilla in the room’ which would have been obvious to everyone. Baker said: ‘It was very difficult to watch, Dennis in particular. I prayed for him. When their cups were empty our hosts would fill it up. I don’t know if it was the culture. It was very difficult to watch. ‘I know they wanted to make him happy. I’ve never seen it at that level when they keep bringing it back to back. It was excessive.’ Baker, 42, added that he was ‘ecstatic’ that Rodman had sought help and that it was ‘going to be a chapter in his life that is amazing’. He said: ‘I’m happy that he’s made this decision to get help. I think Dennis has a lot of things to offer but you have to be in a sober place’. Baker said that when Rodman asked him why he quit drinking he said:  ‘Honestly Dennis, I was going to die if I didn’t change my behavior’. Baker said: ‘I was honest with him. I was just listening to him. He did not really comment. The fact he asked me three or four times led me to know there was something that he wanted to change.’ Rodman was joined in North Korea by seven ex-NBA stars who were there to train the country’s basketball team and play an exhibition game in front of Kim, on his birthday, which they lost. Among the men was ex-New York Knicks power forward Charles Smith. A woman who answered the phone at his home in Montclair, New Jersey said that he was not doing any more interviews. Baker’s interview gives an insight into the methods used by the North Koreans to keep Rodman on message during his trip. Friends: North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un with Dennis Rodman in January . And during his month-long stay at an undisclosed rehab facility in New Jersey, he will certainly have time to reflect on a trip that controversial from the start. It was Rodman’s third visit to North Korea and during his stay the ex-Chicago Bulls star, 52, called the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un his ‘best friend’ and in a bizarre episode sang him happy birthday whilst on the basketball court. But critics said that his brand of ‘basketball diplomacy’ as he put it was doing more damage than good and Mr Bae’s family said his comments were ‘outrageous’. Drinking seems to be a regular feature of Kim’s life and he was supposedly drunk when he ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek. Kim reportedly likes expensive tequila and regularly downs cocktails at all hours. His father Kim Jong-il was supposedly fond of $600 a bottle Hennessy Cognac and spent $700,000 a year on the drink. Rodman, who has been in rehab twice before, will also be reflecting on Baker’s advice, as it comes from a man who has walked in his shoes. Selected by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1993 NBA draft, Baker’s career took off and in 1999 he signed a seven-year, $86.6 million contract with the Seattle SuperSonics. Three years later he was traded to the Boston Celtics but could not get his drinking under control and would turn up to practice reeking of booze. I'll have that: Dennis Rodman reaches to take a bottle of vodka from his bodyguard outside a Pyongyang hotel during his stay. The bottle's handmade illustration, showing Rodman with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Rodman's name in Korean, was designed locally . Boredom: Baker says the group were largely confined to their hotel so the drink flowed freely . He was still earning around $13 million a year but admitted to being an alcoholic and his weight ballooned to more than 300lbs. Baker, once an NBA Allstar, was released and bounced around the league before retiring in 2006. He has nothing to show for his riches but is now a minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem in New York where he helps with the youth basketball programme. In a statement Rodman’s agent Darren Prince has said that while in North Korea his drinking had ‘escalated to a level that none of us had seen before’. He said in a statement: ‘Dennis Rodman came back from North Korea in pretty rough shape emotionally. ‘The pressure that was put on him to be a combination 'super human' political figure and 'fixer' got the better of him. ‘He is embarrassed, saddened and remorseful for the anger and hurt his words have caused.’ Mr Prince did not return calls for comment. Reached by MailOnline at her Desoto, Texas home, Rodman’s mother Shirley said: ‘If he’s going to rehab then good for him’.","Former basketball star has checked into rehab in New Jersey days after returning from trip to North Korea where he went on televised drunk rant .

"By . Sara Malm . and Jill Reilly . and Gordon Deegan . and Daniel Bates . Jenny Lauren, niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren, had her alleged drunken meltdown on a transatlantic flight because she has a 'long history' of anxiety on planes, a close friend said today. Melanie Beck said that Jenny could have turned to drink to calm her deep rooted 'fear of flight'. She said that Jenny, 41, usually flew 1st Class and that Delta, the airline on which she was flying, could have served her too much booze. Lauren is accused of breaching the peace on the flight, which had to be diverted to Shannon Airport in Ireland yesterday, and appeared in court on charges of being drunk and abusive on a . plane. Arrival: Jenny Lauren, 41-year-old niece of fashion icon Ralph Lauren, arrives at Killaloe Court, Ireland, for the initial hearing on Tuesday . In defense: Melanie Beck used to live with Jenny Lauren in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when she was recovering from the eating disorder and said the two have a 'long history' together . But Ms Beck claimed that the incident . was just a one off and her friend had 'matured' from the days when . anorexia controlled her life - with no intention of going back. Ms . Beck used to live with Jenny in Santa Fe, New Mexico when she was . recovering from the eating disorder and said the two have a 'long . history' together. She said that Jenny had been in Barcelona recently and her posts on Facebook suggested she was having a great time. Ms . Beck said: 'It's inexplicable. She's not in a dark place, she has long . outgrown that. I think that she has a history of anxiety on airplanes. 'I . think that's true. She has had a long history of fear of flying. She . could have been drinking to ease that. I think that's how most people . drink on planes (to ease anxiety). 'She was probably overserved. Maybe its the airline's fault.' Dressed in a smart black dress, coat and boots, the New York-based jewellery designer wept before the hearing and then clutched her hands as she appeared before Killaloe District Court . Ms Lauren was arrested off the plane at Shannon Airport yesterday afternoon and held in custody overnight . The unusual sitting was held in the downstairs function room of the Brian Boru pub - named after the ancient High King of Ireland - as there is no dedicated courthouse in the area . Lauren's . old friend added the person Jenny describes in her memoir - it features . a frank account of her battle with anorexia - is the person she was . 'years ago'  and that she is a 'grown woman now'. Ms Beck admitted that her friend had a 'lot of explosive energy' when she was younger but she claimed that was 'years ago'. She . said that when Jenny used to live in her home in Santa Fe together, . which was more than a year ago, they traveled on long haul flights . together including to Brazil with no issues. Jenny would pay for her to go first class - one of the perks would have been as much alcohol as they wanted. Ms . Beck said: 'This doesn't seem like the Jenny that I know. She is a . sophisticated woman. Totally sophisticated. 'I've travelled many places . around the world and I have never seen her act out on an airplane or in a . restaurant or a public place like that. I'm shocked.' Dressed . in a smart black dress, coat and boots, the New York-based jewellery . designer wept before her court hearing and then clutched her hands as . she appeared before Killaloe District Court.

Arrested: Jenny Lauren, pictured with her father Jerry in October 2011 at an evening hosted by Oprah Winfrey at the Lincoln Center in New York City . Jenny Lauren . first began to make jewellery after a manager from Urban Zen, a boutique founded with the help of Ralph Lauren's rival Donna Karan, admired her work. Unaware of her design pedigree, the Sag Harbor, N.Y., store offered her  a trunk show. She was raised in Manhattan and her father Jerry is the executive vice president for men’s design at the Ralph Lauren fashion house. Her mother Susan died from lung cancer in October 2008. She has two older brothers: Brad, who . is in the restaurant business, and Greg Lauren, an artist, who is . married to Dancing With The Stars contestant and former Saved By The Bell star Elizabeth Berkley. She is said to be close to her first cousins, Ralph's children, including David, the executive vice president for global advertising, marketing and communications at Ralph Lauren; Dylan, the owner of 'the largest candy store in the world', and Andrew, a film producer. Jenny Lauren battled an eating disorder and . related health problems during her younger years which she documented in a 2004 book, 'Homesick: A Memoir of Family, Food and . Finding Hope. Her uncle, born Ralph Lifshitz in New York in 1939, is the man behind the . world-renowned Polo Ralph Lauren brand and the 162nd richest person in . the world. He has an estimated wealth of $7.7billion after starting off selling ties in Manhattan in the 1960s. Last year alone, his company reported revenues of $6.9billion. Judge Patrick . Durcan heard Ms Lauren was ready to enter a plea to three separate . charges but he refused to rule on the case in full and said the plea to . the charges would be dealt with at a second hearing tomorrow at Ennis . District Court. At the hearing in the pub near the banks of the River Shannon, Lauren, of East 65th Street in New York, swore an oath on a Bible before speaking only to confirm her name, nationality and that she only has one passport. She became emotional and wiped away tears as she spoke with friends before the hearing. Lauren owns a jewellery line called Jenny Lauren Jewellery . The US national was granted bail on condition she stays at a hotel in Shannon town with her travelling companions and lodges 2,500 euro ($3,400/£2,075) of her own money to the court. She has been ordered to sign on at Shannon Garda Station tonight and surrender her passport. Judge Durcan had refused an initial offer of an 800 euro ($1088/£664) lodgement by solicitor Sharon Curley. He warned that he would have to take account of the nature and extent of the inconvenience to other people, as well as the costs incurred by Delta Air Lines, airport and other passengers. 'These are the issues that will have to be addressed and the court will have to be satisfied before they can be discharged,' he said. The judge asked for an assessment on how much the disruption has cost the airline, airport and passengers before dealing with Lauren's plea at the hearing tomorrow. The downstairs function room of the Brian Boru on the Hill pub is in Ballina, Co Tipperary - one of the twin towns where the ancient High King of Ireland was born. He ruled from Killaloe, on the other side of the Shannon, from 1002-1014, making it the Capital of Ireland. The licensed premises was packed for the day's court sittings, with the bar area cordoned off with wire mesh. A representative from the US Embassy in Ireland also met Lauren at the police station yesterday and appeared in the makeshift court to support her. Lauren was charged with being intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that she might endanger herself or other persons on board the aircraft. She was accused of engaging in behavior likely to cause serious offence or annoyance to any person on board the aircraft, after being asked by a crew member to stop.' Clothes horse: Jenny's uncle Ralph Lauren, flanked by wife Ricky, runs a billion-dollar empire built around his clothing label Polo Ralph Lauren . Lauren also faced a count of breaching the peace by engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour. She left the licensed premises in a black 4x4 and covered face as she ducked past photographers into the vehicle. The . case is due to be heard again tomorrow at Ennis District Court where . sentencing will be decided on a guilty plea from Lauren. More . than 200 passengers and crew were on board the flight from Barcelona to . New York when the alleged air rage incident took place. She . spent last night in a cell in Shannon Garda Station, where she made no . reply when charged under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973. The flight was able to continue its journey to New York just over two hours after touchdown. Her company Jenny Lauren Jewellery operates in the US and sells items prices from $350 to $5,000. Speaking from his Manhattan apartment, Jenny Lauren's brother Brad said he was unaware of the incident - but was not surprised. He said: 'That seems like Jenny. She can be explosive with her temper. I don't know what could cause her to snap. She just has an explosive personality.' Brad Lauren, 46, said that he did not believe his sister's demons were coming back to haunt her and that it was just her temper that was to blame. He said: 'Things are going really well for her...The jewelry business is terrific, everything is really good. I know that she was in Europe for the holidays but I don't know anything else.' Brad Lauren added that his sister would be 'very embarrassed by this' and would be glad to get back to New York.

Mr Draper told TechCrunch that Silicon Valley, which has been the home of . technology in the US since the 1980s, needs to funnel back the money that it . makes into more research and development, instead of funding welfare programmes . elsewhere in California. The state would be split up into Jefferson, North California, Central . California, West California (which would include Los Angeles, South California, . and Silicon Valley. The debts would be split up according to the number of people in each . region, as would the assets in each area. Mr Draper would also create a new office for himself, the ‘Agent of the . state of California’ which would allow him to appoint a lawyer who is more . powerful in Silicon Valley than the state Attorney General.

"By . Daniel Bates . Joe Jackson has vowed to make Michael Jackson’s son Blanket into a star as big as his father - so long as he is ‘trained’ properly. The 75-year-old family patriarch said that he disagreed with those who said there would never be another King of Pop because Blanket was ready to take his place. He said that the 11-year-old is the ‘spitting image’ of Michael at that age and revealed that he believed a fortune teller who once predicted Blanket would be a sensation. Prospects: Blanket Jackson is ready to become the next King of Pop, according to Michael's father Joe . Joe’s comments evoked memories of how he pushed Michael and his brothers into show business and ruled the family with an iron fist. He has in the past admitted to beating his children with a strap but was unapologetic and claimed that it ‘kept them out of jail and kept them right.’ The physical and emotional abuse supposedly went on for years and friends of Michael’s have said that he was never able to forgive his father. Fond memories: Paris Jackson discussed the death of her father Michael for the first time at length . Dancing lessons: Paris said she wanted to learn how to perform the Moonwalk dance from her father, but they never got around to it . Joe made his comments in a forthcoming documentary about Michael’s children in which Blanket speaks on camera for the first time. Prince Michael, 16, and Paris, 15, also talk frankly about the impact of the death of their father in 2009 at the age of 50 as he prepared to mount a comeback. In the documentary Joe said: ‘They said there would never be another Michael Jackson and I say that we already have one. But I said he just has to be trained. Candid interviews: Prince Jackson also opened up about his father's death and lessons learned from him . ‘That kid is the spitting image of Michael when he was smaller.’ Speaking of the fortune teller, he said: ‘She said that boy there is going to be the biggest entertainer in the world.’ The documentary is called Remembering Michael and was made by Michael’s mother Katherine, 83, the legal co-guardian of his children. Heir apparent: Blanket was pegged by his grandfather Joe of being the next King of Pop . Family matriarch: Katherine Jackson was executive producer of the documentary . In extracts already made public Paris breaks down in tears as she says of her father: ‘He promised he would teach me how to moonwalk, but he never got round to it.’ She also opens up about how her grief led her to attempt suicide in June and says her life was so secluded she did not even know her father’s name until she was six. The reason was that he wanted his children to know him as ‘Daddy’ and not a celebrity. In his interview Blanket says that some of his earliest memories are going into his father’s room and watching videos of him dancing.

"By . Daniel Bates . Love triangle: Tearful roomate Rosita Cotto speaks to Mail Online after she was turned back when she tried to visit Cecil Williams. She says a love rival is preventing her seeing the newly-famous blind man Williams . The blind man who survived falling onto a subway track and being run over by a train after his guide dog tried to save him is at the centre of an emotional love triangle, MailOnline can reveal. Cecil Williams has a girlfriend called Cynthia who is caring for him by his hospital bedside - and a former lover who wants him as well. Both women will no doubt be aware that he has to date received $109,000 from well-wishers after an online campaign was launched to let him keep Orlando, his seeing eye dog. Former girlfriend Rosita Cotto tried to visit Cecil in hospital today but burst into tears when apparently told by Cynthia that she could not see him. Rosita lashed out at her love rival and branded her a 'booty call' who has her own 'agenda'. She told MailOnline that Cynthia, who has not revealed her second name: 'She's not good for him!' Her outburst came as Cecil, 60, continues to recover in hospital after he survived falling onto the tracks at 125th St in Harlem, New York, on Tuesday when he became dizzy. His 11-year-old black Labrador, Orlando, who had tried to hold him up, fell with him and just as a train was approaching the station woke him by licking his face. Clutching his dog, the blind man flattened himself in the space between the rails as the train moved into the station. The lead car passed over them, as terrified witnesses screamed for the train to stop. The two managed to duck at the last minute and survived. Rosita arrived at St Luke's Hospital in Manhattan today at 6am in the hopes of seeing Cecil. Scroll down for video . Christmas miracle: Cecil Williams was saved by his dog Orlando after the pair fell onto subway tracks and were run over by a train. Well wishers have donated $39,000 so Cecil can afford to keep Orlando once he retires . Lies: Cecil's current girlfriend Cynthia, pictured, dismissed Rosita's claims and said the fact that she was caring for him 'was all that mattered' But around 10.30am things came to a . head when Cynthia came down to the reception area and informed her she . would not be allowed in. Rosita . spent five minutes on the phone talking to Cecil during which time she . was visibly distressed and could be overheard saying 'this is . unacceptable!' She then stormed out in tears and showed MailOnline documents which she claimed gave her the right to see him. Rosita . told MailOnline that she and Cecil lived together for five years in the . Rockaways in Queens and The Bronx but lost touch during Superstorm . Sandy last November. She said that Cecil then moved into a YMCA in Queens which is where she met Cynthia. Rosita said: 'I feel a sense of responsibility towards him because I cared for him for so long. I'm going to miss him. 'If you talk to Cecil tell him I want him to recover 100 per cent and I love him.' Rosita denied that they had dated - Cynthia says otherwise - but went quiet said that 'I'm just very loyal to him'. War of words: Ms Cotto says the girlfriend staying with Mr Williams is a 'booty call' who has been doing drugs  when not caring for the blind man . As for Cynthia, Rosita had nothing but harsh words. She said: ‘She's not good for him. She's no good. She's HIV positive, she doesn't care about anything. She won't allow me in.' After . being turned away at the hospital reception, Rosita called Cecil on his . mobile phone and he told her that he had a high fever and a headache. During their conversation she could be overheard saying 'this is unacceptable!' Rosita said: 'I prayed for this man every day loyally. He has a son, Daniel Thompson, who has three babies he has to care for.' She . added that Cecil was living in a 'little crunched up apartment a studio . with the dog (Orlando), with the dog in a tiny apartment with roaches . and she doesn't care.' Rosita said: 'Cynthia is a booty call and that's all she is!' Retiring: Mr Williams has found himself at the centre of attention from the two women after well-wishers donated $39,000 so he could afford to keep aging service dog Orlando after he retires . At an emotional press conference earlier in the week at St. Luke's Hospital a teary Cecil thanked strangers nationwide for their kindness saying, 'Orlando, he is my best buddy, he's my pal. The spirit of giving, Christmas, it exists here and it's in New York.' As . Cynthia left the hospital for a cigarette and a walk, she told . MailOnline that she was not bothered by what Rosita was saying. She . said: ‘It’s OK, I don’t care. I don’t want to get into all of that. I . don’t care what Rosita has to say. I’m here and Rosita isn’t. ‘Please don’t ask me any questions. It’s not my decision to let her up, it’s his (Cecils’). I’m looking out for him’. At least as far as Orlando goes, Cecil's life is not quite so dramatic. He . thought that he would lose his companion of eight years but donations . totaling $109,000 have flooded in since it was revealed his insurance . wouldn't pay for the 10-year-old dog to stay with him when he retires.

It is going to to cover him for the rest of his life. Loyal companions: Cecil and Orlando have been together for ten years but the dog will soon have to retire . Cecil raised a smile when he noted that Orlando will deserve his retirement. 'He’s a senior citizen -- he’s got grey hair,' he explained. 'He’s looking forward to enjoying life now.' 'For me, I know that angels, miracles, that’s what saved me down on the track.' Guiding . Eyes for the Blind, the guide dog school that trained Orlando, said . they have been fielding hundreds of inquiries about whether Cecil will . be forced to give Orlando up for adoption in January when he retires . from his job and loses his current insurance plan.

"By . Daniel Bates . Before they hibernate, grizzlies (pictured) eat around 100lbs worth of nuts, salmon and berries . Scientists are studying grizzly bears in the hope they can help solve the worldwide obesity crisis - because they are surprisingly good slimmers. A study has begun into the fearsome 1,000lbs creatures because they eat up to 58,000 calories a day but don't get fat. Before they hibernate grizzlies eat around 100lbs worth of nuts, salmon and berries which increases their cholesterol and causes their blood pressure to jump. Yet unlike humans, they do not suffer heart attacks or clogged arteries - and they don't become diabetics. U.S. drug maker Amgen is now researching 12 grizzlies held in captivity at Washington State University to work out how they do it. Dr Kevin Corbit has been looking at their fat deposits, monitoring their hearts, analysing their blood and conducting biopsies in the hope the bears will yield their weight loss secrets. It is the only facility in the world housing adult grizzlies and offers a unique opportunity to study them. According to the Wall Street Journal, Dr Corbit was inspired by Yogi Bear and his portly figure when trying to think of a way to research weight loss. He said that the test results so far suggest that bears modify their sensitivity to the hormone insulin, which controls how sugars and fats are broken down and used for energy. As they put on weight before hibernation, bears seem to be more sensitive to insulin, he said. But when hibernation begins they seem to shut off their responsiveness to the hormone completely. Hope for humans? Experts say that from the test results so far, bears modify their sensitivity to the hormone insulin, which controls how sugars and fats are broken down and are used for energy . Dr Corbit plans to spend the next two years working out how exactly the mechanism works.His work will be assisted by the sequencing of of the bears' genome which he hopes will be completed soon. The Washington State University bear centre was set up 27 years ago and the animals there were born on site or rescued from places where they went too close to humans such as in a national park. Dr Corbit, who until now has only worked with rats in a laboratory, had to take extra precautions when dealing with the grizzlies. The facility where they are held has electric fences buried underground so the bears can't dig them up. The bears themselves are kept in steel crates when they are being inspected and are put under before samples are taken. Dr Corbit has also become adept at using honey to distract them whilst another resarcher scans their hearts. Amgen research executive Dr Alexander Kamb said the grizzly bear research was unusual but given how big an issue obesity had become, it made sense to think differently. He said: 'I want to learn how the grizzly bears work their magic'.","Before hibernation, grizzlies eat .

"By . Daniel Bates . The multimillion dollar war over Snapchat (logo pictured) has taken an ugly turn after the ousted co-founder was hit with a restraining order . The multimillion dollar war over Snapchat has taken an unexpected twist after an alleged co-founder was hit with a restraining order for leaking documents to the press. Frank Reginald Brown was ordered by two of his former friends, who founded the photo sharing app, to cease and desist from making any more information public. The order states that more leaks would cause ‘irreparable injury to Snapchat’ and that the information is ‘highly confidential’. Mr Brown immediately signalled that he would ignore the order as he wages a public relations campaign to win the case. A judge will now have to decide if the order is granted, even though Mr Brown is supposedly planning an interview with GQ magazine in which he will almost certainly keep up the pressure on Snapchat. The restraining order was filed as part of an increasingly bitter court battle between Mr Brown, Snapchat’s chief executive Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, who also set the firm up. Mr Brown sued because he claims they stole the idea for Snapchat from him when they were students at Stanford University. While California-based Snapchat has no sales or business model, its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds, making it a truly instant service, instead of a more permanent record collector like Twitter or Facebook. The restraining order was filed as part of an increasingly bitter court battle between Brown, Snapchat's chief executive Evan Spiegel (left) and Bobby Murphy (right), who also set the firm up . Snapchat recently turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook, despite making no income from normal business. Evan Spiegel, one co-founders of the two-year-old social media company has reportedly turned down the huge all-cash offer, which would have valued Snapchat at $4 billion – but the firm is said to be being wooed by other investors and possible buyers. Sources close to the company told The Wall Street Journal that Mr Spiegel, who dropped out of Stanford University, is hoping for a better offer. According to sources, he thinks the app’s user numbers have lots of potential to grow and just two months ago, the company’s usage had reportedly risen dramatically to 350 million messages a day, from 200 million in June. However, the company does not disclose its numbers and has not commented on the rumours. Observers have said that the case has . echoes of the lawsuit brought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss against . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which ended with a $65 million . settlement. Since its creation, Snapchat has become so successful that it recently rejected a $3 billion buyout deal from Facebook. The order was filed after Mr Brown leaked . an embarrassing video deposition to Business Insider, in which Mr Spiegel . admitted that Mr Brown ‘may deserve something’ for his contributions to the development of the app. Among . the other information Snapchat is concerned about going public is . sensitive personal information about its bosses and sensitive financial . information about the company. Both sides must submit such data as part of the court process known as 'discovery' - and they have to show it to the other party too. The order, known as a 'protective order', would cover almost everything involved in the case, effectively ensuring a blackout. Spiegel and Murphy also filed a preliminary injunction request which could mean Mr Brown is subject to fines, contempt of court or dismissal of the case entirely if he breaches it. Snapchat is one of the most popular photo sharing apps in the world, especially among young people. According to research by Pew Internet, 26 per cent of under 30s use it, though the number of over 30s was tiny . Mr Brown alleges that Mr Spiegel and Mr Murphy . turned against him by changing the passwords on the Snapchat servers to . shut him out when the company was in its infancy.

"By . Daniel Bates . This is the moment the man who accused Michael Jackson of sexual abuse marries his childhood sweetheart, with the prosecutor who accused the King of Pop among the guests. Gavin Arvizo, whose claims led to the sensational trial in 2005, wed Shelby Drake, and celebrated to a Michael Jackson song at their reception after the ceremony in a church in Atlanta. There was an awkward moment when the DJ played Jackson’s hit ‘The Way You Make Me Feel’ - causing Arvizo to shrug his shoulders in resignation. Holy matrimony: Gavin Arvizo, who accused Michael Jackson of sexually absuing him in 2005, has married Shelby Drake . The guest list included some unusual additions, like the former Santa Barbara Senior Assistant District Attorney Ron Zonen, who prosecuted the Jackson case. Details of . Arvizo’s life were made public in an article in the Daily Beast . which revealed he is now living a modest life working as a paralegal and . wants to go to Harvard. Arvizo, . now 24, was a 13-year-old cancer survivor when he claimed Jackson had . abused him at his Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, California. The allegations led to the trial that derailed Jackson’s career, even though he was acquitted on all 10 counts. Arvizo’s . wedding took place at the bride’s suburban Atlanta Baptist Church on . Saturday November 30 but have only now come to light. Happy ending: The bride and groom join on the dance floor during the reception when the Michael Jackson song was played . Departure: The newlyweds exists the church, located in suburban Atlanta where the bride's father is a minister . Her father Bill Drake, an ordained . minister, and a Catholic priest, Kevin Hargaden, performed the service . and Arvizo plans to worship in both churches. Senior Deputy District Attorney Ron Zonen, who prosecuted the Jackson case, was guest . Drake spent time in England when his daughter was young, meaning she spent part of her childhood in the UK. Among the guests was US comedienne Louise Palanker, a mentor to the Arvizo family who was called as a prosecution witness in the trial, and Arvizo’s mother Janet, who ironically, has married a man called Jay Jackson - meaning her name now is Janet Jackson. Also present was Gavin’s older sister Davellin and her brother Star, who both testified against Jackson. According to the article Arvizo only talks about his past when he applies for jobs and over the years has turned down lucrative offers to speak out. The article says: ‘He says he knows the truth and believes it will be revealed to the doubters of the world when the time is right.’ Jackson died in 2009, aged 50, whilst preparing for the This Is It comeback concerts at the O2 arena in London.

"By . Daniel Bates . Thousands of iPhone 5S users are having to send back their new smartphones because the batteries are defective. Apple has admitted that a manufacturing defect is causing its flagship device to lose battery life far sooner than it should do. The company said the issue has affected a 'very limited number' of users and that it was contacting them to offer a replacement. Thousands of iPhone 5S users are having to send back their new smartphones because the batteries are defective and cause the luxury device to lose battery life sooner than it should do . Apple has smashed its own records by selling nine million iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets during the first three of the devices going on sale - working out as 125,000 an hour, on average, or  2,083 a minute. Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012, yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this year's two . 'This is our best iPhone launch yet―more than nine million new iPhones sold―a new record for first weekend sales,' said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. 'The demand for the new iPhones has been incredible, and while we’ve sold out of our initial supply of iPhone 5s, stores continue to receive new iPhone shipments regularly. 'We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working hard to build enough new iPhones for everyone.' The iPhone 5S handset claims to offer 10 hours of talk time and 250 hours of standby with a single charge. The admission will be embarrassing to Apple, which has been criticised in the past for the battery life of its products. In 2006 it issued a recall for some laptops because some of the batteries were exploding. The iPhone 5S has sold nine million units already since its launch in September with mixed reviews on the battery life. Apple spokeswoman Teresa Brewer said: 'We recently discovered a manufacturing issue affecting a very limited number of iPhone 5S devices that could cause the battery to take longer to charge or result in reduced battery life. 'We are reaching out to (contacting) customers with affected phones and will provide them with a replacement phone.’ Ironically the iPhone 5 had in the past been praised for having a better battery than the iPhone 4. In its review of the device, Techradar said if left on standby overnight the battery dropped off by just five per cent. It also said that it charges 'phenomenally quickly' and that it went from zero to full in just over two hours. The iPhone 5S has sold nine million units since its launch in September with mixed reviews on the battery life. A staff member sets up the new handset, which notably boasts a fingerprint scanner, at the launch in the flagship store in Beijing . Part of the reason for the improvements could be iOS 7, the new operating system, which is thought to organise apps better. Techradar did however point out that Internet browsing still chewed up the battery very quickly and that it did not believe Apple’s claims that users got 10 hours surfing on 3G. The iPhone 5S costs between £549 and £709 new and still has a waiting list after launch because of features like the fingerprint scanner which unlocks the phone. It is the more expensive version of the iPhone 5C which costs from £469. iPhone 5C . iPhone 5S .","Apple admitted the problem with the iPhone 5S is due to a manufacturing defect, which causes the phone to lose battery more quickly .

"By . Daniel Bates . and Ml Nestel . Louise Woodward should take parenting classes 'for the sake of her own child', the family of Matthew Eappen have said . Louise Woodward should take parenting classes ‘for the sake of her own child’, the family of the baby boy she was convicted of killing in America 16 years ago have suggested. The former nanny, who is seven months pregnant, needs to learn to control her temper before her own child arrives, they say. Woodward was jailed for 15 years in 1997 for killing eight-month-old Matthew Eappen at his home in Boston. Her sentence was reduced to time served - . 279 days - when her second degree murder conviction was overturned for . involuntary manslaughter, and she returned to the UK. Matthew’s aunt Mary Wong said yesterday that Woodward had a ‘right to have a child’, but added: ‘For the sake of her own child I hope she is a better parent. ‘For the sake of her family I hope her parenting skills have come a long way... I think that she needs to have parenting skills and support for her baby.’ Mrs Wong, 52, added: ‘I hope no harm comes to the child.’ She said there was ‘nothing Louise does’ that could take away the time Matthew spent with his parents Debbie, 48, an ophthalmologist, and anesthesiologist Sunil, 47. She said: ‘Debbie is a good person. She’s . tormented by what happened but I don’t think that she wishes any evil . things on Louise or her family or the child. Debbie’s reaction is going to be very personal to her.’ Feelings about the case still run high in America too. Matthew's aunt Mary Wong said his mother Deborah (pictured left with husband Sunil Eappen and son Brendan) is still tormented by his death . Woodward was jailed for 15 years in 1997 for killing eight-month-old Matthew Eappen at his home in Boston but her sentence was reduced when her second degree murder conviction was overturned . A . decade after it was resolved Woodward was dubbed ‘the most notorious . criminal in Massachusetts’ by an American magazine - beating a drug . dealer who had topped the FBI’s most wanted list. Matthew’s paternal grandfather . Koodathummuriel Eappen, 75, a doctor, told the Daily Mail: ‘I really . don’t want to stir up bad memories other than wishing her well and . hoping that she looks after her baby well. ‘Her temper is probably more mature now so that she is able to control the baby’. Elaine Whitfield Sharp, Woodward’s lawyer . during her trial, was among the few who said that she welcomed the news . of the pregnancy - and still thought that Woodward was innocent. Miss . Sharp, who is originally from Chester but lives in Boston, was in 1998 . secretly recorded saying she thought her client was a ‘duplicitous . monster’, but appears to have softened her views. Woodward, 35, is now a dance teacher and is expecting with her husband, businessman Antony Elkes . She said: ‘I’m very happy for her and I think she will make a great mother. She deserves it. ‘I think she is a kind and very gentle person. She loves animals, she was very kind to children. ‘Everyone deserves a second chance, and everyone deserves a chance at happiness’. A neighbor of the Eappen's disagreed though. The woman who gave her first name Kate, has three children who were the same ages as the Eappen kids. Asked about the family's loss Woodward's future plans to mother a child, Kate quickly condemned Louise Woodward. 'I think justice did not occur,' she said. Kate agreed that the Eappen family since moving into the neighborhood 13 years ago have been the best neighbors. 'They are both exceptional people both professionally and personally. You wont find any nicer, kind-hearted people.'Unfortunately, as both families grew-up together on the same leafy street, Matty's loss is even more pronounced. 'They lost a child and they live with it everyday,' she said. 'Matty's always in their thoughts.’ Woodward, 35, is now a dance teacher in Bridgnorth, Shropshire and is expecting with her husband, businessman Antony Elkes, 32.

"By . Daniel Bates . Twitter bosses have reignited the war with Facebook by claiming that all it wants to do is ‘dominate, destroy, break things’. Chloe Sladden, Twitter’s head of media, claimed Twitter was a plucky alternative to the social network because it was better at creating a ‘shared experience’. She also said Twitter had won the battle for the ‘basic human need to connect’ - even though Facebook has far more users. Emma Myers at Saga Legal said: 'In the same way you would not want your loved ones falling out or being inconvenienced over a missing will when you die, it's also imperative to plan ahead for the great internet cafe in the sky' Twitter and Facebook have bad blood that dates back to 2008 when Facebook tried to buy its rival for $500m but was turned down.

It was clear to me that wasn’t us.’ Sladden added she was sure Twitter would retain its edge over Facebook because it was better at the ‘humanities thing’. The battle dates back to 2008 when Facebook tried to buy its rival but was turned down. Facebook is said to have tried to squeeze out Twitter by partnering with Yahoo on media events. Twitter, however, recently updated its photo-editing software to add filters, pictured, to rival Facebook-owned Instagram . She said: ‘We’ve won the 'heart moment' in the shared experience, a basic human need to connect, whether it’s something terrible like a bombing or something exhilarating, like a surprise reality show winner. And we are good at that.’ Among the other steps Facebook has taken to squeeze out Twitter is partnering with Yahoo on large media events. Twitter, however, has recently updated its photo-editing software to add Instagram-style features such as filters and cropping, which earned it legions of fans. Twitter is set to float on the stock market next month and will be worth about $20billion - even though it has yet to make a profit. It also faces more of a challenge than Facebook - when Facebook went public in May 2012 it had 845 million users but Twitter has just 215 million.

"By . Daniel Bates . Los Angeles-based author Daniel Stern (pictured) threw himself in the underworld of swinging at sex parties . An author has lifted the lid on the world of swingers and revealed how thanks to the Internet they have come out of suburbia and into a home near you. Los Angeles-based Daniel Stern spent three years having sex with dozens of couples in his quest to understand the subculture known as ‘The Lifestyle’. His conquests include a vixen in her 50s who liked having sex with soldiers and a mother who switched from bad cop to loving mother when her five-year-old walked in on them. He tells how he becomes such a hit that he had three ‘playdates’ a week including one with a wife who screams so loudly he worried the neighbors would call the police. At one sex party he was the youngest there by three decades - where the mature ladies fought amongst themselves to ‘break him in’. Along the way he learned the ‘Swing Commandments’ to ensure that he wins acceptance and gets praised as a ‘respectful and skilled single male’. Stern hopes that other men will read his book and become better educated swingers than he was - and won’t have to go through the same hardships that he did. In his expose of the American swing scene, Stern has gone to great lengths to disguise who the people are that he mentions in his encounters. But he is honest about himself and says that swinging was a way to overcome his own anxieties about sex. Stern, who lives in Los Angeles, says that the golden rules of swinging are: thou shalt not lie - be truthful about your appearance, your age, relationship status and sexual orientation. Stern describes his encounters at sex parties as either one-on-ones, threesomes or foursomes - sometimes with women decades older than him (photo posed by models) He tells aspiring swingers not to judge others, embrace rejection and be polite when it happens. Swinging is broken down into a number of scenarios: one-on-one, threesomes, the hard or full swap - essentially a foursome when two couples all have sex, a soft swap - couples switch partners but no oral or intercourse takes place - and group scenarios. Single women are known as ‘unicorns’ because they are so rare and so treasured. Stern finds out about sex parties on Craigslist or sex websites on the Internet and, once he has a lead, goes on masturbation diets to ensure that ‘there was no way I wasn’t going to be able to perform’. Of his encounters, the anecdotes are legion. One man with a brusque voice calls him up and asks right away: ‘So, you have experience with rough sex’. At eight that night he goes to the address the man texted to be greeted by a woman called Arianna who wore ‘a powder blue lace bra and matching panties’. Stern and another man engaged in uncomfortable small talk about granite versus laminate counter tops before being introduced to ‘Gina’ who was in a side room. Stern writes: ‘Each of her limbs was tied to a different corner of the mattress with thickly braided white rope and over her petite, tanned torso were sprinkled condoms of seemingly every size and variety in the history of prophylactic manufacture. ‘Gina appeared a sexual sundae of sorts’. Stern tells how he became such a hit that he had three 'playdates' per week and found sex parties on Cragislist (picture posed by models) Four men have sex with her and Arianna and Stern joins in until he tries to stand on the mattress - and clips his head on a ceiling fan, sending blood over himself and ruining the mood. He receives oral sex from a single woman in a secluded spot in his car and sleeps with a woman in her 50s who tells a Marine who has also been invited to the party: ‘I can take whatever you got soldier’. Stern writes about the physical dangers of swinging and whilst having sex with one particularly athletic partner he is thrown off her and onto the floor where he injures his pelvis. Stern is hurt so badly he is put on morphine and has to see an orthopedist who says he needs an agonising procedure and weeks of treatment to correct the damage. In the author disclaimer, Stern writes that ‘swinging isn’t for everyone’ and asks that readers come with an ‘open mind and a certain level of curiosity’. He says that anyone can follow in his footsteps, so long as they are respectful and follow the rules of The Lifestyle. He writes: ‘I’m a regular guy. ‘Granted, a regular guy who’s had one-on-ones, MFMs, FMFs, foursomes, moresomes, gang bangs, orgies, phone sex, text sex, car sex, and public sex.’ He adds: ‘By subjecting myself to sexual experience after sexual experience after sexual experience I was demystifying the act of sex, desensitizing my reaction to it and chipping away at the fear it held over me and beneath which I was pinned. ‘Now, years later, I’d escaped that tonnage of performance-hindering anxiety and understood sex for what it was: fun’. For the rest of the book he continues his anecdotes, such as when he is at a party full of older couples and is the youngest by far. Daniel Stern's book Swingland gets between the sheets of the lifestyledaniel stern swingland . Stern writes how he surveys the room whilst eating some mashed potatoes he serves himself from the buffet which had been laid on by the hosts. A woman called Jackie jumps onto him just as he finishes eating, tears his clothes off and summons two more males to wear down her ‘limitless energy’. She screams at all three of them: ‘F*** me now!’ Things continue until Jackie has ‘the orgasm of all orgasms’ that causes her to collapse and for Stern to temporarily fear that she has died - until she comes out of it. On another occasion, given just an hour’s notice, Stern borrows his friend’s car and drives halfway across town to meet a couple who want a threesome. While the wife busied herself in the bathroom on their hotel room, her husband and Stern watched a Steven Seagal movie to pass the time - which they left on whilst both having sex with her. The first sex party he details includes a copy of the invitation to ‘Lionel and Sarah’s 7th Annual Anything Goes Party!’ It reads: ‘Arrival at 7pm, Dinner at 7.30pm, followed by Playtime at 7.31pm’. Once inside Stern talks to a large man called Bob and introduces himself with the words: ‘I’m a boring straight male’, which were designed to put him at ease. Bob asks Stern if he likes to give oral sex, if he is a good kisser and if he uses condoms. Bob then asks how big Stern’s penis is and if he trims downstairs. When Stern reveals that his balls are shaven, Bob replies: ‘Good man’ and lets his wife have sex with him. Stern sums up the process like this: ‘I had progressed this far with Bob because I knew f****** Bob’s wife as the same as f****** Bob’. Stern's book is called Swingland.","Daniel Stern started swinging to overcome his own anxieties about sex .

Tragic Jack Burden, 18, was just two weeks into a month-long expedition in Africa with classmates when he suddenly fell into an anaphylactic shock. Despite receiving immediate first aid and treatment with EpiPens - an emergency treatment for anaphylaxis - he could not be resuscitated. Tragic: Jack Burden, 18, was just two weeks into a month-long expedition in Africa with classmates when he suddenly fell into an anaphylactic shock . Yesterday Jack's father Steven and headmistress mum Alison said the family still did not know what had happened to the 'caring' teenager. Steven said: 'We don't know what it was he had a reaction to yet. We're just waiting for the travel company to tell us what it was.' The school boy's friends flooded social media to pay tribute to 'one of the kindest, most caring lads I could have wished to have met'. Writing on Facebook Kieran Mckeith said: 'Absolutely devastated, Jack was easily one of the kindest, most caring lads I could have wished to have met, never had a bad word to say about anyone. Was an absolute pleasure knowing you, thoughts are with his family. RIP.' Sammy Preston wrote: 'Can't believe the news I've woken up to. I've known you since I was 7, you were such a caring person and such an amazing friend not only to me but to so many other people. You were always there for me. It's absolutely heartbreaking knowing you’re gone and at such a young age too, but you'll always be in our hearts. RIP Jack Burden god always takes the best!' In mourning: Sir Ken Gibson, executive headteacher at the college Jack attended, said he was 'devastated to hear the awful news' While devastated Chlo Hobson added: 'Have woke up today with the most devastating news! Can't believe it, it just can't sink in! Rest in peace Jack Burden. 'Was so kind and funny, he never had a bad thing to say about anyone... I remember one Christmas a group of us spent a load of time together, and I started playing with your catapult when we were at your house and broke it, so I got you a special Christmas card with an elastic band in it. 'You were listed on Facebook as my brother and in school that's what you acted like. When I had trouble there and felt alone you weren't the person to walk past and say nothing, you'd make sure I was okay and ask if I was coming to class. Just can't believe it. 'Feel so selfish for not keeping in contact with you more since school. You'll be missed so much by everybody, your amazing personality has touched everybody. Love is going out to his family.

"By . Daniel Bates . Michael Porter, a leading economist at Harvard Business School, is being sued by a wealthy heiress . A wealthy heiress has sued a baron and a leading economist after she sunk $77 million into their research company - which she claims is now all but worthless. Corinna von Schonau-Riedweg says she is ‘stunned’ that her private banker, Baron Wilfrid von Plotho, gave her bad investment advice while she was still grieving over the death of her mother. In a recently-filed lawsuit she says that she was fooled into investing in Massachusetts-based Continuum Energy Technologies because it could supposedly change the properties of matter. But after the breakthrough failed to happen she now wants her money back - and has gone to the courts to do so. She has sued von Plotho, Swiss bank . Rothschild and, in an unexpected twist, former MIT administrator and . Continuum co-founder John Preston and Harvard’s Michael Porter, one of . the college’s most respected economists, who also sits on the firm’s . board. Among the allegations is that during . their nine year business relationship, von Schonau paid von Plotho $18.5 . million in shares and an annual consulting fee of around $500,000. Now friends have told the Boston Globe that she was treated shabbily and that what happened was ‘very reprehensible’. H.J. von der Goltz, a venture capitalist based in Boston who knows the main parties, said: ‘It’s very sad it had to come to this. ‘It didn’t start that way. She was definitely taken advantage of.’ The row dates back to 2002 when von Schonau’s mother died and she discovered she had been left hundreds of millions of dollars of stocks in pharmaceutical giant Novartis. She knew von Plotho’s wife socially so turned to him for financial advice. As she struggled with her loss, she was also reassured by the fact he worked for Rothschild, a 200-year-old institution that once served Queen Victoria. Over the next nine years together, von Plotho told von Schonau to diversify her holdings so she sold some of her shares and bought into Continuum and related companies. Corinna von Schonau-Riedweg is suing her private banker Baron Wilfrid von Plotho, who worked at Rothschild Bank (pictured), over his alleged bad investment advice . The company seeks to change the properties of things e.g. magnetizing copper so that it becomes more conductive and can be used in computer circuit boards. In the lawsuit, von Schonau says she was told Continuum was just six months away from releasing its first product. On visits to its head office she was also told the company was valued at $500 million but says now that figure was ‘grossly overstated’. And she supposedly grew so close to Preston that he would let her stay at his house and took her to a country club to make a good impression on her. The lawsuit states that Preston ‘assured her that the investments were not risky and told von Schonau that the investments would be profitable’. The money she invested was not just in Continuum but related companies as well, such as $25 million cash and a $15 million loan into Preston’s C Change Investments . Another $5million of her money went into another of Preston’s companies which tried to convert waste into gas but has now gone bankrupt. Von Plotho’s lawyers argue that over the course of his nine-year relationship with von Schonau he made 32 investments on her behalf and that only three of them are in dispute. But the lawsuit paints a very different story and alleges that he ‘preyed on von Schonau’s grief and known inexperience’ with money. Massachusetts-based Continuum Energy Technologies is working on changing the properties of matter . According to the Boston Globe, had von Schonau left her money where it was - in Novartis stock - it would now be worth $80 million. She still however has significant wealth and is not on the breadline. Von Schonau said in a statement: ‘I was advised by my bank and one of its senior officers that I needed a diverse, conservative investment portfolio that would provide security for my family. ‘My trust was bolstered by the professional reputations of the people behind these investments: I believe anyone would have trusted the advice of Michael Porter, a world-class Harvard economist. I am stunned by how this all turned out.’ Mr Porter, the Bishop William Lawrence University Professor at Harvard Business School, declined to comment and referred questions to Preston. Mr Preston said in a statement: ‘I am deeply offended by Ms von Schonau’s allegations and deny them wholeheartedly. ‘I have given my best to every company I have been associated with, and have always put shareholder interests’ first.’ Von Schonau’s claim against Rothschild is that is did not manage her money better and did not keep sufficient checks on von Plotho. Bank spokesman Kilian Borter said: 'We categorically reject the accusations that have been made against Rothschild.' Continuum executive vice president Kevin Welch said that none of their investors have ever lost money and that they want all investors to be rewarded for their ‘loyalty and vision’.","Corinna von Schonau-Riedweg was left hundreds of millions of dollars of stocks in pharmaceutical giant Novartis .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Brazilian footballer who changed his citizenship to Ukrainian so he could play for the country's national football team is now regretting it – after he was called up to fight in the army. Edmar Halowski de Lacerda, 34, admitted that he had never considered the possibility that the passport change would mean he'd have to swap the football field for the battlefield. Ukraine had compulsory military service for school-leavers but Edmar was too old when he got his citizenship to have to worry about performing it, and in any case the country announced in 2012 that it was scrapping compulsory military service in 2013. Scroll down for video . Conscript: Brazilian footballer Edmar Halowski de Lacerda, pictured here marrying Tetiana Halovsky, has been called up to fight for Ukraine after he became a citizen of the eastern European country . But that changed when the country disintegrated and Ukraine's new leadership announced they were reinstating the military draft to address the deteriorating security situation and threats from Russia along the country's border. Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov issued the decree saying Ukraine will conduct a draft for active military service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces in order to increase the state defence potential. The decree says: ‘Ukrainian male citizens who are physically qualified for military service, over 18-years-old and older and who have no right for exemption from military service will be conscripted.’ It added that the measures were to address the deteriorating situation in the east and south of Ukraine, activities of illegally formed armed pro-Russian groups, the seizure and blockade of the state administration buildings, military administration facilities, military bases and so on which pose a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity. Game on: Edmar in action on the football field - he's now been called up to fight on the battle field . But that has left the footballer, who married Ukrainian Tetiana Halovsky in 2008, with orders to report for duty and he admits: ‘I hadn't reckoned on this and although I'm a bit nervous that it might not get sorted out, I have to say that my wife is terrified. I have told her not to worry though and everything will be fine. ‘To be honest, I don‘t know what I would do if I actually went into the army. Playing football is the only thing I can do. I haven‘t heard that any of my team mates have been called up, but maybe nobody says it out loud.’ For the last three years the midfielder has played for Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkiv and he said the order to turn up for duty had been a complete surprise. Conflict: The Kiev government is embroiled in a military struggle with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Pictured is a rebel guarding the MH17 crash site . He added: ‘I had certainly not anticipated that when I got a Ukrainian passport. The club told me they will try to resolve the issue for me.’ The Brazilian came to the Ukraine in 2000 when he signed a contract with Tavriya Simferopol. He played at the club for five years before moving to Metalist Kharkiv, where he remains today, and after getting a Ukrainian passport he also played for the national side where he was capped 11 times, scoring a single goal. The games he played in included one against Poland in Kiev in 2013 in which the Ukrainians won 1-0. Edmar, unlike many fellow South Americans, remained in the Ukraine despite the political crisis. Those that left include six players from FC Shaktar Donetsk, and Edmar's team mate at Metalist, the Argentinian player Sebastian Blanco.","Brazilian Edmar Halowski de Lacerda, 34, came to the Ukraine in 2000 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Spanish underground train passenger Armand Serrano Maya who discovered his vending machine chocolate bar had been nibbled in the corner did not have far to look for the culprit – a mouse that had infiltrated the equipment. He could see the critter inside the machine where it was continuing to tuck into the free feast. Armand said: 'I think the sound of me ordering a snack as it dropped into the bin scared the mouse off temporarily, but when I realised my chocolate bar had been nibbled and looked at the other items. Scroll down for video . Snack attack: A mouse was filmed munching on snacks in a Barcelona train station vending machine . ‘I saw that some of them had also been eaten and wanted to take my phone to video them. But then I realised that the mouse was still there, and seconds later it moved back to the front of the vending machine and continue tucking into a pack of chocolate biscuits.' He said the incident on the Sants-Estacio station of the blue line on the Barcelona metro network had left him feeling ill, saying: 'It was really disgusting, and I posted the video online to complain about it and warn other people. They claim that this food is fresh.' Mouse about that: The incident happened on the Sants-Estacio station of the blue line on the Barcelona metro . The Transport Metropolitans of Barcelona which owns and operates the underground line in the eastern Spanish city confirmed that they have started an investigation after being made aware of the video. They said they had contacted the company that owned the vending machine to demand an explanation. A spokesman said: 'We understand fully the concerns of our passengers, many of whom have contacted us about this unusual event, and it is being fully investigated and steps will be taken as a result of what we find out.' A spokesman for the company that owned and operated the vending machine, Selecta, said: 'How the mouse got inside is a complete mystery but we can confirm that the machine has been taken out of service and in the meantime has been completely cleaned, disinfected and sanitised and will be checked by mechanics to make sure this can't happen again before its put back into service. 'The mystery, however, is how it happened in the first place, because we have been offering vending machine services for 16 years in Spain and despite the fact that we have 4000 machines in operation across the country, we have never had a similar case. All machines are not only vandalism proof, they are also secure to prevent pests from getting inside.'","Mouse has been videoed nibbling on snacks in Barcelona vending machine .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The American public views Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians far more warmly than Muslims and atheists, according to a new study. The Pew Research Center, a ‘nonpartisan fact tank’, asked members of the public to tally eight religious groups with a ‘feeling thermometer’ scale ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 meaning a cold, negative feeling, and 100 the warmest, most positive. Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians all received an average score of 60 or higher, the Center reported. Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians all received an average score of 60 or higher, the Center reported . Poll: The Pew Research Center, a 'nonpartisan fact tank', asked members of the public to tally various religious groups with a 'feeling thermometer' - and Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians scored highest . Jews scored 63, Catholics 62 and evangelical Christians 61. However, Muslims received an average rating of 40 and atheists 41. More than four in 10 (41 per cent) gave Muslims a distinctly icy rating of 33 or below, and 40 per cent rated atheists in the same part of the thermometer. Participants generally had luke-warm feelings towards Buddhists, Hindus and Mormons, which scored 53, 50 and 48 respectively. Frosty: Muslims received an average rating of 40 on the feeling thermometer and atheists 41. Pictured is the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan . Overall ratings: The thermometer shows how Jews are viewed most warmly and Muslims the least . Perhaps not surprisingly, members of religious groups viewed their own faith much more positively than others. Followers of the Catholic faith rated Catholics a toasty 80, while evangelical Christians gave members of their faith a score of 79. For white evangelical Protestants, its atheists they view most coldly, giving them a thermometer reading of 25. And it seems the feeling is mutual, because atheists gave evangelical Christians a frosty 28. The study, which polled 3,200 adults, also cross-referenced results with political opinions. It found that Republicans saved their warmest feelings for evangelicals, giving them an average thermometer rating of 71. Jews and Catholics are the next most-liked, with scores of 67 and 66. Those who follow Islam, in contrast, received a chilly 33 and atheists 34. These results are mirrored in some respects for Democrats, who gave Jews an average rating of 62 and Catholics 61. However, they view Muslims and atheists more warmly, giving them a more generous score of 47 and 46.","Pew Research Center polled US public on its view of different religions .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A pain-racked woman was rushed to hospital by her family and told she was just an hour from death - after being told she was a non-priority by the ambulance service. Lindsay Bowker, 30, was screaming and doubled over with chronic stomach pain when her mother Wendy dialled 999 - only to be told she would have an hour-long wait. Lindsay did not realise she was actually seven weeks into an ectopic pregnancy and was suffering heavy internal bleeding after her fallopian tube ruptured. Close call: Lindsay Bowker (right) was screaming in pain when her mother, Wendy (left), dialled 999, only to be told she faced an hour wait . After losing two litres of blood her mother drove her to hospital herself where she underwent emergency surgery and doctors said she was lucky to be alive. Medics told the mother-of two she was an hour from dying - the length of time she would have waited for the ambulance. Lindsay, of Chorley, Lancashire, who sadly lost her unborn baby, said: 'I was in the house on my own and I was hit with this instant pain. 'It was absolute agony and I immediately fell to the floor. 'I’ve had two babies and it was worse than both labours put together.' Lindsay called her mother Wendy, 53, who was out walking her dog and she phoned for an ambulance. Emergency: Ms Bowker had been suffering heavy internal bleeding and was told by surgeons that she was only an hour from death when she arrived at hospital . Lindsay added: 'They told my mother I wasn't a priority so it would be about an hour until an ambulance would arrive. 'My mother arrived about ten minutes later and could see how much pain I was in. 'I was screaming so she phoned 999 again and told them how urgent it was. 'They would have been able to hear my screams in the background but they just said the same thing.' After waiting around 30 minutes for an ambulance, Lindsay’s brother arrived with the car and her mother Wendy rushed her to Chorley Hospital. Lindsay said: 'It was a nightmare. I had to lie across the backseat of the car with the windows open and I was screaming the whole way because of the pain.' After arriving at Chorley Hospital last Tuesday, Lindsay was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital in an ambulance, where they rushed her into emergency surgery. 'As soon as I arrived they gave me a scan and said they could see lots of blood,' Lindsay said. 'They said they had no option but to rush me straight into surgery. 'They thought it was an ectopic pregnancy but they didn’t know my fallopian tube had ruptured until they operated. 'They put a camera through my belly button and had to remove my fallopian tube when they saw what had happened, so sadly I lost the baby. 'Afterwards, they told me I had lost two litres of blood and would have died if I had waited any longer. 'The surgeon said he’d never worked so fast in his life and said ‘you’ve just had life-saving surgery’. It was incredibly scary.' Lindsay was given a blood transfusion and was kept in hospital for three days before being discharged. Lindsay, who is now recovering at home, praised staff who treated her but the family have made a formal complaint to Chorley MP Lindsay Hoyle regarding the ambulance service. Lindsay, who has two daughters aged seven and 12, added: 'I can’t thank the hospital staff enough. 'I don’t blame the ambulance staff either but something needs to done. 'I could have died and I don’t want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. 'To go through all that and then find out I’d lost my baby all in one day was something I wouldn’t want anybody else to go through. 'I’ve lost all faith in our ambulance service.' North West Ambulance Service said it told the family the patient may have to face a wait due to it being busy. A spokesman said: 'We understand that waiting for an ambulance can be distressing for the patient and their family and we are sorry that in this instance, the patient’s family is not happy with the service received. 'When received, all 999 calls are categorised within the control rooms, based on the information given by the caller, to ensure patients are assessed on the basis of their medical need, with those with immediately life-threatening conditions taking priority. 'In this instance, due to high levels of activity, the family were informed of the possibility of there being a wait for a response and took the decision to make their own way to hospital. 'If the family would like to discuss this incident with us, we would urge them to contact us directly so we can respond to their concerns.'","Pregnant Lindsay Bowker was screaming in pain when her mum dialled 999 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Good Samaritan was left seriously injured and unable to work after being viciously attacked by two teenage thugs who he’d reprimanded for swearing at an elderly couple. Nigel Helmn, of Whitley Bay, was punched in the back of the head with such force that he fell on the floor and damaged a knee ligament. Mr Helmn has been unable to stand properly for the past five months and needs to undergo surgery. Injured: Nigel Helmn has been unable to walk for the past five months after being attacked by two teenagers . Now, as his teenage attackers walk free from court, Mr Helmn told how the incident has affected his life. The 61-year-old said: 'It’s been a nightmare. I can’t work which means it’s hard to pay the rent. I can’t stand up for very long which means I haven’t been able to leave the house very much. 'Now, I’m having to have surgery on my knee which means another six to eight weeks out of action.' Mr Helmn, a supermarket security guard, had been out for a drink in Fitzgeralds in Whitley Bay on February 19 this year. He said: 'I’d popped out and into Sainsbury’s and came out and there were these two young lads who had run over to an old couple and were shouting every sexual thing you could think of. 'I went over to them and told them I’d have them arrested if they didn’t stop it. 'They then ran about 20 yards and started shouting at these girls in North Parade.' Mr Helmn said he went to get a radio from a security guard at a nearby pub when he suddenly felt a fist to the back of his head. Thugs: Teenagers David Polglase (left) and Tyler Latimer (right) both pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding . He said: 'I just went down, hitting the door and landing on my right knee, tearing a ligament.' Shocked staff called an ambulance and Mr Helmn was taken to North Tyneside General Hospital where he needed seven stitches to the back of his head and treatment to his knee. Mr Helmn said: 'The knee swelled up, it was massive. Since then I’ve been unable to work. I can pay the rent this month but after that I’m going to struggle.' Tyler Latimer and David Polglase, both 18, have been spared immediate custody because of their age after admitting unlawful wounding. Mr Helmn said: 'It doesn’t seem that much considering what’s happened, does it?' Addressing the pair at Newcastle Crown Court, Recorder Michael Slater told them: 'Between the pair of you, you punched him to the ground and each of you kicked him. 'As a result of that he sustained injuries to his head and knee and was left, to a certain extent, in a state of disability for a period of time. 'Whatever your argument was with him, he certainly did not deserve that at your hands. 'Were you some years older you would be going straight to custody today. You are only saved by your age and what the author of the pre-sentence report puts before the court.' Latimer, of Whitley Bay, and Polglase, of Newcastle, both pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding. Latimer was given 12 months custody suspended for two years with supervision and 150 hours of unpaid work. Polglase got nine months suspended for two years with supervision and 150 hours unpaid work. Katherine Dunn, for Latimer, said: 'He wants to write a letter to the victim to explain how sorry he is and also to show the victim how he had changed his life around almost as a result of this offence.' Tony Hawks, for Polglase, said: 'This was a disgraceful offence on any view but he has exhibited genuine remorse and insight for his behaviour. 'The victim chose to confront them, it’s not just two lads repeatedly kicking an elderly man in the street.'","Nigel Helmn, of Whitley Bay, was punched in the head by teenage thugs .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A thug with 19 convictions has been jailed for smashing a New Year’s Eve reveller on the head with a stolen vodka bottle. Victim Jonny Smith, 25, was left in a coma for two weeks, needed a titanium plate in his skull and has been left with brain damage. Surgeons removed a section of his skull the size of a man’s hand. Attacker Alexander Hunter, 21, described by the judge at Ipswich Crown Court as a danger to the public, was jailed for 11 years. Jailed: Alexander Hunter (pictured left and right) was sentenced to 11 years after smashing a bottle of vodka over the head of a young father, leaving him in a coma . Mr Smith was hit on the head with a vodka bottle after celebrating New Year’s Eve in Colchester town centre with his girlfriend. He suffered a bleed on the brain. After the attack, in St Botolph’s Street, Colchester, he could not remember his daughter, confused his relatives and still has constant headaches, although he is improving. However, he has been warned he could suffer a fatal seizure in the future. Devastating injury: Jonny Smith (pictured), suffered a bleed on the brain after the attack in Colchester . Long-term effects: Mr Smith has been told that he may go back into a coma or even suffer a brain seizure . Doting: Mr Smith had trouble remembering his daughter after he woke up from a coma . Mr Smith, a landscape gardener, said: 'The first thing I remember was waking up in hospital two weeks after I had been out with my then girlfriend. 'I did not know my daughter. My family had to keep coming in every day and say: ‘This is your daughter.’ 'Things are starting to come back but I still have difficulty remembering. 'It is quite hard sometimes and I still get bad days.' His daughter is now 14 months old and Mr Smith said the priority is getting better for her. He said: 'I can’t drink now and don’t go out in town. 'I don’t really see my friends and I can’t do much. 'I am supposed to stop taking medication now and they say there is a low risk I could go back into a coma or die.' It was revealed Hunter assaulted two other men on the night he attacked Mr Smith. The court heard he already had 19 convictions for 27 offences before he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on Mr Smith. Charges were not brought on the other two assaults, which happened minutes before he attacked Mr Smith. Crime scene: Forensic experts scour St Botolph's Street for clues following the attack earlier this year . The court heard Hunter had stolen a bottle of vodka from the Silk Road bar in St Botolph’s Street in the early hours of January 1 this year. Sarah Porter, prosecuting, told the court, he went outside, put the bottle down and punched a man to the floor. CCTV footage showed him kicking another victim to the floor. He then picked up the bottle and hit Mr Smith on the head. When police arrested Hunter they had to call for a caged transport van due to his threatening behaviour. Jonathan Ray, mitigating, told the court Hunter 'does have another side'. He read parts of testimonies commenting on the good character of a man who first appeared in court aged 12. He also read an apology from Hunter saying he is 'truly remorseful' and that his thoughts have been with Mr Smith and his family since his arrest. Judge John Devaux said: 'This was an unprovoked attack. It resulted in devastating injuries. 'You were under the influence of alcohol, cocaine and long-term steroids.' The judge took into account his remorse, eventual guilty plea and the fact it was a single hit but said the use of a weapon, the fact he was on bail at the time and the severity of the injuries aggravated the offence. He said: 'I am sentencing you to 11 years. You are a danger to the public.' After the hearing the fathers of the victim and attacker shook hands. Mr Smith said: 'I feel sorry for his family. It was nothing to do with them. 'I shook his dad’s hand. It was hard to do at first but after seeing them in court I got used to seeing them and it is not their fault.' Other members of Mr Smith’s family embraced members of Hunter’s family after the hearing. Mr Smith’s uncle, speaking on behalf of the family, said: 'We feel sympathy for Hunter’s family. 'Their lives changed that day too. I hope he leaves behind his life of drink and drugs in jail. 'The sentence was about right and it sends out a message and we hope lessons are learnt.'","Alexander Hunter was jailed after leaving victim Jonny Smith in a coma .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Honour: John Major is having a street named after him in Candeleda, Spain, where he has holidayed with his wife Norma, pictured, for nearly 25 years . Former Prime Minister John Major is to have a street named after him in a small Spanish town he has holidayed in for nearly 25 years. The ex-Conservative Party leader enjoys an annual break every summer with his wife Norma and friends at former Foreign Office minister Tristan Garel-Jones's holiday home near Candeleda, two hours drive west of Madrid. Now local politicians have decided to put the pretty town on the international map - and thank Mr Major for his support - by naming one of its main streets after him. They have voted to call it Avenida de John Major or Avenida John Major - John Major Avenue in English. Major, the oldest living former British Prime Minister, is expected to be invited to the official unveiling ceremony at the end of the month. Councillor Rodrigo Munoz, spokesman for the local Popular Party which holds eight of the 13 council seats and proposed the street-naming idea, said: 'We obviously want to promote Candeleda and see this as an excellent way of achieving this objective. 'But it's also our way of saying thank you to Mr Major for choosing to holiday in our town when he was Prime Minister and repeating year after year. He obviously likes it here and we're delighted to receive him. 'I've enjoyed a beer with him in the town hall square the last couple of times he's been and he seems a very nice down-to-earth man who, although he doesn't speak Spanish, can say the odd word.' The town, a popular weekend destination for tourists from Madrid, boasts one of Spain's highest mountains, the 8,500 Almanzor peak which Major can see from his holiday home when he stays. Olmedo, where Nick Clegg holidays every summer with his Spanish wife and their three kids, is just a two-hour drive drive away in the neighbouring province of Valladolid. Major has yet to take his annual break this summer in the town, where in the current political climate he risks being quizzed by locals about the rising tension between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar. He first visited the area in 1989 when friend and Conservative Party colleague Tristan Garel-Jones invited him to stay at a country home near Candeleda which his Spanish wife inherited from her late father. New name: The local Popular Party in Candeleda, pictured, have voted to call the road Avenida John Major - meaning John Major Avenue in English . He used to be flown by helicopter from Madrid's Barajas Airport when he was holding the reigns of power, but now makes the two-hour journey by car. A Spanish couple that look after the house all-year-round cook for him while he is there, making his favourite sangria and gazpacho, a cold tomato soap. His favourite pastimes include reading and trekking in the Tietar Valley south of the Gredos Mountains which draw holidaymakers to the protected area. The avenue set to be named after John Major is an amalgamation of two streets which include an old tobacco fermentation centre and a council-run sports complex and is soon set to become the HQ of the local police. Mr Munoz said: 'It's one of the three access roads to the town and the road Mr Major uses when he comes into town from his friend's holiday home. 'My understanding is he has already been made aware of our plans to name a street after him through friends. 'We're holding an unveiling ceremony at the end of the month and will obviously invite him. 'We're still deciding whether to name the avenue Avenida John Major or Avenida de John Major.'

"By . Gerard Couzens . Clutched in her mothers arms, she looks like a healthy three month old baby. But Maria Lorena was in fact born just a few days ago - weighing a staggering 13lbs 3oz. Her mother, expat Briton Maxine Marin, became the first woman in Spain to give birth naturally to a baby heavier than four kilos (8lb 8oz) in the early hours of Tuesday morning - without even an epidural painkiller. Pictured holding her new heavyweight arrival for the time, Maxine, 40, revealed how even the pregnancy with husband Jaime came as a big surprise as she'd recently undergone an operation to remove an ovary. Big bundle: Proud parents Maxine and Jaime Marin pictured for the first time holding their baby daughter Maria Lorena who was born weighing 13lbs 3oz at a hospital in Denia near Benidorm . Record-breaker: British expat Maxime Marin gave birth to her baby girl, who at 13lb 3oz, is the largest child to be delivered naturally in Spain . The mother-of-four, who has three sons from a previous relationship, said: 'I went in for an op to remove a cyst on one of my ovaries a year ago and they ended up removing the ovary itself. 'A lot of people panic and think they've no chance of getting pregnant with just the one ovary. 'But it wasn't a real worry for me and Jaime since we weren't planning on having children because of our ages. 'It was a complete shock to say the least when I found out I was pregnant. 'My youngest child was 12 at the time so it's been a while since I've changed a nappy. 'But I'm over at the moon to have a daughter after three sons and Jaime's pleased because he's a first-time dad. 'To be told I'm the first woman in Spain to give birth to a baby over four kilos without a caesarian is an amazing feeling. 'I knew she was going to be big but not this big. She looks just a teddy bear. She's a beautiful miracle.' She christened the child Maria Lorena after her mother-in-law and a colleague at the travel agency where she works. Big baby: The child is almost twice the size of the average newborn baby girl . Heavyweight: Maxine Marin, pictured with her husband Jaime and baby girl Maria, revealed how she was stunned when she became pregnant as she'd recently had an ovary removed. Maxine, originally from Burntwood, Staffordshire, went into labour just after midnight on Tuesday and Maria Lorena arrived at 4.43am that morning. Doctors at the hospital in the Costa Blanca resort of Denia where she gave birth didn't even need to give her an epidural. Maxine, who married construction worker Jaime in September last year, said: 'I was asking for an epidural but the midwife kept telling me I didn't need one and I was only worried because the baby was big and not because I was in any pain. 'She told me to calm down and relax and as soon as I did, she just popped out. 'Everyone gasped when they saw the saw the size of her and then weighed her. 'Even the doctors thought she was only going to weigh around 11lbs right up to the day she arrived. 'Everyone who sees her is amazed by just how big she is. 'I'm only normally around eight and a half stone and my husband weighs around 11 stone. 'In . the first months of my pregnancy before it became apparent Maria was . big, I thought it might be something to do with me eating too much. But I . think the big baby thing must come from my side of the family. 'My mum Vivien weighed 12lbs when she was born and my uncle George was even bigger. Quite a handful: Maxine, pictured holding her daughter with husband Jaime at Hospital De Denia, said the majority of her family were born big babies . Brave: Maxime Marin, pictured centre with her husband (third from left) and family, did not use an epidural . 'All three of my boys have been born big, from nearly 8lbs to more than 10lbs, although they're all normal-size now. 'I don't know why. I've got absolutely no clue. All I know is that the clothes and the nappies I've bought are going to be too small because I've given birth to a baby who needs a clothes size three to six months straight away.' Maxine, who is also mother to Steffan, 22, Dale, 16, and Callum, 13, is expected to leave hospital later today. Her new daughter is due to remain in a neo-natal observation unit but only as a precaution because large babies sometimes experience breathing problems. She said: 'I called her Maria Lorena because Jaime's mum is Maria and I've got a south African work colleague called Lauren - Lorena in Spanish - who's stunningly beautiful. 'I told her I wanted to name my daughter after her because that's the way I'd like her to be when she grows up, with her looks and her character. 'I think the hospital staff are just proud to be able to say the only baby to be born naturally in Spain over four kilos has been born in their hospital.' Javier Rius, Head of Gynaecology at Denia's Marina Salud Hospital, added: 'In 40 years professional practice I've never known a case of a baby with this weight being born naturally. 'We are very happy with the work we've done,' he added.

"By . Dan Bloom . California's drought could last years longer and cost the state $2.2billion, scientists have warned. They say the devastating drought, one of the worst ever recorded, probably won't finish until the end of next year at the earliest and has already cost 17,100 farm jobs. The stark warning comes after residents increased their water use this year - despite $500-a-day fines being approved yesterday. And things could get worse still, as the experts warned the state's groundwater reserves are fast being used up. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: A patch of artificial turf next to a dead lawn in San Francisco, California. The stricken state's drought could last years longer and cost $2.2billion, scientists have warned - including 17,100 jobs . Fallout: The conditions make fires more likely and could get worse as groundwater reserves are sucked dry . The study by the University of California, Davis, found the catastrophic three-year drought is responsible for the greatest water . loss ever seen in California's agriculture. River levels are being replaced by pumping in groundwater at twice the normal rate in some areas - which could cause a crisis in itself. Wells in the Tulare Basin north west of Los Angeles are already in danger of running dry soon and many more could follow. Report author Richard Howitt slammed the state's lack of groundwater checks as a 'slow-moving train wreck', warning reserves underground are being used like an 'unlimited savings account'. He said: 'The problem is that California is [in a position] almost uniquely in the western states of not measuring our groundwater. No food: A horse in a field in Woodacre, California. Worst-hit areas are losing more than half their fallow crops . 'So . we're like somebody who's so rich they don't have to balance our . checkbook. We're walking around signing checks and not even balancing . the checkbook because we still think we are in a groundwater-rich era.' California is the only state without a framework for groundwater management, the report said. The researchers added: 'If the drought continues for two more . years, groundwater reserves will continue to be used to replace surface . water losses. RESERVOIR NAME - % full (July average) EXCHEQUER - 24% (36%) PINE FLAT - 25% (40%) SAN LUIS - 27% (40%) NEW MELONES - 28% (45%) SHASTA - 38% (50%) LAKE OROVILLE - 39% (50%) Source: Department of Water Resources . 'Pumping ability will slowly decrease, . while costs and losses will slowly increase due to groundwater . depletion.' The report claimed this year alone, drought has cost California's agriculture 3 per cent of its entire value. This equates to $1.5billion - $1billion in lost income and and $0.5billion in pumping costs. Once industries that depend on farming are taken into account, this rises to $2.2 billion across the state. One in 20 of the state's crop fields - 428,000 acres - have been ruined in the worst-hit Central Valley as well as Central Coast and Southern California. The study added the drought is 'likely to continue through 2015', despite the possible effects of the El Niño weather system. But the factor hitting people worst on the ground is the loss of jobs. Around 17,100 have disappeared, 3.8 per cent of all farm unemployment, according to the report. Mr Howitt, a professor emeritus of farming economics, added: 'These . are mostly seasonal jobs but they're seasonal and full-time, and . they're from a sector of the population who have the least ability to . roll with the punches.' Running out: Current water levels in California's main reservoirs, with the central area the worst-hit . Desolate: With the drought now in its third year, farmhouses are surrounded by brown, barren hills . Ranchers have begun selling their livestock in droves to ranchers in the northwestern states of the U.S. The report was partly funded by the state's agriculture and water resources departments, and was . released just hours before state regulators considered rolling out . tighter-still rules on water use. It used computer models, satellite . data from Nasa and the latest estimates of the State Water . Project, federal Central Valley Project and local water deliveries and . groundwater pumping capacities. 'The 2014 drought is responsible for . the greatest absolute reduction in water availability for California . agriculture ever seen,' read the report. Crisis: California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency last January . 'These results...underscore . California's heavy reliance on groundwater to cope with droughts. Without replenishing groundwater in wet years, water tables fall and . both reduce regional pumping capacity and increase pumping energy . costs.' Democratic Governor Jerry Brown . declared the state's drought to be an emergency last January. The state has already put millions towards stricken communities and eased . protections for endangered fish to allow pumping from the fragile San . Joaquin-Sacramento River delta. Despite the moves, some areas are seeing more than half their crops die. Ranchers have begun selling their livestock in droves to ranchers in the . northwestern states of the U.S. Most of the 17,100 lost jobs, including . seasonal and part-time agriculture work, are in the San Joaquin Valley. Karen Ross, Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said residents had to 'develop an ethic of conservation'. They must 'embrace recycling of water, capturing stormwater [and] investing in storage, whether its above ground or below ground,' she said. Jay Lund, director of the university's Center for Watershed Sciences, added: 'All the climate change . studies that we've done, we don't see catastrophe if we manage it well, . but we do see inconvenience and we do see costs.' California produces nearly half of . U.S.-grown fruits, nuts and vegetables and nearly a quarter of the . nation’s milk and cream. Across the nation, consumers regularly buy . several crops grown almost entirely in California, including tomatoes, . carrots, broccoli, almonds, walnuts, grapes, olives and figs. Poignant: The grass has even died in the Presidio National Cemetery, San Francisco. California produces nearly half of U.S.-grown fruits, nuts and vegetables and nearly a quarter of the nation¿s milk and cream. Shock: Some residents have continued using their sprinklers despite the threat of $500-a-day fines . But despite the devastation, the report said consumer food prices will be largely unaffected. Higher prices of high-value California crops like nuts, wine grapes and . dairy foods are driven more by market demand than by the drought, it said. 'California’s agricultural economy overall is doing remarkably well, thanks mostly to groundwater reserves,' said Jay Lund, a co-author of the study and director of the university’s Center for Watershed Sciences. 'But we expect substantial local and regional economic and employment impacts. We need to treat that groundwater well so it will be there for future droughts.'","Stark warning issued by experts at the University of California, Davis .

"By . Dan Bloom . It has been a mad month for Silicon Valley's sex workers. They were already in the spotlight after one of their most popular directories shut down. Now, a fellow worker is accused of injecting a Google executive with a fatal heroin hit. But as the media descend on San Francisco, the most prominent insist Forrest Hayes' overdose does not reflect their industry, which remains booming as California floods with tech workers. Scroll down for video . Media focus has turned to Silicon Valley's sex workers after Google executive Forrest Hayes died of an overdose. In one interview, with CNN, Maxine Holloway said it unfairly 'casts a shadow on the sex industry' Thousands of prostitutes work in San Francisco, San Jose and the surrounding area, saying the relentless . hours and high pay of young entrepreneurs makes them ideal clients. Many sex workers are as tech-savvy - and as rich - as their clients. With the highest earners claiming they can pull in $500 an hour, they advertise and campaign for their rights through Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, podcasts and even a newspaper column. And fading are the days of standing on street corners, as a new clutch of mobile apps makes the industry more discreet. Sex worker and activist Maxine Holloway told CNN she sees tech industry workers at least once a week. Influx: Siouxsie Q has seen a steady increase in tech clients in the San Francisco Bay . 'They're working really long, intense . hours which is giving them that disposable income but along with that . lifestyle it doesn't always leave room for traditional dating,' she said. 'So this mutually beneficial relationship with professional providers seems to work out really well. In the last six months business has been really good.' Siouxsie Q, a sex worker who has more than 3,000 Twitter followers and runs a podcast called Whorecast, added to USA Today: 'I continue to see an increase in the amount of technology clients I see here in the Bay Area.' The 28-year-old's website includes comic book-style illustrations, a blog and slogans including 'Winter is Coming' and 'Legion of Honor'. She compared the influx of tech workers to the Gold Rush, saying: 'Anytime you have a lot of young men coming West to seek their fortunes, the sex worker industry responds.' But despite many workers being proud of their work when they're on the web, it remains illegal in California, and many of the bloggers and Tweeters use assumed names. San Francisco's police forces were . called to 269 incidents of prostitution, soliciting or pimping last year, almost all of which . ended in an arrest, according to data published by the City and County . of San Francisco. The most prominent are now speaking out after incidents which they say pose a threat to their work. Dominating the headlines are the allegations faced by 26-year-old Alix Tichelman. She is accused of injecting Google executive Hayes with a fatal dose of heroin before casually stepping over his body and leaving his 50ft yacht Escape in November. Police said Tichelman, who was due to answer manslaughter, drug and prostitution charges today at the Santa Cruz County Superior Court, had many clients in Silicon Valley. Tumultuous time: Alix Tichelman, 26 (right) appeared in court in Santa Cruz on manslaughter charges over the death of Google executive Forrest Hayes (left). It has put the spotlight on what some say is a booming industry . She is also now being re-investigated over the overdose death of her former . boyfriend Dean Riopelle. Speaking to CNN, which first documented the rise of sex workers in Silicon Valley last year, Ms Holloway said Hayes' death was bad for everyone in the industry. 'We think it's a really unfortunate . situation and it definitely casts a shadow on the sex industry,' she said. 'I do . worry that people are going to think this is something that's normal and . happens very often, but in reality it doesn't.' The other threat is the sudden closure of MyRedBook, an online directory with prostitutes said was a vital tool to keep them safe. Last month the FBI shut down the escort site and a grand jury indicted its two alleged operators on charges including facilitating prostitution and money laundering. Stark: Visitors to MyRedBook.com are now met with a warning after it was shut down by the FBI . Visitors to the site - which once included 'reviews' of prostitutes and a reference check system for clients which blacklisted predators - are now met with a message which alleges the FBI has 'cause to believe that this domain name was involved in money laundering derived from racketeering based on prostitution'. In an angry blog post on the topic, Siouxsie Q wrote: 'Last month, thousands of Californians lost their jobs overnight. On June 25, I began getting frantic phone calls from friends and colleagues about the shutdown of the sex work advertising platform, MyRedbook.com. 'The loss of the website rocked the sex worker community in a way I had not yet seen in my career. Some began referring to it as ""Hooker-pocalypse."" 'With the end of the month fast approaching, sex workers had tuition, rent, and bills to pay, and many are still fearful that the shutdown of MyRedbook will be financially devastating for them.' One worker, Patricia West, told SFGate: . 'Right now, everyone I know is noticing a pretty solid down-tick in how . many new clients are contacting them because they're scared. 'I . have the privilege to be able to turn down clients. I'm not desperate . for money. But a lot of people don't have that ability and maybe have to . see more dangerous clients.' Despite many workers insisting they are not victims, attitudes are shifting in some quarters to seeing sex workers in the same bracket as, for example, victims of human trafficking. In San Mateo, part of the Bay Area, police announced two weeks ago that they would stop treating sex workers as criminals. Police Chief Susan Manheimer said: 'They are no longer considered suspects. We treat them as victims who require services, and really bring in victims’ advocates for them to build up some level of trust.'","Area has been in the spotlight again after death of 51-year-old Forrest Hayes .

"By . Associated Press . and Dan Bloom . Surprise! Drivers were showered in 3,000 ping-pong balls on Interstate 15 in Idaho . Freeway drivers were showered in ping-pong balls when a pilot dropped 3,000 on the highway by mistake. The balls were meant to be dropped on a crowd for the grand finale of a two-day city pride fair in Blackfoot, Idaho, and could be exchanged for prizes worth up to $100. But the pilot who was tasked to make the drop overestimated their momentum - prompting what was described as a dangerous scramble by revellers as they ran out into the road. Organizers immediately called off the contest on Saturday night, which was the final event for Blackfoot Pride Days. The city of 12,000 people had put on a string of events to celebrate local pride, including a greased watermelon contest and cheap tours around the Idaho Potato Museum. But attendees had to be instructed not to run onto the highway with the promise that the prizes would be handed out despite the mishap. One resident, Sarah Taylor, told the Idaho State Journal: 'It was ridiculous. Kids and adults were actually running out on the freeway to get the balls.' She . added: 'You could hear them popping as people ran over them. People . needed to realize that's a dangerous situation. I'm glad nobody got hit . and there was no accidents.' The ping-pong ball drop had taken place for more than a decade and most of the balls were redeemable for small prizes including sweets. The highest-ranking ones could be swapped for $100 gift certificates. Aaron Moon, an organiser of the event, said a new pilot attempted the drop this year and misunderstood how the balls would fall. Dangerous: Children and adults reportedly ran into the road to retrieve hundreds of the balls . Instead of being carried by the momentum of the plane or blown in the wind they lost speed and dropped down together, he said. The day was not a complete write-off, however - it also included free fishing, a 'safety fair' and free potatoes for all. Blackfoot Police Chief Kurt Asmus told the Journal no charges would be filed, but police plan to work with the organizers more closely next year.","Aerial drop was the grand finale of Pride Days in city of Blackfoot, Idaho .

"By . Dan Bloom . A priest who was jailed for killing a 23-year-old nun in a botched exorcism has been chased out of his village and forced to live in a remote forest hut. Father Daniel Corogeanu, 33, left Sister Irina Cornici bound, gagged, strapped to a cross and without food or water for five . days at an isolated monastery in Romania. Corogeanu, whose crime inspired a Cannes prize-winning film, was jailed for seven years in 2005 and vowed to build a monastery in her memory when he was released. But when he arrived at the site of his proposed centre, the eastern commune of Zapodeni, furious villagers reportedly chased him into hiding. Scroll down for video . Hounded out: Father Daniel Corogeanu (right), pictured praying after the botched exorcism ritual which killed Sister Irina Cornici (foreground) has been chased out of a Romanian village and forced to live in a remote hut . Horror: Daniel Corogeanu, whose crime inspired a Cannes prize-winning film, holding a holy book and surrounded by nuns at the Tanacu Monastery a day after Irina Cornici died in an exorcism ritual . A local council official said the priest has now set up home in a wooden hut in the forest, which he refuses to leave. Corogeanu was jailed in 2005 along with four other . nuns who helped him with the ritual at the Tanacu monastery in eastern Romania. They said they were just trying to help Cornici but a court in the northeast city of Vaslui convicted the priest and nuns of holding her captive, resulting in her death. Nun Nicoleta Arcalianu was sentenced to eight years in prison, and the other three - Adina Cepraga, Elena Otel and Simona Bardanas - received five-year sentences. Dozens of Corogeanu's supporters packed the courtroom and prayed at the time of his conviction . Dozens of Corogeanu's supporters packed the courtroom and prayed for the priest, with several bursting into tears when the verdict was announced. Romania's Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Corogeanu against his conviction. The crime was a national scandal for the Romanian Orthodox Church, which excommunicated the priest and promised reforms, including psychological tests for those seeking to enter monasteries. But the outcome of the case is still shrouded in mystery and doubt, despite the conviction. There are allegations that the court had not properly considered the . suggestion that the nun might have died from an adrenaline overdose . injected by paramedics. Coroner . Dan Gheorghiu admitted recently that the was some credence to the theory, . saying: 'I was part of the team who handled the exhumation of the nun's . body. 'It was concluded that the woman died of an overdose of adrenaline. Don't ask me, I don't know why the judges did not take that into . account.' It also emerged after her death that . Cornici had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and her 'possession' was . unlikely to be more than a series of schizophrenic episodes. At . the time Father Corogeanu told the court: 'I consider myself not guilty because Irina Conrici's death was . not down to the fact that we kept her locked up. 'We tied her up because . she kept hitting and harming herself and we would have found her dead in . her room eventually. 'I . admit I tied her up and stuck a towel in her mouth and kept her like . this for five days. 'I admit that I used to cover her mouth with tape . while she took part in daily mass, but only because I did not want her . to disturb the service. Corogeanu, who was jailed for seven years in 2005, said he was just trying to help Cornici but a court in the northeast city of Vaslui convicted the priest and four nuns of holding her captive, resulting in her death . Media attention: The current fate of the former Orthodox priest has been widely reported in his native Romania . 'Four . nuns helped me tie her up and guarded Irina for days. They tried to . give her food and water but she refused. All she accepted was holy . water. This was the best solution for her because she had to recover . from her constant agitation.' He added: 'Had I not . called the ambulance, she would have been well now. It was the last . stage of her exorcism and it is normal that a person possessed by demons . faints when all the prayers end. She was supposed to recover after . that.' The death inspired the screenplay for . the film Beyond the Hills, a Cannes and Palme d'Or award winning film by . Romanian director Cristian Mungiu. In 1999 the Vatican issued its first new guidelines since 1614 for driving out devils, which urged priests to take modern psychiatry into account in deciding who should be exorcised. And earlier this month the Papacy gave its blessing to exorcisms as a standard practice in the Catholic Church. Pope Francis has emphasised that Satan exists and was previously thought to support exorcisms. Last year he appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair bound man who said he was possessed by the devil.","Father Daniel Corogeanu was jailed for seven years after ritual killed nun, 23 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Climate change is making Antarctic seals more genetically diverse, according to new research. Scientists found because food is getting scarcer, pups are born smaller and those that survive are breeding later. However, female seals with less diverse genes are breeding more and their pups are less likely to survive in the changing environment. Climate change is making Antarctic seals (stock image pictured) more genetically diverse, claims study Scientists found because food is getting scarcer, pups are born smaller and those that survive are breeding later. And, female seals with less diverse genes are breeding more and their pups are less likely to survive . A genetic analysis found Antarctic fur seals have dramatically altered in shape because of the drop in availability of tiny krill which they feast on. The researchers looked at data . going back to 1981 to assess changes over generations of female fur . seals on South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. Females who did . survive to motherhood were likely to be more genetically diverse - a . condition known scientifically as ‘heterozygous’ and linked with higher . fitness in many species. But their pups will only have the same advantage if they too are heterozygous - a characteristic not inherited. It depends on which male the female mates with and so arises mostly through chance. So, many seals are born not heterozygous and are so less able to cope with the changing environment. Krill rely on the plankton which grows on the shrinking sea ice. Dr Jaume Forcada, of the British Antarctic Survey, said: ‘Compared with 20 years ago, we can see female fur seals are now born with a lower weight. 'Those that survive and return to breed tend to be the bigger ones and they have their first pup later in life than they used to. ‘Such changes are typically associated with food stress.’ Decades of data collected at South Georgia show how changes in the seal population have occurred over time with changes in krill availability. Even if krill is very abundant, environmental variation determines its availability in the seals’ feeding grounds, claim the researchers. The researchers looked at data going back to 1981 to assess changes over generations of female fur seals. Females who did survive to motherhood were likely to be more genetically diverse and linked with higher fitness. But their pups only have the same advantage if they too have these genes . ‘This environmental variation is driven by the climate which impacts local atmospheric, sea ice and oceanographic conditions.’ Environmental change is expected to affect many species and biological systems throughout the world so the study, published in Nature, could have relevance for other threatened creatures. Dr Joe Hoffman, of Bielefeld University in Germany, said: ‘We found over the last two decades the proportion of breeding females highly heterozygous has increased as these individuals are more likely to survive the changing conditions. ‘However in this case the seals do not appear to be evolving because surviving females do not pass their high heterozygosity on to their offspring. ‘Therefore - with each new generation - the process of selection has to start all over again with only those individuals that happen to be born more heterozygous having a good chance of survival. ‘As the climate continues to change many fur seal pups are not surviving to adulthood and the population is declining.’","Scientists found because food is getting scarcer, pups are born smaller and those that survive are breeding later .

"By . Simon Walters . Dramatic: The chances of Britain leaving the EU rose last night after it emerged that one of David Cameron's closest Cabinet allies Michael Gove, pictured,  believes it is time to tell Brussels 'We are ready to quit' The chances of Britain leaving the EU rose dramatically last night after it emerged that one of David Cameron’s closest Cabinet allies believes it is time to tell Brussels bluntly: ‘We are ready to quit.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove has told friends that, if there was a referendum today on whether the UK should cut its ties with Brussels, he would vote to leave. He wants Britain to give other EU nations an ultimatum: ‘Give us back our sovereignty or we will walk out.’ Mr Gove insists the UK could thrive as a free trading nation on its own, like other non-EU nations in Europe such as Norway and Switzerland. He has changed his view partly as a result of his fury at Brussels meddling which has held up his school reforms. Mr Gove, one of the Prime Minister’s closest confidants, has discussed his views in detail with Mr Cameron. In an anti-EU pincer movement by the two Tory allies, Mr Cameron will formally announce later this month the first major step towards grabbing back powers from Brussels. He will set out in detail how he plans to withdraw Britain from EU justice ties, but he will then ‘cherry pick’ which aspects of Anglo-EU legal co-operation he believes are in British interests. These could include the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), access to police databases, prisoner transfers and co-operation over drugs trafficking and money laundering. The disclosures are the latest evidence of a turning point in Britain’s relationship with the EU, which is currently gripped by the euro crisis. Mr Cameron has struck an increasingly tough stance. He won plaudits for vetoing changes in the EU Treaty, has edged closer to pledging an ‘In or Out’ referendum, and suggested Brussels should have two budgets, one for eurozone nations and another for non-eurozone nations such as the UK. Mr Gove, backed by Eurosceptic Ministers including Welfare Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, wants Mr Cameron to go even further. A well-placed source said: ‘Countless British Prime Ministers have said they want to reclaim powers over justice, fishing, employment, health and safety and other matters from the EU. ‘But when people like John Humphrys and Adam Boulton say to them, “What if they refuse? Have you got the courage to tell them you are packing your bags and leaving?” they always reply feebly, “Er, no, we won’t.” Wants out: Mr Gove has told friends that, if there was a referendum today on whether the UK should cut its ties with Brussels, he would vote to leave . ‘Michael thinks it is about time we spelled it out, in simple words that even Brussels bureaucrats can understand, that we won’t tolerate this any longer. We have to tell them if they don’t return some of the important powers they have snaffled from us, we will leave. We have nothing to be scared of and he wants them to know that. ‘We are a major trading nation and that gives us considerable bargaining power with the EU whether we leave – or stay in.’ Last night, Tory grandee Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons Public Administration Committee and a long-time EU critic, said: ‘The significance of the change in Michael Gove’s attitude cannot be overstated. ‘No one is closer to David Cameron and Michael clearly now agrees with people like  me who have been arguing for years that we should be prepared to leave the EU if  they do not agree to a substantial renegotiation of our terms of membership.’ Mr Gove’s view on Europe has changed so dramatically that he has spoken admiringly of arch Tory Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash. For years, Mr Cash has been derided by mainstream Conservatives as an extremist. But Mr Gove observed: ‘Maybe Bill Cash was right all along.’ Getting tough: Mr Gove, one of the Prime Minister's closest confidants, has discussed his views in detail with Mr Cameron, pictured . The Education Secretary is among a number of Tory Ministers who say they have been shocked to discover the extent of Brussels’ power to interfere in UK legislation. Officials say several aspects of Mr Gove’s school reforms have been ‘disrupted’ by the  EU and the European Court of Human Rights. They claim his plan to make it easier for the bosses of failing schools to get rid of sub-standard teachers have been affected by an EU anti-sacking law. Mr Gove has also been told moves to give teachers greater power to discipline pupils could fall foul of the ECHR. And plans to streamline the process for building new schools and classrooms have been delayed by complex EU laws on procurement which are said to be ‘pro big business’, making it impossible for local building firms to win contracts. The increasingly Eurosceptic mood of Mr Cameron and fellow senior Ministers is certain to place further strains on relations with pro-EU Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Cynics will say it also reflects the electoral threat to the  Tories posed by the fiercely anti-EU UKIP. More than 100 Tory MPs this year called on Mr Cameron to take Britain out of the EAW, on the grounds that it infringes British sovereignty and takes little account of widely varying standards of procedural fairness across Europe. By withdrawing from EU justice ties, Mr Cameron will have to exempt the UK from all 130 arrangements with Brussels that concern home affairs. Downing Street will then negotiate over which measures to opt back into – and on terms more acceptable to Eurosceptic backbenchers.","Education Secretary has .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Households are throwing away a million tons of untouched food each year, figures show. This means around one quarter of our ‘avoidable’ food waste has not even been opened after it was bought. Confusion over best-before labelling, ‘buy one get one free’ supermarket offers and the decline of basic cooking skills are all blamed for the ‘quite staggering’ figures from by the Government’s waste advisory body. Experts also warn that we are victims . of a culture in which we feel we haven’t provided properly for our . family unless they leave some food on their plate. The . figures, compiled by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) from two studies involving almost 3,000 households around the UK, show . that Britons throw away 7million tons of food waste a year. While . some of this, such as bones, shells and tea bags, is unavoidable, some . 4.2million tons is ‘avoidable waste’ – food that could have been eaten. This is enough to provide six meals a week for the average family – and . save them £700 a year. Shockingly, a quarter of this needless waste is thrown away whole or in unopened packaging. Potatoes make up almost a quarter of this untouched food waste, with some 230,000 tons going straight in the bin. To blame: Offers in supermarkets such as 'buy one get one free' and a decline of cooking skills are behind the rising food waste mountain . Salads in unopened bags and other . fresh vegetables account for 260,000 tons and unwrapped and whole fresh . fruit some 240,000 tons. Some 10,000 tons of apples, 46,000 tons of carrots and one in every ten bananas are thrown away untouched. The . research also shows that more than 60 per cent of the tomatoes and . mushrooms that are binned are still whole. The report comes after a . study by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers last year concluded . that up to half of the food we buy from supermarkets goes in the bin. Experts . at the institution said that with the shift away from small shops to . large-scale supermarkets, we have lost the sense of value of food. And just last month, several EU countries blamed confusion over best-before dates for millions of tons of food waste a year. Unlike . use-by dates, which are used to denote the safety of meat and other . foods that spoil quickly, best-before dates are usually just a mark of . food quality such as flavour and texture. Family pressure: Experts also warn that we are victims of a culture in which we feel we haven't provided properly for our family unless they leave some food on their plate . But it means that dried pasta, flour, tinned goods and other  products with a long shelf life are being binned unnecessarily. Wrap found that almost half of the 4.2million tons of avoidable waste was binned because it was ‘not used  in time’. Other reasons given for binning food include people cooking too much. Sue Baic, of the British Dietetic Association, said that she is ‘always amazed’ at how people struggle to turn leftovers into a meal. Supermarket ‘buy one, get one free’ offers are also blamed as they tempt shoppers into buying more than they need. Colin Brown, one of the authors last year’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers report, said such offers lead to food being binned because people find eating the same thing monotonous. Emma Marsh, a food waste prevention manager at Wrap, described the figures as ‘quite staggering’. She said: ‘We all have our own reason for why food gets thrown away at home, so there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. ‘We want to be able to get people to look at the huge volume of food and drink that’s ending up in the bin and consider one thing they might do differently to make sure food gets tasted, not wasted.’","Britons throw away 7million tons of food waste every year .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Never mind being too tired or too busy – it seems millions of women are put off sport simply because they cannot find a suitable bra. Almost one in five British women said they suffered pain or embarrassment caused by their breasts when exercising. This discomfort was a bigger deterrent than the cost of exercise, lack of access to facilities or not having anyone to exercise with – and many blamed the problem on being unable to find the right sports bra. Bra: Millions of women are put off sport simply because they cannot find a suitable bra . Researchers at the University of Portsmouth, who carried out the survey, urged women to get their sports bras professionally fitted and said schools should educate girls about the importance of wearing them. It follows a call from the head of Sport England for schools to put hairdryers in changing rooms to prevent image-conscious girls being put off PE. Latest figures show girls in the UK are the fattest in Europe, with almost a third of under-20s classed as overweight or obese. Uncomfortable: Having the wrong sports bra, was a bigger deterrent than the cost of exercise, lack of access to facilities or not having anyone to exercise with . They are also among the least active, with only 6 per cent doing the recommended five sessions of exercise a week, and there are fears they will become the first generation to die at an earlier age than their parents. Previous research has shown more women wear a fashion bra when exercising than a sports bra, which can provide extra support and limit embarrassing and uncomfortable movement. In the latest study, some 239 women aged 18 to 64 answered dozens of questions about their exercise habits, including how much sport they did and what put them off taking part. Lack of energy or motivation was the top reason, followed by lack of time and then health issues. But concerns about breasts, including pain and embarrassment, came in at fourth place, ahead of cost issues and lack of facilities. In all, 17 per cent of the women surveyed said problems caused by their breasts put them off sport, the Journal of Physical Activity and Health reports. Researcher Emma Burnett said something as simple as a well-fitting sports bra could lead to women doing more exercise. She added: ‘We had plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest breasts are a barrier to exercise but this is the first study to provide evidence that they are affecting women’s participation in sport.’","Millions of women are put off sport because they cannot find a suitable bra .

"By . Fiona Macrae . It is something all good map readers have long suspected - sat-navs dull the mind. A study found the brain is less active when we blindly follow directions than when we try to work out the route ourselves, causing regions thought to be key to navigation to become particularly quiet. The finding, which will be seized upon by those who have been ridiculed for refusing to abandon their ‘old-fashioned’ road maps and A-Zs, comes from a University College London study into how we navigate. A study found the brain is less active when we blindly follow directions such as from a sat-nav (pictured) than when we try to work out the route ourselves, causing regions thought to be key to navigation to become particularly quiet . Researchers began by taking a group of healthy men and women to Soho in central London and giving them a thorough tour. A detailed exam followed and confirmed that they had got to know the area well. A day later, the volunteers’ brains were scanned as they watched films of the streets they had walked around. Sometimes they were asked to navigate to a particular destination. Other times, they were shown the destination and then given directions to follow. The scans showed that two brain areas light up when navigating. The first is active at the start of a journey and seems to compute the distance as a crow flies. The second, neighbouring area, then calculates the distance as we weave and wind our way along the route, with detours and junctions sparking flurries of activity. Interestingly, when the volunteers simply followed instructions, similar to using a sat nav, the two brain regions abandoned their calculations. The researchers began by taking a group . of healthy men and women to Soho in central London and giving them a . thorough tour of the warren of bustling streets and the shops, bars and . cafes in them.

The second, neighbouring area, then calculates the distance as we weave and wind our way along the route, with detours and junctions sparking flurries of activity. Interestingly, when the volunteers simply followed instructions, similar to using a sat nav, the two brain regions abandoned their calculations. Researcher Dr Hugo Spiers said: ‘What happens to the brain when using the sat-nav is that these areas stop tracking. In an experiment, people were asked to navigate to a particular destination and when they manually had to find a location (illustrated by map reading) scans showed that two brain areas light up . ‘There is absolutely no interest in the distance to the goal.’ The brain in general was also much less active. However, Dr Spiers says this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as it frees up the mind to concentrate on other tasks. It is thought that the two navigation hubs may simply work better in those who have a good sense of direction. And despite the long-standing joke about women being worse at navigating and map-reading than men, the study didn’t find any differences between the sexes. The topic will be the subject of ‘intensive’ further research. The scans revealed two brain areas light up when navigating. The first is active at the start of a journey and computes the distance as a crow flies. The second area calculates the distance as people weave along the route, with detours and junctions sparking flurries of activity. A stock image of an MRI scan is pictured . The research, detailed in the journal Current Biology, could help shed light on dementia. Alzheimer’s patients often become disorientated and the two brain regions identified – the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus – are among the first to be attacked by the disease. Dr John Williams, of the Wellcome Trust, which funded the research, said: ‘These results provide some explanation as to why such patients struggle to find their way and become lost. ‘Combining these findings with clinical work could enable medical benefits in the future.’","Researchers began by taking a group of men and women to London .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Fish oils could hold the key to saving pensioners’ sight. Omega-3 fatty acids, abundant in oily fish, help stop tiny blood vessels from bleeding into the back of the eye, experiments show. The finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight, including many cases of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in the elderly. The finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight (File photo) AMD affects more than 600,000 Britons and the number is expected to treble in the next 25 years as the population ages.  There are few treatments – and no cure – for the condition. The research, from Harvard Medical School, focused on ‘wet AMD’, the most serious form, in which central vision can be lost within months. In the study, a diet rich in omega-3 cut damage to the blood vessels in mice with an AMD-like eye disease. The healthy fats, which are found in mackerel, trout, herring, sardines, tuna and salmon, stopped damaging immune cells from fuelling the disease, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Researcher Dr Kip Connor said the fats seems to have a ‘vital role’ in eye health. It is not clear if fish oil supplements alone will be enough help save sight in people.  This is because the body may find it harder to process and make use of omega-3 as we age. AMD affects more than 600,000 Britons and the number is expected to treble in the next 25 years as the population ages.  There are few treatments ¿ and no cure ¿ for the condition . However, the findings do point to a drug related to fish oil. With existing drugs expensive, injected directly into the eye and not effective in all cases, the researchers said that there is an urgent need for new treatments. Dr Connor said that given the prevalence of AMD and a related form of blindness in diabetics, the ‘potential impact of this study is highly significant’. Patients with other diseases fed by rogue blood vessels, such as cancer, may also benefit from the knowledge. Dr Connor added: ‘It is our hope that future studies will allow us to develop specific therapeutics that harness this knowledge, resulting in greater visual outcome and quality of life for patients suffering from these sight-threatening diseases.’ In the meantime, he advises that everyone eat oily fish or take omega-3 supplements for all-round health. Omega-3 has previously been credited with health benefits form keeping high blood pressure at bay to helping ward of Alzheimer’s disease.","Damage to retinal blood can lead to age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly .

The respected Mayo Clinic in the US says that while many people sleep peacefully with their pet curled up beside them, some are left so exhausted that they seek specialist help. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota have warned that growing numbers of people are being kept awake at night by their pets. The clinic says that while many people sleep peacefully with their pet curled up beside them, some are left so exhausted that they seek specialist help (stock image shown) Snoring dogs, squawking parrots, wandering kittens, sick pets and animals with weak bladders are all disturbing vital shut-eye. Pet owners have long fought like cats and dogs about whether felines or canines make the best furry companions. But a study last week claimed that cat owners are smarter than dog owners - regardless of their pet's intelligence. The research revealed that the owners of the two animals tend to have different personalities - with cat lovers being more sensitive and open-minded than dog lovers who are largely energetic. And in the study by Carroll University, Wisconsin the researchers also found that cat owners scored more highly on an intelligence test than dog owners. Pampered pooches may be a problem, as well as more people owning more than one pet. Some 10 per cent of pet-owners who attended the clinic’s sleep centre in 2013 partly blamed their animals for their problems. This is up from just 1 per cent in 2002, a sleep conference heard. The study’s author, Dr Lois Krahn, a psychiatrist, said: ‘The study determined that while the majority of patients did not view their pets intolerably disturbing their sleep, a higher percentage of patients experienced irritation. ‘This may be related to the larger number of households with multiple pets. ‘When people have these kinds of problems, sleep specialists should ask about companion animals and help patients think about ways to optimise their sleep.’ Dogs, cats and birds were the most popular pets and kept their owners awake by snoring, whimpering and wandering. Medical needs and the need to go outside were also problematic. In some cases, pets acted as living alarm clocks. Dr Krahn said: ‘One patient owned a parrot who consistently squawked at 6am. ‘He must have thought he was a rooster.’ Snoring dogs, squawking parrots (stock image shown), wandering kittens, sick pets and animals with weak bladders have all been blamed for disturbing vital shut-eye.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The Earth’s magnetic field, which protects the planet from cosmic radiation, has grown weaker over the past six months. Data collected by the European Space Agency’s Swarm satellites has indicated weak spots in the magnetic field. The first set of high-resolution images generated from the constellation reveals dramatic declines over the Western Hemisphere. The Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from solar radiation, has grown weaker over the past six months, according to satellite data. This map shows the filed from January to June. Shades of red represent areas of strengthening, while blues show areas of weakening over the 6-month period . Constellation: Swarm is a constellation of thee identical satellites, measuring the Earth's magnetic field. Launched: November 2013 . Orbit: Two satellites orbit side-by-side, initially at an altitude of 285miles (460km) moving to 186miles (300km) while the third one operates at 330miles (530km). Mission life: Four years . Satellites: Each satellite weighs 1,043lbs (473kg) at launch and is 29ft (9m) long, 4ft (1.5m) wide and 2ft (85cm) high. Instruments: Vector field magnetometer, electric field instrument, accelerometer, GPS receiver, startrackers and laser retroreflector . Mission control: Esa's European Satellite Operations Centre (SECOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. However, the field has strengthened in other areas since January, including over the southern Indian Ocean. Scientists are unsure why the magnetic field is weakening, but one reason could be that the magnetic poles are preparing to flip, Swarm mission manager Rune Floberghagen told Live Science. The latest measurements, made by magnetometers on board the three Swarm satellites confirm the movement of magnetic North towards Siberia. ‘Such a flip is not instantaneous, it would take many hundreds if not a few thousand years. 'They have happened many times in the past,’ he said. Swarm (pictured) is Esa's first Earth observation constellation of satellites. Two satellites orbit almost side-by-side at the same altitude - initially at about 460km - while the third satellite is in a higher orbit of 530km . Changes in the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field are normal, but satellites have shown that it is weakening more rapidly than in the past. Scientists have previously estimated that the Earth’s magnetic field is weakening at five per cent every century, but now they believe it could be diminishing 10 times as fast. This means that the flip could occur sooner than the 2,000 years already predicted, according to experts who presented their findings at the Third Swarm Science Meeting in Denmark. Scientists are not sure why the magnetic field is weakening, but one reason could be that the magnetic poles are about to flip. The magnetic field and electric currents near Earth (pictured) generate complex forces, but exactly how it is generated and why it changes is not yet fully understood . Esa’s satellites pick up signals from the magnetic field as well as other sources, which could help scientists solve the mystery of why the planet’s magnetic field behaves as it does. ‘Over the coming months, scientists will analyse the data to unravel the magnetic contributions from other sources, namely the mantle, crust, oceans, ionosphere and magnetosphere,’ ESA said. ‘This will provide new insight into many natural processes, from those occurring deep inside our planet to space weather triggered by solar activity. In turn, this information will yield a better understanding of why the magnetic field is weakening.’ There is no evidence to suggest that a weakened magnetic field will mark the end of life on Earth as we know it. During previous flips, there are no records of mass extinctions or evidence of radiation damage. But as with the threat of space weather, scientists think that power grids and modern communication systems would be most at risk. This is a snapshot of the main magnetic field at Earth's surface as of June 2014, based on Swarm data. The measurements are dominated by the magnetic contribution from Earth's core (about 95%) while the contributions from other sources (the mantle, crust, oceans, ionosphere and magnetosphere) make up the rest. Red represents areas where the magnetic field is stronger, while blues show areas where it is weaker .","Data was collected by the European Space Agency's Swarm satellites .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Listening to music while battling through a work assignment or doing mind-numbing admin can be tempting. And while some people claim that music passes the time, others find it distracting. Now an app called Focus@Will claims to boost your attention span by up to 400 per cent, using ‘neuroscience-based music channels’. Tune in and out: An app called Focus@Will (pictured) claims to boost your attention span by up to 400 per cent, using 'neuroscience-based music channels' The music is designed to help people focus and ‘effortlessly zone out distractions’ as well as retain information while studying, writing and reading. Half of people listen to music while working, but it could be the ‘wrong’ music, according to the company behind the app, because songs with lyrics are designed to connect with people intellectually and emotionally – distracting them. The app has ‘attention amplifying’ music channels, which the San Francisco-based start-up says are scientifically designed ‘to engage with the brain’s limbic system. ‘This soothes the easily distracted fight or flight mechanism, increasing attention span and general focus,’ it says. The music is designed to help people focus, reduce distractions, 'effortlessly zone out distractions' and retain information while studying, writing and reading. The app is available for iPhone and Android smartphones, as well as on PCs (pictured) The firm says that trials of the app showed a 15 per cent increase in focus biomarkers 'and up to 400 per cent extended session time' It is designed to help people focus for a full 100 minutes (pictured), after which scientists think the brain needs a quick break . Focus@Will claims to reduce distractions using music. Most people can only concentrate for a maximum of 100 minutes at a time. The app claims to make it easier for someone to get in the concentration 'zone' and stay there. The company says: 'It works in works in the background by subtly soothing the part of your brain, the limbic system that is always on the lookout for danger, food, sex or shiny things'. People tend to take around 20 minutes to adjust to the environment in which they are trying to work, and tune out distractions. Each piece of music is sequenced to influence how the brain adjusts, enhances a person's focus and reduces distractions, according to the app's creators. 'Characteristics such as musical key, intensity, arrangement, speed, emotional values, recording style, and much more determine what is played where and when,' they said. The app was developed with neuroscientists, including Dr Stephen Sideroff, UCLA professor of psychology. The firm says that trials showed a 15 per cent increase in focus biomarkers ‘and up to 400 per cent extended session time’. ‘Focus@Will helps you study more efficiently and work smarter,’ it said. The firm beleives that the majority of people can only concentrate for a maximum of 100 minutes before needing a quick break.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A terminally ill woman claims NHS doctors failed to diagnose her pancreatic cancer, despite 19 appointments. Julia Rogers, 58, from Newton Abbot in Devon, said she only found out she had an inoperable pancreatic tumour after she went to a private hospital and paid £600 for a scan. NHS England has launched an inquiry to determined what happened. In September 2013, Ms Rogers went to her . GP complaining of severe back pain, which she said felt like it was . spreading to her abdomen. Julia Rogers, 58, (pictured) from Newton Abbot in Devon, said she only found out she had inoperable pancreatic cancer after she paid £600 for a scan at a private hospital . She had blood tests and was later sent for an ultrasound at Totnes Community Hospital, but nothing unusual was seen on the scan. The test was not repeated, despite Ms Rogers’ pancreas being obscured at the time because of ‘excessive bowel gas’. For the past nine months, she has experienced severe pain and visited doctors 17 times. Between . October and June Ms Rogers made two trips to Torbay Hospital’s accident . and emergency department and on one occasion was sent home with . painkillers. On June 11 Ms Rogers was told she had 'inoperable' advanced pancreatic cancer (illustrated). 'You either throw the towel in and give up or you fight and for me there is only one option,' she said . Around 8,000 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer every year, of whom fewer than four per cent are likely to live five years. It is the ninth most common cancer in the UK and tends to affect people over the age of 60. Pancreatic cancer is when a tumour starts to develop in the pancreas. It rarely causes any symptoms when it first develops, which can make it hard to diagnose. The first symptoms include: pain, unexpected weight loss and jaundice. Cancer of the pancreas is a very serious form of cancer which is both difficult to detect and treat. Surgery to remove the tumour is usually the only way to completely cure pancreatic cancer. But this is a suitable treatment for only around 15 to 20 per cent of patients. A study by Cancer Research UK recently revealed that 37 per cent of people with the disease could have saved themselves by maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking. Source: NHS Choices . She told the BBC’s Sally Mountjoy: ‘I still knew something was very wrong. ‘I could not get any of the doctors to take me seriously. 'Urgency was totally lacking. I’ve been let down and I’m devastated.’ Ms Rogers was referred to an appointment with a gastroenterologist but decided she could not wait several weeks and paid £600 to have a scan at a private hospital in Bristol. On June 11 she was told she had ‘inoperable advanced pancreatic cancer’. ‘You either throw the towel in and give up or you fight and for me there is only one option,’ she said. Ms Rogers said that since she was diagnosed, it has been a-day-by-day battle to find out when she would start chemotherapy. She was admitted to hospital over the weekend and expects to undergo treatment this week. In a statement, NHS England, on behalf of South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Torbay Hospital, Totnes Community Hospital and South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ‘We are very sorry to hear about Ms Rogers’ diagnosis and the difficulties she seems to have encountered over an extended period. ‘This clearly calls for thorough investigation on behalf of all NHS organisations involved. ‘We will be seeking an early meeting with Mrs Rogers to understand her concerns more fully.’ Dr Graham Lockerbie, the medical director for NHS England in the South West will be leading the investigation. In September 2013, Ms Rogers went to her GP complaining of severe back pain. But an ultrasound did not reveal a problem, leaving her in pain and visiting the doctors 17 times between October and June. It was not until she paid £600 for a scan at a private hospital in Bristol that she found she has inoperable pancreatic cancer. Magnified pancreatic cancer cells are pictured . Leigh Naylor (pictured) was distraught when medics revealed they had found cervical tumour, giving her nine months to live in March . A woman who claims doctors failed to diagnose her terminal cancer 16 times, raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany as she prepares to take legal action against the NHS. Leigh Naylor was distraught when medics revealed they had found cervical tumour, giving her nine months to live in March. The 32-year-old raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany, after doctors in the UK said all they could offer was a course of life-prolonging chemotherapy. After three weeks of treatment, Mrs Naylor said her tumour has shrunk and she is starting to show signs of recovery. But she has been forced to return to the UK after her money ran out, and is trying to raise a further £12,000 for each course of treatment, which she may need for the rest of her life. Mrs Naylor visited her GP with irregular bleeding in April 2009 and saw her doctor 16 times in the space of 18 months. She claims she was only given tablets to stop the bleeding. Mrs Naylor said an ultrasound scan revealed she had fibroids - non-cancerous tumours around the womb. Just three weeks after a routine operation to remove the fibroids, doctors at Leeds' St James Hospital admitted they had failed to spot a cancerous tumour, Mrs Naylor claimed. Following treatment, the 32-year-old was given the all-clear in April 2010, but in September 2012, she went back to doctors complaining of further pain. She said doctors sent her away with antibiotics. Once more, she asked for a scan and seven months of tests revealed that the cancer had returned and was inoperable. She was a given just nine months to live in March this year. Refusing to accept the outcome, Mrs Naylor raised £35,000 to travel to Marinus Clinic in Brannenburg, Germany, where she had three weeks of treatment, involving heating the body to kill cancer cells while undergoing vitamin C injections to boost her immune system. German doctors told Mrs Naylor that she is responding well to treatment and hope that the tumour will continue to shrink.","Julia Rogers, from Newton Abbot in Devon, says she attended 19 doctors' appointments before her disease was diagnosed .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scinetists have discovered that people with a mutation of the CHD8 gene have a 'very strong' likelihood of having autism (stock image) Scientists have taken a breakthrough step towards understanding exactly what causes autism. Researchers from 13 institutions around the world have discovered that people with a mutation of the CHD8 gene have a 'very strong' likelihood of having autism. The new study found the gene mutation was marked by common characteristics, including gastrointestinal disorders, a larger head and wide set eyes. It is the first time researchers have linked a definitive cause of autism to a genetic mutation, the team claim. Associate professor at the University of Washington, and lead author of the new research, Raphael Bernier, said: 'We finally got a clear cut case of an autism specific gene.’ In the study, published in Cell magazine, 6,176 children with autism spectrum disorder were anaylsed. Researchers found 15 had a CHD8 mutation and all of these children had similar characteristics in appearance. The 15 children also shared sleep disturbance and gastrointestinal problems. Professor Bernier and his team worked with scientists at Duke University who specialise in zebra fish modelling. The Duke team disrupted the CHD8 gene in the fish, and noted they developed large heads and wide set eyes. They then fed the fish fluorescent pellets and found that the fish had problems discarding food waste and were constipated. Professor Bernier said this is the first time that researchers have linked a definitive cause of autism to a genetic mutation. Although just 0.5 per cent of all children have the kind of autism related to the CHD8 mutation, he said that there are lots of implications from the study. A team of researchers disrupted the CHD8 gene in the zebra fish, (pictured) which developed large heads and wide set eyes. They then fed the fish fluorescent pellets and found that the fish had problems discarding food waste and were constipated . ‘This will be a game changer in the way scientists are researching autism,’ Professor Bernier said. The results could pave the way for a ‘genetics-first approach’ that could uncover hundreds more genetic mutations and lead to genetic testing, he explained. Genetic testing could be offered to families as a way of guiding them on what to expect and how to care for their child. Currently autism is diagnosed by doctors examining and assessing a child's behaviour. In the short term, Professor Bernier said that clinicians can pay attention to the small population with this CHD8 mutation and provide targeted treatment. Autism has already been linked to different types of genetic events. The most commonly researched genetic events associated with autism are chromosomal re-arrangements, called ‘copy number variations,’ in which a chunk of chromosome is copied or deleted. But no one rearrangement affects more than one per cent of all autism cases and there is no definitive link between the rearrangement and autism. The CHD8 gene mutation is the first gene mutation to show a ‘very strong penetrance’ – or link - to a certain subtype of autism. Scientists have developed an app that can detect signs of autism as well as a trained expert. They said in May that the software is also more accurate than medics who are not autism experts . The researchers, from Duke University, in North Carolina, believe the technology could eventually be placed in schools as a way of screening children for autism. They believe this would be particularly beneficial as it is known children with autism develop fewer symptoms if they are diagnosed early. The software works by tracking and recording infants’ activity during filmed autism screening tests. Experts currently use behavioural tests to identify autism in very young children, such as shaking a toy from side to side and seeing how long it takes for a child's attention to shift in response to the changing stimulus. The new programme provides automatic measurements of reaction times down to tenths of a second. ‘The great benefit of the video and software is for general practitioners who do not have the trained eye to look for subtle early warning signs of autism,’ said Amy Esler, an assistant professor of paediatrics and autism researcher at the University of Minnesota, who participated in some of the trials. ‘The software has the potential to automatically analyse a child's eye gaze, walking patterns or motor behaviours for signs that are distinct from typical development.","Scientists from the University of Washington discovered that people with a mutation of the CHD8 gene have a 'very strong' likelihood of having autism .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A woman whose leg grew to three times its normal size, due to a build-up of thick liquid in her thigh, is able to walk normally again after a series of operations. Annabelle Harrison, 31, has a rare condition called Lipoblastomatosis that caused a tumour to form in her left leg, causing it to balloon in size. Mrs Harrison, of Banbury in Oxfordshire, was first diagnosed with the condition when she was four years old. But after numerous operations to remove the tumour in her left leg, both her limbs are now the same size. Annabelle Harrison, 31, was diagnosed with the rare condition, Lipoblastomatosis, causing a tumour to grow in her left leg, making it balloon in size (left). Following a series of operations to remove the tumour she can finally walk normally again (right, Mrs Harrison's scar after surgery) ‘I am so happy now that I don’t have that limp. I’ve done exercises which mean I can actually bend my knee for the first time since I was a child,’ she said. Mrs Harrison’s mother first noticed her daughter’s condition when she was four years old and playing on a slide, noticing her ankle appeared to be abnormally swollen. Mrs Harrison said: ‘My mother took me to the doctors and they realised that I had a thick fluid building up in my leg.’ Experts diagnosed the child with a rare form of benign tissue tumour, called lipoblastomatosis. As the tumour spread up Mrs Harrison's left leg, doctors feared it would reach her hip and turn cancerous. ‘By the age of 18 my leg had grown to three times its normal size,’ Mrs Harrison said. The condition caused her to walk with a limp or waddle, making her a target for cruel school bullies. Mrs Harrison, of Banbury in Oxfordshire, was first diagnosed with the condition when she was four years old. By the age of 18, her left leg had grown to three times its normal size and caused the teenager to walk with a limp or waddle, for which she was bullied . She said: ‘I have always walked with a limp. I used to walk with a waddle and had problems with my back. ‘I used to get picked on because I . couldn’t run very fast with my leg. The other kids used to chase me . outside of school as they knew I wouldn’t be able to get away. ‘They called me “fat leg, thin leg.” It . was horrible but that didn’t really bother me. What really bothered me . was when they chased me, because I couldn’t run away fast enough.’ Benign lipoblastomatosis is a tumour that typically affects children. Approximately 90 per cent of cases occur before a child reaches the age of three. The tumours are typically found in a patients' limbs, head and neck as well as their torso. It is a rare condition, with around 80 per cent of cases affecting boys. The tumours usually present as a painless mass in the leg, with around 75 per cent of cases being seen on a patients' left side. The condition caused a tumour to form on Mrs Harrison's left leg, which caused it to balloon in size. Thick fluid was building up in her leg, causing it to swell. She was first diagnosed with the condition when she was four, but it has taken doctors 20 years to control. Mrs Harrison, a café worker, avoided wearing skirts and shorts, instead preferring to cover her legs with a pair of loose jogging bottoms. She said: ‘I just wanted to hide my leg. If I did wear a skirt, I needed the thickest tights I could find.’ Mrs Harrison wasn’t allowed to play sports or go roller skating while she was growing up. ‘I didn’t even learn to ride a bike until I was 15,’ she said. Mrs Harrison had had her first operation at the age of nine to combat the ever-increasing size of her leg. Initially, . doctors tried to control the condition using liposuction, but after . three failed attempts to remove the thick fluid, they tried to cut the tumour out. Ms . Harrison’s final operation took place when she was 24, when surgeons . removed a large amount of muscle from her thigh to counteract the . growth. An MRI scan showed that the tissue tumour was no longer growing and would need no more operations. Mrs . Harrison was left with a dent in her leg and no longer has any feeling . in the left side of her thigh. She also has a jagged scar which runs . down the length of her leg. She . said: ‘My husband’s nephew calls it my Voldemort scar because it’s like . a zigzag. But I feel so much more confident with the scar than I did . with a giant left leg. ‘I don’t limp anywhere near as much - even though one leg is longer than the other. Mrs Harrison had had her first operation at the age of nine to combat the ever-increasing size of her leg. After failed attempts at liposuction, her final operation took place when she was 24 and her legs are now the same size (pictured left). Mrs Harrison how feels confident enough to wear dresses (pictured right) ‘I still hobble sometimes out of habit. I’m so used to walking like that I don’t realise I’m doing it.’ Mrs Harrison still has the condition, but doctors are confident it will not get any worse. She has lost five stone since the operation, which has made the dent in her thigh less prominent and has boosted her confidence. Mrs Harrison has been with her husband, Aaron Harrison, 40, for 12 years and credits him for giving her the strength to endure so many procedures. She said: ‘He’s been with me since I was 19, and was my source of strength throughout the operations. 'He loved me how I was before the operations and before I lost the weight. Now I think he is just happy that I am happy. He is my inspiration.’","Annabelle Harrison, 31, has a rare condition called Lipoblastomatosis .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Leigh Naylor, (pictured) was distraught when doctors found a cervical tumour they had missed and gave her nine months to live . A woman who claims doctors failed to diagnose her terminal cancer 16 times, raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany as she prepares to take legal action against the NHS. Leigh Naylor was distraught when medics revealed they had found cervical tumour, giving her nine months to live in March. The 32-year-old raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany, after doctors in the UK said all they could offer was a course of life-prolonging chemotherapy. After three weeks of treatment, Ms Naylor said her tumour has shrunk and she is starting to show signs of recovery. But she has been forced to return to the UK after her money ran out, and is trying to raise a further £12,000 for each course of treatment, which she may need for the rest of her life. Mrs Naylor, from Ripon, North Yorkshire, said: ‘I didn't trust the NHS when they said there was nothing they could do but prolong my life by a couple of months because they told me I was dying before and I survived. ‘They also misdiagnosed my cancer as fibroids and a urine infection. They were quick to write me off but I felt fit and healthy and wanted to do anything to stay alive. ‘A friend told me about the clinic in Germany and after researching the treatment, I was hopeful it would save my life. ‘It's not right that I have had to pay for my own treatment, but I do not feel I have any choice because the NHS has repeatedly let me down. ‘I know the odds are stacked against me, but I will do anything I can to try and get through this.’ Mrs Naylor claims that the reason why she was not given the scan straight way is because it was ‘too expensive’. ‘But I would be in a completely different position now if they'd detected the tumour earlier,’ she said. ‘I refuse to accept this death sentence.’ Mrs Naylor visited her GP with irregular bleeding in April 2009 and saw her doctor 16 times in the space of 18 months. She claims she was only given tablets to stop the bleeding. Mrs Naylor said an ultrasound scan revealed she had fibroids - non-cancerous tumours around the . womb. Just . three weeks after a routine operation to remove the fibroids, doctors at Leeds' St James Hospital admitted they had failed to spot a cancerous tumour, Mrs Naylor claimed. Following . treatment, the 32-year-old  was given the all-clear in April 2010, but in . September 2012, she went back to doctors complaining of further pain. But she said doctors sent her away with antibiotics. Once more, she asked for a scan and seven months of tests revealed that the cancer had returned and was inoperable. Mrs . Naylor and her husband Stuart, 33, were told that radiotherapy was not . an option and were only offered life-extending chemotherapy. She raised £35,000 to have the disease treated at Marinus Clinic in Brannenburg, Germany, and after just three weeks, the tumour has shrunk and Mrs Naylor (pictured during treatment) is showing signs of recovery. The treatment involved heating the body to kill cancer cells while undergoing vitamin C injections . She has been forced to return to the UK after her money ran out and has to raise another £12,000 for each course of treatment, which she could need for the rest of her life. Mrs Naylor is pictured here with her husband in February . She was a given just nine months to live in March this year. Refusing . to accept the outcome, Mrs Naylor raised £35,000 to travel to Marinus . Clinic in Brannenburg, Germany, where she had three weeks of treatment, . involving heating the body to kill cancer cells while undergoing vitamin . C injections to boost her immune system. ‘As well as donations, I held a Robbie Williams tribute night because I'm his biggest fan,’ she said. 'No one wants to be told they're dying,' said Mrs Naylor (pictured) doing the Race for Life . ‘I also organised an auction, dinner, dance, raffle, family fun day and sponsored walk to raise the cash. ‘I was worried we weren't going to raise it in time but luckily everyone was so generous. It was such a relief. ‘No one wants to be told they're dying and I wasn't prepared to be dosed up with morphine and wires and lay down and die at 32.’ German doctors told Mrs Naylor that she is responding well to treatment and hope that the tumour will continue to shrink. ‘It's amazing, not only has the tumour got smaller but the tissue has got softer and the cancer in one of my lymph nodes has a hole in it - which means it's dying,’ Mrs Naylor said. ‘I still have a long way to go, but it's a good start. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for my husband and my friends. ‘They have done more for me than the NHS ever did. I feel totally let down and I've lost all my trust in UK medicine. 'As a taxpayer, I shouldn't have to raise money to save my own life.’ She is raising money for the next stage of her treatment and people can donate money by visiting her website. Mrs Naylor is now launching legal action against the NHS. A St James' Hospital spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the patient's concerns and are actively engaged in a process to address these. 'We would like to pass on our best wishes for her future treatment. ‘We have reviewed the patient's records in detail and can evidence that the patient was reviewed in a timely manner on a number of occasions. ‘All relevant investigations, including scans, were arranged as a matter of priority. At no time have we refused any requests for scans or treatment.’ Julia Rogers, 58, (pictured) from Newton Abbot in Devon, said she only found out she had inoperable pancreatic cancer after she paid £600 for a scan at a private hospital . A terminally ill woman claims NHS doctors failed to diagnose her pancreatic cancer, despite 19 appointments. Julia Rogers, 58, from Newton Abbot in Devon, said she only found out she had an inoperable pancreatic tumour after she went to a private hospital and paid £600 for a scan. NHS England has launched an inquiry to determined what happened. In September 2013, Ms Rogers went to her GP complaining of severe back pain, which she said felt like it was spreading to her abdomen. She had blood tests and was later sent for an ultrasound at Totnes Community Hospital, but nothing unusual was seen on the scan. She told the BBC’s Sally Mountjoy: ‘I still knew something was very wrong. I could not get any of the doctors to take me seriously.' Ms Rogers was referred to an appointment with a gastroenterologist but decided she could not wait several weeks and paid £600 to have a scan at a private hospital in Bristol. On June 11 she was told she had ‘inoperable advanced pancreatic cancer’. She was admitted to hospital over the weekend and expects to undergo treatment this week. In a statement, NHS England said: ‘We are very sorry to hear about Ms Rogers’ diagnosis and the difficulties she seems to have encountered over an extended period. ‘This clearly calls for thorough investigation on behalf of all NHS organisations involved.","After attending 16 doctors' appointments, Leigh Naylor, 32, was distraught when doctors found a cervical tumour and gave her nine months to live .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Arrest: Damarius Wren has been charged with murdering flight attendant Decarol Deloney-Cain . An 18-year-old has been charged with murdering his girlfriend's mother after Indiana police found a GPS system pinpointing where the body was dumped. Damarius Rashard Wren was charged on Friday with killing Decarol Deloney-Cain, whose body was found stabbed, bound and left in the trunk of her car on Monday. The 54-year-old flight attendant's body had to be identified through the serial number in her breast implants. When police searched the victim's home they found traces of blood, stains, and red duct tape similar to that used to bound the hands and feet of Deloney-Cain. Police were allegedly contacted by the victim's teenage daughter, who said she had found a bloody wrench in the basement bedroom of her home. A GPS system was also found in the home, which police reports said showed directions to where the woman's body had been left in Gary. When police questioned Wren he allegedly gave two differing accounts of how he found the body of his girlfriend's mother. The . victim's daughter, who has not been identified, later claimed that Wren . had attacked her mother when she returned home on July 3. Victim: The body of flight attendant Decarol Deloney-Cain was found bound and wrapped in bags on Monday . She alleged that Wren put a pillowcase over Deloney-Cain's head and hit her head against the stairs, before stabbing her with a kitchen knife, according to court records seen by My Fox Memphis. A coroner said Deloney-Cain, who had three children, suffered multiple stab wounds and blunt force trauma to the head. The records state that the girl hid upstairs and later saw two of Wren's friends arrive and help carry the body to a car in plastic bags. She . claimed that she got in a car driven by one of the men and followed . behind the vehicle her mother's body was in, and watched as it was left . on a dirt road.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Jason Manford (pictured) is worried he may have testicular cancer, after finding a lump . Comedian Jason Manford has revealed he has been struck by a cancer scare, fearing a lump he found on his 'favourite testicle' could be the disease. The stand-up discovered an abnormality on his left testicle and told his Facebook followers that he has booked an urgent doctor’s appointment to get it checked out. The 33-year-old showed his sense of humour, telling his fans he found the 'little lump on my favourite testicle'. Updating fans yesterday evening, the comedian from Salford wrote: ‘[I’ve] booked in a doctor’s appointment tomorrow for a check, I'm sure it's nowt but it's good to talk about these things.’ In another update this morning, before heading to his daughters’ sports day, the father-of-three said: ‘I can't help thinking the papers have slightly overreacted to my Facebook post but if I guess if it makes another bloke get himself checked then it's worth it!’ He is currently finishing the final dates of a long UK tour. Mr Manford . wrote on Facebook yesterday: ‘My body ""hey brain, has Jason got much work in this . week after his 220-date, 6 nights a week tour?"" ‘My body ""oh good"" My brain ""why do you ask?"" ‘My body ""oh, I'm just thinking of f*****g him right up with a bit of the flu, a frozen shoulder, back ache and a swollen ankle...oh and schedule an appointment in at the doctors cause I've just developed a lump on his left testicle so he can spend the rest of his break either ill or worried.” ‘Cheers body!’ Sharing his scare on Facebook with more than 800,000 followers, the comedian, who has presented TV shows including 8 out of 10 cats and A Question of Sport, said: 'Super Saturday, encouraged other men to check out any worrying lumps, before posting a link to the NHS’ cancer prevention page.' Mr Manford met bowel cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton and helped him raise money for The Teenage Cancer Trust, before Stephen tragically died in May. He rallied celebrities to join a Thumbs up for Stephen campaign on Twitter, which helped the teenager raise over £3million before he died. The total is currently at around £4.1million. On his Facebook page, he wrote: ‘Let's start a #thumbsupforStephen. He gave us one, let's give him one back, and donated £10,000 to the cause. The stand-up comedian yesterday told his Facebook followers (pictured) that he has booked an urgent doctor's appointment to get a lump on his left testicle checked out . Last night, Mr Manford, managed to find humour in the scary situation by writing that he has found 'a little lump on my favourite testacle' and this morning posted that he was surprised he has received so much attention . Testicular cancer usually affects men between the ages of 15 and 44. Men are advised to visit a doctor as soon as possible if they notice any lump or swelling on their testicles. Symptoms include: . Less than four per cent of testicular lumps are cancerous and swollen blood vessels are a common cause of them. Testicular cancer is one of the less common forms of cancer, accounting for one per cent of all cancers that occur in men. Each year, just over 2,000 men are diagnosed with it, according to Cancer Research UK. Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer. Over 95 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer can be completely cured, and even cases where the cancer has spread to nearby tissue, have an 80 per cent chance of being cured.","The Salford-born comedian discovered a 'little lump' on his left testicle .

Craig Jones had left the dog, Arfee, in his van with a window rolled down while he had breakfast at a Coeur d'Alene coffee shop on Wednesday morning. But an officer who approached the van a short while later shot the dog, which he described as a pit bull, over claims that it barked and had lunged at him. Heartbreaking: Craig Jones was devastated when he discovered police had shot dead his beloved dog Arfee . Jones had been unaware of the incident until he left the coffee shop and was shown the bullet hole in his van window.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . NPR host Diane Rehm has talked about her husband's painful and drawn out death as she calls for improvements in assisted dying laws. When Rehm's husband John, who had been suffering from Parkinson's, made the decision to end his life there was only one option open to him - dehydration. Weakened by the disease, and no longer able to use his limbs, Mr Rehm had asked his doctor for help but was told that wasn't possible in Maryland, where the couple live. Heartbreaking: Diane Rehm, pictured with John, who had a slow death from dehydration because of restrictions on end-of-life care . Instead, Mr Rehm's family had to stand by helplessly for nine days, after he refused all liquids and died a slow and uncomfortable death last month. 'John said he felt betrayed. He said, ""I felt that when the time came, [doctors] would be able to help me"",' Rehm told NBC News. For Rehm, who had been married to John for 54 years, it was heartbreaking to watch her husband suffer. In the months leading up to his death, Mr Rehm's condition had become progressively worse. 'He just kept getting weaker. We called in the doctor and John said to him: ""I am . ready today"". He said ""I can no longer use my legs, I can no longer use . my arms, I can no longer feed myself"",' Rehm said. She said her husband had told his doctor directly that he wanted to die, and asked for his help. But the doctor had to tell the couple that 'legally, morally, ethically' he was unable to offer assisted dying. Mr Rehm's only option was to refuse all food and liquid - a process that can take a few weeks before the patient dies. Campaign: NPR host Rehm says her terminally ill husband felt betrayed when he asked for help to end his life . During that time, they are likely to suffer headaches, leg cramps and delirium. 'We do not let our little animals suffer and people shouldn’t have to suffer,' Rehm told NBC as she described how she had desperately wanted to ease her husband's suffering during his final days. 'It wasn’t easy to watch [but] you have to respect someone else’s wishes. You have to honor his . desires. And he was finished with life,' she said. Barbara Coombs Lee, president of campaign group Compassion and Choices, said Mr Rehm should have been given better choices about how he ended his life. 'I have no . doubt that he was terminally ill and if he was in Oregon he would have . qualified for aid in dying,' she said. Despite some polls showing 65 percent of Americans supporting patients being allowed some option for a quicker or pain free death, laws on assisted dying vary widely state from state. Compassion and Choices doesn't support euthanisa, and draws a distinction between what is known as assisted suicide and giving a terminally ill patient more say in their end of life care. Compassion: Radio talk show host Rehm said it wasn't easy to watch her husband die, but she had to respect his wishes . It suggests that doctors should be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs for a patient to take as they chose. 'Assisted suicide is a crime in many states, including Oregon and Washington, where aid in dying is legal,' the group says. Assisted dying is also legal in Vermont and Montana, and several other states have debated introducing it. For radio show host Rehm, giving choice and help to patients who are suffering, like her husband was, is the humane way forward. It . would allow a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs for a patient . to take as he or she chose. 'I would like to, in every state across the . country, in every city, in every county, I would very much like to see a . justification, an allowance, for aid in dying,' Rehm said.","Diane Rehm says John was told only option was to refuse all liquids .

"By . Annette Witheridge . Justina Pelletier, the Connecticut teenager 'kidnapped' by hospital staff 16 months ago, finally returned home to her family today. The grinning 16-year-old was freed from the secure unit she’d been held at after her parents dramatically won custody on Tuesday. 'I’m so happy. I’m so excited,' Justina said, as she celebrated her first taste of freedom. Freed at last: justina Pelletier is pictured being driven home after being kept against her will in hospital for 16 months . A winning smile: Justina is driven home by her mother after her ordeal . Home comforts: Justina is welcomed by her sisters at her Massachusetts home . Wheelchair-bound Justina spoke briefly outside the Thompson, Connecticut, residential unit she had been living in for the past month just after 10am. As her mother Linda loaded up the car with her belongings, Justina said she couldn’t wait to get home to see her friends, play with her beloved dogs, soak in the swimming pool and enjoy lazy mornings lolling around in bed. And Justina’s overjoyed father Lou told Mail Online: 'We are just so happy our daughter is finally coming home. 'It has been 16 months of torture but finally justice is being done.' As Justina left the facility, family spokesman the Rev. Patrick Mahoney told waiting news teams: 'We are so thankful and thrilled that Justina is at long last being returned to the loving arms of her family. 'The Pelletiers are relieved their 16-month nightmare is finally over. Now Justina can begin the healing process.' But commenting on her deteriorating health, The Rev Mahoney added: 'Sixteen months ago Justina was ice skating, now she can’t walk.' The family plans to spend a quiet day settling Justina back into their five-bedroom home on a leafy street in upmarket West Hartford. Just before her release, Justina said she couldn’t wait to get into the family swimming pool and play with her beloved dogs. Like most teenagers, she’s also looking forward to sleeping late and getting together with her pals. Sharing her story: Journalists and local media gathered for a news conference today as Justina was freed . Justina’s Kafka-esque plight, revealed by Mail Online last year, began when she went down with flu in February 2013. She . suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle wasting . illness, but as her regular doctor was away, he told her mom Linda to . take her to Boston Children’s Hospital. After she was admitted, experts re-diagnosed her, saying she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental illness. When Justina’s parents protested, hospital staff called welfare workers, who won custody. Justina was locked in a psychiatric ward, taken off stabilizing medication and only allowed to see her family once a week as her family battled the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to regain custody of their once vibrant daughter. Ice skating fanatic Justina’s health deteriorated rapidly and she is now unable to walk. 'They are sadists and psychiatry is the devil as far as I am concerned. My daughter was used as a lab rat, a cruel experiment' - Lou Pelletier . But her parents and three older sisters, Jennifer, Jessica and Julia, are cautiously optimistic that they can nurse her back to the health. 'We’re going to keep her home-coming low key,' financial planner Lou told Mail Online. 'I know her sisters want to throw a big party for her but we need to get her settled and give her time to breath. 'Her condition has deteriorated terribly since she was taken from us. She’s no longer jumping jacks and ice skating, she is paralyzed. 'She needs time to adjust to being home and I think she wants that to be low key. We need to help her back to health. 'She has been sleep deprived – forced to get up at 7am every morning and not takes the naps she needs – and I think she just wants to settle back into her old bedroom. Family support: Justina pictured at Boston's Children's Hospital with her parents before being released to go home . 'I am still very angry at the psychiatrists, Boston Children’s Hospital and the Department of Families and Children for putting Justina through this. 'They are sadists and psychiatry is the devil as far as I am concerned. My daughter was used as a lab rat, a cruel experiment. 'Now they need other lab rats – well they’ll struggle. We finally beat the system and they cannot do that to anyone else. 'They tried to gag me, to prevent me from telling what was going on. Can you imagine what would have happened to Justina if I hadn’t gone public? Happier times: Justina pictured before being kept in hospital . 'I went to a rally at Massachusetts State House recently. People were coming up to shake my hand, saying if it wasn’t for me, the same thing would have happened to their son or daughter. 'It won’t bring back the 16 months that Justina was away. But at least we have her back again now.' Lou, 57, admitted there were times that he feared Justina would never return home. But after numerous rulings against the family, Massachusetts Judge Joseph Johnston suddenly ruled she could be freed on Tuesday. He had relaxed the ultra-tight visitation rights earlier in the month, allowing Justina to visit her home for the first time on Father’s Day. And after his ruling Tuesday, her mum was able to take her out of the JRI Susan Wayne Center for Excellence for a celebration steak dinner. Linda, who had been staying in a nearby motel, said she screamed with joy when she heard Justina was finally being released. 'Unbelievable', she told the Boston Globe. 'It’s been such a long journey.' Once her health is back on track Justina, who has missed 16 months of schooling, plans to go to Washington DC to lobby lawmakers. She intends to push for 'Justina’s Law' to make sure that no other child admitted to hospital is ever taken into custody in the same way. Justina intends to brush up on her politics and enlist her local legislators to promote her cause. 'This is only the beginning,' her father said. 'There’s going to be a Justina’s Law.'","Justina's father described psychiatrists as 'sadists' and said: 'Psychiatry is the devil'

"By . Annette Witheridge . The estranged husband of model Monica Olsen accused of offering to pay a hitman $80,000 to have her murdered has been placed in solitary confinement as he awaits trial, it emerged today. Dino Guglielmelli, 52, is in lock-down at the notoriously violent Men’s Central Jail, in Los Angeles. The millionaire vitamins tycoon is unable to receive visitors or make telephone calls. A source close to the alleged murder-for-hire plot told MailOnline that Guglielmelli was moved into solitary confinement last week. Working out through it: Monica Olsen claims she lives in fear after her husband was arrested when he was taped offering a would-be hitman $80,000 to kill her during an acrimonious divorce . Long stretch: Her husband has been moved to solitary confinement. It comes after a court was told that because of his wealth, other inmates have offered to take out the 'rat' hitman who recorded him . 'The sheriff deemed he was high-profile and had to go into solitary. He’s in lock down,' the source said. On the jail’s inmate webpage, a letter N has been placed next to Guglielmelli’s visiting arrangements. The site states that N means inmates are unable to receive visitors 'due to classification, discipline, security'. Guglielmelli claims he was set up by his friend and would-be hitman Richard Fuhrmann, who recorded the bitter husband apparently asking Fuhrmann to take out his wife. But sources close to the investigation tell MailOnline that both Monica and Furhmann are terrified he is trying to get at them from behind bars. According to court documents seen by MailOnline, other inmates have offered to 'visit' Fuhrmann for grassing up Guglielmelli when they get out. Army vet Fuhrmann, 47, is so frightened he has fled his home in California and has gone into hiding. Police claim he secretly taped Guglielmelli offering him $80,000 to kill Monica, who created the Skin by Monica Olsen beauty line when she retired from the catwalk. Guglielmelli and Monica were embroiled in an increasingly bitter custody battle over daughters Cienna, nine, and six-year-old Vandella when he allegedly tried to have her killed. Prosecutors say he had secretly wired $4.4 million abroad and was planning to flee the country with the children. Since his arrest seven months ago he has been held at the Men’s Jail, part of LA’s notorious Twin Towers correctional facility. Notorious: Guglielmelli, 52, is at the Men's Central Jail, part of the infamous Twin Towers correctional facility . Feuding: Guglielmelli is alleged to have turned to the hitman because he feared his wife and mother of his two daughters was winning the divorce battle - and particularly custody of their two daughters . Moving on: Olsen won the family Canyon Country ranch in a pre-divorce hearing. She has now put the six-bedroom mansion on themarket for $3.2million . Luxury: In happier times, Monica and Guglielmelli completely remodeled the property adding a children's wing, play area and guest quarters . Princesses: Monica’s divorce lawyer Ronald Lebow complained in court papers seen by MailOnline, that the children had been cared for 'by a series of 13 nannies' after Monica left . Spa: The six-bedroom, 7000 sq ft house sits on three acres with a 'magnificent' salt water swimming pool . The 9,500-prisoner complex was named as one of the 10 worst jails in the world in 2011 and according to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union violence by guards on inmates is widespread. Officers, who monitored 500 phone calls and numerous jail visits before Guglielmelli was put into solitary, say he offered to pay hardened prisoners 'protection' money, according to court documents. 'He is not a criminally sophisticated individual when it comes to street crimes,' Detective Mike Staley said at one of Guglielmelli’s court hearings. 'He has had some incidents in jail. He used the wrong toilet one time and was made to do a bunch of push-ups by African-American inmates. 'Right after that, he was approached by (what) we call shot callers, he called it the dorm manager. He offered to put money in the dorm manager’s books for protection. 'People like Mr Guglielmelli in custody are very quickly sized up as being rich. Whether he is or not, he has the appearance of being very wealthy. And with that comes power within the jail system. 'Often times we have had many, many incidents where people will leave, get released and go visit people on the outside for witness intimidation, assaults and murder.' The . detective said a taped visiting-room conversation between Guglielmelli . and his long-time employee Tracee Sidell revealed that 'sympathetic' inmates had offered to visit 'rat' Furhmann. Guglielmelli, . whose Creation’s Garden beauty supplements business had revenues of $48 . million a year, allegedly turned down one offer, then wrote a name down . on a piece of paper. Staley . admitted Guglielmelli could have been writing the prisoner’s name down . to report him but no piece of paper had been handed in to guards. He . told the court he believed he had written down Fuhrmann’s details. Furhmann is expected to be the star witness at Guglielmelli’s trial next month. His friendship with Guglielmelli turned sour after Monica slapped him with a subpoena to give evidence during a custody hearing. Furhmann . said he didn’t mention Guglielmelli’s threats then but after . Guglielmelli exploded in temper over his perceived disloyalty he feared . the former waste disposal entrepreneur would find another hitman, according to court papers. Model mom: Monica gave up her catwalk career to have children and has since launched her own brand of skin care products. Her business with Dino was thriving until their relationship fell apart . Hit: Fuhrmann alleged in court papers that 'What I heard extensively, most . continuously (from Dino), was when is this going to happen? Do we have a time frame? Is this going to be over soon?' 'We went into his office. He slammed the door and just kind of went on a tangent for a good five minutes,' Furhmann told investigators, according to court papers seen by MailOnline. 'He shouted: ""That stupid bitch is going to get away with it (referring to winning the custody battle)."" 'What I heard extensively, most continuously, was when is this going to happen? Do we have a time frame? Is this going to be over soon?' Fuhrmann said there were 'a number of conversations where he needed to know when this was going to be over, give me a date, give me a time. If no, I’ve got to take care of it. 'I was absolutely panicked that he would accelerate or move things along without me being in control of it anymore and he really would take things into his own hands. 'He absolutely had the means to do that. Dino is a smart man. He’s got money.' By . then Monica, who appeared in the Rachel McAdams movie The Hot Chick, . was demanding full custody of the children and half of his business . empire. Guglielmelli, 52, has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and solicitation to murder. His defense attorney Anthony Brooklier said: 'I think when you hear the tapes, when the jury hears the tapes,' Brooklier said, 'you'll understand he was manipulated by somebody who was trying to help himself.' Monica’s . spokesman Sean Borg said: 'Monica is still very frightened and jumpy. Her husband was very controlling throughout their 10-year marriage and . she fears he will continue to try to get at her from behind bars.' Monica is so traumatized she has put the ranch she shared with Gugliemelli up for sale. Friends . say she cannot stand being inside the sprawling Canyon Country mansion . and is jumpy is she hears even the slightest noise. Last . month - in a pre-divorce hearing - a matrimonial judge ordered that she . get the house, plus a couple of commercial buildings. Fear: Monica's spokesman, Sean Borg, said she's 'still very frightened and jumpy. Her husband was very controlling throughout their 10-year marriage and . she fears he will continue to try to get at her' The six-bedroom, 7000 sq ft house sits on three acres. There is a 'magnificent' salt water swimming pool and spa. In happier times, Monica and Guglielmelli completely remodeled the property adding a children's wing, play area and guest quarters. The property, which also includes a swimming pool and spa is now on the market for $3.2million. When the couple, who married in 2004, first split Guglielmelli stayed in the house. Monica’s divorce lawyer Ronald Lebow complained in court papers seen by MailOnline, that the children had been cared for 'by a series of 13 nannies' after Monica left. He also claimed that Gugliemelli’s girlfriend, business staff and household aides had periodically lived in the house. After his arrest, Guglielmelli handed over power of attorney to his older brother Gino who filed for bankruptcy on hisbehalf. He listed debts of just $1.5 million - despite business assets that included $8 million in beauty stock, a warehouse, factory equipment and company vehicles. Creation’s Garden, which once employed 250 staff, was sold off at auction. Monica is now trying to re-launch her arm of the business, which included 52 beauty creams and baby skin care products.","Dino Guglielmelli, 52, claims he was set up by would-be hitman Richard Fuhrmann .

"By . Annette Witheridge . A former top model turned skin care guru is living in terror after her estranged husband was arrested for allegedly trying to hire a hit man to murder her, MailOnline can reveal today. And Monica Olsen fears millionaire vitamin tycoon Dino Guglielmelli is still trying to sabotage her life from behind bars. Guglielmelli has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and solicitation to murder and is due in a San Fernando, California, court on Thursday. Jealous: Sources claimed that Monica Olsen's husband Dino Guglielmelli was at first envious of his beautiful bride's success and then became increasingly angry over the custody battle they were having over their kids . Ex catwalk model Monica believes he has deliberately destroyed their joint health and beauty business, which earned $50 million a year and employed 300 people, by filing for bankruptcy. Monica, who appeared in the 2002 movie The Hot Chick with Rachel McAdams, says he is trying to force her out of their spectacular Canyon Country ranch as a way of 'controlling' her from his jail cell. The 32-year-old brunette, whose picture has appeared on fashion billboards in Times Square, was horrified when detectives told her Guglielmelli had allegedly offered a pal $80,000 to murder her. According to secret recordings made by would-be assassin Richard Fuhrmann, Guglielmelli asked about ways to 'get rid' of her. As the two men ate mint chicken and noodles in a Los Angeles restaurant, Guglielmelli said: 'I’ll be happy when it is all over.' Army veteran Fuhrmann initially thought the 52-year-old founder of Creation’s Garden health supplements company was 'nothing more than an angry husband', bitter that his wife appeared to be winning their increasingly nasty custody battle over their two young daughters. But after Guglielmelli allegedly discussed 'specifics' about having Monica killed, Furhmann alerted detectives. He then secretly taped their lunch conversation. Happier times: Monica believes her husband has deliberately destroyed their joint health and beauty business, which earned $50 million a year and employed 300 people, by filing for bankruptcy . Taped: A horrified friend of Gugliemelli (left) went to detectives after the bitter husband allegedly discussed 'specifics' about having his wife killed. He was said to be recorded saying: 'I'll be happy when it is all over' Fear: A source told MailOnline that 'if someone even looks at Monica for more than . a minute, she gets nervous. He has always been controlling and she . thinks that even behind bars he can find ways of getting at her' Prosecutors played 14 minutes of the covert hour-and-a-half recording when Guglielmelli appeared in court shortly after his arrest last year. After discussing the alleged hit, he asked Furhmann: 'There’s no way for them to track it back to me?' And he is also heard on tape reassuring Furhmann: 'You’re going to get paid. Don’t worry about that – I’ve got you covered'. Furhmann told the hearing that he had initially approached Guglielmelli about a business idea but the two quickly became friends. He said Guglielmelli, an aspiring singer in a rock band called COR, became increasingly angry as his decade-long marriage unraveled. Montreal-born Monica, who is descended from Eastern European aristocracy and speaks seven languages, was devastated when detectives from the Santa Clarita Sheriff’s Department major crimes bureau told her what had happened. Sources close to the investigation said: 'Monica is distraught. She can’t believe the man she loved so much, and gave up everything for, would do this. 'She is terrified. She fears he will find another way of killing or hurting her. She is living in fear and very jumpy. 'If someone even looks at her for more than a minute, she gets nervous. He has always been controlling and she thinks that even behind bars he can find ways of getting at her. 'He has left her deeply in debt and frightened for her life. What man would do that to the mother of his children?' The couple married 11 years ago - just after she was voted the Fresh Face of 2003. She was just 21 when she quit her . Manhattan model life to move to California, where Guglielmelli was . based, and planned to carve out a second career as an actress. But . sources close to the investigation claimed Guglielmelli caused trouble . with Hollywood producers and sabotaged plans to turn a comic book . character she had created into a movie franchise. She . started her Skin by Monica Olsen beauty line when pregnant with their . first daughter eight years ago after she discovered there were few . organic baby creams on the market. Guglielmelli grew up on a farm in Washington State and ran a trash disposal business before moving into health supplies. Model and mother: Olsen gave up her successful modelling career in Manhattan to move to LA when she fell in love with her husband at the age of 22 and they had two daughters together. But then their relationship soured . Businesswoman: Sources claimed that when her skin care products business scored success and went national through Duane Reade and Walgreens, he was upset because he wanted her 'pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen' rather than having a career . He already owned his own factory churning out diet supplements and energy drinks when he married Monica. But the business took off when Monica’s skin care line went national through supermarket chains like Duane Reade and Walgreens in 2011. Around the same time, sources say, Guglielmelli started acting erratically and appeared to be jealous of his 20 years younger wife. 'She discovered that her products weren’t reaching the stores and staff were being randomly fired', the source said. 'It was weird but he seemed hell bent on destroying the business, rather than promoting it. 'It was like he wanted Monica pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen, rather than being a successful businesswoman'. Then as their marriage crumbled Guglielmelli demanded custody of their daughters and accused her of domestic violence. Monica spent a terrifying night in a jail holding cell with hardened criminals after he called police to complain she had attacked him. 'That was her wake-up call – she finally plucked up the courage to demand a divorce,' said the source. But he refused to accept it and started acting even more strangely.' Monica, who worked in New York and Milan for top designers including Helmut Lang, Thiery Mugler, Michael Kors and BCBG Max Azaria, had no idea he was allegedly trying to kill her until his arrest. She has now filed for divorce but he is contesting the action from Pitchess Detention Center, where he is being held in lieu of $10 million bail. He also handed over power of attorney to his older brother Gino, who filed bankruptcy papers on behalf of Creation’s Garden. Aside from a $995,922 Bank of America debt, he listed just a handful of small creditors, including $940 owed to a phone company, $2,491 due to an insurance firm and $16,659 owed to Fed Ex. The company’s assets, including $8 million in stock, a warehouse, vehicles, factory equipment and executive office furniture, were put up for auction last month. Wake up call: Monica claims he decided to divorce him and take away their daughters when he once accused her of abusing him and she had to spend the night in a cell with hardened criminals . Sources say Monica was horrified when she discovered the business had been bought by a California pharmaceutical firm. She is now fighting to reclaim her share and attempting to re-launch her organic beauty business, as well as pushing ahead with the divorce. Deputy District Attorney Emily Cole told MailOnline: 'Monica has problems with her divorce and other things that I try to stay out of.  I am prosecuting Mr Guglielmelli for attempted murder and solicitation to murder. We are hoping to go to trial at the beginning of May.' When approached by MailOnline Monica refused to comment. Guglielmelli has employed leading Mafia lawyer Tony Brooklier, whose father Dominic was the boss of the LA’s La Cosa Nostra and has won acquitals for several of his mob-connected clients. He did not return calls for comment. If convicted, Guglielmelli faces life in prison.","Monica Olsen 32, living in fear after her husband Dino Guglielmelli was arrested for trying to hire friend to take her out .

"By . Sally Lee . US porn actor James Dean was highly critical of Sydney's popular Opera Bar . An Australian iconic venue is under fire once again after a US porn star launched a scathing attack on Sydney's famous Opera Bar. James Deen, who's the star of Sydney's Sexpo exhibition, uploaded a highly critical review of the popular locale - describing it as 'the most god awful eatery in the existence of the universe'. This is the second angry spray over the Sydney Opera House in two weeks, after veteran actor John Malkovich labelled the acoustics of the tourist attraction as 'hideous'. Deen, who's real name Bryan Matthew Sevilla but is better known as his stage name which refers to the popular actor James Dean, didn't hold back on his self-entitled blog. The 28-year-old recently visited Opera Bar upon recommendations. 'Beautiful as the scenery was, this was the worst food I have ever eaten in my life,' he wrote on Saturday. Deen continued his rant, clearly frustrated at the service and ordering system at the bar. 'Hands down the most god awful eatery in the existence of the universe,' he wrote. He did however admit the 'ambiance [sic] was nice'. Scroll down for video .

'It's lovely to drive by on a motor boat and it has a very nice crew and very capable, but the acoustics are hideous,' Malkovich told The Daily Telegraph. 'I mean, I have only played in about 200 opera houses, and it certainly has acoustics that would do an airplane hangar a disservice.' The actor also added it would be impossible to stage anything in the venue except a circus.","US porn star James Deen is in Sydney for the health, sex and lifestyle exhibition Sexpo .

"By . Sally Lee . The Hammonds appear to be like any other ordinary Australian family. But Cary and Jon's extraordinary journey began when their first child was brought into the world sooner than anticipated. Little Evie was delivered at 30 weeks, weighing just 1.2kg. This wasn't the kind of parenthood the Victorian couple had imagined. The Hammond family, from Victoria, are this year's ambassadors of Walk for Prems - an annual event which aims to raise funds for families with premature and sick babies . Sonny Hammond who was born in 2009 at 28 weeks and weighed 1150 grams . Billy Hammond was born half the size of his twin brother Sonny and weighed 698 grams . Evie Hammond was born in 2007 at 30 weeks and weighed 1275 grams . 'I had the most perfect pregnancy,' Mrs Hammond told Daily Mail Australia. 'No morning sickness, I wasn't showing that much and I still very active.' The complications started when Mrs Hammond discovered she had a severe case of pre-eclampsia. 'I was in utter shock and bewilderment,' she said. 'It was a foreign world to me. I had no family history of it and all my sisters gave birth without any complications. 'We just had no knowledge on what we were about to embark on and it was so scary, so daunting.' Evie was born 10 weeks early in October 2007 and was held in The Royal Women's Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, in Melbourne, for seven to eight weeks. 'My mother-in-law described her as two pounds of butter but I was telling people that Evie was like a 1.25 L coke bottle with arms and legs,' Mrs Hammond said. Two years later, when the couple received the news of twins, they tried to prepare themselves for the worst. Mother Cary, severe from pre-eclampsia, holds her twins Billy and Sonny . Cary with her son Sonny who nearly died four days after he was born . 'We kept saying the twins are probably going to come early,' Mrs Hammond said. 'We thought we'd probably have them at 34 weeks and we were comfortable with that.' But the obstetrician told them otherwise. 'If you make it to 30 weeks, I'd be wrapped,’ the doctor told them. At that point, Mrs Hammond felt helpless that she couldn't do anything about the situation. 'I felt like I had failed as a mother,' she said. 'You just blame it on yourself. The one thing you think you should be able to do as a female is to have a baby. 'But I was putting them through a horrible, an absolutely horrible, start to life.' Billy and Sonny were born at 28 weeks in October 2009, weighing 698g and 1150g. 'We thought we'd be okay because we'd been through it but when we actually entered into that world, it was completely different from before,' Mrs Hammond said. 'When I saw Billy, I was so horrified at how small he was. He was the size of a coke can with arms and legs.' Jon with his daughter Evie who still has ongoing issues with her eyes . Mrs Hammond had to wait three weeks until she could hold Sonny for the first time. 'Sonny had some heart problems, nearly died on day four when he contracted a staph infection and doctors thought he wasn't going to make it,' she said. 'So he was on a ventilator for a month and he was still on it when I cuddled him at three-weeks-old. 'There were lots of tears. It felt so surreal. It was an amazing and precious moment.' While Sonny battled through and started showing signs of recovery, Billy couldn't get his breathing and feeding under control. Consequently, he was on oxygen for a year and a half and was fed through a tube until he was three years old. He had his first taste of real food at the age of two. The twins spent 99 days in the same neonatal intensive care unit as Evie. However Billy was soon readmitted to hospital and was in and out for over a year. Twins Sonny and Billy, 4, with their older sister Evie, 7, are all thriving at school . 'I'm so proud of my kids, so proud of our journey and how far we've come,' Mrs Hammond said . Through it all, the Hammonds couldn't be any closer. 'If it wasn't for my parents and Jon's parents, I don't know if we would've survived,' Mrs Hammond said. 'At the time we would just cling onto any kind of positiveness. It was way to keep sane. Otherwise we would crush and not cope.' This year the Hammonds have been named the official ambassadors for the 2014 Life's Little Treasure Foundation's Walk for Prems. The annual event will be held across Australia on October 26 to raise funds for families of premature or sick babies. 'I'm very honoured,' Mrs Hammond said. 'I'm so proud of my kids, so proud of our journey and how far we've come.' She hopes to raise awareness to let other parents know that they're not alone. 'There are so many of us out there and it's not your fault that this happened,' she said. While Evie, 6, and the twins, 4, are thriving at school there are still some health complications. 'They still have a lot of issues but when we think about how may not have been here, we're just so happy they're alive,' Mrs Hammond said.

"By . Sally Lee . While silence isn't usually associated with a football match, a junior club has become the first in Australia to enforce a silent sidelines policy. That means no cheering, no talking and absolutely no abusive comments. The Gap Football Club, in Brisbane, is the first to introduce the rule in a bid to improve sideline behaviour by spectators, mainly parents. A Brisbane junior football club have adopted a new rule which allows its players to play an abuse-free game . The Greater Brisbane Junior Rugby League also warned that misbehaving parents on the sidelines will be shamed by having their children eliminated from the game. The Gap Football Club will be the first junior sports club in Australia to enforce the 'silent sidelines' policy . But GBJRL president Shane McNally told the Courier Mail they have not yet suspended any players. 'When it comes to kids' sport, it tends to get a bit emotional,' said Mr McNally. 'Being a parent, you want the best for your kids and if you think your kids are getting a raw deal or they're not getting a fair go, well, sometimes emotions get the better of people.' While the GBJRL issued a timely reminder about their 'be positive or be quiet' policy, The Gap Football Club - which was established nearly 60 years ago - have opted for a tougher preventative measure. Gerry McAvoy, the club's technical director, said majority have shown support for the new rule while others thought their freedom of speech was being withheld. 'I've had two people who didn’t agree with it, who said ""We feel that you're gagging us"",' Mr McAvoy told Courier Mail. This follows a series of sideline brawls and fist-throwing parents aiming their anger at match officials during junior sports games. The grounds were junior players of The Gap Football Club will be able to play their game in peace .","The Gap Football Club, in Brisbane, has adopted the rule in a bid to tackle abusive parents .

"By . Sally Lee . A six-year-old boy was on his way to his martial arts class when he was hit by an oncoming car in Sydney. The boy was struck in Hurstville, Sydney's south, on Monday afternoon but tragically died in hospital. It is believed he was with his aunt when he broke free from her and ran across the road. A six-year-old boy was killed outside Boys Scout Club in Hurstville, Sydney's south, on Monday afternoon . It is believed the boy was on his way to his martial arts class when he broke away from his aunt when he ran onto the road . The boy, who's name has not been released, suffered from severe head and chest injuries when paramedics were called to the scene about 4.40pm. He was flung metres into the air when he was struck by the car - just outside the the Boy Scout Club in Hurstville which is where he attended his tae kwon do classes, reported the Daily Telegraph. The female driver stopped after the crash underwent mandatory testing. Speed and alcohol were not factors in the accident, a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. Traffic and Highway Patrol Command’s Acting Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said the tragedy was heartbreaking. 'The impact of a crash on everyone who is linked to it resonates well after headlines have faded,' he said. 'After a series of similar events earlier in the year, I would hope anyone with children in their lives would use this an opportunity to talk about road safety with them.' Acting Assistant Commissioner Smith urged parents and caretakers to take extra precautions when near vehicles. 'As a parent, I would plead with everyone that if they are with young children near a roadway always keep holding their hand,' he said.

This was discovered when prison guards responded to an altercation involving five intoxicated prisoners were fighting over a mobile phone at about 12.35 on July 20. Upon reviewing CCTV footage, police say at least four prison inmates jumped the prison fence on the night of July 19 between 7pm and 11pm.

'They were transferred to maximum security immediately,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'This is now under police investigation.' The spokesman said a search of the work release centre uncovered contraband including two empty bottles of spirits, five mobile phones, phone chargers, some 'green leafy substance' believed to be marijuana, scissors, tobacco and rolling papers. It is believed the four men escaped and returned between scheduled head counts at 7pm and 11pm.

"By . Sally Lee . Corra Connell has been living with the most devastating mystery for the last eight years. The 30-year-old, from Geelong, Victoria, cannot move her legs, cannot use her arms and can only communicate through slow speech. Doctors are baffled and have been unable to provide a diagnosis. But the most heartbreaking part of Corra's battle is that her illness prevents her from showing the simplest maternal instincts to her one and only child. Corra Connell eight years ago (left) before a mysterious illness took over her body. Doctors haven't been able to diagnose her condition . The 30-year-old is now bedridden and feeds through a tube her mother's home in Geelong, south-west of Melbourne . It all began prior to Corra's pregnancy when she began suffering from an unusually high heart rate and blurred vision, Corra's mother and carer Jen Connell said. 'It just came out of the blue and there weren't many signs leading up to it,' Ms Connell explained. 'But then five months into her pregnancy all she saw was fog and couldn't see.' Upon visiting the eye specialist, Corra was told this was more than just her vision and was referred to a neurologist. There were still no answers and after her daughter Kyra was born, the condition progressed to her legs. 'Corra's legs were very fatigued so she was constantly leaning on something or someone but she couldn't make it very far,' Ms Connell said. 'So I had to be with her all the time and then she had to move back in with me when Kya was about three years old.' Corra is the mother to eight-year-old daughter Kya (right). They are both hopeful that Corra will overcome this illness . Just a day after her 30th birthday, Corra was taken to hospital in a critical condition . Then tremors started in Corra's hands. 'She couldn't sit up right, she lost control and just couldn't support herself,' Ms Connell said. 'So I would have to hold her up when she went to the toilet and she started using a wheel chair. But then we had to get one especially made for her because her chin would drop down. 'I'm virtually Corra's arms, legs and voice.' While Corra still has reflexes in her body, she has been completely bedridden for the past year and feeds through a tube as she's unable to swallow. The young mother reached a critical moment on May 31, just a day after her 30th birthday. 'She was at the edge of life or death,' Ms Connell said. Corra was taken to hospital as she had been suffering from pneumonia. 'The doctors just told us there was nothing left for them to do,' Ms Connell said. 'They were telling us to be prepared. We even spoke with palliative care.' Corra's condition has progressively become worse as she is now unable to use her legs, her arms and can only communicate through slow speech . Corra had to move back in with her mother Jen Connell when Kya was three-years-old . But Corra proved them wrong. 'She's always been strong and always believed that this isn't permanent,' Ms Connell said. 'We're just waiting for someone to open the door with an answer.' While Ms Connell is a full-time carer, she tells of a mother's heartache as she's seen her second youngest daughter deteriorate each day. 'The difficulty for me is to watch her deteriorate little by little and lose her independence,' she said. 'She was a very good singer, great dancer and she was very social and outgoing. She played netball and was very active. Incredibly contrasting from her life now.' Even the simple things in life have become part of Corra's every day struggle. 'I have to scratch her head when it's itchy or if something is in her eye I have to get it out for her,' Ms Connell said. 'But the heartbreaking thing is that she can't raise her daughter and she watches life go on. It's difficult to see that she's losing her place in life.' Jen Connell (right) has been with her daughter every step of the way . Kya is waiting for the day her mum overcomes her illness and finally gets out of bed . Corra is determined to overcome her illness so she can become the mother she's always wanted to be for Kya . Incredibly, Corra remains positive despite living with the mysterious illness which has completely taken over her life. 'The doctors told us they have no answers,' Ms Connell said. 'They just hit a wall. 'But Corra is so good with dealing with it all. So she's my strength.' And her motivation is to finally be the mother she's always wanted to be for eight-year-old daughter Kya. 'She's a beautiful girl and she's grown up very quickly,' Ms Connell said. 'But she's just hanging out for the day her mum gets out of bed. The saddest thing is that Corra can’t easily give her own daughter a hug.' Ms Connell says they all truly believe that Corra will overcome the illness. 'Corra strongly believes that this is a journey she has to be on because there's a reason for everything and there's a purpose for what she's going through,' Ms Connell said. 'Whatever this is, it will just run its course. I don't think Corra's condition is terminal. 'So we are just waiting for a miracle.' ‘It’s often assumed that with our . increased understanding of medicine and progress with genome sequencing, a diagnosis will simply pop up,' Alastair Kent OBE, director of Genetic Alliance UK told MailOnline. The charity, along with its sub-section called SWAN UK - Syndromes Without A Name - offers support and information to families of children with undiagnosed conditions. Mr Kent added: 'However it is surprisingly difficult in many cases to make a diagnosis – we estimate that in the UK alone, there are at least 5,000 families who have a child with an undiagnosed condition. ‘It can be incredibly frustrating and stressful – these people often have a cocktail of difficult problems and their lives are hanging by a thread. They have also been through countless tests which often conclude there are ‘no abnormalities’. ‘That doesn’t mean there’s nothing wrong – it means we don’t understand the significance of these results. Sometimes you get a lot of data but not a huge amount of information. For a diagnosis, you need a previous example to compare it with. Without that, how do you know it’s the same thing? ‘Rare diseases - often caused by . extremely rare genetic mutation - are defined as medical . conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 people (this is the number the EU uses). The National Institues of Health in the U.S has recently established the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) to help diagnose rare and new diseases and treat those with rare disorders. Dr Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, told NBC News:  ‘To date, researchers have discovered the . genomic bases of more than 5,000 rare genetic disorders, but we are . still on the hunt for the cause of an additional 2,000-3,000 . single-gene, also called Mendelian, disorders.’","Doctors have told Corra Connell that they have no answers for her .

"By . Sally Lee . Johnny Lin is living the high life. The Brisbane real estate agent is earning about $800,000 a year and he's only 27. And he rewards himself by fine-dining with friends every night, indulgent holidays every few months and plans to retire in the next three years. But life hasn't always been easy for the managing director of Harcourts Aspley - north of Brisbane - who worked 70 to 80 hours a week for the first three years of his career. Johnny Lin, at just 27, makes $800,000 gross commission a year . 'I remember I was still living at home and had to borrow money from my parents at the start,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It wasn't easy. I went crazy over work and dropped everything for it. I pretty much gave up three years of my life.' Johnny says he grew up knowing he'll be working in the business industry but he never even considered real estate until he stepped into a noodle shop in Aspley back in 2007. 'I had just about finished by engineering degree at the time but I knew I didn't to spend the rest of my life sitting behind a computer,' he said. 'One day I walked into a noodle shop and got talking to a real estate agent. Then he told me that I'd make a good agent, gave me his card and told me to give him a call. 'Two months later, I was working for him and I haven't looked back.' Mr Lin works at Brisbane real estate agency Harcourts Aspley - in the city's northside . But it's a choice he'll understandably never regret. 'My mum thought it was insane that I was giving up engineering because I had already graduated from it but I knew it was a risk I had to take when I was young,' Johnny said. Within the first six months of starting at Harcourts Aspley, Johnny and a friend took over half the business. 'I was addicted to work,' he said. 'I'd be working 70 to 80 hours a week, going to work by 8am and coming home at about 9pm. Then I'd jump back on the computer at home and keep at it.' And it appears the hard work has paid off. 'The last few years I made an average of about $800,000 in gross commission,' he said. 'Most recently I sold 83 properties and earned $810,000 in gross commission.' Seven years later, Johnny has won over 150 awards - including the No.1 Sales Consultant in Brisbane, No. 2 Sales Consultant in Queensland and No. 7 Sales Consultant in Australia 2012/2013. 'I've got more trophies than I can keep in my office,' he said. 'But at the end of the day, money isn't everything. My ultimate goal is to be happy and I'm the happiest when I'm working.'","Johnny Lin has been in the real estate industry for seven years .

The pilot's flying techniques are further shown as he circles around, aiming its rotor at the men before it lands a few metres away. Butler tells talk-show host Kimmel that he's only released footage of 'the tame stuff'. 'This is how we were flying about,' he said. 'We didn't even upload the best bit of this where we were spinning around at 70 miles per hour and him in the chopper right above us.' The Scottish actor refrained from revealing the pilot's name but said: 'this stuff is evidence he's insane'. Peter Gibson, the spokesman for CASA, says they were alerted about the video on Thursday. 'The registration of the helicopter is unclear from the video but we are looking into it,' he said. 'We treat these kind of potential unsafe operations very seriously and it's for the inspectors to determine whether there will be an investigation.' Mr Gibson did not comment on whether the helicopter pilot breached any safety rules.

"By . Sally Lee . Candid photographs of Anzac troops at Gallipoli have captured moments which reflect true experiences of war. The Australian War Memorial has released 39 images as part of a travelling exhibition to commemorate the centenary of the First World War. The photos were taken by leading Melbourne surgeon Sir Charles Ryan while he was serving with the Australian Imperial Force in Turkey in 1915. Scroll down for video . Sir Charles Ryan, the Melbourne surgeon who took candid photos of soldiers during the First World War, stands outside the dugout of the Aide-de-Camp at Gallipoli in 1915 . This image of Brigadier General Carruthers, a British officer, depicts the dry and forbidding conditions Anzac troops had to endure . The exhibition - A Camera on Gallipoli - shows the reality behind the 1915 Gallipoli campaign, director of the Australian War Memorial Dr Brendan Nelson said. 'In 1914, at the age of 61, Sir Charles Ryan was appointed consulting surgeon to the AIF, embarking from Melbourne in October for the Middle East and on to Gallipoli,' he said. 'Sir Charles Ryan’s photographs reflect the Australians' true experience of war, depicting the dry, forbidding landscape, tired troops in the trenches, and squalid dugouts.' But while the images illustrate the realities of war, Dr Nelson says the photos also portray 'true spirit of the Australian soldiers who fought at Gallipoli'. 'Their mateship, stoicism and endurance underpin the photographs and embody the meaning of the Anzac spirit,' he said. Dr Ryan served as a doctor with the Turkish army in 1877 to 1878, treated Ned Kelly at Glenrowan - north-east of Melbourne - and gave long service as a senior military officer, Dr Nelson said. 'He was extended high civil and military recognition by his peers,' Dr Nelson said. The photos will be displayed in three formats: a framed exhibition, a pop-up banner exhibition and a digital exhibition. They will be travelling across NSW from August to October.

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sally Lee . The owner of a school bus that exploded into a fireball on a Queensland highway on Tuesday has warned that this could happen to more buses due to engine manufacturers being forced cut emissions. Passengers included students and teachers who managed to escape in time, minutes before the bus burst into flames on the Sunshine Coast, north of Brisbane. The bus was engulfed by flames when firefighters arrived. Scroll down for video . The bus exploded into flames on a Queensland highway moments after 61 students and three teachers escaped . Firefighters attend to the dramatic scene of the fire on the Bruce Highway at Chevallum, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast . Paul West, of West National Coaches, says there had been a rise in the number of bus fires in not only Australia but also around the world. He believes such incidents could be the ramifications of a new environmental rule which forced engine manufacturers to reduce emissions. 'Because of the change, there is an enormous amount of pressure put on diese,' Mr West told The Queensland Times. 'Aviation fuel normally can't burn, but under pressures it burns beyond belief.' Michael Apps, executive director of Bus Industry Confederation, agreed with Mr West's comments. He says there's no doubt that newer low emission vehicles operate on higher temperatures. Consequently this increases the risk of the vehicle to catch fire after there has been leaking fluid such as coolant, he said. The 61 high school students and three teachers were on an excursion when the bus caught alight on the Bruce Highway, near Chevallum, before 1pm on Tuesday. The bus was taking a group of year 10 students from Maroochydore High School back to their school from a careers expo, the Sunshine Coast Daily reported. One of the students, Mason Hope, described the moment he called his grandmother to tell her why he'd be late home. '[I told her] the bus is on fire. We just heard bang after bang and explosion after explosion. It's crazy,' he told the Sunshine Coast Daily. Keeping a safe distance: Students heard 'explosion after explosion' as the bus turned into a fireball . When the fireball subsided the bus was nothing but a charred shell . Pictures show the large coach fully engulfed in flames and the charred remains as firefighters attend the scene. Plumes of black smoke can be seen billowing out from the site of the crash, backing up traffic for miles along the highway. Paramedics treated five passengers at the scene, including two who suffered smoke inhalation, a Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said. The investigation into the cause is ongoing.","School bus caught fire on a Sunshine Coast highway in Queensland on Tuesday .

"By . Sally Lee . The super-cuteness of Nemo, the beloved clownfish made famous in Pixar's delightful film Finding Nemo, is being used to highlight what Greenpeace says is a potential environmental disaster on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Greenpeace Australia Pacific has released a controversial advertisement which features a clownfish stuck swimming in a blender as part of its campaign to stop what it claims is a 'monstrous new mine' in Queensland, which will require a shipping terminal in the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef. The 30 second video, which was uploaded on YouTube on Tuesday, has since gained more than 29,000 likes. Scroll down for video . Greenpeace Australia Pacific released their latest campaign to put a stop to port expansion near the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage by featuring beloved children's film character Nemo, from the Pixar film Finding Nemo . The 30 second ad protests against the pending approval of the Carmichael mine in Galilee Basin, western Queensland . The 30 second video, which was uploaded on YouTube on Tuesday, has since gained more than 29,000 likes . Finding Nemo opened to universal acclaim in 2003, earning US$936 million. The animation is based in Australian waters and begins with Nemo jumping from a fish bowl in a dentist's surgery and into Sydney Harbour. The Greenpeace clip begins with a close up on the little clown fish swimming around in what initially seems to be the ocean. 'Life for this fish was, quite literally, going swimmingly,' the video description reads. However as the camera pans out, it becomes evident that the clownfish is trapped inside a blender. The campaign is a protest against the approval of the Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin, west of Rockhampton, in far North Queensland. The narrator of the footage explains that the new mine, owned by coal giant Adani, will require a shipping terminal in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area and threaten the lives of sea creatures like this clownfish. 'Right now a proposal to build the largest ever coal mine in Queensland threatens our Great Barrier Reef,' he said. 'How much will we destroy in pursuit of profit and power?' Ben Pearson, program director of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, says this was a fresh and confronting way of reminding people that threats to the Great Barrier Reef 'remain and are still very real'.

"By . Sally Lee . It's a long way from the sunny beach-loving holiday destination that Balinese tour operators like to project to the thousands of Australians who descend on the island every year. A 16-minute video was uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday showing various breeds of dogs held to the ground and given a lethal injection by Balinese officers. The footage shows how dogs 'illegally smuggled' into the country are given a lethal injection before being thrown onto a pile. This is part of a 'legally endorsed program' by the Governor of Bali and the Bali Agricultural Quarantine to tackle the risk of a rabies plague from the increasing number of stray and smuggled dogs. And in one shot, a female official can be seen smiling and taking photos of an animal just before it is put to its death. Scroll down for video - WARNING: DISTURBING IMAGES . Smuggled dogs of various breeds are culled in Bali to tackle the risk of a rabies plague . Dogs are held in cages and forced to watch others be killed in front of them . Balinese officers take photos of the dogs before they are killed . The footage, which shows how innocent pedigree dogs are first held in cages and forced to watch in fear as they await their horrific fate, has been condemned by animal activism group PETA, describing the scene as 'slaughter'. The YouTube user who uploaded the video says the dogs are killed with an intracardiac injection, also known as a heart stick. This procedure involves sticking a needle into the animals' hearts. 'In Bali frightened smuggled dogs for the black market are held in cages and forced to watch others killed by lethal injection,' he wrote in the video description. Bali, one of Australia's top holiday destinations, has more than 900,000 Australian visitors each year. The Bali Times reported that in April about 31 expensive breeds, including a Siberian husky, a Pomeranian and a Lacy, were euthanised. They are worth hundreds of millions of rupiah, equivalent to thousands of Australian dollars. They were smuggled on a bus traveling from Java to Bali. It was also reported that dogs were captured by authorities when no one claimed ownership after 24 hours. A 16 minute YouTube video shows Balinese officers holding dogs as they are given a lethal injection . Dogs are being culled in Bali as a way to tackle the risk of a rabies plague from the increasing number of stray and smuggled dogs . A petition on Change.org is urging Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika to eliminate the inhumane culling program . 'The sadistic scene involving innocent dogs whose only crime is being homeless and suspected to have ""rabies"". 'There is no compassion from the killers. 'Thrown into a pile the killers can be heard talking and laughing with no regard to the pain and suffering going on around them. Loving dogs treated as garbage instead of faithful companions who only wanted to be loved.' The Jakarta Post reported that mass vaccinations have also been held, targeting more than 300,000 dogs each time. Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika was quoted saying that any stray dogs should be killed immediately as part of the 2009 rabies prevention bylaw. This was created to prevent people from being bitten by stray rabid dogs. 'If any stray dogs are found, feel free to eliminate them,' Mr Pastika said last month. 'It has been stipulated in the bylaw that dog owners have to confine their pets at home.' A PETA Australia spokeswoman says they've previously worked with the Bali Animal Welfare Association (BAWA) and the Indonesian government to end the mass culling of dogs. 'PETA strongly condemns the slaughter seen in this video. Dogs are clearly terrified and stressed, no attempt is made to administer lethal injection via IV methods (the only humane form of euthanasia) and there is no reason why these dogs cannot be vaccinated rather than slaughtered.' 'Since 2010, a successful vaccination program and the number of humans becoming infected with rabies has fallen dramatically,' the spokeswoman said. 'It is unclear why the Balinese Governor has decided to revert to a policy of killing all stray dogs in the face of an extremely successful anti-rabies vaccination program and against all specialist advice. A petition on Change.org is urging Mr Pastika to shut down his elimination programs and suggests more humane ways of controlling increasing numbers.","A 16 minute YouTube video shows various breeds of pedigree dogs being euthanised .

"By . Sally Lee . Within the sandstone walls of Sydney's St Matthias Anglican Church, lies over 150 years of history. But a property magnate has proposed that the site, structured in a gothic revival style, should be demolished to make way for a multi-storey carpark as 'St Matthias has ceased to function as a church'. Max Raine, a former chairman of Raine and Horne, believes the church is 'under-used' and has 'much more potential'. Reverend Peter Baker says St Matthias Church in Paddington, eastern Sydney's inner-city, is here to stay . The historic church was built on this very site in 1861 but its history dates back to 1885 . Property magnate Max Raine says the historic site is the perfect spot for a multi-storey car park . However Reverend Peter Baker, assistant minister of the church, refutes these claims and says St Matthias has about 400 parishioners. And the congregation continues to grow. 'Our cultural values of the church itself significantly outweighs the values of a carpark,' Rev Baker said. 'St Matthias has been a vibrant part of the community and our facilities are used regularly.' And he says the Paddington church, in Sydney's inner-city eastern suburb, is here to stay. 'It's not for sale and we're not looking to move thank you very much,' Rev Baker said. 'But Mr Rains is more than welcome to our church. Our doors are open.' Mr Raine (left) says the church is 'under-used' but Rev Baker (right) refutes these claims . Rev Baker says the church site is not for sale as it is a 'vibrant' part of the community . The 19th century church has been structured in a gothic revival style . Mr Raine, who's been in the property industry for about 60 years, says the double street frontage of the church makes it a perfect location for a multi-storey carpark. 'The site is being under-used and I know that from going there several times myself,' he said. 'It's sad to say but the church is under-used and it has so much more potential for even a hospital or a child-care centre.' Mr Raine, an Anglican, says creating a multi-storey carpark will help activate the strip of shops on the street. 'There's not enough parking in the area and it needs to be created in order to attract more shoppers,' he said. Church administrator Josh Crockett says activities for congregants are held at the church nearly every day of the week. These include two services on Sundays, youth groups, marriage counselling, various women's groups and ESL classes.

Mr Obama has also paid tribute to AIDS researchers and activists who were bound for an international conference in Melbourne. The president phoned Prime Minister Tony Abbott to discuss the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight, which crashed in disputed territories in eastern Ukraine. Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama (left) phoned Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) to discuss the Malaysian Airline MH17 tragedy . 'The president expressed condolences on behalf of the American people to the Australian families who lost loved ones on board the flight,' a statement from the White House said on Saturday. Malaysian Airline MH17 passengers and crew died when MH17 was downed on Thursday, with 28 Australians and one American, among the casualties. The talks come after Abbott and Australia's representative on the United Nations Security Council ramped up pressure on Russia to de-escalate its influence over separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. 'The two leaders discussed the importance of a prompt, full, unimpeded and transparent international investigation, and they stressed the need for immediate access by international investigators to the crash site,' the statement said. The president underscored continuing US support and co-operation with Australia as this issue unfolds, and the two leaders committed to remaining in close touch moving forward. Victorian couple Frankie Davison with her husband Liam Davison were among the 28 Australians killed in the MH17 crash . Other Australian victims include Liliane Derden (left), a public servant from Canberra, and Sister Philomene Tiernan (right) from NSW . Mr Obama told a press conference that evidence indicated the jet was shot down by a surface-to-air-missile launched from an area controlled by Russian-back separatists in eastern Ukraine. There were a number of AIDS researchers, activists and health workers were also on the plane, heading to Melbourne for the 20th International AIDS Conference - AIDS2014 - and Mr Obama made special mention of them during his address. 'Onboard Malaysia Airlines flight 17 there were apparently nearly 100 researchers and advocates travelling to an international conference in Australia dedicated to combatting AIDS/HIV,' the president said. 'These were men and woman who have dedicated their own lives to saving the lives of others and were taken from us in a senseless act of violence. 'In this world today we shouldn't forget in the midst of conflict and killing there are people like these. 'People who are focused on what can be built, rather than what can be destroyed.

"By . Sally Lee . This is one remarkable story of the undeniable love between a man and his best friend. It took Richie, a 12-month-old Kelpie, 13 days to be finally reunited with his beloved owner Paul Galloway after falling off the back of his ute - 45km from home. And boy, was he happy to see him. With a broken leg, a starved Richie survived on sheep and cattle dung as he trekked it back to Mr Galloway's Adelong farm in south-western NSW. Scroll down for video . Paul Galloway, from Wagga Wagga in south-western regional NSW, with his 12-month-old Kelpie named Richie . Mr Galloway's bond with Richie began when they first met four months ago. 'I've always been a dog lover and always had them around,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was ready to adopt another one and when I went over to the animal shelter, Richie appealed to me the most. 'He was of three in the litter and had the best personality. He was excited, affectionate and just wanted someone to take him home.' Since then, the pair have been inseparable. So taking Richie on a trip to neighbouring town Gundagai on June 20 was no exception. But it was only when Mr Galloway, from Wagga Wagga in south-western regional NSW, arrived at his destination that he realised his dog was missing. Mr Galloway was driving to Gundagai, south-western NSW, with his 12-month-old pup in the back of his ute on June 20 . But on the way, Richie got lost and couldn't be found when his owner went back to find him . 'Richie was chained to the back because I was doing sharp turns on the highway but when I arrived at the place I went around the back and saw no dog,' Mr Galloway said. 'The collar had come undone and I presumed Richie had jumped off onto the highway.' So Mr Galloway went back to retrace his tracks several times. 'I drove up and down the highway, hoping to see a dog roaming around,' he said. By then, Mr Galloway had feared the worst. 'I was travelling about 100km an hr so I knew it would've been a pretty tough fall for him,' he said. 'I was half expecting to see him dead on the side of the road but I just wanted to find him.' He then received an unexpected call on Thursday afternoon. 'People on my Adelong farm asked me if I knew anything about a black dog which was just sitting on the verandah,' Mr Galloway said. 'They told me he had a flea collar and that's when I knew it was my dog.' Mr Galloway is pictured with his grandchildren Matthew, 7, and Millie Galloway, 5 . Richie is clearly a great addition to the Galloway family as he's been described as a loyal and affectionate pup . Mr Galloway says he was 'over the moon', jumped in the car straight away and drove to the farm. 'I couldn't believe it,' he said. 'Richie would've been hopping for most of that journey on his three good legs because he had a cut up the front left one. It nearly ripped off. The tear was pretty bad.' A check from the local veterinary hospital revealed that Richie had survived on cattle and sheep dung while he was on the road for 13 days. Although Richie has proved that he is one hell of a fighter, Mr Galloway revealed that this is the second time his dog has beat death. 'Three three weeks before Richie was lost he ate rat poisoning and survived,' Mr Galloway said. Now the pup is said to be doing well and simply 'happy as Larry to be home'. 'He'll probably have a limp for awhile but he's a celebrity and going great guns,' Mr Galloway said. When asked whether Richie will return to his post at the back of the ute, Mr Galloway said: 'oh he's progressed to first class and sits in the front seat.' 'He's getting the royal treatment now.' Matthew Galloway, 7, is thrilled to play with his grandfather's 12-month-old Kelpie . Mr Galloway, a self-confessed dog lover, says he is 'over the moon' to have Richie back home .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sally Lee . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will do everything in its power to ensure the bodies of the Australians killed on Flight MH17 are respected. 'We owe it to the dead, all the dead, we owe it to the families, all the families to do everything in our power to respect the bodies, to find the truth and to ensure justice is done,' Mr Abbott told 60 Minutes on Sunday night. The Prime Minister attended a national security committee of cabinet meeting on Sunday evening after images emerged of the crash site in eastern Ukraine being 'absolutely trampled'. He told 60 Minutes the discussion at the meeting was dominated by concerns to ensure the bodies were treated with respect and taken to a place where a proper investigation could be carried out.

The Prime Minister says it could be weeks before victims' remains are brought back to their families in Australia . 'We are consulting with our friends, we are consulting with our allies because frankly it is simply unacceptable to see what is happening on this site given that 298 innocent people have been murdered,' Mr Abbott told the program. He also said Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was in New York prosecuting Australia's case before the Security Council for an immediate securing of the site, proper treatment of the bodies and a full and fair investigation. Earlier on Sunday, an emotional Tony Abbott held himself together as he spoke of the innocent lives lost in the downed Malaysian Airline MH17 in eastern Ukraine. The Australian Prime Minister revealed that his daughters had boarded an MH17 flight when they flew back from Europe a few months earlier as he warned that it could be weeks before the remains of MH17 victims are returned to their families in Australia. 'The grim truth is that not all the bodies will be intact,' he told ABC program Insiders on Sunday morning. The service was dedicated to the 298 lives lost during the tragic MH17 crash in eastern Ukraine . Mr Abbott described the crash site in eastern Ukraine as 'chaotic' These were 'wrenching times' but he couldn't allow emotions to cloud his judgment. 'You look at the faces of the dead and they're your neighbours, they're your friends, they could be your kids because let's face it, we're a people who like to travel,' Mr Abbott said. 'And my own daughters flew on MH17 some months ago on their way home from Europe, so this is a tragedy that touches us deeply. 'There are 36 people who call Australia home who have been snuffed out. This is an horrific crime.' Mr Abbott described the crash site in eastern Ukraine as 'chaotic' and reports of pro-Russian rebels meddling with the evidence - including the removal of bodies - as 'outrageous'. He also expressed concerns about the security at the crash site in eastern Ukraine. This comes after Russia agreed to an international investigation into MH17 amid mounting scepticism about its willingness to co-operate with the international community. 'My fear is that Russia will say the right thing, but that on the ground interference with the site, interference with investigators, interference with the dignified treatment of bodies will continue,' he said.

The Prime Minister's daughters Frances (left), 22, and Bridget Abbott (right), 21 . At least two attempts by international investigators to access the site had been frustrated by rebels, Mr Abbott said. 'The site is chaotic, it's absolutely chaotic,' he said. 'The kinds of things that would normally be happening at an air crash site are not happening.' However Mr Abbott would not say if he had tried to make contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, nor if Australia would block his attendance at November's G20 meeting in Brisbane. 'It's not too late for changes of heart,' he said. 'There are excuses. There is blame shifting. There is handwashing going on, and that's not acceptable, it's simply not acceptable.'

Russian Minister for Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev, in Sydney for a G20 summit, was summoned for an unexpected meeting with Mr Abbott on Saturday. The prime minister made clear his 'dissatisfaction with the way this has been handled'. 'Russian controlled territory, Russian-backed rebels, quite likely a Russian supplied weapon - Russia can't wash its hands of this,' he said. He said the international community had a 'very high degree of confidence' MH17 was brought down by a missile launched by Russian backed rebels. There was 'slightly less confidence' that the weapon was Russian supplied, he said. 'There is very, very strong evidence that sophisticated weaponry has moved across the border from Russia into Ukraine, sometimes its moving backwards and forwards across the border from Russia into the Ukraine,' Mr Abbott said. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had invited Australia to 'fully participate' in any aspect of the investigation, including body recovery.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Barack Obama announced Friday that the rebels believed to be behind the rocket attack on a Malaysian Airlines jetliner in eastern Ukraine have had 'a steady stream of support from Russia,' but stopped short of calling for an immediate pushback against Moscow. The U.S. president's brief but substantial comments about deaths that he called 'an outrage of unspeakable proportions' came 24 hours after he coolly inserted a 40-second statement about the plane crash into a 16-minute oration about domestic transportation policy, drawing gasps and guffaws from Americans. 'This certainly will be a wake-up call for Europe and the world that there are consequences to escalating a regional conflict in the Ukraine,' he said in the White House press briefing room on Friday, cautioning that it's not yet completely clear 'what individuals, or groups of individuals ordered the strike.' But 'it is not possible for these separatists to function the way they're functioning' without Moscow's involvement, he insisted. 'A group of separatists can't shoot down military transport planes ... without sophisticated training and sophisticated equipment. And that is coming from Russia.' Scroll down for video . Obama said Moscow is supporting the rebel faction that brought down MH17, but only threatened new sanctions . The president also announced the name of the sole American known to have been aboard the Boeing 777 when a Russian-made rocket slammed into it at 32,000 feet . Obama revealed Friday that Quinn Lucas Schansman, a U.S.-Dutch dual citizen, was on his way to meet family members who were vacationing in Malaysia when his plane was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile . Russian President Vladimir Putin 'has the most control over that situation,' Obama said. 'And so far, at least, he has not exercised it.' Those words came off as softer than those of his former top diplomat, Hillary Clinton, who is presumed to be running to replace him in two years' time. A network of high-tech eavesdropping and early-warning satellites operated by the Pentagon most likely played a key role in determining that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile over the Ukraine. According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, intelligence officials almost certainly relied on a technical discipline known as measurement and signature intelligence, also known as MASINT, to obtain key bits of information about the missile launch. The sophisticated system of satellites at the Pentagon’s disposal could have pinpointed the location from which the missile was fired and plotted out its trajectory as it shot up into the sky on a collision course with the MH17 Flight. Riki Ellison, founder and chairman of Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, an industry lobby, told the paper that intelligence analysts would have become aware the missile launch because of its heat signature. U.S. Air Force-operated satellites orbiting the Earth are equipped with hyper-sensitive sensors that pick up on heat from missile and booster plumes. In fact, the detectors are so fine-tuned that they even spot forest fires. The system of satellites, run as part of the Defense Support Program, sends back early warnings each time it detects an intercontinental ballistic missile launch. Also, American radars scattered around Europe have the capacity to provide data on the exact launch site, the missile’s destination and its speed. The other vital intelligence tool is a fleet of U.S. listening satellites that collect electronic signals from foreign defense systems. Armed with this data, U.S. analysts would be able to determine the source of the signals and the weapon used. The Russian-made Buk missiles, like the one that downed the jet Thursday with 298 people on board, are equipped with a radar system that gives off unique signals, making it possible to triangulate the launch site and trace its route. Source: LA Times . The U.S. needs to 'put Putin on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by,' she told PBS host Charlie Rose on Thursday night. 'Commercial airliners are big targets, but by the time they got over that part of Ukraine they should have been high, so it takes some planning.' Obama demanded 'an immediate cease-fire' on Friday so the 298 dead could be recovered and the crash scene secured. The downed Boeing 777, he said, 'should snap everybody's heads to attention' on the question of Russia's hand in supporting anti-government forces in eastern Ukraine. 'We don't have time for propaganda, we don't have time for games,' he said. But the U.S., he said, does have time for 'a credible international investigation' to take place. He said investigators from the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board were en route to eastern Ukraine to help determine the details of what happened as the aircraft, carrying 298 souls between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, flew at 32,000 feet near the intersection of Ukrainian and Russian airspace. 'Are they going to continue to support violent separatists whose goal is to overthrow the government of Ukraine?' Obama asked. 'As Russia engages in efforts that are supporting the separatists, we have the capacity to increase the costs we impose on them, and we will do so.' But Obama hasn't hinted at what a new round of sanctions might look like. Just this week his administration imposed new financial penalties and restrictions on a range of Russian-owned banks and other businesses, freezing them out of long-term U.S. bank borrowing. It's unclear whether his State Department has contemplated what a broader sanctions package would look like. Secretary of State John Kerry has been quiet on the question, and the president indicated Friday that such talk would be a cart before the horse. 'We don't know exactly what happened yet,' he said, urging Americans not to 'get out ahead of the facts.' Obama . named a single American on Friday, Quinn Lucas Schansman, as 'the sole . person that we can definitively say is a U.S. or dual citizen' and was . on the doomed aircraft.

'This was an airliner headed towards Russian airspace,' the Arizona Republican said on MSNBC. 'And it has the earmarks – and I'm not concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian.' 'If that's true, this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are. And there will be incredible repercussions if this is the case.' 'If it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly believing that this is a Ukrainian warplane,' McCain warned, 'I think there's going to be hell to pay and there should be.' The . senator's comments came as recovery workers began to pick through mounds . of luggage, airplane sections and even human remains in a nine-mile . debris field where the Boeing 777 went down Thursday. A Russian 'Buk' air defense missile like this one is believed to have shot down Malaysian Airlines flight 17, with Russia and Ukraine pointing fingers of blame at each other .

Vladimir Putin and refusing to arm Ukrainian government forces. 'The . United States – it has been insulting in how small and how little help . we have given,' he complained. 'I mean, they have been begging us for . defensive weaponry [but] we have not given it to them.' McCain also slammed the White House for the shallowness of economic sanctions the U.S. has pushed on Moscow after Putin annexed a region of Ukraine that was populated mainly by ethnic Russians. 'The sanctions so far in exchange for Crimea have been minuscule,' said McCain. 'These latest enacted by the Obama administration, I think, are helpful. But if you ask the Ukrainian government that's struggling, they said they need weapons [with] which to defend themselves.' Earlier in the day McCain went directly after Putin, telling Roll Call that if the plane was fired on by 'separatists, which are also Russian, Vladimir Putin should be paying a heavy price.' Wreckage: Firefighters contained blazes at the site of the crash near the town of Shaktarsk, in rebel-held east Ukraine . Putin on Thursday called the idea of Russian government involvement in the plane's destruction 'stupidity' and blamed Ukraine. 'This tragedy would not have occurred if there was peace in that land,' he said, at least if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.' 'And without question, the state over whose territory this took place bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.' U.S. officials said Thursday that they are certain the passenger plane was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile. The Associated Press reported that Soviet-era 'Buk' missile systems have been spotted in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist fighters. Video surfaced on Friday showing that specific anti-aircraft weapon system being hauled into Russia. The apparatus was missing two of its four missiles.","U.S. president warns Vladimir Putin that he knows support for militant groups in Ukraine have had 'a steady stream of support from Russia'

"Hillary Clinton is running for president, Comedy Central host Jon Stewart declared Tuesday night on The Daily Show, and the former secretary of state played along – even saying she prefers a 'home office' with 'fewer corners' than usual. U.S. presidents work in the famed Oval Office, a White House room with no corners. Speculation about the potential for a 2016 Clinton White House run has consumed America's political chattering classes since she resigned from President Barack Obama's cabinet early in 2013. New, less comfortable questions may intrude into the discussion, however, since questions and answers between Stewart and Clinton about the Middle East were left on the cutting room floor. Scroll down for video . President Hilarity: Former U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. senator and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton entertained 'Daily Show' host Jon Stewart on Tuesday with her latest series of playful hints about running for president . The Oval Office at the White House has no corners and is unique among workplaces of world leaders . Clinton's case got somewhat stronger with the publication last month of a memoir, 'Hard Choices,' a book that has since been bumped down best-seller lists by an unflattering retelling of her feuds with Obama. As Stewart held Clinton's book sideways to show the cameras its heft, Hillary quipped that it represented 'a lot of hard choices.' 'Not for your editor.' a playful Stewart shot back. Clinton . later said she 'put my heart and soul into' the book. But reports have . swirled around Washington, including one from famed Hollywood reporter . and former Fox News journalist Roger Friedman, that a ghostwriter did most of the heavy lifting. Brown . University historian Ted Widmer, according to Friedman, wrote the book. Historian Ted Widmer, a onetime Bill Clinton speechwriter, is reportedly the true author of 'Hard Choices' He was a speechwriter near the end of the Bill Clinton White House . years, and conducted many of the interviews that formed the basis for . the former president's own memoir, 'My Life.' The . Comedy Central interview, broadcast in two segments, was marred by a . pair of abrupt cuts. An Associated Press report suggests what was left . out. Clinton and Stewart, the AP writes, 'moved on to a series of national and international issues Clinton faced as secretary of state, including the violence and tension between Israel and the Palestinians.' '""We're really in a terrible dilemma,"" she said, noting there has been an offer of a cease-fire brokered by Egypt that Israel accepted but that was rejected by Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.' 'Part of what I see Hamas doing is, their identity comes from being the violent resistance,' Clinton said, according to the AP report written between the taping and when the show aired. But Hillary's time in the State Department and her book-length retelling of it necessarily took a back seat on Tuesday, even as images of the 'Hard Choices' cover danced on TV monitors in Stewart's New York City studio. It's 'incredibly complex and well-reasoned,' he said. 'And I think I speak for everyone when I say no one cares. They just want to know if you're running for president.' Not so hard: Clinton told Stewart she 'put my heart and soul into' her memoir, 'Hard Choices,' although ghostwriter Ted Widmer reportedly produced the manuscript . Hillary . laughed: 'I was going to make an announcement, but you kind of spoiled . it for me. So I'm just going to have to reconsider.' The . studio audience's earlier cheers had already betrayed their enthusiasm . for a Clinton 2016 ticket, cheers that continued as a half-joking . Stewart seemed to paint her into a corner with a series of questions . culled from a high-school career aptitude test. 'Do you like commuting to work, or do you like a home office?' he asked. 'I've spent so many years commuting that I kinda prefer a home office,' Hillary replied. 'That's where I wrote my book.' As anticipation ratcheted up, Stewart uncorked the next gag. 'Do you have a favorite shape for that home office? Would you like that office to have corners?' he grinned. 'You know,' Clinton replied knowingly, 'I think the world is so complicated, the fewer corners that you have –' The audience's wild cheers drowned out the rest of her sentence. It's 'incredibly complex and well-reasoned,' the comedian Stewart said of Clinton's memoir, 'and I think I speak for everyone when I say no one cares: They just want to know if you're running for president' Other questions were more serious, drawing answers from Clinton that will seem familiar to Republicans who are critical of Obama's 'pen and phone' approach to working around Congress. Asked whether 'the bureaucracy of government [has] become unmanageable,' Clinton replied that America has 'a Congress that is no longer functioning effectively.' She added that presidents face 'a very difficult situation in our executive branch because ... it has not kept up with the times. We don't have the kind of agility and flexibility' other nations enjoy. Her statement seemed to be a veiled reply to GOP critics of Obama's many end-runs around the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, including immigration deportation waivers and numerous unilateral tweaks to the Affordable Care Act. 'We need comprehensive immigration reform,' Clinton said as one reason the White House should have more power.","Clinton told host Jon Stewart that she 'put my heart and soul into' her memoir, despite widespread reports that it was ghost-written for her .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . and Associated Press . President Obama told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that he 'must halt the flow of weapons and fighters' into Ukraine as the U.S. imposed tough new sanctions on Moscow. The tough action, in the form of new sanctions on Russia's lucrative energy and defense companies as well as a handful of Russian banks, was announced by Obama in a half-empty White House press briefing room on Wednesday. It came as his administration struggled for a way to quell a Moscow-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine. The penalties, which Obama said were a response to Russia's 'provocations in Ukraine,' significantly expand on previous U.S. sanctions, which were limited to Russian individuals and companies. 'Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border in Ukraine' and pursue international talks, Obama said. 'I've made this clear directly to Mr. Putin,' his counterpart in Moscow. President Barack Obama escalated U.S. sanctions against Russia on Wednesday in response to the crisis in Ukraine . Unrest: Smoke from a mortar attack rises above Luhansk during clashes between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian fighters . The president said his administration . was 'designating selected sectors of the Russian economy as eligible for . sanctions,' and then applying 'significant but ... also targeted' sanctions to companies in those sectors. 'We . have to see concrete actions and not just words that Russia is in fact . committed to end this conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border,' he told . reporters. 'There are some clear steps that we've asked Russia to take that they haven't taken,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday. 'And that is what has elevated the risk that Russia faces right now as it relates to additional economic costs that could be imposed by the international community,' U.S. officials . said earlier in the day that they were continuing to hold in reserve a . strategy that would cripple entire market sectors in Russia, in case . Moscow launches a . full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Obama warned that with a new round of financial penalties, 'what we are expecting is that the Russian leaders will see once again that their actions in Ukraine have consequences.' The U.S. will continue to help Ukraine 'defend its territorial integrity,' he vowed. Hours earlier, the . U.S. Treasury Department listed the Bank for Development and Foreign . Economic Affairs, Gazprombank Gas Industry, Rosneft Oil Co. and the . Joint Stock Company Military-Industrial Corp among the sanctioned . entities. They are among Russia's largest business entities, but will no longer be permitted to borrow funds on the American market for medium- and long-term periods of over 90 days, The New York Times reported shortly after a closed White House conference call with journalists. The companies will still be able to conduct overnight loans and other short-term banking business. During the same brief press conference, Obama announced that Afghanistan had agreed to abide by the results of an international audit of its recent presidential election. He added the U.S. continues 'to support diplomatic efforts to end the violence between Israel and Hamas.' 'Israel has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorize the Israeli people,' Obama declared. 'There is no country on earth that can be expected to live under a daily barrage of rockets, and I'm proud that the Iron Dome system that Americans helped Israel develop and fund has saved many Israeli lives.' But he condemned 'the death and injury of so many innocent civilians in Gaza – men, women and children caught in the crossfire,' and said he would continue to pursue a diplomatic peace. Obama also added that he was considering an extension of Friday's deadline for Iran to make good on its commitments to halt its nuclear weapons program. 'Based on consultations with secretary [John] Kerry and my national security team, it's clear we've made real progress,' Obama said, while acknowledging that gaps remain between America's expectations and what Iran has delivered to date. The president took no questions after he finished reading his statement, and said nothing as a reporter shouted a question about whether he would hit Iran with sanctions similar to those he was leveling on Russia. Campaign: Protesters rally against Ukrainian military action in Donestsk on July 6 after the country tried to seize back more territory from rebels . Conflict: Ukrainian troops move armored vehicles closer to Slaviansk as the government searches for pro-Russian activists blamed for the deaths of 23 servicemen earlier this month . The U.S. announcement came as European leaders met into the night in Brussels to . discuss taking their own measures aimed at helping ease tensions along . Russia's border with Ukraine. EU . diplomats were also looking at penalties that would go beyond the . current travel bans and asset freezes against individuals, though it was . unclear whether their sanctions would go as far the U.S. Until . now, the U.S. has insisted on hitting Russia with penalties in concert . with Europe in order to maximize the impact and present a united Western . front. The European Union has a far stronger . economic relationship with Russia, making the 28-nation bloc's . participation key to ensuring sanctions packages have enough teeth to . deter Russia. But those same economic ties have made Europe fearful that tougher penalties could boomerang and hurt their own economies. The . White House's willingness to punish Russia without European backing . comes as the Obama administration faces criticism that its repeated . warnings about tougher sanctions are little more than empty threats. 'Sometimes . I'm embarrassed for you, as you constantly talk about sanctions and . yet, candidly, we never see them put in place,' Republican senator Bob . Corker said during a Senate hearing on Ukraine with administration . officials last week. Obama said he was considering an extension of Friday's deadline for Iran to show it had halted its nuclear weapons program, but ignored a reporter's shouted question about whether he might impose new economic sanctions on the Islamic republic . The U.S. and Europe have levied coordinated sanctions on Russian individuals and companies connected to Moscow's alleged destabilization in Ukraine. Obama administration officials argue that those penalties have had an impact on Russia's economy, citing International Monetary Fund statistics showing a downgrade in Russia's growth this year. However, officials have acknowledged . that the sanctions have not had an impact on Putin's decision-making in Ukraine. State . Department spokesman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that if Putin 'cares deeply . about his people, about the economy, his own country' the sanctions . would shift his calculus. But Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov blasted . the U.S. in the wee hours of Thursday morning in Moscow, warning that a . Russian retaliation could be 'quite painful and serious.' 'The . new decision by the U.S. administration to lodge sanctions under false . pretenses against a number of Russian businesses and individuals can’t . be called anything other than outrageous and totally unacceptable,' Ryabkov told the Interfax news service. Obama . and European counterparts have vowed to take even broader sanctions . targeting Russia's lucrative energy and defense sectors, as well as . access to financial markets, if Moscow failed to quell tensions with . Ukraine. But it is unclear what the new package of U.S. sanctions would . include. During a Group of . Seven meeting in Brussels in early June, Western leaders warned Russian . President Vladimir Putin those penalties could be levied within a month . if Russia did not meet specific conditions. Unmoved: President Putin has so far failed to react to threats of sanctions from Europe and the U.S. The conditions included recognizing the results of Ukraine's May 25 election and starting a dialogue with President Petro Poroshenko, ending support for the pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine and stopping the flow of arms across the Russian border. The end-of-June deadline the West outlined for Putin came and went with little follow-through from Russia, yet no penalties were levied by the U.S. and Europe. Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the West's failure to follow through on its threat of sector sanctions has raised a 'credibility question' for the Obama administration. 'I think the bluff has now been fully called,' Conley said. If Obama moves forward with unilateral sanctions, he will face opposition from the private sector. U.S. businesses have been pressing the administration to hold off on sanctions that could put them at a disadvantage in the global economy. 'It's not clear to us that breaking commercial ties with the Russia partners, consumers gets anyone to where they want to be,' said Gary Litman, vice president for international strategic initiatives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.","Obama hits gas and oil companies and banks under new measures .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The wife of former Vice President Dick Cheney took a swipe at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday, mocking her claims last month that she and then-President Bill Clinton descended into poverty as they left the White House. During a lunch event in Washington, D.C. hosted by Politico, Lynne Cheney recalled her husband's decision to accept the vice presidential nomination. 'When Dick was asked to be vice president, he thought that was a great idea,' she said. 'I was not so sure. You know, give up your job, give up your house and move. We weren’t ""dead broke,"" excuse me.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Former second lady Lynne Cheney (R) took a shot at Hillary Clinton, saying she and former VP Dick Cheney were not 'dead broke' when they transitioned to a White House campaign . Members of @CODEPINK crashed a Monday afternoon lunch event and interrupted the Cheneys with calls for war crimes prosecutions . Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was roundly criticized in June for claiming she and Bill Clinton were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2001 . Hillary Clinton drew ridicule after an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer in which she said her own family was 'dead broke' in 2001 because or multiple home mortgages. The Clintons have reportedly collected in excess of $100 million for heir public speeches since leaving the White House. Dick Cheney warned that America can't 'wish away the problem' of jihadis in the Middle East, but protesters from the far-left pressure group Code Pink weren't in the mood to hear him. A trio of pink-clad activists were among what a Politico event host called 'the first-ever standing room only Playbook lunch,' and they interrupted . 'Dick Cheney should be tried for war crimes!' shouted one. 'You destroyed Iraq and you're destroying this country!' 'We call for the arrest of Dick Cheney!' yelled a third. The three were escorted out but stole the attention of a rapt crowd, one after another, for nearly three minutes . 'It never gets old,' an annoyed moderator carped. 'I wondered why the line was so long,' quipped Lynne. Politico cut its live video fed for nearly one minute as one of the activists approached the stage and held u pa pair of handcuffs to 'arrest' the former VP. Referring to the disruptive audience members as 'pink ladies' and a 'pink gentleman,' Cheney daughter Lis had her own take. 'That's not what America is about,' she said. 'It's not supposed to be about shouting people down.' Lynne, who is hawking a book about American founding father James Madison, said he would have favored a robust disagreement about government policy, but 'I'm not sure he would have put up with it for quite so many minutes.' She mocked the activists by shouting, political convention-style, 'Four more years! Four more years!' The group gloated on Twitter as the lunch continued that 'we ""ruined"" your lunch because dick Cheney destroyed Iraq.' Former Vice President Cheney said President Obama made a mistake when he withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 . The former vice president weighed in heavily on President Barack Obama's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, deriding him for believing he 'can go in and declare the war is over.'

'I look back on it now and it was absolutely the right thing to do,' he said. Obama, he complained, 'has dramatically reduced the military ... we're delivering pink slips to officers in the United States army.' 'That is absolutely an outrage.' He insisted that Obama should beef up military spending, 'not food stamps or highways.' President George W. Bush, Cheney noted, has 'made a decision that he wasn't going to criticize his successor. ... I'm not bound by those strictures. Some people don't like that.' Answering a question about Obama's implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Cheney agreed with Republican critics and said 'I think he exceeded the limits of his constitutional authority.'","'When Dick was asked to be vice president, he thought that was a great idea,' said Lynne Cheney .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . While an estimated 400 illegal immigrant children stream across America's southwest border every day in August, President Barack Obama will take a 15-day vacation in a $12 million home nearly as far away as it's possible to travel in the continental United States. The pricey real estate belongs to a wealthy Connecticut widow whose late husband, then a General Electric executive, made $6,900 in donations to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008 – then the maximum allowed by law. 'On Saturday, August 9th, the president and the first lady will travel to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts,' a White House official said Wednesday. 'They will remain there until Sunday, August 24th, when they will return to Washington, D.C.' Sprawling: President Obama's family will vacation in August at this $12 million home at 72 Gosnold's Way in Chilmark, Massachusetts . Paradise lost: The Obamas will live for half of August in this expansive summer home while the Middle East is in turmoil and a border crisis grows in the American southwest . Ready for another vacation: Obama spoke about the U.S. in the liberal Texas enclave of Austin on Thursday as Secret Service and a massive advance team prepared to help his family bug out for half of next month . 'There are no public events scheduled at this time.' Private events, however, will take place in a $12 million, 8,161-square-foot house with seven bedrooms and a whopping nine bathrooms. The property in Chilmark, Masschusetts sits on 10 acres of forested meadow and features an infinity pool and hot tub, along with a tennis court that doubles as a basketball court. The weekly Martha's Vineyard Times was first to report on the White House's officially secret choice. The First Family's has visited the tony Massachusetts island five times since Obama became president. Last summer they stayed in a 5,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house owned by presidential donor David Schulte. This year's vacation spot is owned by wealthy widow Joanne Hubschman, whose husband Henry died of cancer in 2011. Four years earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, he made two $2,300 contributions to Hillary Clinton's doomed presidential campaign. He donated another $2,300 in August 2008, after Obama had sewn up the nomination, to help retire Clinton's campaign debts. Two months later, just two weeks before the general election, Mr. Hubschman contributed $2,300 to Obama's campaign. Mrs. Hubschman herself contributed $1,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1998. She could not be reached for comment. Hillary won the support of Henry Hubschman in 2008, but the late GE executive's wife is renting their summer home to the Obama's in August .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Hillary Clinton has accepted her husband Bill's philandering ways but told him that 'when we are back in the White House, he'll have to behave,' according to a new book by former Newsweek editor Ed Klein. That's 'when,' not 'if.' But Hillary's apparent certainty about her presidential plans has taken a back seat in reviews of the book, 'Blood Feud,' to accounts of vicious backbiting between the Clintons and the Obamas. Even tales of exploits of the former 'first cheater' have garnered little notice. According to Klein, Hillary told friends that Bill is 'having another of his middle-age crises.' And she doesn't seem to mind. No more 'Slick Willie': 'I've told him that when we are back in the White House he'll have to behave,' Hillary Clinton told her friends last year, Ed Klein writes in Blood Feud . During one of Bill Clinton's whirlwind trips across the world, he met with 'the playboy king of Spain' King Juan Carlos I in Madrid . 'We accept . each other as we are and chase our collective dream,' Klein quotes her as saying to a group of confidantes. 'All that s**t of . throwing things at him and yelling is in the distant past.' The specter of the former president being properly referred to as America's 'first gentleman' has produced eye-rolls and chuckles in Washington, given his penchant for being seen with gorgeous starlets and famed Lotharios in exotic locations. 'During one recent whirlwind trip around . the world,' Hillary reportedly told her friends, Bill 'started off in Hollywood with Charlize Theron . at an event for GLADD, the gay and lesbian advocacy group.' 'Then he went . to Peru with Scarlett Johansson; jetted off to Madrid to spend a few . days with Juan Carlos, the playboy king of Spain; went next to London to . meet Elton John and his husband David Furnish, then was off to Vienna . for an AIDS benefit with his new best friends Eva Longoria and Carmen . Electra.' It was all part of a conversation in May 2013, two months after Hillary left the State Department, at the French restaurant Le Jardin du Roi near the Clintons' home in Chappaqua, New York. 'This guy is unstoppable,' she reportedly told her friends. 'I've told . him that when we are back in the White House,' she added, according to . Klein, 'he'll have to behave. He laughed hysterically. We are at that . point where we can joke about it. You have to love him. I do.' The revelation came as the Washington Free Beacon published audio excerpts from a series of interviews the Clintons did in the 1980s with a reporter who planned to write a profile for Esquire magazine. 'When a person gets to be a certain age it’s hard to change a lot,' said Clinton, then hovering around 40 years of age. 'But . I think I have been able to change some of my bad habits, and to shore . up my weaknesses a little better, set up a system which helps my . strengths.' On the same trip, Clinton, center, attended the Life Ball in Vienna with musician Elton John, center left . Actress Eva Longoria, right, is named in Blood Feud as one of Bill Clinton's gal pals. They are pictured here participating in a panel discussion on achieving economic and social mobility at the Clinton Global Initiative on June 13, 2013 in Chicago, Illinois . In Hillary Clinton's 2013 dinner conversation, Klein writes, she also bashed president Obama and his leadership style, calling him 'incompetent and feckless' and saying 'you can’t trust the motherf***er.' 'The thing with Obama is that he can’t be bothered and there is no hand on the tiller half the time,' she is said to have barked in a boozy rant. ‘That’s the story of the Obama presidency. No hand on the f***ing tiller.’ 'Obama has turned into a joke,' she declares in Klein's account. 'The IRS targeting the Tea Party, the Justice Department’s seizure of AP phone records and James Rosen’s emails – all these scandals. Obama’s allowed his hatred for his enemies to screw him the way Nixon did.' The Clintons have been under a renewed spotlight since the publication of Hillary's memoir, 'Hard Choices,' and her ham-fisted media interviews in which she claimed she and Bill were not among America's richest elites. Financial disclosures, however, put their worth in the eight-figure range. And they routinely pull in between $200,000 and $500,000 for public speeches.","The former secretary of state has made her peace with Bill Clinton's bed-hopping, according to Ed Klein's latest tell-all book .

Cochran appeared to win a primary run-off on Tuesday against tea party darling Chris McDaniel, a state legislator. But McDaniel hasn't conceded the race and may challenge it before the result is certified on July 3. His campaign claims that pro-Cochran forces organized thousands of Democrats to cross party lines and support Cochran in the Republican primary, voting illegally after they had already cast ballots in the June 10 Democratic primary. About 61,000 more people voted in the runoff than in the Republican Primary, a development that hasn't been seen in Mississippi since 1984. Political shenanigans tied to Cochran's side of the race include racially charged 'robocalls' and radio ads, paid for by a PAC friendly to Cochran and founded by former Gov.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The aggressive Republican chairman of a House investigative committee demanded Monday that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen explain – in person – how 28 months of emails to and from embattled former official Lois Lerner were 'lost' to a computer crash. California Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote to Koskinen in reaction to his agency's claim Friday that the IRS no longer has copies of emails between Lerner and anyone outside the IRS from January 2009 through April 2011. Lerner is at the center of a scandal involving years of intrusive screening of conservative groups that sought tax-exempt status beginning in 2009. Hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received approval. Issa demanded in his letter on Monday that Koskinen appear in a rare evening hearing on June 23, a half-day before he's scheduled to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee. 'I will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game-playing in response to the Committee’s investigation of the IRS targeting,' he wrote. Scroll down for video . Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen will be hauled before two House committee hearings next week to explain how Lois Lerner's emails could have been lost despite robust data-retention standards in the U.S. government . Cruella de Washington: Lois Lerner retired with a full government pension and has refused to testify about her role in a years-long scheme to target tea party groups with politically imbalanced scrutiny . 'For too long, the IRS has promised to produce requested – and, later, subpoenaed – documents, only to respond later with excuses and inaction.' Lerner officially retired, with a full pension, in late 2013. House Republicans passed a Contempt of Congress resolution against her along party lines this year, after she twice refused to testify in open committee hearings. Legal analysts disagreed about whether she had waived her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by giving a lengthy statement during one hearing, in which she claimed she 'broke no laws' and 'did nothing wrong.' It was Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican congressman, who whipped up a dust storm after the IRS first claimed the records were 'lost.' The IRS informed the committee on Friday that many records were not backed up on servers, tapes or external drives. Its own guidelines require that 'IRS officies will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail messages that are federal records ONLY on the electronic mail system.' It also requires its offices to back up email messages to 'a separate electronic recordkeeping system.' Camp and Rep. Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said Monday that 'we are simply not going to accept the IRS claim that these documents are not recoverable. We will demand the president live up to his promise to work ""hand in hand"" with Congress to get the facts.' The two lawmakers wrote to President Obama on Monday, asking for its records of emails between Lerner and employees the White House, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Election Commission and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration. That move came hours after committee staff interviewed government employees charged with running the IRS's internal computer networks. A committee aide told MailOnline that those IRS workers confirmed that budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials' access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives. They also said, according to the aide, that other executive branch agencies have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the IRS. Camp and Boustany asked Obama to order 'an exhaustive search for all Lois Lerner emails' throughout the executive branch. Republicans hope to establish whether or not Lerner colluded with Obama administration officials to play political favorites and single out right-wing groups for special scrutiny. But the White House is likely under no obligation to cooperate. President Obama has already referred to the IRS matter as one of several 'phony scandals' that he believes are politically motivated. Yet in May 2013 when the scandal first erupted, Obama pledged that his administration would 'make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.' Subpoena: Rep. Darrell Issa is demanding Koskinen show up for an evening interrogation on June 23 . The Ways and Means Republicans threw that phrase back in the president's face on Monday. 'In order to ensure accountability and “get this thing fixed,” please provide ... all communications between Lois Lerner and any persons within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) for the period between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2011,' they wrote. 'Also, please indicate in writing when the EOP [Executive Office of the President] was informed, and by whom, that the IRS had lost critical Lerner documents.' In the House Oversight Committee, Issa hammered Koskinen for promising in a March 26 hearing that he would deliver every email Congress sought. At the time, however, he insisted that it would take 'years' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the IRS isn't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government. And simply searching through Lerner's individual email storage, Koskinen said then, wouldn't produce an exhaustive record. 'They’re stored somewhere,' he explained to Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz during the hearing. 'They get taken off and stored in servers and you’ve got 90-thousand employees,' he insisted, but 'we can find, and we are in fact searching – we can find Lois Lerner’s emails.' At the time, he didn't mention the computer crash which became an overnight butt of jokes among conservatives. 'It's OK. The NSA has the original files,' Capitol HIll speechwriter Amanda Carpenter tweeted. 'Wonder what the #IRS would say if we told them we couldn’t submit tax documents because of a computer crash?' replied her boss, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. 'Wheel of Fortune' game show host Pat Sajak, who has begun wearing his conservatism on his sleeve in recent years, tweeted: 'Weird. Hundreds of emails to & from someone named Lerner just showed up in my spam. Must be British. Lots of tea talk.'","Next week will see brutal hearings before two House committees investigating how the IRS targeted tea party groups with special scrutiny .

"By . Associated Press . and David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Supreme Court on Thursday limited the president's power to fill high-level vacancies with temporary appointments, ruling in favor of Senate Republicans in their partisan clash with President Barack Obama. The high court's first-ever case involving the Constitution's recess appointments clause ended in a unanimous decision holding that Obama's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board in 2012 without Senate confirmation were illegal. Obama invoked the Constitution's provision giving the president the power to make temporary appointments when the Senate is in recess. Problem is, the court said, the Senate was not actually in a formal recess when Obama acted. Scroll down for video . Closely watched decision: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that presidents can't trump the U.S. Senate and make 'recess appointments' when legislators insist they're not in recess . Spitting into the wind: A frustrated Obama forced his picks onto the NLRB but the Supreme Court said he overstepped his legal authority . Obama had argued that the Senate was on an extended holiday break and that the brief sessions it held every three days — what lawmakers call ""pro forma"" — were a sham that was intended to prevent him from filling seats on the NLRB. The justices rejected that argument Wednesday. Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said Thursday on the Senate floor that Obama clearly overstepped his constitutional authority. 'No president in history had ever attempted to make recess appointments when the Senate said it was in session. ...  These illegal appointments represent just one of the important areas where President Obama has disregarded the law with his philosophy of ""the ends justify the means"",' Grassley said. 'We should all be thankful the Supreme Court has reined in this kind of lawlessness on the part of this administration.' Grassley declared that Thursday's ruling is 'the Supreme Court’s biggest rebuke to any president since 1974, when it ordered President Nixon to produce the Watergate tapes.' Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander piled on, insisting that 'the Constitution gives the Senate powers the executive branch cannot usurp.' 'Our founders wanted a President, not a king,' he blasted, 'and our Constitution is written to protect against precisely the kind of overreach this president demonstrated.' Justice Stephen Breyer said in his majority opinion that a congressional break has to last at least 10 days to be considered a recess under the Constitution. Neither house of Congress can take more than a three-day break without the consent of the other. The issue of recess appointments receded in importance after the Senate's Democratic majority changed the rules to make it harder for Republicans to block confirmation of most Obama appointees. But the ruling's impact may be keenly felt by the White House next year if Republicans capture control of the Senate in the November election. The potential importance of the ruling lies in the Senate's ability to block the confirmation of judges and the leaders of independent agencies like the NLRB. A federal law gives the president the power to appoint acting heads of Cabinet-level departments to keep the government running. Torpedoed: Obama put two Democrats -- former senior counselor to the Secretary of Labor Sharon Block (L) and former International Union of Operating Engineers general counsel Richard F. Griffin, Jr. (R) -- on the NLRB unconstitutional ly, the Supreme Court said . Still, the outcome was the least . significant loss possible for the administration. The justices, by a 5-4 . vote, rejected a sweeping lower court ruling against the administration . that would have made it virtually impossible for any future president . to make recess appointments. The . lower court held that the only recess recognized by the Constitution is . the once-a-year break between sessions of Congress. It also said that . only vacancies that arise in that recess could be filled. So the high . court has left open the possibility that a president, with a compliant . Congress, could make recess appointments in the future. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for . himself, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and . Clarence Thomas, said he would have upheld the lower court's reasoning. He said Thursday's decision means ""the abolition of the Constitution's . limits on the recess-appointment power."" A . recess appointment can last no more than two years. Recess appointees . who subsequently won Senate confirmation include Chief Justice Earl . Warren and Justice William Brennan, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan . Greenspan, two current NLRB members and Consumer Financial Protection . Bureau director Richard Cordray. Former UN Ambassador John Bolton is . among recess appointees who left office because they could not win a . Senate vote. The case . challenging the appointments was brought by Noel Canning, a soft drink . bottling company in Yakima, Washington. The company claimed an NLRB . decision against it was not valid because the board members were not . properly appointed and that the board did not have enough members to do . business without the improperly appointed officials. Senator Chuck Grassley said Obama's appointments were 'illegal,' and claimed Thursday's decision was 'the Supreme Court¿s biggest rebuke to any President since 1974, when it ordered President Nixon to produce the Watergate tapes' Noel Canning prevailed in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and two other appeals courts also had ruled against recess appointments. Obama has made relatively few recess appointments, 32 in his four-plus years in office, according to the Congressional Research Service. President George W. Bush made 171 such appointments over two terms and President Bill Clinton filled 139 posts that way in his eight years in office, the research service said. But Obama was the first president to try to make recess appointments when Congress explicitly said it was not in recess. The Constitution requires that the Senate and House must get the other's consent for a break lasting longer than three days. At the end of 2011, the Republican-controlled House would not give the Democratic-led Senate permission for a longer break. The partisan roles were reversed during Bush's presidency, when Senate Democrats sought ways to prevent the president from making recess appointments. In fact, the very basis on which the justices decided the case — that the Senate can use extremely brief sessions to avoid a formal recess — was a tactic devised by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada to frustrate Bush.","Obama appointed three people to the National Labor Relations Board in 2012 while the U.S. Senate was taking a break from regular business .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This is the shocking moment a tombstoner hurled himself off a historic Brunel bridge - plunging more than 60ft into the water below. The young man was caught on camera leaping from Royal Albert Bridge, which was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and spans the River Tamar between Plymouth and Saltash, Cornwall. Donning black swimming shorts, he scaled scaffolding surrounding the crossing, before jumping the height of two houses into the cold water. The tombstoner is just one of many youngsters who locals claim are 'risking their lives' by throwing themselves off the famous bridge. Scroll down for video . Shocking: This is the moment a tombstoner hurled himself off the Brunel-built Royal Albert Bridge in Saltash, Cornwall - plunging more than 60ft into the water below . Aaron Dinham, who photographed the man's daring leap, said: 'Whenever the weather is nice, and the tide is high, there can be up to 15 kids jumping from the pier and pontoon. Now they have found a way of getting onto the scaffolding that is surrounding the pillar of the Brunel railway bridge. 'They are using it as a diving board for their tombstoning. The height they are jumping from is crazy, and I guess it's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt.' It comes as emergency services, MPs and . city councillors have issued warnings to young people about tombstoning over the summer months. The craze involves jumping from cliffs, piers and other structures, before entering the water below in an upright position 'like a tombstone'. Yesterday, Alison Seabeck, Plymouth Moor View MP and former lifeguard, urged parents the region to help clampdown on tombstoning. She said young people are seen jumping from rocks and structures on Plymouth Hoe - often into shallow water - every year, and some have even been left paralysed by tombstoning. Massive leap: Donning black swimming shorts, the tombstoner scaled scaffolding surrounding the crossing, before jumping the height of two houses into the cold water . She added that tombstoners are not only risking their own safety but the lives of others as their exploits draw emergency services from other areas. 'We need to put an end to this tombstoning practice in Plymouth,' said Ms Seabeck. 'It's simply not safe. All we can do really is keep raising awareness of the problem. 'If you are a parent or a carer I would encourage you to talk to your sons and daughters and remind them of how dangerous tombstoning is. 'There are some beautiful areas of Plymouth's shoreline to visit and enjoy, you don't have to risk your life.' Ms Seabeck said she believes tombstoners do not know how dangerous their actions are, saying: 'It always staggers me that intelligent young people will throw themselves off a wall on the Hoe into the water. Famous: Royal Albert Bridge, opened by Prince Albert on May 2, 1859, spans the River Tamar between Plymouth on the Devon bank and Saltash on the Cornish bank . 'They often do not know exactly how deep it is and, with the changing tides, they do not know how dangerous their actions are. We have had very serious accidents where people have been left crippled or paralysed and yet year after year it happens again. 'As a former lifeguard I can tell you there is seriously nothing more terrifying than seeing jumping into the water and not immediately reappearing.' Royal Albert Bridge, which was opened by Prince Albert on May 2, 1859, comprises two 455-feet iron trusses, situated 100 feet above the water, giving it a total length of 2,187 feet. Its creator, Isambard Kingdom Burnel, was an English mechanical and civil engineer whose designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police, today described tombstoning, which is not illegal, as a 'potentially lethal pursuit'. 'The summer holidays and warmer weather can attract tombstoners into Plymouth,' he said. 'Tombstoning is a reckless activity and even in calmer waters it can be extremely dangerous. 'We, along with the Coastguard, are trying to deter young people from this potentially lethal pursuit and we strongly advise against it. 'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters. 'It is unfortunately the case that if they carry on they are likely to end up with serious, life-changing injury or even death. This risk-taking behaviour is just not worth it.' A spokesman for Brixham Coastguard said the issue of tombstoning is a recurring problem for Plymouth. 'Over the last few weeks we have had reports of tombstoning in Plymouth and we do look into each case,' she said. 'When these reports come in we inform the coastguard patrol boat, or the police patrol boat in the area, to have a word in the ear of tombstoners offering safety advice. It's a problem we have every year. It's something the kids will do but they are advised not to because of the dangers. 'There have been cases over the years of kids getting seriously hurt. This is something of course that we want to avoid. Tombstoning has been linked with numerous deaths in Britain in recent years.","Young man was captured on camera hurtling himself off Royal Albert Bridge, built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . House Majority Leader Eric Cantor refused Wednesday to explain how he lost his seat in Congress a day earlier, telling reporters in Washington, D.C. that he would 'leave the political analysis to y'all.' He flatly refused to navel-gaze about whether his stance on illegal immigration signaled the end of his political career, or to speculate on whether he had drifted too far away from his conservative base and joined the dreaded 'Republican establishment.' Responding to a question about the conservative-moderate divide plaguing the GOP, he would say only that 'what divides Republicans pales in comparison to what divides us conservatives from the left.' Cantor, who lost his Republican primary Tuesday night in a result that left the Republican Party shell-shocked, said just 18 hours later that he would step down as House Majority Leader on July 31. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Crushed: Eric Cantor lost a 56-44 decision to economics professor Dave Brat on Tuesday and won't be back in Congress next January . Cantor, a seven-term Virginia congressman, said he had no regrets about his time in Washington, but refused to speculate about why he had lost in historic fashion . That will leave enough time for the House Republican caucus to choose a successor before the November election season heats up. He endorsed Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy for the job. McCarthy, a Californian serving in his fourth term, is currently the majority whip, the official in charge of 'whipping' votes and maintaining party discipline. 'I will be backing him with my full support,' Cantor announced. Despite widespread beliefs that his willingness to embrace some reforms to the U.S. immigration system ultimately cost him the primary election, Cantor said his views haven't changed. 'I have always said the system is broken. It needs reforms ... one step at a time,' he said. He was particularly rankled by the cases of so-called ""DREAMers,"" illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. 'I would like to see the issues of the kids addressed,' he said. But the Virginian drew a sharp line between his position and the White House's: 'I don't believe in this my way or the highway approach that the president has laid out.' Dave Brat, a political unknown who teaches economics at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia, took 56 per cent of the vote on Tuesday, driven by Virginians' fears that increased immigration would choke off jobs and lower wages. Brat persuaded voters that Cantor, despite his preference for a limited slice of immigration reform options, backed a Barack Obama-style 'amnesty' program that would give 11 million illegal immigrants a path to U.S. citizenship. Meet the press: Outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Va. said after a House Republican caucus meeting that he will resign his leadership post on July 31 . Cantor said he had no regrets about his seven terms in Congress. 'We House Republicans have made some tremendous strides over the past few years,' he said, citing his party's advocacy for school vouchers, medical research, budget cuts and 'protecting the elderly' from Obamacare. 'We forced the reduction of spending in Washington in consecutive years for the first time since the Korean War,' he said. Pressed on his sudden lack of tea party credentials – points that swung to Brat on Tuesday – Cantor admonished the press not to misunderstand the movement's purpose. 'Remember what TEA party stands for: Taxed Enough Already,' he said. 'All of us conservative Republicans believe in that.' 'Conservatives have solutions that can help alleviate the middle-class squeeze and provide opportunity for all.' Dave Brat, right, defeated Cantor in the Republican primary on Tuesday, marking one of the most improbable American political victories in the history of party primaries . He also slammed Senate Democrats for allowing 'a stack of bills' to accumulate – legislation already passed in the House – despite their habit of referring to House Republicans as a 'do-nothing' caucus. Cantor also pushed back against claims that he had spent more time hobnobbing with donors and working with lobbyists, as part of his leadership role, than working on his constituents' needs. 'I was in my district every week,' he insisted. 'There's a balance. ... Never was there a day when I did not put the citizens of the 7th District of Virginia first.'","Cantor took questions in a brief session following an emergency meeting of the House Republican caucus .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Jailed: Michael Webster, 49, from Streatham Hill, London, was today jailed for stealing £75,000 from his clients to prop up his diamond business in Ghana . One of Britain’s top black lawyers was today jailed for stealing £75,000 from his clients to prop up his diamond business. Michael Webster, 49, took tens of thousands of pounds from the client account of his firm Webster Dixon LLP, which made history as first company founded by black lawyers in the City of London. He then funnelled the cash into the account of a business associate who hoped to make money on diamonds in Ghana. When . the deal failed to go through, he tried to take out a loan to cover . the loss, but was arrested after his bookkeeper spotted discrepancies in his accounts. Today Webster, a former chairman of the Black Solicitors Network, has been jailed for eight months after pleading guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position at London's Old Bailey. The court heard that the lawyer had made four withdrawals totalling £75,605.57 from the client account at Webster Dixon LLP between December 3, 2012, and February 1, 2013. Leee Ingham, prosecuting, said the law firm had been in financial difficulty at the time. He told the court: ‘What Webster was really doing was speculating with someone else’s money. The firm was suffering financially and that is the primary motivation.’ He added that the diamond deal had, in fact, turned out to be an advance fee fraud operated by criminals in Ghana. Webster, a former lawyer at Lehman Brothers International, set up his own firm in 1998 after four years as a partner at Conway & Co. Solicitors. He was named in the Lawyer Magazine ‘Hot 100’ in 2004 and described as ‘one of an influential new generation’ of lawyers. In July that year, he was elected as a . Council Member of the Law Society and the following year, he joined the . board of the City of London Law Society. Shamed: Webster (above) took tens of thousands of pounds from the client account of his firm Webster Dixon LLP. He then funnelled the cash into the account of an associate who hoped to make money on diamonds . In November 2007, Webster was elected chairman of the Black Solicitors Network, the largest organisation for minority lawyers in Europe. He also spent four years as secretary for the Society of Black Lawyers. Tyrone Smith, defending, told the court that Webster's good character and references from dozens of fellow lawyers, including a former President of the Law Society, meant he should be spared jail. He said: ‘This man has been broken by his conduct. He will never be able to . practise in the job he loves, his standing amongst his friends is . indelibly stained by his actions. Firm: Webster Dixon LLP (above) made history as first company founded by black lawyers in the City of London . He has brought the good name of his family into disrepute. There is not a day that goes by that he doesn’t consider it.’ He added that the lawyer had always . intended for the money to be returned to the client account once the diamond . deal had been successful. ‘The firm stood to receive significant . fees for the success of the deal,’ he said. ‘This is not a case where . there is a simple taking of clients’ money to enrich the defendant.’ But Judge Nic Madge told Webster that his behaviour had been so serious that he had no option but to send him to prison. He told me: 'You abused a position of trust not just as a solicitor but as a compliance officer for finance and administration in the firm. ‘I accept the motivation for the fraud was financial pressure. This is a personal tragedy for you and your family. ‘You have let yourself down, you have let your family down. You have let your professional partners and your clients down. You have thrown away what you have worked so very hard to achieve.’ Webster, from Streatham Hill, south London, was originally accused of plundering a total £104,000, but the prosecution later admitted the true figure was £75,605.57. He has already paid back £27,000 and has promised to repay the rest of the money. He also faces being struck off by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.","Michael Webster stole £75,000 from clients of his firm Webster Dixon LLP .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . The brother of murdered teenager Jimmy Mizen has been mugged at knife-point - just yards from the bakery where his sibling was killed. George Mizen, 15, was walking along the road opposite the Three Cooks Bakery in Lee, south-east London, when he was approached by a teenage boy. The thug threatened to stab him unless he handed over his iPhone and iPod, before taking the possessions and fleeing the scene. Victims: George Mizen (left), the brother of murdered teenager Jimmy (right), has been mugged at knife-point . It comes just six years after George's older brother was murdered at the bakery in 2008 in a crime that provoked national outrage. Jimmy, 16, a former altar boy, bled to death after 19-year-old Jake Fahri, threw a glass dish at his throat, severing his jugular vein. Yesterday, George's mother Margaret told the Sunday Mirror how her son had immediately handed over his possessions for fear of being attacked like his brother. She added that the attack had brought back horrific memories, saying: 'When this happened we were . devastated. One reason in particular is that George is precious to all . of us in this family. The second is this attack happened directly . opposite to where Jimmy was killed. Scene: George, 15, was walking along the road opposite the Three Cooks Bakery in Lee, south-east London, when he was approached by a teenage boy. His brother Jimmy was murdered at the bakery in May 2008 . 'It was kind of like déjà vu, kind of like history repeating itself.' Following the robbery, George immediately called the police, who tracked down his attacker. The teenager was arrested and is believed to have later pleaded guilty to robbery at youth court. Speaking of the thug's arrest, Mrs Mizen said: 'I did an impact statement and in that we talked about Jimmy as this boy wouldn’t have known about him and the pain that these things caused.' Incredibly, she said George, who works for the Jimmy Mirzen Foundation in his spare time, had told her he did not want his attacker to go to prison. Trial: George and his mother Margaret attend the trial of murderer Jake Fahri at London's Old Bailey in 2009 . She added that the teenager had previously been attacked by three youths in the wake of his brother's death. The trio were arrested following the 2012 assault and forced to meet George face-to-face, she said. Jimmy was murdered in May 2008 after Fahri started threatening him in the bakery in Burnt Ash Hill. During the altercation, Fahri hurled a 12-inch hot glass dish at the schoolboy's chin, piercing his neck and severing his jugular vein. Jimmy managed to stagger into the . rear of the bakery, and into a cupboard, to . shield himself from Fahri, where his older . brother Tommy found him covered in blood. He died in his brother's arms. Siblings: Jimmy (left) died in his brother Tommy's (right) arms after he was hit in the throat with a glass dish . In 2009, Fahri was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 14 years after being convicted of murder at London's Old Bailey. A Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm a robbery took . place in Burnt Ash Hill, near Lee railway station, on Monday, June 9. 'It was investigated. A 15-year-old boy was arrested and pleaded guilty to robbery at youth court. 'He was given a nine-month youth referral order. He also had to pay £85 costs and a £10 victim surcharge.' The spokesman added that he could not confirm the names of those involved in the incident.","George Mizen, 15, attacked opposite Three Cooks Bakery in Lee, London .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A gang of 11 boys beat to death their eight-year-old classmate because they were bored, Chinese police said today. The boys, aged between nine and 13, allegedly attacked Zhang Tai in the street just near the city of Zhangjiakou in north-west China's Hebei province. They reportedly beat him up, before leaving his battered and bruised body lying beside the road. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Killed: Zhang Tai, eight, was beaten to death by a gang of boys near Zhangjiakou in China, police said today . Tai was taken to hospital with bruises and severe head injuries, but was later declared dead. Today, police said the gang had confessed to killing their classmate after deciding they were bored and looking for something interesting to do. Police spokesman, Cong Lu, said the idea had been apparently suggested by a ringleader, who had been seen with Tai and the other boys in the minutes leading up to the attack. 'We are interviewing all of the boys now to try to find out the extent to which each was involved,' she said. Scene: The 11 boys, aged between nine and 13, allegedly attacked the victim in the street in Hebei province. They reportedly beat him up, before leaving his battered and bruised body lying beside the road (pictured) Horrific: Tai was taken to hospital with severe head injuries, but was declared dead. Above, his bruised body . Tai's grandfather, Zhang Kuo, 67, said he had left the young boy playing in the yard, but when he went out later to see him there was no sign of the child. He said another boy had told him that Tai had gone off with a group of boys because 'they promised not to beat him any more if he agreed to go with them.' 'I was instantly worried . because I know that one of them is a bully,' said Kuo. 'My grandson told me that he . had to call the boy ""Big Brother"" and that whenever he wanted someone to . follow him he would either threaten them, or if he couldn't threaten . them would provide them with food from his father's shop. Bruised: A massive bruise is pictured on the youngster's body after he was attacked by the gang of 11 boys . 'He didn't like . my grandson because he had refused to hand over his pocket money and . later complained to his mother.' Tai's father Zhang Han, who works as a bricklayer, said his son had often been the victim of local bullies. 'I . have to go to the local town to work so my son is being raised here by . my grandfather, and without parents he was often the victim of local . bullies,' said the 42-year-old. 'He . told me that the pocket money I gave him was often stolen by local boys . and he didn't like going to school because he was picked on. But I . never realised things had got this bad.' Happier times: Today, police said the gang had confessed to killing their classmate after deciding they were bored and looking for something interesting to do. Above, Tai is pictured at his family home . He added that he and Kuo are are suing both the local school for failing to stop the bullying and the parents of those involved in the alleged murder. 'When my wife left me and our son two years ago it was hard to find the strength to go on, but knowing that Tai was healthy and well helped me keep going,' he said. 'He was everything to me, and now he's gone I don't know what I'm going to do.

"By . Kevin Keane . and Sophie Jane Evans . Country star Garth Brooks has rejected a deal to stage two matinee gigs to complete his five-show comeback special in Dublin. The 52-year-old singer was offered the extra gigs on the weekend of July 26 and 27 at Croke Park, to take place before a second night-time show on each day. It was proposed by Dublin City Council as a way to break the standoff over the cancelled concerts. Rejection: Country star Garth Brooks, 52, has rejected a deal to stage two matinee gigs at Croke Park in Dublin . But now, Brooks has turned down the offer, saying it 'cannot possibly compare to a five-night straight run' and would be too much for him at his age. In a webcast at 5pm yesterday, he also highlighted the logistical challenge of having 160,000 fans descend on Croke Park each day. ‘I don’t have a problem with matinees but sticking 160,000 people out in the middle of the day, I don’t know if I’m more worried for them than me because I’m getting older,’ he said. ‘I personally would do whatever it takes except cancelling on people. We sold 160,000 tickets to people who were coming to see the full show, and that show is only full at night.’ World tour: Garth will anounce plans for a major global tour next week . Last night, following tense behind-the-scenes talks, Aiken Promotions also confirmed the proposal was 'not feasible'. And Brooks’s U.S. publicist Nancy Seltzer remarked: ‘To treat 160,000 people differently than all the rest who will be seeing the show the way it was meant and created is wrong. ‘He does not understand why it is once again put upon him to treat people less than they deserve to  be treated and he still returns to why did they allow five shows to be sold and all these people to be disappointed. It is not his decision – it is, with the greatest of respect, the city council’s.’ Earlier this week, Brooks issued an all-or-nothing ultimatum when city chiefs granted permission for just three out of the five planned sold-out gigs, which 400,000 people have booked tickets for. Public support: Marie Gorman, 69, holds a poster from Garth Brooks' 1997 concert at Croke Park. She is one of thousands protesting the cancellation . The star, who has sold more than 130million albums, said to choose one show over another 'would be like asking to choose one child over another'. He told a press conference: ‘If the Prime Minister [Taoiseach Enda Kenny] himself wants to talk to me, I would crawl, swim, I will fly over there this weekend, sit in front of him. ‘I will drop on my knee and beg for those 400,000 people to just have fun and let them come see. That’s what I want to do.' Thousands of fans were given brief hope as news emerged of a potential breakthrough yesterday evening - with many hoping all five gigs would get the go-ahead, with a break between the final two. Shortly before 7pm yesterday, the council said that after a meeting between city manager Owen Keegan and Aiken Promotions, they would allow two matinee shows on the afternoons of the weekend concerts. ‘Following a meeting this morning between Peter Aiken of Aiken Promotions and Owen Keegan, chief executive of Dublin City Council, the City Council has agreed to a proposal from Aiken Promotions designed to break the impasse that has arisen,’ a statement said. The council suggested that the matinee shows ‘will allow everybody who bought a ticket to see Garth Brooks’. ‘It will be a matter for Aiken Promotions and Garth Brooks to decide if they wish to pursue this suggestion,' it said. A spokesman added that the proposals involved ‘having the same concert on twice in the same day’. But Brooks's management later rejected the proposal, telling Dublin Lord Mayor Christy Burke it would be unworkable for the star, who is known for his high-octane shows. Sources close to Mr Aiken told the Irish Independent: 'This was nothing short of a flyer, a possibility. And it is quite clear it ain't going to run. 'To stage two concerts in the afternoon would be a logistical nightmare'. Taoiseach: It comes as Enda Kenny (pictured) has snubbed an appeal from Brooks to intervene in the matter . It comes as Taoiseach Enda Kenny has snubbed Brooks's emotional appeal for him to intervene in the matter. He told the Irish Daily Mail that it was ‘not a case of Mr Politician moving in on top of the law and saying, “You have to do this”’. He said: ‘We have processes and legal systems in the country here, at the same time we have a very can-do attitude and I think the progress made today by the City Manager and the promoter and all of the organisations involved have put on the table here a potential solution to this so lets see.’ ‘Mr Keegan made his decision in accordance with the law and his responsibilities so it’s how can you move it from that to a realisation that these concerts can take place, so let’s see, we will continue to show an interest in hoping that it might be able to happen.’ The Taoiseach added: ‘People [near Croke Park] have withdrawn their objections and as the representatives of the people down in the Dáil, we would like to see these things happen so I hope that’s one potential solution that might be accepted and we will see what happens.’ Speaking on Primetime on RTÉ last night, Dublin Lord Mayor Christy Burke still didn’t rule out Garth Brooks making a comeback. ‘I’m not going to say “never never”,’ he said. ‘To my knowledge the management team are still on board. I got a  call from my source at Aiken promotions asking for a review of the  plans tonight. I would like to see everybody facilitated, and if that is by having two gigs in three nights than so be it.’ Meanwhile, Eamon O’Brien, chairman of the Croke Park Streets  Committee, described the situation as a ‘crisis’. He said: ‘The way that the community has been affected by this is quite enormous, there’s been division, and a man who wanted to take a case has been threatened. ‘This is not proper social responsibility coming from Croke Park.’ 'Croke Park needs and wants Garth': During the fiasco a split emerged among residents living near the site . Elsewhere, Mr Kenny revealed that he was a fan of Garth Brooks. He indicated he had tickets for one of the concerts, adding that he would be one of the 400,000 people who would be ‘out at the moment’ because of the cancellations. He said people had been sending him their letters and their texts about the plans they had for the concerts and the arrangements they had made. He said: ‘For those who are big followers of Garth Brooks music this would [have been] a wonderful occasion.’ During his online press conference yesterday, an emotional Brooks said: ‘Today we should all be laughing and joyous but there’s a cloud hanging over us. ‘Up until ten days ago it was nothing but love. Then came the thing, they said “Hey Garth, we’re okay with three of them you’re going to have to do figure out the other two.” ‘I wish I knew where that came from. It’s a simple yes but for some reason the system keeps throwing it back here.’ He added: ‘The reason why it’s a dark cloud: everybody in Ireland who is sad about this you’re not one billionth as sad as I am. ‘I’m the real loser here, I’m the guy who’s out the greatest experience of his life. ‘You can’t talk about a future [for large scale events] in Ireland until Ireland has a system that works. Let those five shows be played and fix the laws after that. It’s a simple fix. ‘But for some reason the problem keeps getting thrown back here. ‘The system should be looking at itself saying we have flaws.’ He continued: ‘You have a gentleman in a certain political position and he’s standing by that decision. Let that gentleman do his job  but there should somebody who should walk over to him and  say, “We’re going to allow these  people to come and sing and have a good time.” ‘I don’t have a clue how we got here. All I know is that the powers that can fix it are not there. ‘It’s a simple yes, open up for five nights, let everybody have fun then go to work on never letting it happen again. Create your laws, create  your guidelines but don’t sell a  show to people and get their hopes up that you’re going to just cancel on them and that’s okay. I don’t think that’s okay. ‘Everybody knows we don’t do golden circles. We don’t elevate tickets or drop tickets for people with more money. We treat everybody equal. It’s the luck of the draw.’ He added: ‘I want to hear “Garth, welcome to Ireland”. I was there six months ago and I heard “Garth, welcome home”.’ It is understood that a solution to the matter must be found by Monday.","Garth Brooks has rejected deal to stage matinee gigs at Croke Park, Dublin .

The accused woman was spotted travelling from her home for a secret rendezvous with boyfriend James Terrano in a Seattle park on Wednesday. During the emotional hour-long meeting, she could be seen sobbing and speaking animatedly to Terrano, before cuddling up to him against a wall. At one point, the University of Washington student was also pictured reaching into her purse and withdrawing what appeared to be $100 in cash. The mystery meeting comes just days after Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend contradicted her account of the night of the murder of 21-year-old English student Meredith Kercher. Scroll down for video . Mystery meeting: Amanda was seen smiling as she handed over a handful of cash to boyfriend James Terrano during their rendevous in a Seattle park on Wednesday . Handing over cash: The 26-year-old removed what looked to be a handful of $20 bills from her purse, before placing the money in Terrano's hand in an emotional meeting . Strained: During the emotional hour-long meeting, Knox could be seen sobbing and speaking animatedly to Terrano, before cuddling up to him against a wall (pictured). The mystery meeting comes days after Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend contradicted her account of the night of the murder of 21-year-old English student Meredith Kercher . In . January, an Italian judge re-convicted 26-year-old Knox and her former . partner Raffaele Sollecito of killing Miss Kercher, who was found dead in a pool of blood in the bedroom of her home she . shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007. Her . throat had been slashed and she had been sexually assaulted. Both . Knox and Sollecito have always denied any involvement in Miss Kercher's . death, claiming that they spent the evening at Sollecito's place getting . high, having sex and watching a movie. But earlier this week, the 30-year-old Italian's lawyer said that Sollecito could not be sure that Knox was with him for the first part of the evening. The lawyer has pointed to phone records showing that Knox was away from his house – . information that he plans to use as an alibi to try to prove his . innocence. However, he insisted he wasn't trying to pin the murder on the American. It has also recently been reported that Italian prosecutors are preparing . to use Knox's alleged ties to a cocaine dealer to extradite her back to . Italy. Court . documents allegedly showed that the exchange student had . called a drug dealer in the days before and after Miss Kercher was killed. Tears: The Washington University student was photographed crying during the secret rendezvous with boyfriend James Terrano. Earlier this week, it was also reported that Italian prosecutors are preparing to use Knox's alleged ties to a cocaine dealer to extradite her back to Italy . Embrace: After looking close to tears Amanda has a hug with Terrano . Relief: In a lighter moment during their rendezvous the pair look relaxed and happy as they both break into natural smiles while chatting in a park . Serious: The pair appeared to be having a deep conversation in the Seattle park after Amanda handed over what appeared to be a wad of cash . More upbeat: The couple did, however, smile during their meeting. Terrano wore a Knicks hat while Amanda was similarly dressed down showing her newly cropped hair . Speaking of Knox and Terrano's park rendezvous this week, an eyewitness said: ‘It seemed very strange and . Amanda is clearly in a very bad place right now, because she broke down . crying several times. ‘It . looks as though she and James may be having major relationship trouble, . if they are even together still. It was also strange that they went all . the way to this secluded park to exchange money – perhaps they didn’t . want anyone to see what they were up to?’ Close-up images appear to show Knox looking relieved after the meetup. The . pair then embraced and her spirits were noticeably lifted as she and . Terrano shared a tender hug. Later, the two went their separate ways . looking visibly downcast. The eyewitness added: ‘They hugged one more time and Amanda kept looking over her shoulder, back at James as she walked away. ‘It really looked like they were breaking up with each other, but who knows why she paid him?’ Comfort: Amanda holds on to Terrano's hand tightly as they walk through the Seattle park . New look: In an appearance dramatically altered from her days in Perugia, Amanda was seen sporting a boyish haircut and glasses, wearing pink harem pants, a tank top adorned with crosses and a pair of black clogs with socks . Amanda looks lost in thought as the pair walk up a hill . Under pressure: The couple visited a coffee shop as part of the date and appeared locked in meaningful conversation. Amanda Knox has suffered a series of blows to her legal case in recent days with even her ex-boyfriend and co-accused Raffaele Sollecito stating that he thinks her story has anomalies . Prior . to their clandestine date in the park, Knox and Terrano had met at a . Seattle coffee shop, where the accused student was seen breaking down in . tears and wiping her eyes during a tense encounter that lasted over an . hour. The witness . said: ‘She had her glasses off and was sobbing. Terrano was side by . side next to her, and they were clearly having a very animated . discussion. ‘At . one point she was writing something down in a book. She got up several . times to go to the bathroom, presumably to wipe her eyes and fix herself . up.’ Sporting . a boyish haircut and glasses, Knox was photographed during the park . rendezvous wearing pink harem pants, a tank top adorned with crosses and . a pair of black clogs with socks. Knox, who turns 27 later this month, has been in the U.S. since 2011. She has vowed she would never . 'willingly' return to Italy to face her fate in court. Anxious: Amanda chews her nails and looks nervous as she checks her phone after seeing Terrano . Dressed down: Amanda Knox was dowdily dressed . for the meeting with her boyfriend James Terrano. She looked anxious as . she waited for the young man and removed her long-sleeved top to reveal a . pair of mismatched vests underneath . She . left the country right after an earlier appeals court ruling overturned . the initial lower court conviction that had led to her imprisonment . abroad. Knox has said she is hopeful Italian courts will 'once again recognize' her innocence. The . January ruling against Miss Knox included a 28-1/2-year prison sentence . for her and a 25-year sentence for her co-defendant, Sollecito. The pair had previously served four years in prison for the murder, . before an appeals court acquitted them in 2011. Rudy Hermann Guede, an Ivorian man, was convicted separately in the slaying and sentenced to 16 years in prison. The appeals . panel that reinstated the conviction against Knox in her British . roommate's 2007 murder said that the American herself delivered the . fatal blow out of a desire to ‘overpower and humiliate’ the victim.

The bus, which had only seven seats, was returning the children home through a mountainous village in the southern Hunan province yesterday when it swerved off the road, state media said. It plunged into the water, killing all 11 people onboard, including two teachers and the driver. Crash: Eight children and three adults drowned when this kindergarten bus crashed into a pond in China . The van was pulled out of the pond early today with the children and a driver inside, according to Xinhua News Agency. The bodies of the teachers were recovered an hour later.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Prison: Unlicensed cab driver Paul Causer, 39, drove a clubber to the Surrey countryside and raped her, a court heard today . An unlicensed taxi driver who drove a clubber to the countryside and raped her was caught after an iPhone app tracked his cab, a court heard today. Paul Causer, 39, picked up the 31-year-old woman as she queued at a taxi rank outside McQueen bar in Shoreditch, east London, in the early hours of the morning. He then drove her 22 miles to a secluded spot in Godstone, Surrey, before forcing her to perform a sex act on him. But he was caught after the victim left her iPhone in the car - and its 'Where's my iPhone' tracker app revealed his location. Now, Causer has been jailed for 11 years after being convicted of rape at London's Old Bailey. The court heard that Causer, from Deptford, south-east London, had picked up his victim after she had been out drinking with a friend on August 3 last year. The woman told him she had no cash to get back home to Battersea, south London, so he agreed to drive her to a nearby cash point and withdraw the £20 fare they had decided on. But when they pulled up to the cash point, Causer was filmed on CCTV making several unsuccessful attempts to take £300, £200, . and £120 from her account using the PIN code and bank card she had . given him. He then drove the victim to Bone Mill Lane, Godstone, while she slept on the back seat of the cab. He knew the lane was secluded because he had previously attended ‘dogging’ sessions there, the court heard. At this point, the woman woke up and realising she was not at home, pleaded: 'Why are you doing this to me? I'm a good person.' But Causer ignored her pleas - and instead, forced her to perform oral sex on him, the court heard. He then told her something was wrong with his car and forced her to climb out, before speeding off at around 5am. Secluded: Causer picked up the 31-year-old woman as she queued at a taxi rank in Shoreditch, London. He then drove her to Bone Mill Lane (pictured) in Godstone, Surrey, before forcing her to perform a sex act on him . Distance: The defendant drove the woman 22 miles, from Shoreditch to Godstone (pictured), to attack her . The woman was later discovered by a security guard, who led her to safety and called the police. Officers launched an investigation and found Causer had borrowed the car from a friend. They then successfully tracked down the vehicle using the victim’s iPhone app. Sentencing Causer, Judge Anthony Morris QC said: ‘You chose that location [Bone Mill Lane] because it was remote, unlit and a no through road. ‘You did so with a view to forcing her to have oral sex with you. 'You were familiar with the lane because . you had been there previously on dogging expeditions to take part in . sex activities there.' Bar: Causer picked up the victim as she waited at a taxi rank outside McQueen bar (pictured) in east London . He added: ‘I am satisfied you realised how drunk and vulnerable [the victim] was. 'You . tricked her into getting out of the car and drove off, abandoning her . at 5am in total darkness in a country lane she was unfamiliar with.’ Judge Morris said the woman’s life had been shattered by the rape, and she is now considering leaving the capital because of the ordeal. ‘She still replays the events in the lane in her mind, day and night’, he said. ‘The sheer horror of it remains, and she feels you have taken away her trust in people. ‘She found it difficult at first to leave the flat, and even now she is not carefree. She and her partner are now seeking work away from London because she no longer feels safe here.’ Causer, who admitted three counts of attempted theft before the case began, was convicted of one charge of rape but acquitted of theft by a jury at an earlier trial. His family have abandoned him following the conviction, and no one has visited him in prison, the court heard. Causer was handed eight-month concurrent sentences for each of the attempted thefts. He used a crutch to get into the dock and showed no emotion as he was led away.","Paul Causer, 39, picked up 31-year-old woman at taxi rank in Shoreditch .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Scandal: This is the 18-year-old British girl who was filmed performing sex acts on 24 men at a nightclub in Majorca's notorious party capital, Magaluf . The shocking video of a British girl performing a sex act on 24 men in Majorca was the result of cheap alcohol and an 'everything-goes' party culture, it was today claimed. The two-minute footage shows the 18-year-old blonde working her way through holidaymakers at a nightclub in the island's notorious party capital of Magaluf. Donning . pink hotpants and a white vest top, she was cheered on by revellers as she moved from man to man, encouraging each of them to take their . trousers down. The DJ apparently counted . the number of men she notched up on the dancefloor, while playing . the song Sexy and I Know It. Now, it has been claimed that the girl's actions were influenced by an 'out-of-control' party atmosphere in which everyone was 'wasted'. A man called Kieran, 26, who said he was at the club at the time, said the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party organisers she would win a 'holiday'. But her prize, in fact, reportedly turned . out to be a cocktail named 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach . schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur and fruit juice. 'It was a game that got . completely out of hand,' Kieran told The Sun. 'The girl was being encouraged to drink more and more and was told she would win a ""holiday"" if she took part in this game. 'Unfortunately the ""holiday"" turned out to be the name of a cocktail.' Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take part in the game, told the newspaper the girl had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture. 'This girl's gone on holiday, got . fuelled with alcohol, someone's suggested it, she's smashed and thought . it's a good idea,' he said. The reality TV star was reportedly asked whether he wanted to be 'number 25', but declined, sticking his middle finger up at the girl who then walked away. Speaking to The Mirror, . he said he been taking part in the bar crawl, but had decided not . to take part in the sex game because it was 'the most shocking thing I've . seen.' However, he added that he would not hesitate to go back to the infamous party island. Scene: Party capital: The unnamed girl was captured on video working her way through men at Alex's Bar (pictured) in Magaluf. Today, it was claimed her actions were the result of cheap alcohol and a party culture . Footballer Nathan Redmond was among Twitter users who condemned the act, calling it 'sickening' Under . Ellie Stevenson branded the footage 'vile' as social media users took . to Twitter to vent their outrage after the minute-long clip was posted . According to the newspaper, the young Britons taking part in the bar crawl had . been plied with unlimited free alcohol for more than four hours before . the video was shot. Footage of the girl's actions were later posted online and quickly went viral, . sparking outrage among local politicians and women's rights groups. Last . night, police launched an inquiry into the incident, which took place . during an event organised by Carnage Magaluf at Alex's Bar. TV star: Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video, said the girl had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture . In . the video, the men can be seen sporting T-shirts from Carnage Magaluf, . which takes young Britons on pub crawls and is not linked to Carnage UK, . a separate party organiser. Meanwhile, several holidaymakers are captured taking photos of the 'game' on their mobile phones. The girl, . who reportedly works as a mobile phone sales rep, is believed to have . flown to Spain for seven-night holiday with a friend last month. Locals immediately suggested she was British, as are the vast majority of tourists in a resort which has a reputation for excess. Dozens . of posts about the incident appeared on Carnage Magaluf's Twitter feed, . with some claiming it happens ‘everywhere every day’. Reports said other tourists were being offered free drinks in similar sex competitions. But the footage has been described by many as a new low in Magaluf, where pub crawls were . regulated for the first time this year following complaints. Yesterday, Spanish mayor . Manu Onieva voiced his ‘absolute indignation’ and said police were . investigating the practice that local press have dubbed ‘mamading’ – a . play on the crude Spanish word for a sex act, ‘mamada’. Benefits Street star White Dee was a . guest of Carnage Magaluf in May and was photographed at a party wearing . the company’s T-shirt. The . 42-year-old mother of two, real name Deirdre Kelly, claims £10,000 a . year in benefits but flew to the resort despite being ‘too depressed’ to . work. She . returned to the resort last month and had been due to go on another pub . crawl organised by the firm. Party capital: Magaluf, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe. It is especially popular with British tourists (file picture) Backlash: The images have provoked a debate on Twitter, with some coming to the defence of the girl . Spain’s Women’s Institute called it ‘degenerate, discriminatory and unfair’ towards women. The . More for Majorca opposition party demanded that the activity be . penalised, saying it was ‘an absolutely irresponsible and unhealthy way . of enjoying leisure time’. Politician David Abril asked: ‘Where is the responsible tourism we all want?’ Residents . of Magaluf have long complained about drunken Britons wreaking havoc on . the island, injuring themselves during all night drinking sessions and . blocking off roads through towns.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This is the chilling moment two killers tried to pull their victim's severed leg out of a boat propeller after pushing him overboard and deliberately running him over. Paul Gerlach, 51, and Louis Borzoni, 50, got into a drink-fuelled argument with 30-year-old Rico Dardis as they cruised on a speedboat off the coast of Christchurch Bay in Dorset. They pushed the father-of-one overboard, before running him over with the boat's propeller - ripping both of his legs from his body. Chilling: Paul Gerlach (left), 51, and Louis Borzoni (right), 50, are caught on camera trying to pull 30-year-old Rico Dardis's severed leg out of a boat propeller after pushing him overboard and deliberately running him over . Killers: Gerlach (left) and Borzoni (right) got into a drink-fuelled argument with Mr Dardis as they cruised on Gerlach's Maxum powerboat, 'No Chance', off the coast of Christchurch Bay in Dorset on May 27 last year . They were later spotted trying to unclog the propeller of Gerlach's Maxum speedboat, 'No Chance', after returning to shore. A . shocking photograph, taken by a beach-goer, shows Gerlach looking over . the side of the boat while a blood-soaked Borzoni can be seen checking . the stern. As they examined the vessel, a passing couple noticed a torso . floating in the sea and asked the pair what it was, to which Borzoni replied: 'Oh, maybe it's a dummy'. Police . were called and Mr Dardis's dismembered body was discovered floating in . the surf, while one of his legs was found entangled in the boat's . propeller. Victim: Mr Dardis, a father-of-one and an aspiring rapper, had both of his legs ripped off by the boat's propeller . Now, Gerlach and Borzoni have been jailed for life after being found guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court. Sentencing the pair, the Honourable Mr Justice Blake told them the last thing Mr Dardis would have heard before he died would have been the sound of a propeller approaching. 'Neither of you have shown any remorse for his (Mr Dardis’) death,' he said. 'You have shown a callous disregard for his dignity as a human being. 'You, Mr Gerlach, deliberately drove the boat over him causing catastrophic injuries. 'You, Mr Borzoni, were aware of what he was going to do and were in agreement with it. Scene: Police were alerted after a couple noticed a torso floating in the sea off Christchurch Bay (pictured) 'You have deprived a family of a son and a nine-year-old of a father and that relationship and guidance for the rest of his life.' At an earlier hearing, the court heard that a fight had broken out between Gerlach, Borzoni and Mr Dardis, who had been drinking vodka and beer, on May 27 last year. Mr Dardis, described as a 'talented freestyle rapper' by his family, was pushed off the back of the speedboat into the sea, before Gerlach turned the boat round, 'whacked the throttle down' and ran into him. At around 9pm, families relaxing at Christchurch Bay called the police . after spotting Gerlach and Borzoni acting suspiciously onboard the . broken boat as they returned to shore. Far . from calling for help, the pair were trying to unclog the propeller, before walking away laughing and joking, jurors were told. After abandoning the vessel, Gerlach and Borzoni took a taxi to nearby Southbourne to purchase more alcohol, the court heard. During the . journey, the taxi driver questioned them about the blood on their . clothing, to which they replied: ‘Yeah, we murder’, before adding ‘Ha, . just joking’. The pair were arrested after driving . back to the car park - where they had left a bag containing a bloody . towel and a meat cleaver - at around 10pm. Court: Gerlach and Borzoni have been jailed for life at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) after being found guilty of murder. Gerlach was sentenced to a minimum term of 17 years, while Borzoni was given 15 years . Both defendants were later secretly taped confessing to the murder - Gerlach to his estranged wife and Borzoni to his brother. Gerlach claimed Mr Dardis’ death had been an accident, while Borzoni chose not to give evidence. Gerlach, of no fixed address, was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum term of 17 years. Borzoni, from Boscombe, must serve a 15-year minimum term. Mr Dardis's relatives, who sat in court for the sentencing, said in a statement: 'Rico was a loving, caring son, brother and dad. 'We have been blessed to have had him in our lives. The horrific way Rico lost his life will stay with us forever. It has been the most difficult an heartbreaking time of our lives. 'But his light and spirit will live on, and we will make him proud and remain strong as a family unit.'","Paul Gerlach, 51, and Louis Borzoni, 50, started arguing with Rico Dardis .

'Destruction of the animal was the last resort. Public safety and animal welfare were considered after all other efforts to restrain the animal were unsuccessful.' Aberdeen Coastguard first spotted the black cow swimming among boats in the busy turning basin at the harbour, around half a mile away from the spot where it dived in, this morning. An RNLI inshore lifeboat were scrambled to the scene, but the crew found . the were forced to keep their distance because the 'distressed' animal kept charging at the vessel.

Rescuers managed to get the cow out of deep water and onto a narrow sea-wall on the quayside by 9.15am, while shipping vessels and large oil and gas supply boats sailed by just 100 yards away. There, they made several attempts . to coax the animal to a sloped area as the tide continued to rise. However, the cow refused to . cooperate with them and could be seen growing increasingly tired as crowds gathered along the quay to watch the drama unfold. Battered and bruised: As the hours went by, the tide continued to rise, battering the stricken cow with waves . Harbour . authorities could be heard on dockside radios ordering stunned boat . captains to stay to the south side of the harbour as 'there . is a cow in the water'. As the hours went by, the tide continued to come in, battering the stricken animal with waves. At one point, the cow could be seen walking towards the inner harbour, before seemingly changing its mind and returning further out towards the port exit to the North Sea. 'A last resort': At around 1pm, rescuers decided they were left with no choice but to call in police marksmen, who shot the cow as a 'last resort' (pictured). Dozens of onlookers watched as the cow collapsed in the water . At around 1pm, rescuers decided they were left with no choice but to call in police marksmen, who shot the cow twice as a 'last resort'. Dozens of onlookers watched as the animal collapsed in the water, before lifeboat crews attached a rope to its body and dragged it out of the harbour by tug boat.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This is the moment a drunken burglar was caught on camera by a home-owner as he fled over a garden fence. Darren Thomas, 38, tried to break in through the kitchen window of a property just around the corner from his own house in Ronkswood, Worcester. But he fled after he was spotted by 27-year-old owner Chris Hancock, who had just returned home. Snapped: Darren Thomas was caught on camera trying to flee over a garden fence in Ronkswood, Worcester . The teacher ran outside and snapped Thomas as he climbed over a fence, before sprinting off across neighbouring gardens. He then showed the photo to police, who recognised the burglar and arrested him later that day. Thomas admitted attempted burglary and resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty at Worcester Magistrates' Court on Friday. But he escaped jail after magistrates sentenced him to five months in prison, suspended for two years. Scene: The 38-year-old tried to break in through the kitchen window of a property (pictured) just around the corner from his own home in Ronkswood, Worcester. But he fled after he was spotted by owner Chris Hancock . Sentencing Thomas, Judge Nigel Cadbury told him: 'If you had already broken in and were caught inside the house by the householder with that record, you would be going to prison immediately.' Clare Linehan, prosecuting, said Thomas, who appeared at court on crutches, had been spotted by Mr Hancock trying to remove the beading from the kitchen window on April 28 this year. 'The householder came home and there was a confrontation, albeit through a window,' she said. Caught: Mr Hancock took a photo of Thomas as he climbed over a fence at his property (pictured) '[He] had come back to let the dog out. As he walked into the kitchen he saw a man at the window and he realised he was trying to break in to his property.' She added that when Thomas was confronted by police later that day, he had resisted arrest, saying: 'He started to resist, pulling his arms away, and tried to get back into his home address.' Judith Kenney, defending, told the court that Thomas had turned to drink after he lost his job as an auditor and his 18-year marriage had collapsed. 'On the defendant’s own admission he was trying to get the beading off the window with a multi-tool for a child’s bike when having been spotted, he garden hopped to get away,' she said. 'He admitted this offence from the word go in the police station. He was ashamed and mortified by what he had done. She added: 'He was only not co-operative [with the arrest] because his children had been upset.' Speaking outside court, Mr Hancock said he had acted out of instinct, adding: 'Luckily, the picture helped police find him.' In addition to his suspended sentence, Thomas was placed . under supervision for two years, ordered to undergo alcohol treatment . for 12 months and placed on an electronic curfew between 7pm and 7am. He was also ordered to pay £100 compensation to his victim and an £80 victim surcharge.","Darren Thomas tried to break in though the kitchen window of a house .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The dust coughed up by stars during their death throes has always been a mystery to scientists. But trying to analyse the behaviour of this interstellar material involves going into deep space - and up until now that has hindered efforts to understand it. Now researchers at Nasa have found a way around this problem by designing a machine that can create interstellar dust from scratch here on Earth. A close up image of interstellar dust created by the Cosmic machine. This grain is approximately 1.5 micrometers in diameter. For comparison, a bacteria cell is around 5 micrometers . The device, dubbed Cosmic, could help astronomers better understand the types of grains that form around stars. Dust grains that form around dying stars and are thrown out into the cosmos can lead to the formation of planets. ‘The harsh conditions of space are extremely difficult to reproduce in the laboratory, and have long hindered efforts to interpret and analyse observations from space,’ said project leader Farid Salama. ‘Using the Cosmic simulator we can now discover clues to questions about the composition and the evolution of the universe.’ Dust grains that form around dying stars and are thrown out into the cosmos can lead to the formation of planets and are a key component of the universe's evolution . The team started with small . hydrocarbon molecules that they expanded in the cold jet spray in Cosmic . and exposed to high energy in an electric discharge. Nasa . then detected and characterised the large molecules that are formed in . the gas phase from these precursor molecules with highly sensitive . detectors. Cosmic  then collected the individual solid grains formed from these complex molecules and imaged them with a microscope. In the past, the inability to simulate space conditions in the gaseous state prevented scientists from identifying unknown matter. The Cosmic Simulation Chamber (Cosmic) could change this by recreating the extreme conditions that reign in space where interstellar molecules and ions float in a vacuum. The densities found in space are billionths of Earth's atmosphere and average temperatures can be less than -167ºC (-270ºF) ‘We now can for the first time truly recreate and visualise in the laboratory the formation of carbon grains in the envelope of stars and learn about the formation, structure and size distribution of stellar dust grains,’ said Cesar Contreras of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute. ‘This type of new research truly pushes the frontiers of science toward new horizons.’ The device, dubbed Cosmic, could help astronomers better understand the types of grains that form around stars and uncover secrets how Earth-like planets form . The team started with small hydrocarbon molecules that they expanded in the cold jet spray in Cosmic and exposed to high energy in an electric discharge. Nasa detected and characterised the large molecules that are formed in the gas phase from these precursor molecules with highly sensitive detectors. Cosmic then collected the individual solid grains formed from these complex molecules and imaged them with a microscope. ‘During Cosmic experiments, we are able to form and detect nanoparticles on the order of 10 nm size, grains ranging from 100-500 nanometers and aggregates of grains up to 1.5 micrometres in diameter, about a tenth the width of a human hair,,’ said Ella Sciamma-O'Brien, of the BAER Institute and a research fellow at Nasa. These results have important implications and ramifications not only for interstellar astrophysics, but also for planetary science. For example, they can provide new clues on the type of grains present in the dust around stars. That in turn, will help us understand the formation of planets, including Earth-like planets.","Grains around dying stars are a key component of universe's evolution .

"By . Ray Massey . You and I might think  potholes are a bad thing – but the roads minister has claimed they are actually the sign of a booming economy. Robert Goodwill said craters are being caused by the recovery, as more people get jobs and use their cars to get to work. He also claimed that streets are suffering more wear and tear as consumer spending rises – causing an increase in the number of delivery drivers on the roads. The transport minister says potholes are being caused by the recovery, as more people get jobs and use their cars to get to work . His comments came days after Home Office minister James Brokenshire gave a similar explanation for a huge backlog of passport applications. He told the House of Commons that delays were due  to a ‘significant surge’ in applications which was ‘an indication that as the economy is improving more people are understandably planning to travel’. Tory Mr Goodwill told LBC Radio yesterday: ‘We have seen more traffic on the roads – we have seen a 4 per cent increase in traffic in the first quarter of this year in comparison to a year ago. ‘That is because more goods are travelling around as the economy improves, more people are travelling to work as they get jobs, so this means the roads are getting more wear and tear.’ His claims came after the Government revealed how it would spend £168million to end the ‘menace’ of potholes by filling in more than  three million before the next general election. To secure cash from the Pothole Repair Fund, local authorities will have to publish monthly progress updates on how many they have fixed. Some 148 councils applied for funding, and ministers said every single one will receive a share. All repair works will have to be completed by the end of March next year – two months before the next election. Robert Goodwill claimed streets are suffering more wear and tear as consumer spending rises . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘Potholes are the bane of all our lives and the funding announced today is an important step in ridding our roads of this menace.’ The AA welcomed the cash injection, but warned that potholes were not the only road maintenance ‘menace’ that needed to be tackled. The group’s president Edmund King said: ‘Potholes in the  UK have been a long-running scourge that has cost tens  of thousands of car owners millions of pounds in repair bills,  and councils millions in compensation claims. The new government money is very welcome, but it will only be truly effective if roads are re-surfaced on time and not just patched up after each winter.’ The AA also called for a fund to allow councils to switch street lights to cheaper, greener  and more fuel-efficient technologies rather than switch them  off altogether.","Tory MP Robert Goodwill said craters are being caused by the recovery .

A 10-year-old boy was viciously attacked by two dogs in Bellambi on Tuesday afternoon, one of which was a German shepherd. Pictured is a stock image . 'The owners surrendered the animals,' he said. Dog lovers have leapt to the defence of the animals and their owners on social media, saying that the house had a ‘Beware of the dog. Enter at your own risk’ sign on the front fence. 'I'm sick of innocent dogs getting put down because of the negligence of others. Who's property did he go on?????????' Ryan Micallef posted on the NSW Police Force Facebook page. 'It's a horrible incident but all children should be taught never to enter someone's yard with out permission specially if there is a gate n it's shut. Dogs r protective they were doing there job! I'm so sorry for this boy n his injuries poor little man may all of us with small children take from this to educate them on dangers entering yards both from animals n strangers,' Sam Gafa wrote. Meanwhile Sherri Meredith wrote: 'Kid shouldn't have walked into the back yard. Might teach him to knock on a door and ask next time instead of just walking onto someone's property! I feel sorry for the dogs.' The boy was taken to Wollongong Hospital after paramedics were called and he was later airlifted to  Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick, where he underwent surgery. As of 1.30am Wednesday morning, the young boy's condition was not known a police media spokesperson said. A spokeswoman for the Sydney Children's Hospital said the boy's mother was 'very distressed' and did not wish to release any information about her son's condition. The young boy was bitten on his legs, arms, hips, stomach, buttocks and head in a gated front yard, by the dogs including an American Staffordshire. Pictured is a stock image . Police were told the boy was looking for his brother with a friend and the two had been door knocking before the boy entered the yard. His friend was not involved in the dog attack and remained on the footpath while it happened, reported The Daily Telegraph. A police media spokesperson confirmed that Wollongong Council  had been notified of the dog attack and was investigation. Police are also currently investigating the attack. This incident was the latest in a spate of reported dog attacks on young children in the Bellambi area on Tuesday. NSW Ambulance Illawarra district inspector Terry Morrow confirmed paramedics received two unrelated dog attack reports in the area, neither matching the incident reported by police, reported the Illawarra Mercury. Also at Waley Avenue, paramedics attended an 11-year-old who had be bitten by a small dog, and the child was taken to Wollongong Hospital with minimal bleeding and a few small puncture wounds, Mr Morrow said. After a dog bit a 10-year-old on the buttocks, the child went to Wollongong following the attack in Bellambi’s Whitby Mews, also on Tuesday. For treatment of a small wound, the child was transferred to Sydney Children’s Hospital by road ambulance. The spate of dog attacks on children on Tuesday took place in Bellambi, north of Wollongong .","Boy, 10, in hospital in serious condition following dog attack in Bellambi .

"By . Sarah Michael . Residents were evacuated from a unit block in Sydney's eastern suburbs after an overloaded power board which was resting on top of a pile of clothes caught fire. Fire and rescue workers were called to the four-unit block in Randwick at 6.43pm on Tuesday night where they extinguished the blaze. Firefighter Nicolas McGuiggan, who attended the scene, said the fire broke out in a male tenant's bedroom in Unit Four where there was a laptop, mobile phone and other personal electrical items. Fire and rescue workers were called to the four-unit block in Randwick, Sydney on Tuesday night after a blaze broke out . The incident was cause by an overloaded power board resting on a pile of clothes which caught fire . Six people were evacuated safely from the block and one was treated for smoke inhalation by an ambulance . 'The tenant had a laptop and a few other electrical devices plugged in and charging,' Mr McGuiggan said. 'There was a large amount of personal belongings in the room, clothes, so we believe he'd run a lead and piggybacked another lead and power board off that and it was resting on an external clothes wardrobe. 'We believe heat from that into the clothes has gotten the fire started.' A NSW Fire and Rescue spokeswoman said the incident served as a warning not to overload power boards, especially in winter. This comes after a 28-year-old woman died and a 13-year-old boy was injured by electric shocks from faulty USB chargers - sparking warnings from NSW Fair Trading about the dangerous items and the businesses that stock them. A NSW Fire and Rescue spokeswoman said the incident served as a warning to people not to overload power boards, especially in winter . The residents were not able to stay in the block overnight over fears the roof may collapse . Mr McGuiggan said the man whose unit burned down was home at the time. 'The resident heard some noise, didn't think it was anything and it wasn't until he went back to his lounge room and saw some smoke coming out of his ceiling and he went back to his bedroom and saw it on fire,' he said. 'He quickly closed the door to the room and notified all the other residents and they all evacuated.' Six people were evacuated safely from the block and one was treated for smoke inhalation by an ambulance. Unit Four's second bedroom was totally destroyed by fire, the living room suffered smoke damage and the rest of the unit suffered water damage.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Aap . Paid parental leave should be replaced with a HECS-style loan that parents would repay when they returned to work, a new report says. The Fairer Paid Parental Leave report from The Centre for Independent Studies argues the Abbott government's proposed scheme is poorly targeted, delivering large amounts of cash to the highest-income families. Under government's policy, scheduled to start in mid-2015, a woman will receive her full wage for six months, including superannuation, capped at $50,000. Paid parental leave should be replaced with a HECS-style loan, and parents would repay all but $5000 of the money they received, a new report argues . Report author Matthew Taylor says the government's proposed scheme is expensive and unfair. Instead, Mr Taylor argues for the implementation of a Parental Leave Contribution Scheme which would pay up to 26 weeks of the primary carer's pre-birth wages. But parents would need to repay all but $5000, and repayments would start once they earned above a minimum threshold. Both parents would be responsible for repayments regardless of their relationship status, and the parent with higher earnings would make most of the repayments. Under the government's current proposed policy, scheduled to start in mid-2015, a woman will receive her full wage for six months capped at $50,000 . The report says the expenditure on this PPL loans scheme would cost approximately 12 percent of likely 2016–17 expenditure on the Abbott government's PPL policy – tipped to be more than $5 billion. The government's leave scheme has been criticised for being too generous. 'Despite the Abbott government's claims that the scheme is a productivity measure, the additional $3 billion of expenditure will do nothing to increase women's labour force participation,' Mr Taylor said.' 'The coalition's PPL scheme is also unfair, giving $50,000 to women with incomes over $100,000, but only $16,172 to women earning the minimum wage. The Centre for Independent Studies argues the Abbott government's proposed scheme is poorly targeted, delivering large amounts of cash to the highest-income families . 'I think a fairer approach would be for everyone to fund their own leave through their own future incomes… Not shifting all the cost onto the taxpayer.' The move took money from low-income families and gave it to those who could afford to self-finance their parental leave, he said. The scheme was also excessively costly as many parents, especially those on high wages, already have access to paid parental leave from their employers.","The Centre for Independent Studies proposes a parental leave loan which parents would repay when they returned to work .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Sarah Michael . Andrew Darling was last seen at the Corella Place facility in Ararat, Victoria shortly after 2.30am before he left the facility on foot . A manhunt is underway after a child rapist took off his tracking device and escaped from a correctional facility yesterday morning. Andrew Darling was last seen at the Corella Place facility in Ararat, Victoria shortly after 2.30am before he left the facility on foot. Corella Place - nicknamed the 'Village of the Damned' - is a village-style complex which houses child sex offenders and rapists who have finished serving their prison sentences but are considered unacceptable risks to the community. Police searched the facility and found the man's tracking device, but not the man. Darling served nine years in prison for raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000. He assaulted the girl in her bed after breaking into her family’s home to commit a burglary. He was released from Port Phillip Prison in May 2009 but went missing from his Ararat home the day after he was released, breaking his parole and prompting a police search. Police are urging rural landowners in the Ararat area to remain vigilant around sheds and outhouses on their properties and to report anything suspicious to police. Scroll down for video . Police are hunting Andrew Darling after he removed his tracking device and escaped from Corella Place correctional facility in the early hours of Sunday morning . Corella Place - nicknamed the 'Village of the Damned' - is a village-style complex which houses child sex offenders and rapists who have finished serving their prison sentences but are considered unacceptable risks to the community . Detective sergeant Peter Hawkins from Ararat Police said there had been no confirmed sightings of Darling. He added that police were again searching Carella and the construction site at Ararat prison.'Suffice to say all areas locally are being searched thoroughly,' Det Serg Hawkins told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're unable to say if he's local or further afield. 'Our inquiries are panning out across the state and Australia.'Also any residents who notice stolen food or clothing should contact police. The 42-year-old is described as caucasian, about 176cm, with a medium build, blue eyes, fair, close-cropped hair, and a fair complexion.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Aap . Japanese cars are set to become a lot cheaper for Australian consumers after Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sign an economic partnership agreement. Mr Abe and wife Akie arrived in Canberra on Monday night for the first bilateral visit by a Japanese leader in 12 years. He addressed parliament on Tuesday and will sign the free-trade agreement along with a new deal to transfer defence equipment and technology. Japan is Australia's second-biggest trading partner. Scroll down for video . Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott in Canberra on Tuesday. Prime Minister Abe is in Australia for three days and will sign a Economic Partnership Agreement with Australia . International trade expert Alan Oxley said the main benefit for Australian consumers would be the reduced cost of Japanese cars. 'The government has indicated there's a tariff of 5 to 8 per cent that will come off automobiles,' Mr Oxley, principal of ITS Global, told Daily Mail Australia. Australian Automobile Association chief Andrew McKellar said Japan was the largest source of imported vehicles in Australia and made up about 30 per cent of the market. 'We would estimate [the trade deal] would reduce the amount of tax payable on a new car by about $1000 to $2000,' Mr McKellar told Daily Mail Australia. 'For a larger vehicle like a [Toyota] Land Cruiser the saving is probably closer to $3000.' Toyota is the top selling Japanese brand in Australia but Mazda, Nissan, Honda and Subaru also have significant sales in Australia, he said. Mr Oxley said Japanese electronics and whitegoods are also set to become cheaper, but the tariffs on these goods are much lower than the tariff on cars so the difference will not be as substantial. Japanese cars are set to get 5-8 per cent cheaper for Australian buyers. For a vehicle such as a Toyota Land Cruiser the saving is projected to be close to $3000 . Mr Oxley said the relaxation of investment controls will encourage more Japanese investment in Australia, especially in minerals and gas. 'The economy at large will benefit from more Japanese investment,' he said. The deal is also good news for Australian exporters. The tariff on beef, Australia's biggest export to Japan, will be halved over time delivering an estimated benefit of up to $400 million a year for the local industry. 'We all know Japan's facing some tough economic problems, and they are seeking to try to lower food prices,' Mr Oxley said. 'One way to do that is to reduce tariffs on imports. 'Our cheaper products will go in, and the benefit will spread beyond the Australian beef industry.' Other beneficiaries will include Australian producers of dairy, sugar, wine, fruit, vegetables and seafood. Mr Oxley said the new agreement also made it easier for Australian businesses in the service industry to invest and operate in Japan. Japanese electronics and whitegoods will also be cheaper for consumers . 'Working in Japan requires having to work very hard to get in sync with their cultural values but there should be great opportunities for legal and investment firms to operate in Japan,' he said. But Labor is demanding the federal government reveal the detail of its free trade deal with Japan before the agreement is inked. Opposition trade spokeswoman Penny Wong urged the government to release the full text of the agreement before the 'photo opportunity with the pens and flags'. 'What's the secret?' she told reporters. 'The only information Australians have is a five-page glossy pamphlet.' Trade Minister Andrew Robb said the full text would be released later this month. Japan is Australia's second-biggest trading partner. Picture: People walk on the street in Akihabara Tokyo, Japan. Akihabara is nicknamed Akihabara Electric Town because it's a mecca for household electronic goods . He lauded the deal as the most ambitious trade deal Japan had ever done, pointing out Australia had gotten in first before competitors like the United States. Mr Robb played down concerns from China about Australia cosying up to Japan, saying it was important to have strong security and trade ties with both Asian powers and South Korea. Independent senator Nick Xenophon described the deal as a 'costly and secretive folly'. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed past deals signed with Singapore, the United States, Thailand and Chile had led to worsening trade deficits, he said. 'We are taken for mugs by partner countries,' he said. 'We are known overseas as the Free Trade Taliban because of successive Australian governments and bureaucrats having a fundamentalist, literalist approach to free trade.'

"By . Jennifer Smith . A farmer has been jailed after investigators found 350 dead and dying animals scattered around his land in the 'worst case' ever seen by the RSPCA. James Linsley was sentenced to 16 weeks imprisonment after animals were found 'knee deep' in faeces and gnawing off a horse's carcass to stay alive, Northallerton Magistrates' Court heard. The 29-year-old, who was renting Woodside Farm in West Layton, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to 53 sheep, four cows, ten horses and a dog. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Officers discovered more than 350 dying and dead animals at the farm in the 'worst case' they had seen . Some live animals were found 'knee deep' in faeces according to RSPCA officials who spent a week at the site . Linsley, who was renting the property, was jailed for 16 weeks for his 'atrocious' treatment of animals . James Linsley was sentenced to 16 weeks in jail at Northallerton Magistrates' Court yesterday . RSPCA Chief Inspector Mark Gent said: 'It was the worst case I have seen because of the sheer number of animals involved. 'It was horrendous, the RSPCA were there for a week. 'There were dead and dying animals all over the place, some of this suffering had been going on for months. 'They were not given the food they should have been given.' The court heard how the investigation cost more than £100,000 in vet bills. Mr Gent, who said he was 'pleased' with the sentencing has applied for a disqualification order banning Linsley from keeping animals. Defending Simon Walker said the farmer had been faced with 'the perfect storm' during the cold winter. 'This whole event was without precedent. Medication and food was on the farm, he just couldn't get it into the animals quickly enough. 'He is guilty by omission rather than commission.

'The weather was poor but it didn’t mean it was impossible for you to attend to the needs of the animals, other farmers were dealing with them.

Gerard Berger had only just moved from the Gold Coast to Perisher on June 16 to start a three month stint working at the resort. But just two weeks after he left home, his family were hit with the devastating news that a snowboarding accident had claimed his life. 'From what I heard he was having the best day of his life, the day it happened,' his brother Rudi told the Gold Coast Bulletin. Gerard went snowboarding with his colleagues on Wednesday and was last seen by friends at 12.30pm. He was reported missing by the resort at 10.50pm after he didn't arrive for his rostered shift and police discovered he had not returned from snowboarding earlier in the day. His family were told Gerard may have missed jumping a creek that can be difficult to see when it's covered in snow. He may have hit his head and fallen back into the creek or drowned after searchers found his body in the creek at about 11.30pm. A post mortem is yet to be carried out to determine exactly how he died. 'He’s always happy and the one to make a fool of himself to make sure other people are happy and laughing.

Transportation Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said airlines had been notified to avoid routes near the mountain. Mount Sinabung is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on what is known as the Pacific 'Ring of Fire'. The cluster of volcanoes in the basin of the Pacific Ocean is where 90 per cent of the world's earthquakes and occur. Authorities raised the alert of Mount Sinabung to the highest level in November after a string of sporadic eruptions. Though no casualties were reported last week it is now understood that as many as 11 people have died. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said last week: 'Hot lava spewed from the volcano some 60 times, reaching up to five kilometers southeast of the crater. 'This outpour is the biggest we’ve seen in all the recent eruptions.' The rural landscape has been transformed by clouds of ash and debris as homes have been damaged by rocks hurled by the volcano for miles .

"By . Jennifer Smith . A grandmother who won £7.5milllion in the National Lottery has spoken of plans to split her winnings with family members and maintain a modest lifestyle despite becoming a multimillionaire. Doreen Hay had been buying lottery tickets for 10 years before her numbers came up after buying an extra Lucky Dip ticket on top of her usual two. The 70-year-old from Thornaby, Teesside, plans to donate £1.5million to various charities and spend the rest of the money buying a new home and visiting the Lake District. Doreen Hay (centre) will split the £7.5million jackpot with family members including her son John Hay (right) and his partner Susan Robinson (left) 'You've got to win some time': The 70-year-old had been buying lottery tickets for ten years before her numbers appeared on a third Lucky Dip ticket she bought by chance . Speaking of the winning ticket, Mrs Hay said: 'I thought ""you might as well be skint as broke, I'll get three""'. Upon realising she had won the jackpot, the grandmother-of-three phoned her son who raced to over to her home. 'I checked the numbers three times. I couldn't believe it so I sat down and then checked again,' said John Hays, a former cable engineer. 'It was then I realised we'd won £7.5million'. The 70-year-old previously won £1,300 when she drew five numbers in the jackpot won by Iorworth Hoare, a convicted rapist who won £7.2million on the day he was released from prison. John Hay plans to give up his job as a cable engineer and use the money to find a home big enough for his family . 'He was a convicted rapist and I thought: 'He has got the six and I've got five, but I'll get it next time. 'It's taken 10 years but I've got it. I'm a gambler, I like a little bet and you have to win some time haven't you?' Mrs Hays, a retired cleaner, will split the money with her son, his three children and her seven brothers and sisters as well as donating a large sum of the prize to charity. 'I've £1.5million given away,' she said, adding : 'It's not (a lot of money) when you have £3.5million and I'm 70. 'I have no ambitions for a toyboy.' The pensioner, who retired 17 years ago due to arthritis, plans to make more regular trips to the Lake District. 'I need to go away and come back on the same night,' said Mrs Hays who has never been on an airplane. 'I . have been the same for 70 years, I don't know how to be any different,' she said before recalling her dinner the previous evening of fish . fingers. 'I was pulling a face because I don't really like them, so I ate two and then shot the rest out for the seagulls. 'I thought ""I'm worth £3.5million and I'm having fish bloody fingers for my tea.' Mr Hays, who has given up his job, spoke of plans to buy a home big enough for his partner and three children. The retired cleaner will give £1.5million to five different charities and spend the rest of the money on a new home, a pet poodle and trips to the Lake District . The 38-year-old is also planning a trip to Disneyland in Florida. 'Working outside in the cold? No more of that,' said the former cable engineer. Mrs Hay will also give a share of the prize money to her former husband who she remains on good terms.

"By . Jennifer Smith . Thirteen people have been killed in violent clashes between riot police and Islamist protestors in Egypt today after the Muslim Brotherhood renewed calls to support the country's former president. Heavily populated residential areas across the country were struck by violence as rocks, tear gas and Molotov cocktails were hurled back and forth between police forces and demonstrators. Cairo, Giza, Ismailia and Alexandria were among the worst affected, where security forces launched water cannons on the protesting crowds. Thirteen people have died amid violent clashes between Muslim Brotherhood protestors and government forces in Egypt. Civilians ran out of a bus caught up in the violence in Cairo's Nasr City . Tension between government forces and the Muslim Brotherhood has been rife since the removal of the Islamist president in July . Protestors set fire to police vehicles and tires today in Maadi in the most recent conflict between protestors and officials since the removal of president Mohamed Morsi . In the Cairo district of Nasr City, riot police in bulletproof vests fired teargas at protesters throwing fireworks and stones. The Health Ministry said five people were killed in different districts in Cairo, with a source confirming they died from bullet wounds. One of the five was a man who was shot dead by the protesters after he yelled insults at Brotherhood demonstrators marching near his house. A male protester and a woman were shot dead in the coastal city of Alexandria, medical and security sources said though it was not clear whether the woman was a protester or not. Two were shot dead by police in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia after a march set off from a mosque after midday prayers while three more, including a student, were shot in the head and chest in Fayoum, Reuters reports. A Brotherhood-led alliance claimed the . death toll had reached 19 on a social media website, though this figure . has not been confirmed. More than 58 people are thought to have been injured in the conflict. Those in support of the country's ousted former president, Mohammed Morsi, set fire to cars and threw fireworks at officials who were clad in protective clothing. More than 100 Brotherhood protestors were arrested carrying homemade grenades and Molotov cocktails according to a statement released by the Interior Ministry. Today's violence is the latest outburst since the Islamist leader was ousted by a military coup on July 3. Thirteen people have been confirmed dead and at least 52 people injured according to figures revealed by the Health Ministry . The Muslim Brotherhood has been the target of government smear campaigns in recent weeks after the Islamist president was ousted by a military coup . The political group has changed tactics in light of government crackdown on protests and is relying on more women and student supporters. A civilian carries her child from a bus caught in the violence in Cairo today . The Muslim Brotherhood is the country's most organised political group, but has seen supporter numbers dwindle since in recent months after the military-backed interim government launched a severe crackdown on protest. Hundreds of Brotherhood members have been killed and thousands arrested since the crackdown this summer. The government last week ordered the seizure of hundreds assets belonging to non-governmental groups who they suspected were linked to the Muslin organisation. The Brotherhood has changed tactics in response, relying on more female and student supporters to lead protests ahead of key events. The second stage of the former president's trial over the killing of protesters will take place on January 8. A referendum over a new, more secular referendum is due to take place on January 14 and 15. The draft charter is an amended version . of the 2012 constitution drawn up by an Islamist-dominated panel under . Morsi, which was suspended during the coup. The Brotherhood has been labelled as a terrorist organisation in recent weeks, and has been accused of having ties to a well known al-Qaeda inspired group called the Champions of Jerusalem. The group has claimed responsibility for many attacks including a deadly December 24 bombing of a security headquarters in a Nile Delta city.

"By . Jennifer Smith . In his first Christmas as leader of the Catholic church, Pope Francis has urged people to shun pride and selfishness and open their hearts to God. Francis, who became the first non-European pope in 1,300 years in March after the historic resignation of Pope Benedict IX addressed packed St Peters Basilica in Vatican City on Christmas Eve. He told worshippers in Rome to receive their fellow man with open hearts in the Christmas Mass service. Pope Francis celebrates the Christmas Eve Mass in St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican while thousands of worshippers watch the televised service . Holding the crib effigy of the infant Jesus, Pope Francis delivered a service in which he encouraged people to open their hearts to God and their fellow man . Thousands gazed at the pontiff's image on giant screens to watch the Sistine Chapel intoning the Gloria, a traditional prayer to herald Christmas. Pope Francis delivered a brief and simple homlily, telling worshippers: 'On the part of the people there are times of both light and darkness, . fidelity and infidelity, obedience, and rebellion; times of being a . pilgrim people and times of being a people adrift.' Speaking in Italian, he continued: 'In our personal history too, there are both bright and dark moments, . lights and shadows. 'If we love God and our brothers and sisters, we walk . in the light; but if our heart is closed, if we are dominated by pride, . deceit, self-seeking, then darkness falls within us and around us.' He then urged crowds not to be afraid to seek the guidance of God. 'Do not be afraid! Our Father is patient, he loves us, he gives us Jesus to guide us on the way which leads to the promised land. 'Jesus is the light who brightens the darkness. He is our peace,' he said. Pope Francis lauded Jesus' humble beginning as a poor and vulnerable baby, saying: 'You are immense, and you made yourself small; you are rich, and you made yourself poor; you are all-powerful and you made yourself vulnerable.' He noted that the first to receive news of Jesus' birth were shepherds, who in society were considered ''among the last, the outcast.""' The bells of St. Peter's rang as Francis, who turned 77 a week ago, walked briskly up the main aisle of the basilica for the ceremony, which began two hours before midnight. Keeping with the theme of humility he has set for his new papacy, Francis carried the statue instead of an aide, and kissed a knee of the figure of the newly born Jesus. In his first Christmas service since becoming leader of the Catholic Church the Pope kisses a statue of the baby Jesus . Pope Francis celebrated the service with over 300 cardinals and priests. The 77-year-old urged people not to be afraid to reach out to God . Tonight's service is the only public Mass the pope will hold over Christmas. He is due to address worshippers on Christmas Day from the basilica's central balcony overlooking St Peter's Square . 'The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light' (Isaiah 9:1) 'This prophecy of Isaiah never ceases to touch us, especially when we hear it proclaimed in the liturgy of Christmas Night. 'This is not simply an emotional or sentimental matter. It moves us because it states the deep reality of what we are: a people who walk, and all around us - and within us as well - there is darkness and light. 'In this night, as the spirit of darkness enfolds the world, there takes place anew the event which always amazes and surprises us: the people who walk see a great light. A light which makes us reflect on this mystery: the mystery of walking and seeing. 'Walking. This verb makes us reflect on the course of history, that long journey which is the history of salvation, starting with Abraham, our father in faith, whom the Lord called one day to set out, to go forth from his country towards the land which he would show him. 'From that time on, our identity as believers has been that of a people making its pilgrim way towards the promised land. 'This history has always been accompanied by the Lord! He is ever faithful to his covenant and to his promises. 'God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all' (1 John 1:5). 'Yet on the part of the people there are times of both light and darkness, fidelity and infidelity, obedience, and rebellion; times of being a pilgrim people and times of being a people adrift. 'In our personal history too, there are both bright and dark moments, lights and shadows. If we love God and our brothers and sisters, we walk in the light; but if our heart is closed, if we are dominated by pride, deceit, self-seeking, then darkness falls within us and around us. 'Whoever hates his brother - writes the Apostle John - is in the darkness; he walks in the darkness, and does not know the way to go, because the darkness has blinded his eyes' (1 John 2:11). 'On this night, like a burst of brilliant light, there rings out the proclamation of the Apostle: 'God's grace has been revealed, and it has made salvation possible for the whole human race' (Tit 2:11). 'The grace which was revealed in our world is Jesus, born of the Virgin Mary, true man and true God. He has entered our history; he has shared our journey. He came to free us from darkness and to grant us light. 'In him was revealed the grace, the mercy, and the tender love of the Father: Jesus is Love incarnate. He is not simply a teacher of wisdom, he is not an ideal for which we strive while knowing that we are hopelessly distant from it. 'He is the meaning of life and history, who has pitched his tent in our midst. '3. The shepherds were the first to see this 'tent', to receive the news of Jesus' birth. They were the first because they were among the last, the outcast. 'And they were the first because they were awake, keeping watch in the night, guarding their flocks. Together with them, let us pause before the Child, let us pause in silence. 'Together with them, let us thank the Lord for having given Jesus to us, and with them let us raise from the depths of our hearts the praises of his fidelity: We bless you, Lord God most high, who lowered yourself for our sake. 'You are immense, and you made yourself small; you are rich and you made yourself poor; you are all-powerful and you made yourself vulnerable. 'On this night let us share the joy of the Gospel: God loves us, he so loves us that he gave us his Son to be our brother, to be light in our darkness. 'To us the Lord repeats: 'Do not be afraid!' (Luke 2:10). And I too repeat: Do not be afraid! Our Father is patient, he loves us, he gives us Jesus to guide us on the way which leads to the promised land. Jesus is the light who brightens the darkness. He is our peace. Amen.' Some who had travelled thousands of miles to attend the service felt compelled to make the journey as they felt the new leader had breathed fresh life into the Church. '(He) is bringing a new era into the Church, a Church that is focusing much more on the poor and that is more austere, more lively, a Church that cares about everyone in the world,' said Dolores Di Benedetto, from the pope's native Argentina. Giacchino Sabello said he had not been to Midnight Mass in St. Peter's but now wanted to get a first-hand look at the new pope. 'Now I am coming from quite far away, mainly because ... I thought it would be very nice to hear the words of this pope close up and to see how the people are overwhelmed by him,' he said. On Wednesday at noon (local time) he . will deliver the second 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) message and blessing of his pontificate. The first was last Easter. On . Dec. 31, the 77-year-old celebrates a year-end Mass of thanksgiving . inside the basilica and presides at a New Year's Mass to mark the Roman . Catholic Church's World Day of Peace. On . Jan. 6, he will celebrate a Mass in the square on the day the Church . marks the feast of the Epiphany, which commemorates the visit of the . magi to the baby Jesus. Pope Francis carried the statue of the baby to a manger instead of enlisting an aide. He then kissed its knee in celebration of the birth of Christ in his first Christmas service since being elected .

Its creator, Antonio Cantone, named the work 'Francis 1223 - Francis 2013' in reference to St Francis if Assisi who inspired the pope's choice of name. Cantone said he wanted to create a scene that reflected the Pope Francis's humble approach to leadership and give more prominence to ordinary people dressed in simple clothing. 'I have based the scene on the message of Pope Francis. 'The first to arrive when Jesus was born were ordinary people, that is the core of the message I wanted,' he said earlier this month.","Pope Francis celebrated his first Christmas Mass with 300 cardinals and priests at the Vatican .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Seven dangerous Al-Qaeda suspects are to be freed from Government curfews and able to walk the streets within days, it has emerged. The men, some of whom are suspected of plotting to kill thousands on transatlantic airliners, will no longer be bound by electronic tags or curfew restrictions after the terrorism prevention orders are lifted. The measures were introduced in 2012 to replace Labour government rules which, according to the Liberal Democrats, undermined the suspects' human rights. However they only last two years unless the government can prove the suspects have engaged in 'new' terrorist-related activity. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed vanished after cutting off his electronic tag and disguising himself in a burqa . Officials say such proof is hard if not impossible to come by as the men, who have not been named, know their behavior is being monitored. Under the curbs, suspects are required to stay at home for up to 10 hours each night, wear electronic tags and are banned from certain places. Among the seven due to be freed this month is a would-be suicide bomber known only by his initials, AM. The Sunday Times reports the 26-year-old . was involved in what investigators called 'Operation Overt', a plot to . attack flights from London to America in 2006. Another is, BF, a former train driver who was part of a group of British extremists seeking terrorist training in Pakistan. Among the men who are due to be freed is one who attended a training camp with the men behind the failed London 2005 bombings (pictured) Others . include a 30-year-old who attended a training camp alongside four of . the attempted suicide bombers involved in failed attacks on London in . 2005, and a man who was trained by al-Shabaab, the group responsible for . the massacre at Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi. The whereabouts of two suspects is . unknown, including that of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed who cut off his . electric tag while visiting a mosque last November. A senior Whitehall security official confirmed the men would be released over the next month. MI5, the police and the Home Office has been working together to decide what action to take once the men are freed. 'We've been planning how to mitigate the risks,' said a security offiIcial. The Home Office said it had 'tailored plans' to manage the risk, adding: 'These plans, similar to those put in place for the release of prisoners who had served their sentenced, are under constant review.'","Suspects monitored by electronic tags and curfews to be freed this month .

"By . Sam Webb . and Jennifer Smith . Graham Richardson, 27, was sentenced to life behind bars after murdering antiques dealer Peter Battle and leaving his body to rot for weeks . A killer who murdered an antiques dealer and left his corpse to rot for weeks as he repeatedly stole more goods has been jailed for life. Graham Richardson was sentenced to a minimum of 27 years in prison today after being found guilty of murder following a five week trial. Richardson clubbed Peter Battle to death with a heavy ornament and then hid his body at his cottage in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire. The alleged heroin-user returned to the property to repeatedly steal goods that he then passed on to elderly friends and relatives. A court heard he covered up the killing with ‘cunning and guile’ by posting fake notes on Mr Battle’s window and covering his body and a window so it couldn’t be seen. The murder is said to have taken place on December 30 last year and Mr Battle lay undiscovered at his home until early February. His body was eventually found when neighbours started to get concerned and called police, who broke in and found his body. Passing sentence today Mr Justice Stephen Males said Richardson had launched a 'vicious and sustained attack' on a 'defenceless and unconscious man' who he had already stabbed to the ground. A pathologist report found the victim suffered some 40 injuries, including fatal blows to the head. 'You demonstrated extreme callousness by leaving his body to lie for five weeks before it was found,' added the judge. 'The . ransacking of a dead man's home with his body lying there is despicable . conduct, made worse by the way in which it was repeated over an . extended period.' Victim: Antiques dealer Peter Battle was was found murdered in his countryside home in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire . The victim's daughter, Lisa Battle,  is one of the first people in the country to be able to address the court under the new Victims’ Code. The code, which came into effect this month, allows victims or their relatives to address offenders to explain how a crime has impacted them. Previously, judges read such statements in private. Looking directly at her father's murderer she said: 'If all you wanted to do was to rob my dad, why didn’t you wait until he was out and then break in when he wasn’t there? 'You have totally ripped my heart out and that piece that you have ripped out will never grow back. 'How would you feel if someone had done this to your mum in the same way you he done this to my dad and taken advantage as much as they could, like you have done.' Mr Justice Males praised the woman for her bravery, and that of her family. 'Their courage, love for their father and genuine feelings contrast starkly with your cowardice, selfishness and lies,' he told Richardson. Richardson had earlier admitted taking and selling jewellery from the cottage but denied murder. During the five-week trial, prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said Richardson killed Mr Battle in rage when he refused to give him credit on gold to sell. He told Teesside Crown Court that Richardson, of Norton, North Yorkshire, was on bail and desperate for money and went through his ‘little black book’ looking for easy prey. On December 29 he went to Mr, Battle’s house hoping to get gold and rings on credit so he could sell them and when that didn’t succeed he returned the following day. Mr Battle again refused and Richardson lost his temper and battered him with a heavy ornament, fracturing his skull, claimed the prosecutor. Police believe Mr Battle, 56, may have lain dead in the lounge of his home for weeks before his body was found . Scientists allegedly found Richardson’s DNA on Mr Battle’s trouser hem, which the prosecution claimed showed he moved the body after death. His DNA was also found on a curtain allegedly used to cover a window and door to prevent people from seeing into the house. The prosecution claimed that Mr Battle’s blood was found in Richardson’s mother’s car which he used and tried to scrap after the death. The prosecutor said Richardson was expected to claim that Mr Battle had been killed by another man and he had just ‘chanced on a treasure trove’. Darren Archer, 43, was convicted in court after carrying out a robbery of a gold dealer with Richardson three weeks before the murder took place. He will be sentenced next month. Peter Anthony Egan, 48, was acquitted of the same charge.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . and Jennifer Smith . David Cameron has written to the mother of a British doctor who died in custody in Syria, describing his death as 'a sickening and appalling tragedy'. Dr Abbas Khan, 32, was on the verge of being released when his family were told of his death this week. His relatives have said he was the victim of a political murder, but the Syrian government have called his death suicide. Transfer: The body of Dr Abbas Khan, who was killed while volunteering in Syria, has been returned to Britain . Heading home: The orthopaedic surgeon's body was handed over to UK officials in Beirut, Lebanon, yesterday . Tragic: Dr Abbas Khan, a father-of-two, died just days before he was due to be released from a Syrian jail . His body was flown back to the UK today and will undergo a post-mortem examination. In . a letter dated December 20, the Prime Minister told his mother, Fatima . Khan, that he and his wife Samantha were 'so very sorry' to hear of her . son's death. 'I know from my . own experience of losing a child that words are of little comfort at . this terrible time but please know that you are in our thoughts,' he . wrote. 'Abbas' death is a sickening and appalling tragedy and it is right that the Syrian regime should answer for it. He . branded the regime's treatment of Dr Khan 'despicable' and claimed it . was 'utterly unacceptable' that the UK were not able to support him. In a hand-written ending, he added: 'You are in our thoughts and prayers.' Dr Khan's . brother Afroze said he was 'grateful' that Mr Cameron had condemned the . Syrian regime but insisted that the Prime Minister must now 'follow . through' and use every possible method to bring to justice 'those who . have murdered my brother'. Distraught: The 32-year-old's mother Fatima Khan broke down in tears at the sight of her son's coffin yesterday . Anguish: Ms Khan was in the Lebanese capital to meet the coffin which was today transported back to Britain . Allegations: The mother, pictured left with her son Shah Nawaz, insisted Syrian officials had 'killed' Dr Khan . He . told the BBC: 'We are very angry at the failures of the British . government at securing the release of my brother and now that he is dead . we want to see the British government act decisively to respond to the . death of a British citizen at the hands of a foreign regime.' Mr Khan added: 'There must be a firm response to such a callous and cruel act.' The . orthopaedic surgeon from London was captured in November 2012 in the . ancient city of Aleppo after travelling from Turkey to help victims of . hospital bombings. Horrific: Dr Khan was captured in November last year - just 48 hours after flying from Turkey to Aleppo to help victims of hospital bombings . Dispute: Syrian regime officials claim the orthopaedic surgeon hanged himself while in captivity - a suggestion that has been refuted by his family, who say he was looking forward to spending Christmas at home . Nabeel . Sheikh, solicitor for Dr Khan's family, issued a statement which read: . 'Dr Khan's family would like to thank everyone for their help and . support. 'The family are relieved that his body has been repatriated. Dr . Khan is being transported by ambulance to the Coroner's Court in . Walthamstow for the purposes of a post-mortem. 'The . family hopes that all relevant tests as deemed necessary are carried . out so as to ensure the post-mortem is concluded without delay and the . body laid to rest as soon as possible. Support: In a letter dated December 7, Dr Khan told his campaigners 'Good work guys - keep up the pressure' 'The . Home Office is organising the process but, as a matter of course, . Scotland Yard is actively involved given the circumstances surrounding . Dr Khan's death are highly suspicious. 'Our . thoughts are with the family. The immediate priority is to give the . family privacy and enough support as necessary to help them through this . difficult time.' The . International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it transported the . body from Damascus to the Lebanese capital Beirut, where it was received . by Mrs Khan and British officials. Mrs Khan, who has '110%' refuted claims that he committed suicide, broke down in tears when the coffin arrived. 'The national security intelligence of Syria, they killed him!' she screamed. 'They're murderers!' Mrs Khan has categorically denied claims made by Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad that he had killed himself. In . the last few days the family revealed a letter in which the doctor . expressed his optimism at being released, and his hopes of being home in . time for Christmas. Dear Mrs Khan, . Samantha and I were so very sorry to hear about the tragic death of your son, Abbas, in Syria. I know from my own experience of losing a child that words are of little comfort at this terrible time but please know that you are in our thoughts. I hope that, in time, you will remember all the good things about Abbas' life. You have shown incredible courage and fortitude throughout the last 13 months. I cannot begin to imagine how devastating losing Abbas must be, especially at a time when it seemed as if the regime might finally release him. I hope that you can draw some comfort from the out pouring of support you have received, and that you have the space and time to grieve for him, as well as celebrate, with pride, the fact that he dedicated so much of his life helping others, including some of the most vulnerable people in the world. The Foreign Secretary has been briefed regularly on Abbas' case and I have asked the Foreign Office to do all they can to bring Abbas' body home as soon as possible. Abbas' death is a sickening and appalling tragedy and it is right that the Syrian regime should answer for it. Their despicable treatment of him and refusal to engage with us or the Czechs to enable us to support him is utterly unacceptable. We will continue to press for those responsible to be held to account. Again, please accept my deepest condolences. Our thoughts are with you. (Handwritten) You are in our thoughts and prayers. Yours sincerely, . David Cameron .","Dr Abbas Khan died just days before scheduled release from Syrian jail .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Caroline Criado-Perez was the victim of an online 'avalanche' of abuse after supporting a campaign calling for women to appear on banknotes. Two people will face charges in relation to comments made on Twitter . A man and a woman are to appear in court after sending threatening messages on Twitter to a woman campaigning for females to appear on banknotes. Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo will be charged with improper use of a communications network for their roles in the 'avalanche' of abuse directed towards Carolina Criado-Perez, the Crown Prosecution Service has revealed. The journalist received a torrent . of death threats and sexist remarks alongside other female campaigners after calling for women to . be featured on banknotes. Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: 'Following early consultation with the police, the CPS has been asked to make a charging decision in respect of five suspects whom it is alleged sent offensive tweets to Stella Creasy MP and journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez. 'We reviewed these cases in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and guidelines issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media. Sorley, 23, and Nimmo, 25, will face charges in Westminster's Magistrates Court on January 7. Detectives ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute one suspect, while another who is accused of sending offensive messages to Stella Creasy MP will avoid sentencing as prosecution 'would not be in the public interest'. 'In relation to the fifth suspect, we have asked the police to carry out further investigation before a charging decision can be made,' Mr Ubjey added. 'We have written to both Ms Creasy and Ms Criado-Perez to inform them of these decisions.' Ms Criado-Perez responded to the news online, writing on Twitter: 'Well that’s pretty awesome. CPS informing press about charges ahead of me. 'About the level of victim-support I’ve grown to expect.'

Over 60,000 people signed an online petition calling for Twitter to take action against the abuse, prompting the website to launch a 'report abuse' button on its latest iPhone app. Speaking in July, the company's general manager for the UK said: 'We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of the rules. 'Also we are testing ways to simplify reporting, e.g. within a Tweet by using the 'Report Tweet' button in our iPhone app and on mobile web. 'We encourage users to report an account for violation of the Twitter rules by using one of our report form (sic)'.

"By . Jennifer Smith . Controversial comedian Eddie Izzard has announced plans to stand in the 2020 London mayoral election. The heterosexual transvestite revealed he will throw his hat into the ring, unless the capital is already being led by a Labour mayor in which case he plans to run for parliament instead. The 51-year-old, who has campaigned for the party in four general elections, said he would be suited to the role as he does 'things in a different way'. Comedian Eddie Izzard (right) has announced plans to enter the 2020 mayoral race. The 51-year-old is Labour party leader Ed Miliband's (left) top choice for the role . Izzard, who has cross-dressed on stage and performed the world's largest ever global standup tour said he hoped his presence in politics would inspire young people to become involved. 'I think I can put a lot of energy . into it, I think London's a great city, I think I can bring unusual . things to the table, and think in a different way, why shouldn't I be mayor?' he said. 'Everybody says I would be a good fit for mayor because it's a personality-led thing,' the comedian told the Guardian. Yemen-born Izzard said he felt would be a good representative for the city, having started his career as a street performer in Covent Garden. He added the prejudices he has had to face as a transvestite makes the criticisms thrown at political figures look easy in comparison. The cross-dressing transvestite, pictured with former deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, attends the party's annual conference . The standup comedian said 'everybody thinks' he is suited to the role as 'it is a personality-led thing' 'I have always learned how to do things while struggling at the beginning to work out they work. I'll probably screw up, but I'll learn.' In 2009 Izzard ran 43 marathons in 52 days in aid of Sport Relief, carrying the flag of the home nation he was passing through at the time as he completed the 1,000 mile feat. The 51-year-old has amazed fans by performing the French leg of his most recent tour entirely in the native language, and plans to learn Spanish, German, Russian and Arabic in the near future. His plans to run in the 2020 mayoral election have been met warmly by Labour party members, with MP Tessa Jowell describing the news as 'a vote of confidence'. 'Eddie is a man of enormous substance, generosity and conviction,' she said.","The transvestite comedian announced plans to stand in election for Labour .

"By . Jennifer Smith . A secret Santa brought an early Christmas gift to cash-strapped shoppers by spending $20,000 paying off their outstanding bills. Staff at Walmart  were stunned when Greg Parady asked if he could contribute towards customer's Christmas layaway bills. The local businessman was browsing for toys in the store on The Villages, Florida, to donate to a charity event when he decided to spread even more good will. Scroll down for video . Surprise Santa: Greg Parady stunned staff and shoppers by spending $21,000 paying off their layaway bills . The local businessman was shocked to learn how many families could go without Christmas presents so decided to offer a helping hand . Staff at the store in The Villages, Florida (pictured) were stunned by Mr Parady's act of kindness . 'It just kind of unfolded,' the 40-year-old said. After overhearing another shopper say she may not be able to afford her outstanding bill, Mr Parady wandered over to the layaway department to see what he could do to help. 'It's kind of a depressing place... over by the bathrooms and bikes,' he told NBC news. After asking the manager to tally up all the outstanding balances, Mr Parady was shocked to hear that $89,000 worth of gifts hadn't been paid for, and saddened by how many families were struggling to put presents under their tree. The 40-year-old made a significant dent in the debt however, after swiping a variety of personal credit cards through the machine. 'I came back here and just saw him swiping and swiping,' said his businesspartner, Cindy Nazzaro, who accompanied him on the visit. He paid the bills of six shoppers who were in the store at the time, as well as paying off half of every bill over $200. Staff at the store recalled how the holiday hero swiped his card for customers who approached the till to cancel their orders, simply saying 'Merry Christmas' afterwards. 'They didn't know what was happening at first,' said Wal-Mart operations manager Deb Davis. 'This one girl in particular, she goes, ""What do I owe?"" My associate goes, 'That gentlemen right there just paid for you.""' Overwhelmed, the woman, began to cry and had to sit down on a bench. His spending was so unexpected, Mr Parady's banks began to decline transactions in the fear his credit cards had been stolen. The man used three different cards, took up two cashiers, and also made payments over the phone during the hours-long spree which employees described as the most generous they had ever seen. 'I've never seen anything of this magnitude,' said Ms Davis who has worked at the store for 13 years. 'I cant believe his credit cards didn't melt he was running them so fast. 'It was like stepping back in time when life wasn't so busy and so hectic when neighbors were helping neighbors,' she added. A Christmas miracle: Deb Davies said she had never seen kindness 'of that magnitude' throughout her 13 years at the store . Mr Parady said he hoped his gesture inspired others to share at Christmas, whether it be money, time, or kindness . Since his act of kindness, Parady has become a global hit with tributes pouring in from all over the world. 'I didn't intend for the attention but I hope it motivates other people,' he said. 'I hope everyone will use it as a tool to give in their own way. It doesn't have to be money, it can be time, or just something kind.' Though none have quite come close to the depth of Mr Parady's pockets, other do-gooders have been dropping in on stores to help settle struggling customers' debts. The so-called 'layaway Santas' have been popping up across the US since 2011. Walmart alone has noted 1,000 cases where a stranger has paid off another's bill this year, while KMart said over $1.5million had been spent by well-wishers in years past. The company matched every layaway Santa's contribution with a $200 donation to Toys for Tots, and this year pledged to donate up to $1million to the charity.","Greg Parady was in the store buying gifts to donate to a charity .

The photographer had to move at a slow pace to avoid being detected by the crocodile who took longer to notice him . 'I had around three or four metres of visibility, so when I saw the crocodile for the first time it was almost in front of me,' he said. 'I had to stay calm so the crocodile didn't detect my presence. 'I just put my camera between the crocodile and me and started taking pictures while the animal was trying to come back to its refuge.' Mr Aburto was visiting a group of islands in the Mexican Caribbean at the time. The area is known to have the largest population of American crocodile known as Crocodylus acutus, with more than 250 living there. 'It was almost dusk and was able to take the pictures with a very nice light, but also I had to take some of them with very slow speed, so the movements of the crocodile was captured in a great way but maintaining the magnificent teeth that the animal has.' The crocodile was right in front of the man when he first noticed it. Mr Aburto said he quickly placed his camera between them and began taking pictures . The reptile took slightly longer to notice Mr Aburto's presence as they swam through the reef which is known to have the a large American crocodile presence .

Mr Aburto has been a professional underwater photographer since 1994 and is now also a researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He said: 'I have not done this before, but the experience was incredible. 'I really think that the animal was surprised in the same way that I was. 'Although there was very little time to think about what was happening, I never felt that the animal would attack me.'","Underwater photographer Octavio Aburto was swimming in the Mexican Caribbean when the reptile appeared .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Operation: Tracey Connelly is desperate for a gastric band operation so she can lose weight and find a new man now she's out of prison . Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly wants a gastric band to help her lose weight after ballooning to 22 stone while in prison, it has been claimed. Connelly told residents at her bail hostel she wanted to undergo the taxpayer-funded NHS procedure to help her find a new partner. She was jailed in 2009 after the brutal death of her tortured son Peter, but was released in November following a Parole Board review. The 32-year-old told friends at the halfway house where she has been living: 'I need to do something about my weight. No one will touch me looking like this,' the Mirror said. As well as the operation which costs the NHS between £5,000 and £7,000, Connelly said she wanted diet pills to help her lose weight. Though she will not receive a new identity, officials are to give her a new surname and hairstyle to help disguise her appearance. She is also set to receive taxpayer-funded childcare lessons. A source at the hostel in North England said: 'She is desperate to lose weight but wants a quick fix, slimming pills and a gastric band on the NHS. 'She talks about getting herself a fella all the time.' Body mass index are among the factors which will be considered in order to qualify for the controversial operation. NHS guidelines state patients must have tried all other ways to lose weight themselves and be seriously obese before being eligible to undergo the procedure. Connelly, who weighs 22 stone, is due to stay at the hostel for several weeks until she is given a new home and job. She was released from prison several weeks ago. She reportedly spends most of her time in her room, only leaving the premises to buy sweets and chocolate mousse at a nearby store. Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after her 17-month-old son Peter was tortured to death by her boyfriend and his paedophile brother . Steven Barker (left) and Jason Owen (right) remain behind bars. The pair inflicted 50 injuries on the toddler whose body was discovered in 2007 . The 32-year-old was recently spotted . shopping in an Aldi supermarket near the hostel where onlookers saw her . checking out bargains on festive food. Gastric bands reduce the capacity of the stomach so recipients can only eat small meals. Patients must have a body mass index of over 40 or 35 and suffer a medical condition to be eligible to receive the procedure which can cost up to £10,000. Almost 1,500 people received gastric bands between 2011-2012, costing the NHS an estimated £85million. Witnesses said the criminal seemed to be 'really enjoying herself' as she strolled the shop with a friend. Earlier . this month it was revealed the woman is also receiving childcare . lessons at the hostel, as well as being taught literacy, numeracy and . healthy living skills. Connelly . admitted causing or allowing the death of her 17-month-old son, Peter, . in 2009, having done nothing to stop her boyfriend and his paedophile . brother from torturing the infant to death. The child's body was discovered at his mother's old flat in Tottenham, North London, in 2007. Coroners found he had suffered 50 separate injuries, including a broken back. While Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen remain behind bars, Connelly was released from County Durham's Low Newton jail at the end of October. Probation officers ruled though the woman was still a danger to children, she is no longer a danger to the public.","Tracey Connelly wants the NHS operation to help her find a new partner .

Gavin Duffy, 29, was visiting a friend in the United Arab Emirates when he was run over on Saturday following a night out. The man's family from Billingham, Teeside, have received £17,000 in donations from the British public to repatriate his body after launching an appeal.

"By . Sam Creighton . Blackmail threats allegedly made against Bernie Ecclestone ‘sounded like they had come straight from a gangster film’, a court heard. Investigators said the F1 boss failed to give ‘concrete details’ to back his claim he was blackmailed by Gerhard Gribkowsky, who was in charge of selling Bayern LB bank’s stake in F1 in 2005. Ecclestone, 83, says Gribkowsky demanded £27million to buy his silence over ‘untrue allegations’ about his financial affairs. But prosecutors say it was a bribe to get Gribkowsky – currently in jail for taking the money – to sell to a certain equity firm. Bernie Ecclestone in court today. The F1 boss denies bribery and says he was the victim of a blackmail scam . Ecclestone at the Munich court on the second day of his trial with one of his lawyers, Sven Thomas . Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, second from right, and his lawyers Sven Thomas, centre, and Norbert Scharf, fourth from right . Flanked . by his imposing legal team, Ecclestone looked calm and collected as he . appeared at a Munich court on the second day of his trial on bribery . charges. Mr . Ecclestone's had gathered together a crack team of lawyers to represent . him in the case, not least Dr Sven Thomas, thought of as one of . Germany's top legal minds. The . hulking lawyer, who towers over Mr Ecclestone's 5' 2"" frame, is an . expert in white collar crime cases having represented huge companies and . several high profile German politicians during his 36 year career. He was in . Mr Ecclestone's corner today as two German investigators gave evidence . in a case where, if convicted, the Formula One chief, who has built up . his power base in Formula One since the 1970s would likely find his . position in the sport's hierarchy untenable. The . charges involve a $44million (£26 million) payment to banker Gerhard . Gribkowsky, who is serving an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for taking . the money. Based on information from a two-year investigation, prosecutors allege the payment was meant to facilitate the sale of Munich-based bank Bayern LB's stake in Formula One to a buyer of Ecclestone's liking. Gribkowsky was in charge of selling that 47 percent stake in F1 in 2005. While Ecclestone claims he was the victim of blackmail, in court today, German prosecutors did their best to cast doubt on that assertion. Called as a witness, Martin Bauer, a public prosecutor who took evidence from Ecclestone after the arrest of Gribkowsky in 2011, said: 'It was never really clear what form this threat could have taken'. Bauer said Ecclestone had spoken merely of Gribkowsky being able to make things uncomfortable for him without specifying how. Ecclestone, who denied wrongdoing when he went on trial last week, followed the proceedings through an interpreter. The former used-car salesman, who is fighting to save his job and his reputation, is required to attend every session in a case that will be heard once or twice a week to fit around his Formula One commitments and is set to run until mid-September. CVC, the largest shareholder in Formula One, has said it will dismiss Ecclestone if he is found guilty. Dr Sven Thomas, the silver-haired lawyer hulking over Bernie Ecclestone's 5' 2"" frame, is one of the most respected legal minds in Germany and part of the team spearheading the Formula One boss's defence against bribery charges. Qualifying as a lawyer 36 years ago, Dr Thomas has made a career as an expert in white collar crime cases, defending both people and companies of note in a number of high profile cases. The Chambers Directory describes Dr Thomas as ‘fantastic’ and he has been referred to by peers as ‘one of the standout defence lawyers in Germany'. His highest profile case to date has been as part of the defence team for several directors of German company Mannesmann, who were charged with various counts on misconduct in relation to the company's takeover by Vodafone in 2000. Although all the defendants were acquitted, an appeal led to a retrial of all the men but the charges were again shelved on the understanding that the defendants would make public and charitable payments according to their means. Ecclestone testified during Gribkowsky's trial in 2011 and the banker is seen as the key witnesses for the prosecution in this trial, which is scheduled to last until September 16. Gribkowsky was found guilty of corruption, tax evasion and breach of trust in a trial heard by the same judge who is overseeing Ecclestone's case, Peter Noll. The defense made clear that it will attack Gribkowsky's credibility, and when the trial opened last week, Ecclestone protested his innocence in a statement read by his lawyers. In the statement, Ecclestone reiterated testimony he gave at Gribkowsky's 2012 trial that he gave the banker the money because he was 'blackmailed' and worried Gribkowsky would falsely accuse of him of being in charge of a trust fund set up for the his former wife and their children — possibly incurring a huge British tax bill. Ecclestone said that 'from today's point of view, it was not a rational decision' to pay Gribkowsky. 'I saw my life's work in danger' if Gribkowsky went to the British tax authorities, he said, adding that he wouldn't have been able to pay the resulting bill. Ecclestone said he had turned over his entire stake in Formula One to his then-wife, Slavica, and their two daughters, in 1997, following a series of health scares that left him worried his family would have to pay a 40 per cent inheritance tax on his fortune if he died. He claims that while he runs the day-to-day business of Formula One, he has not persoanlly owned a stake since 1997. Ecclestone has stepped down temporarily . as a director of Formula One's holding company pending the outcome of . the trial, though he continues to manage the sport's commercial . operations on behalf of investment fund CVC Capital Partners, which has a . controlling stake in the web of companies which run the commercial side . of the sport. Ecclestone jokes with Dr Thomas before the start of the hearing. Two German investigators are expected to give evidence today . Fabiana Flosi, wife of Bernie Ecclestone, also attended the regional court in Munich . Ecclestone's lawyers also insisted anew that their client is innocent, saying in a written statement that 'the alleged bribe has not occurred.' They argued that the charge is based on statements by Gribkowsky that are 'incorrect, misleading and incoherent' and said they would produce new documents at the trial to dispute Gribkowsky's assertions. Ecclestone faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.","Ecclestone appeared in Munich court for second day of trial .

The protestors marked International Workers' Day by marching peacefully while carrying banners branded with slogans such as 'Die Yuppie Scum' and 'Anti-Capitalism and Anti-State'. However, a violent minority caused trouble once the sun went down, waging running battles with police officers.

Nine men, aged between 17 and 37, were arrested as a peaceful day gave way to a violent evening on a march that was still relatively quiet compared to those in each of last two years. At one point, police fired pepper spray into the crowd, claiming that bottles and other missiles had been thrown at them. They also recovered a gun from one of the marchers. While there was a general theme of workers' rights and immigration reform, the protestors were not rallying behind a single unifying cause. Rather, different groups brought their own agendas as the crowd made its way from Capitol Hill to the city's downtown area and then back again. Tempers frayed as the temperature soared to 30C. One protestor, carrying a banner that simply read 'F*** Off', told Seattle Pi: 'I believe in transformative justice and community accountability. 'These cops that are surrounding us right now are just the later generations of the slave catchers that caught slaves before; you know, it's just a continuation. It's modern-day slavery and that's what we're fighting against.'

Last year, police arrested 18 people from a crowd that pelted them with rocks and bottles and Seattle police noted a marked uptick in anti-authority rhetoric leading up to this year's events events. Police escorted both the permitted march of immigration and labor activists and later, unpermitted marches, allowing them to block traffic but stepping in to stop property damage. Businesses downtown also prepared, posting security guards outside, taping paper over their windows to discourage graffiti, and using metal coat hangers to tie down iron grates along the sidewalks.

On of the key themes of yesterdays march was the campaign for a $15 minimum wage and, early in the day, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced a plan to phase it in over the next seven years. However, Daniel Stender, 26, was at the rally holding a sign pushing for quicker action on getting to a $15 minimum wage. 'It's getting ridiculous. It's getting to the point where you can't afford things,' he said. The police department's blog said vandals spray-painted a few businesses early Thursday in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Officers also found 'Kill SPD' - standing for 'Kill Seattle Police Department' - painted on walls and a flier was circulated calling for the killing of officers.","Hundreds of demonstrators turned out for the annual May Day protests .

"By . Emma Glanfield . BBC economics editor Robert Peston has received mixed reaction to his debut in the Newsnight presenting seat – after he failed to wear a tie for the appearance. The 54-year-old journalist, who is set to host two more editions of the show this week, chose to go without a tie as he took up the seat formerly occupied by Jeremy Paxman. It has sparked a string of comments on Twitter, with many calling for him to ‘buy a tie’ and smarten up. Others also took to the social media site to point out his ‘uncanny’ resemblance to Doctor Who star David Tennant. BBC economics editor Robert Peston  failed to wear a tie as he presented Newsnight for the first time . The 54-year-old journalist drew criticism from viewers for looking 'scruffy' while hosting current affairs show . Viewers took to Twitter to criticise Peston for not wearing a tie with some branding him 'scruffy' Peston, who wore a purple striped shirt with his top button undone and a dark suit jacket, interviewed Isaac Herzog, the leader of Israeli Labor, the country's main opposition party, on his debut. He looked fairly relaxed as he questioned Mr Herzog about the conflict in Gaza, and fiddled distractedly with a pen in one hand. His interview with Andy Burnham on Labour's stance on privatisation and the NHS was fairly more animated – but viewers couldn’t help but notice his ‘scruffy’ appearance.

"By . Emma Glanfield . NHS chief executive Simon Stevens (above) has urged employees to lose weight to set an example . NHS staff have been told to cut chips and burgers out of their diet after more than half of workers were found to be overweight. Chief executive Simon Stevens said employees should set an example and said incentives would be introduced to help the 700,000 workers who are overweight. He said chips and burgers currently on offer in staff canteens would be ditched in favour of healthier meals and NHS sites across the country would include gyms and become more ‘cycle-friendly’. Mr Stevens, 47, said weight-loss competitions would also be open to the 1.3 million workers, with pedometers and mugs being put up as prizes. The move comes as the NHS attempts to save money to fund the £30billion a year it is expected to need by 2020. The rising obesity epidemic has put a strain not only on the nation’s health but also on the NHS, with overweight people relying more heavily on the national health service. Mr Stevens said he hoped the move would not only set an example to the public but encourage other major employers to follow suit. He told The Sun: ‘The fact that as a nation we’ve all been putting on the pounds for several years is bad for our health and bad for the health service.’ ‘A lot of the food in hospital canteens, not just for patients, but for staff, is chips and burgers.’ ‘I think the NHS has got to take an example in helping our own staff and hopefully other employers will follow suit.’ Several hospitals across the country have already started offering weight-loss incentives to staff, with the rest set to begin imminently. As well as calling on workers to tackle obesity problems, Mr Stevens also urged parents to keep their children healthy by swapping fizzy drinks and fruit juices during meal times to water or milk. It is hoped the scheme will go some way in reducing the obesity crisis in the UK, where two thirds of adults are classed as overweight and a quarter are deemed obese. Those who are overweight are at risk from a host of health problems, including Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and strokes, which places further strain on NHS resources. Mr Stevens said burgers and chips currently on offer in NHS canteens would be replaced for healthier options . Mr Stevens, who has lost three stone in the last three years, took over as NHS chief executive three months ago and has been keen to slash ‘unnecessary costs’. He has ditched taking a car to work in favour of catching the bus and Tube and opts to travel in standard class on trains when he makes regular visits from his home in South London to NHS England’s headquarters in Leeds. Looking to the future, he said that further progress in technology would keep patients out of hospital as people live longer, and he wants greater partnership between the NHS and social services. He said: 'What's great about the NHS can't excuse what needs to change about the NHS. 'That is the approach that we have got to take. We've got to support people doing great things, nurses, doctors, the frontline of healthcare. But we've also got to raise our game.' He also called for thousands more GPs to be trained, and said he wants to give them more power to make decisions about how NHS money is spent.","NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said employees should set an example .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A string of petty complaints – from the canteen not stocking ready-salted crisps to the television being ‘fuzzy’ – are made on a regular basis by inmates at one of Britain’s toughest prisons, it has emerged. Prisoners at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire – which include convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles - have logged hundreds of complaints about the category A jail over the last 12 months. Their moans centre on everything from the food in the canteen to the cleanliness of the men-only prison. Prisoners at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire (pictured) – which include convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles - have logged hundreds of complaints about conditions at the category A mens-only jail . One prisoner, whose name has not been revealed, made a formal complaint about his dietary requirements after he failed to receive a packet of ready-salted crisps with his lunch. He wrote: ‘No red crisps (i.e. ready salted) were given at lunchtime to me. ‘Evidently some of the wing staff found this very funny when I used an expletive over this. Whilst they might find this funny, I do not. ‘I have had enough problems getting my dietary requirements right for seven years in this place and I still have problems. I am informing you that all mistakes etc. with my dietary requirements with regard to food will be noted and action taken for my health being put at risk.’ In a separate complaint, another inmate wrote: ‘For the past two weeks we have had no parsley sauce with the fishcakes despite it being advertised on the menu sheet as fishcakes with parsley sauce.’ Inmates at HMP Wakefield are said to include paedophile Ian Watkins (left) and April Jones' killer Mark Bridger . Several of the complaints centered around food served the prison. Pictured: Staff in the prison's kitchens . As one of Britain’s toughest prisons, HMP Wakefield is understood to house a number of high-profile criminals and the likes of paedophile Ian Watkins, April Jones’ killer Mark Bridger and Sarah Payne’s killer Roy Whiting are all thought to be serving time there. The complaints, which have been obtained by The Mirror via freedom of information request, also reveal how inmates are complaining about matters which are often out of prison staff’s hands. One lodged a complaint saying: 'Can something be done to stop pigeons landing and leaving droppings on my window sill.’ While another said: ‘The other night the temperature did not go above 18.5C. This is making me unhappy because I don’t like to be cold.’ Inmates have the option to earn a few pounds a week by working in the prison and are allowed to spend the money on certain items, including on the television which costs them each £1. However, despite being able to enjoy luxuries such as watching TV, one still wasn’t happy and lodged a complaint about the picture quality. He said: ‘The picture is a bit snowy. How many months will this take to fix?’ The list of complaints has drawn criticism from some officials including Labour MP Michael McCann who said the inmates ‘should have thought about home comforts before they committed their crimes.’ Prisons Minister Andrew Selous also hit out at the inmates and told The Mirror: ‘Prisoners shouldn’t be in any doubt they are there to be punished and complaints will only be taken forward if they have any merit.’ The revelation comes just days after a fire was started by inmates during a riot at HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire. Up to 60 prisoners took over a wing of the category C prison on Saturday when they were told they were not allowed outside during hot weather. The fire was reportedly started during the ongoing incident which lasted more than eight hours.","Hundreds of complaints made by inmates at HMP Wakefield, West Yorkshire .

President Goodluck Jonathan heard tales from some of the 57 who escaped after their abduction on April 15 before assuring them of his determination that those still in captivity ‘are brought out alive’. Following the meeting in Chibok, presidential spokesman Reuben Abati told reporters it was a ‘very successful event’. Scroll down for video .

The schoolgirls managed to escape their abduction by Islamic extremists, but more than 200 are still missing . During the meeting of around 177 people, which included the schoolgirls and their parents, Jonathan gave assurances that the education of the schoolgirls and their still-captive classmates would not suffer in any way . During the meeting of around 177 people, which included the schoolgirls and their parents, Jonathan gave assurances that the education of the schoolgirls and their still-captive classmates would not suffer in any way. Mr Abati said: ‘Mr President reassured them of the federal government determination and his personal determination to ensure that the girls that are still in captivity are brought out alive. ‘He made it clear that is the main objective of the government.’ The parents of many of the 219 kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls emerged from the closed door meeting without showing emotion but some shook hands with the president. Some of the escaped schoolgirls smiled for photographers after the meeting. At least 11 of the parents have died since the kidnappings - seven in a village attack this month and four of heart attacks and other illnesses that the Chibok community blames on the trauma, according to residents. Jonathan was accompanied in the meeting by the ministers of education and finance, and his national security adviser.

Several relatives of some of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls broke down in tears during today's meeting . Some of the parents have made public statements urging Jonathan to negotiate with the schoolgirls' captors . Also present was the Gov. Kashim Shettima of Borno state, from which the girls were abducted. Shettima has accused Jonathan of not doing enough to save the girls and has angered the government with his charges that Boko Haram fighters are better armed and motivated than Nigeria's military. Today's meeting came after months of the parents asking to see the president. He finally agreed this week following a request from Pakistani girls-education activist Malala Yousafzai. The failure of Jonathan's government to . rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily . BringBackOurGirls rallies in Abuja, the capital, to ensure attention for . the girls' plight.

Schoolgirls who escaped the abduction appeared deep in thought as they arrived ahead of today's meeting . According to a mediator working with Boko Haram two of the girls have died of snake bites while around 20 have fallen ill. Residents have warned that there is a famine looming in Chibok because food stocks are being depleted by the growing population. Four . or five families are having to share small houses because nearby . villagers who survive  assaults are swarming into the town. Some . of the parents and community leaders of Chibok have made public . statements urging Jonathan to negotiate with the girls' captors. Boko Haram is demanding a swap for detained fighters in exchange for the girls but so far, Jonathan has refused. 11 parents of the 276 Nigerian schoolgirls have died since they were abducted by terror group Boko Haram . Martha Mark, the mother of kidnapped schoolgirl Monica Mark, cries as she displays a photo of her daughter . Nigeria's Defence Ministry, which has . also been criticised for not quickly rescuing the girls, has said that . it knows where they are being held but fears any military campaign could . get them killed. Jonathan . has never before met with the parents or the escaped girls, although he . has insistently repeatedly that: ‘My priority is the return of these . girls.’ The number . of soldiers guarding Chibok has increased from 15 to around 200 since . the kidnapping but they have done little to increase security. They often refuse to deploy to villages under attack even though there is advance warning 90 per cent of the time. Most . of the schoolgirls are still believed to be held in the Sambisa Forest — . a wildlife reserve that includes a mixture of thick jungle and open . savannah. The . forest borders on sand dunes marking the edge of the Sahara Desert. Sightings of the girls and their captors have been reported in . neighboring Cameroon and Chad. Demands: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Sheku, repeated in a video this week that he would exchange the abducted girls for detained extremists . Displaced: Villagers from Borno State who survive Boko Haram assaults are swarming to Chibok, depleting vital supplies. Earlier this month an attack on Maidguri (pictured) killed 18 people . Chibok and nearby villages are targets because they are enclaves of staunch Christians in predominantly Muslim north Nigeria. Residents feel so abandoned that they appealed this month for the United Nations to send troops to protect them. The U.N. has repeatedly urged Nigeria's government to live up to its international responsibility to protect citizens.","The schoolgirls were abducted by Islamist extremists over three months ago .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A heavily-pregnant woman has given birth to a baby girl in a crown court after going into labour in the witness room. The 25-year-old attended Birmingham Crown Court to support a friend who was giving evidence in a trial. However, half-way through proceedings, the woman’s waters broke and court staff were forced to leap into action and help. The 25-year-old woman attended Birmingham Crown Court (above) to support a friend who was giving evidence in a trial, but ended up giving birth in the witness room after her waters broke midway through proceedings . Paramedics were also called to the scene at 2.40pm yesterday but found they did not have time to get her to hospital and she gave birth to a baby girl just 10 minutes later. The newborn was taken in the arms of a paramedic to a waiting ambulance which then transferred mother and baby to Birmingham Women's Hospital. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘Crews were called to Birmingham Crown Court at 2.40pm to reports that a 25-year-old pregnant woman had gone into labour. ‘Two ambulances attended and the baby was born inside the court building. ‘Both the baby and mother were taken by ambulance to Birmingham Women's Hospital.’ Witnesses said court clerks, ushers and security guards all gathered around to give the woman a round of applause as she was wheeled out of the building. One witness said: ‘I saw two ambulances outside the court building. There were paramedics rushing up the stairs. ‘One of the paramedics later came out with a newborn in his arms wrapped in a blanket with an oxygen mask over its face.’ Paramedics were called to the scene but did not have time to get the woman to hospital and she ended up giving birth to a girl just 10 minutes later. They were both later taken to Birmingham Women's Hospital . Another onlooker added: ‘There was a bit of a commotion in the corridors when word got around, she had her first taste of a court at a pretty young age. Let's hope that's not an omen. ‘Some of the court staff gathered around and gave her a round of applause as she was led out, mother and baby both looked to be doing well.’ Victim Support West Midlands tweeted about the incident saying: ‘2day baby girl born in @VictimSupport witness waiting room, Bham Crown Court - thanks 2 all who assisted & mother & baby doing well!!!.’ It is the second time a mother has given birth in an unusual place in Birmingham in the space of a month.

Witnesses have told how it sounded ‘like a bomb going off’ when part of the 125ft high office block in Hounslow High Street fell to the ground – showering a busy road in rubble – yesterday afternoon. Hounslow West Tube Station was left without power during rush hour following the incident and a nearby bus station had to be evacuated by police over concerns for safety. Witnesses said it sounded 'like a bomb going off' when part of the 125ft high office block in Hounslow High Street fell to the ground - showering a road in rubble and cutting off the power supply to Hounslow West Tube . Part of the seven-storey office block's front was left hanging off at an awkward angle and debris was left strewn across the main road following the incident which is believed to have been a sudden accident . Despite Hounslow House being scheduled for demolition, it is thought the huge collapse was an accident which may have been caused by a crane plunging into the front of it. Part of the office block’s front was left hanging off at an awkward angle and debris was left strewn across the main road following the incident. Sam Gibbs, who was just yards from the building as it collapsed, described it as ‘terrifying’. ‘My whole office shook,’ he said. A nearby resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘I know they’ve been working on that site for a while now, because my car is constantly covered in dust. ‘But that can’t have been a controlled demolition - the bang was so loud it sounded like a bomb going off. ‘There was rubble all over the road - it’s a wonder nobody was killed. ‘I heard the building was hit by a . crane. I’m not sure whether it was an accident or not, but if it wasn’t . an accident, nobody should be allowed to demolish a building that way. ‘It was so dangerous.’ Despite the office block, which is called Hounslow House, being scheduled for demolition to make way for a new development, it is thought the collapse was an accident which may have been caused by a crane hitting it . Hounslow West Tube Station was left without power during rush hour following the incident yesterday afternoon and a nearby bus station (above) had to be evacuated and cordoned off over concerns for safety . Hounslow House was in the process of being knocked down to make way for a possible housing development when the unexpected collapse occurred. Police confirmed no one was injured when the front of the block fell . Others took to Twitter to share news of the incident including Colin Tutty who wrote: 'A crane has hit a building in Hounslow.' Hounslow House is in the process of being knocked down to make way for a possible housing development - dubbed Tesco Tower after the supermarket’s interest in the site. Police, firefighters, paramedics and a specialist hazardous team were all called to the scene but officers confirmed there were no reported injuries. A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: ‘We were called to the scene at 4:40pm to a building site, where a disused office block had partially collapsed. ‘There were no reported injuries.’ A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service confirmed an ambulance crew, duty officer and the hazardous area response team were also sent but said 'nobody required any treatment.'. It is understood GBM Demolition, a Lincolnshire-based company, was carrying out the demolition process at the site. However, while no cause has yet been given for the incident, it is thought to have been an unexpected collapse. GMB Demolition said a statement would be given shortly when contacted by MailOnline.","Part of 125ft high office block in Hounslow High Street collapsed suddenly .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Dr David Glowacki, a Research Fellow at the Royal Society, was ejected from the Bristol Old Vic . A leading scientist was kicked out of a classic music concert after trying to crowd surf during a performance of Handel’s Messiah, it has emerged. Dr David Glowacki, a Research Fellow at the Royal Society and visiting professor at the prestigious Stanford University in the US, was ejected from the Bristol Old Vic after getting ‘overexcited’ during the performance. His apparent crowd surfing came as audience members were encouraged to move towards the front of the stage with their drinks and ‘clap or whoop when you like’ by the theatre’s artistic director, Tom Morris. However, while the crowd were warned not to ‘shush other people’, Mr Morris said the respected chemist got ‘very excited’ during the Hallelujah Chorus. Witnesses claim he was lurching from side to side with his hands raised and whooping before attempting to crowd-surf, The Independent reported. Apparently irritated by the commotion, audience members attempted to eject the professor from the main arena. Mr Morris, who directed War Horse at the National Theatre, told The Independent: ‘The Bristol Proms are contributing to a ground-breaking way of thinking which will pave the way for a new kind of classical concert. ‘But by allowing an audience to respond in whatever way they want, you also allow an audience to self-regulate, as we discovered.’ However, Dr Glowacki, who said he was not . under the influence of alcohol, defended his actions and accused both . Morris and the audience members of hypocrisy in only approving the right . sort of 'free' behaviour. He told the newspaper: ‘Classical . music, trying to seem cool and less stuffy, reeks of some sort of . fossilised art form undergoing a midlife crisis.' His apparent crowd surfing came as audience members were encouraged to move towards the front of the stage during the performance at the Bristol Old Vic (above) by the theatre's artistic director, Tom Morris . Several ticket holders have since . urged Mr Morris to stipulate an official ban on crowd surfing. He said while . he does not wish to impose strict rules, he would not . tolerate crowd surfing during classical concerts. The performance of Handel's Messiah, launched by Mr Morris as a more 'accessible and informal' alternative to classical music, forms part of this year's Bristol Proms.","Dr David Glowacki ejected from Bristol Old Vic after trying to crowd surf .

"By . Laura Williamson . He might have been ‘held together by tape’, but that did not stop Greg Rutherford adding the Commonwealth title to his Olympic long jump gold on Wednesday. This was the one he really wanted, after all; the title that Rutherford felt he needed to silence all those who have unfairly labelled his achievement on ‘Super Saturday’ two years ago as ‘lucky’. That is why he had been talking about these Games since winning at London 2012 and why he has overcome the ruptured hamstring that nearly forced him to quit athletics, 36 pain-killing injections and a damaged left knee to pursue his dream of winning in Glasgow. Beaming: Team England's Greg Rutherford is all smiles as he holds up his gold medal for winning the long jump . Commonwealth champion: Rutherford won the long jump final with a leap of 8.20m on Wednesday evening . Punch the air: The 27-year-old celebrates on day seven of the Commonwealth Games after his win is confirmed . Even on Tuesday Rutherford’s therapist, Andy Burke, had to drive up from London to treat his left hamstring. ‘This is one of the best feelings of my life,’ said Rutherford, who won a silver medal four years ago in Delhi. ‘People are always going to write you off. The Olympics came as a shock to some people, but I had been working so hard for that moment in London. ‘This year I have probably been working beyond hard to make sure that I could win a major title again. ‘I considered quitting at one point with my hamstring, so the fact I have managed to win a major championship is just amazing.’ Even in the minutes before his victory on Wednesday, BBC pundit Michael Johnson’s criticism that Rutherford ‘had a little bit of a chip on his shoulder’ prompted British 200m runner James Ellington to spring to Rutherford’s defence. Johnson ‘just slates our athletes’, Ellington wrote on Twitter. ‘There’s being honest and being disrespectful.’ But Rutherford’s performance demanded respect last night. His winning distance was 11cm down on his leading jump in London and 31cm less than the new British record he set earlier this year, but the manner of his victory was deeply impressive. Quite the collection: Rutherford adds the Commonwealth title to his Olympic gold medal from London 2012 . Leading the charge: Rutherford won gold for England despite having his sleep disturbed in the athletes' village . Podia potential: Rutherford collects his medal flanked by the silver and bronze medallists, Zarck Visser, left, and Rushwakl Samaai, right, both of South Africa . Rutherford really thrived on the crowd’s warm reception in an arena where his great-grandfather, Jock, played football for England 106 years ago. The 27-year-old responded to South African Zarck Visser taking the lead by jumping 8.20m in the third round, earning the right to parade around Hampden Park with a St George’s cross. It was only the second time Jerusalem has played in this stadium this week, following Dan Greaves’s victory in the F42/44 discus. England needed another gold medal in track and field after winning five silvers on Tuesday night and their Olympic champion — the only one of the ‘Super Saturday’ trio to compete in Glasgow — duly provided it. However, a heptathlete called Jessica also won a medal as Rutherford triumphed. With Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill missing these championships after giving birth to her son, Reggie, earlier this month, it fell to Jessica Taylor to continue England’s proud tradition in the women’s multi-sport event. The 26-year-old won bronze and set a new personal best of 5,826 points. Taylor, who is trained by Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s coach Mike Holmes, was third going into the final event, the 800m, and made sure she finished ahead of Jamaican Salcia Slack to clinch the bronze medal behind champion Brianne Theisen-Eaton of Canada. Record-breaker: Kirani James strolled to victory in the 400m and set a new Commonwealth fastest time . There was disappointment, however, for Martyn Rooney in the men’s 400m final. The 27-year-old seemed to go off too slowly, leaving himself far too much to do in the final straight as he finished fourth. Kirani James, 21, added Grenada’s first Commonwealth gold to his Olympic title by beating Iwan Thomas’s 16-year-old Games record with a winning time of 44.24sec.

"By . Katy Winter . Born Grant, Jessica Gillien, 20, always felt as though he was trapped in the wrong body. Making the brave decision to live as a woman Jessica has had to endure taunts, stalkers and even death threats. After doing a modelling shoot with a friend, Jessica, from Scotland, found it boosted her confidence and feeling of femininity hugely and that it also offered her a platform to champion the rights of transgendered people. Jessica only began modelling six months ago when a friend asked her to pose in a shoot for her . Even as a child (left) Jessica felt she was trapped in a male body, and by age 14 (right) was experimenting with make-up and dressing as a woman . 'Ever since I was young I wanted to dress up in girls' clothes and I remember aged three my favourite toy was a Barbie doll. By the time I was 14 I was experimenting with new looks and ways I could look like a girl so that I could be myself and not be judged for being trans. ‘I went to a celeb lookalike party as a woman and everyone said how great i looked and from then on I decided I wanted to be a woman when I was older. ‘At the age of 15 I told my mum that I wanted to be a female. She was supportive but apprehensive and scared for me as I made the decision at such a young age. 'We agreed to wait until I was older before I made any changes or started taking hormones and looking into surgery, but by the age 17 I couldn't wait any longer.' Jessica has faced stalking, abuse and even death threats for being transgender . ‘I felt like a woman, I dressed like a woman, and deep down I knew I was always meant to be a woman. I started to dress like a girl and went to the doctors to speak about hormones and how to get the ball rolling. My friends and family were supportive but it’s not been easy. ‘I've had stalkers and death threats, even hate crimes but the worst of these ones were settled in court. ‘I haven't undergone any surgery yet but have been taking steroids for over a year now and I love the way I look. ‘I may consider surgery in the future but at the moment nobody thinks I’m a man so I may stay natural. Jessica began modelling six months ago when a friend asked her to pose in a shoot for her. ‘It was amazing, I felt empowered, sexy. It was the most like a woman I'd ever felt. ‘A . photographer from London asked if he could shoot me and I said yes, to . this day I think he thinks I’m a girl. Well, I am… but you know what I . mean!! ‘Since then I’ve done more and more shoots and it’s my mission to become the first ever published Trans glamour model. ‘Being trans gives you a larger sense of . achievement when you do things like this as its proving everyone wrong, . it’s been so hard over the years and all the changes I’ve gone through . both mentally and physically but I look in the mirror and it’s all been . worth it. Jessica says in front of a camera is where she feels her most confident and sexy . ‘I look the best I’ve ever looked and all my friends and family are behind me so I’m going to do this. I won’t stop until Trans is fully accepted in our culture today - it’s my mission and I WILL make it happen! ‘I’d love to help any other confused girls and boys out there who are trans and scared to be themselves.

"By . Katy Winter . A man has gone from struggling to fasten his seatbelt on a plane to looking forward to taking his first flying lessons after losing more than 11st. Thirty-one-year-old Brendan O’Donnell has dreamed of fulfilling his ambition to learn to fly for years but was always too heavy for light aircraft. Now he’s slimmed from 25st 9lb to 14st 6lb and been named Slimming World Man of the Year 2014 – and to celebrate he’s planning to take to the air. Brendan, who works for insurance firm Aviva, was nicknamed ‘Big Bee’ as a child and has struggled with his weight since school. Scroll down for video . Weighing in at 25st 9lb at size 6XL and a 48in waist Brendan, pictured cuddling a friend's baby, decided to tackle his diet . Standing at 6ft, Brendan lost 11st 3lb through diet and exercise, now weighing a trim 14st 6lb (right) He would hide behind jokes about his size and, despite attempting to slim down in the past, it wasn’t until his 30th birthday that he decided to make a serious change. He says: ‘I turned 30 at the beginning of 2013. You get to that age and I suppose you start to grow up a bit. I’d been lucky and didn’t have any health problems, but I began to wonder how long I could continue with the lifestyle I was leading and remain reasonably healthy. ‘We organised a number of birthday celebrations throughout the year and looking back I realise my weight impacted on a lot of them. A holiday to Spain last summer was almost ruined because I spent the whole time feeling too hot to enjoy myself, and on the plane home I only just managed to fasten the seatbelt. It dug into me for the whole flight and I decided enough was enough. Brendan used to eat an unhealthy diet of convenience food, snacking on crisps and chocolate . Back home Brendan and his wife Sarah, who live in Fridaythorpe in East Yorkshire, joined a nearby Slimming World group in Driffield in August 2013. Brendan says: ‘Anyone who says they weren’t nervous when they first joined Slimming World, especially a bloke, probably isn’t telling the truth. ‘I was terrified because I thought everyone was going to turn and look at me, but I needn’t have worried as everyone was so friendly and welcoming – and there was even another man there which pleased me no end! I quickly realised I’d come to the right place and I’ve made so many friends there now, it’s like having your own cheerleading squad every week.’ Brendan's incredible achievement has resulted in him being crowned Slimming World's Man of the Year . Brendan and Sarah swapped their diet of ready meals, convenience foods and weekly takeaways for cooking meals from scratch including their favourite dish of barbecue pulled pork. He says: ‘I’ve followed meal replacement diets before and lost several stone but they taught me nothing about changing the way I eat and my relationship with food, so when I stopped, the weight went back on as quickly as I’d lost it. ‘I love that I can fill my plate and feel satisfied – the only problem now is that Sarah and I argue over who gets to do the cooking because we both enjoy it so much!’ Previously doing minimal activity, Brendan has discovered a love of running during his weight loss . As well as overhauling his eating habits, Brendan’s discovered a love of running. He says: ‘I’ve never been sporty and at school I’d do anything I could to avoid PE. But after I’d lost a bit of weight I decided I wanted to increase my activity levels and my consultant, Shirley, told me about the couch to 5km challenge, which promised to get you running for 30 minutes within weeks. ‘I decided to give it a try and within eight weeks I ran 30 minutes without stopping – in fact, I was so pleased I ended up running for 45 minutes because I didn’t want to stop! Since then I’ve taken part in 10k races and I’d like to attempt further in the future. Breakfast: Croissants, large latte . Lunch: Pre-packed sandwiches, large bag of crisps and a bag of sweets . Dinner: Frozen pizza with a large portion of chips . Snacks: Sharing bags of crisps or chocolate bars . Breakfast: Fresh fruit with fat-free fromage frais and granola . Mid-morning: Skinny cappuccino . Lunch: Tuna pasta salad . Mid-afternoon: Plenty of fresh fruit . Dinner: BBQ pulled pork with chips (baked in the oven) and roasted vegetables . Snacks: Sushi, lean meat, fruit, ice lollies . Since joining Slimming World Brendan’s lost 11st 3lb and dropped from a size 6XL and a 48in waist to wearing M-L clothes and a 34in waist while his wife Sarah has lost nearly 4st. Brendan, who would like to lose another stone to reach his personal target weight, says: “It’s been incredible and doing it together with Sarah has been really important because whenever one of us has had a bad day the other one is there to pick them up and keep us both on track. I feel fantastic and being named as Slimming World Man of the Year 2014 is incredible.’ This summer when Brendan heads off on holiday he’s not worrying about the heat or aeroplane seats and he has big plans for the rest of the year too. He says: ‘We’re returning to a music festival we went to last year and planning to recreate some of the photos to see the difference in us. I’m also hoping to try scuba diving now I can fit in a wetsuit, and I’m going to learn to fly which is something I’d always wanted to do but I was previously too heavy for light aircraft. ‘People always say that losing weight has given them a second chance at life but I’ve never been this slim before so I feel like this is my first chance and I’m determined to make the most of it. I’m never going back to the old Brendan, this is me forever now.’","Always large, Brendan's poor diet led his weight to rise to nearly 26st .

"By . Katy Winter . With mere weeks until she joins Team GB for the World Equestrian Games in Normandy, Zara Phillips is once again back in the saddle. The former Olympic equestrian took part with her horse High Kingdom at CHIO Aachen World Equestrian Festival in Aachen on Friday. The Queen’s granddaughter looked confident and robust in the saddle, dressed all in white to fend off the stifling midday heat. Zara, who rode her horse High Kingdom, looked focused despite the heat and bright sunshine . The CHIO Aachen World Equestrian Festival in Aachen is one of the events the mother-of-one is competing in in the run up to World Equestrian Games in Normandy . Just last week the 33-year-old competed at the Dauntsey Park Horse Trials in Wiltshire, while her six-month-old baby daughter Mia looked on from the side lines. On Friday however, there was no sign of Mia as Zara focused on honing her craft. Zara's riding career, put on hold during her pregnancy and for the first few months of Mia's life, is slowly cranking back into top gear as the World Equestrian Games approach. Earlier this month, Zara took to the field at the Barbury Horse Trials near Marlborough - with baby Mia once more among the crowds. Late June saw her enjoy a successful day at the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire, watched by husband Mike Tindall, 36, and another outing at the Hopetoun Horse Trials in Edinburgh. Zara's riding career, put on hold during her pregnancy and for the first few months of Mia's life, is slowly cranking back into top gear as the World Equestrian Games approach . Now settled into motherhood, it seems Zara's determination to win has not been softened by any sleepless nights cause by six-month-old Mia . The Queen's granddaughter looked confident and robust in the saddle dressed all in white to fend off the stifling midday heat . Having won a silver medal in the 2012 Olympics, Zara’s passion for riding is well known. But she courted some controversy during her pregnancy with first child Mia when she continued to ride well into her second trimester. Now settled into motherhood, it seems Zara’s determination to win has not been softened by sleepless nights, her ambition no doubt bolstered by the knowledge that scouts for the 2016 Rio Olympic games will be watching the World Equestrian Games.","Queen's granddaughter at CHIO Aachen World Equestrian Festival .

"By . Anna Edwards . Letting her baking do the talking; Ruby Tandoh says she encountered a barrage of abuse . It is a show that is filled with the sweeter things in life; cakes, puddings and kind judge Mary Berry. But The Great British Bake Off left a bitter taste in finalist Ruby Tandoh's mouth, who says she was subjected to 'lazy misogyny' in a torrent of online abuse. Former model Tandoh, who clashed with TV chef Raymond Blanc when he suggested she was too thin to enjoy food, said she was 'surprised at just how much nastiness was generated from the show'. Writing in The Guardian, she said: 'Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press. 'Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode... How did a programme about cake become so divisive?' Tandoh, 21, said criticism ranged from the gently cynical to the downright obnoxious, 'but as the series went on I noticed an increasing degree of personal vitriol and misogyny'. She added: 'We (female) finalists are supposedly too meek, too confident, too thin, too domestic, too smiley, too taciturn.' The contestant, who consistently won the applause from judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood on her instinctive baking skills, had been criticised for being emotional on the show. Ruby's tears inside the Bake Off tent incurred the wrath of viewers, who shrieked insults at her online . In one episode, presenter Mel Giedroyc, dabbed her nose when she was weeping during a stressful bake, and on another occasion, at the behest of Tandoh, told her to 'get a grip'. when she became too flustered. Some fans of the show grew frustrated with the university student, who they claimed was cunningly portraying herself as fragile to win sympathy from the judges. But judge Paul Hollywood defended the young baker, describing her as 'one of the most talented bakers who has walked in that tent'. As the runner-up became as much a talking point as her baking skills, chef Raymond Blanc waded in on the commentary to deride 'female tears' on the BBC2 show. The . 63-year-old chef sparked anger when he wrote on Twitter, mistakenly . referring to Tandoh as the show’s winner: 'The Great British Bake Off. Not much skills, female tears and a winner so thin who makes me doubt of . her love for great cooking, baking.' The Great British Bake Off finalist Ruby Tandoh with her fellow competitors and the judges (left to right) Mary Berry, Kimberley Wilson, Frances Quinn and Paul Hollywood . Tandoh hit back, writing: '@raymond-blanc ‘female tears’?! and what has anyone’s size got to do with it? 'I don’t care if you’re a patisserie king - don’t be an idiot.' Blanc later apologised, tweeting co-host Paul Hollywood: 'Apologies if I upset people this morning. I would like to congratulate you on a show. Best Rb xx' Tandoh wondered in the article: 'What are ‘female tears’, anyway? Are they more fragile and delicate than male tears? Do they wear pink?' And she added: 'If a show as gentle as Bake Off can stir up such a sludge of lazy misogyny in the murky waters of the internet, I hate to imagine the full scale of the problem.' Tandoh, who is studying for a . philosophy degree, said in an interview with student magazine The Tab . that she was not bothered by accusations of favouritism. She . said: 'It's easy to brush it off because I know how it was in the tent - . and there was no favouritism. It was all very fair so that doesn't get . to me very much.' Despite the unexpected controversy around the finalist, the BBC2 show has pulled in the viewers and is set to move to BBC1 next year as a result of its rising ratings. The . contest has had BBC2's highest viewing figures so far this year with . an average audience of seven million. The . audience has grown from an average of 2.8 million for the first series . in 2010, peaking with 7.8 million a fortnight ago - more than even last . year's final, which drew a total of 7.2 million.","Student Ruby Tandoh, 21, defends herself against angry commentators .

"By . Sam Marsden . Firebrand: Sheikh al-Habib has allegedly said comments on air that are considered deeply offensive to Sunnis . A firebrand Muslim cleric is being allowed to broadcast hate sermons to the Middle East from a pretty Home Counties village because the regulator Ofcom is powerless to act. Sheikh Yasser al-Habib, 34, is accused of stirring up bitter sectarian tensions in the Islamic world via his UK-licensed satellite channel, which is based in a former Christian church hall in a leafy corner of Buckinghamshire. His station, Fardak TV, is required to comply with Ofcom’s strict rules banning hate speech for any programmes that can be watched by British or European viewers. But the communications regulator can place no restrictions on what he broadcasts to the rest of the world because this is out of its jurisdiction. Sheikh al-Habib, who belongs to the minority Shia branch of Islam, has allegedly made remarks on air that are considered deeply offensive to the rival Sunni sect. He was granted asylum in Britain in 2004 after being jailed in his native Kuwait for insulting some of the most revered figures for Sunnis. Tensions between the two branches of Islam are at the root of much of the bloodshed that has plagued the Middle East for centuries, right up to the current conflict in Syria. An MP warned that problems between Sunnis and Shias would also ‘bubble up’ in Britain unless action was taken to stamp out hate speech aired with impunity from the UK. Last year Sheikh al-Habib led a campaign that raised £2 million to buy a former evangelical Christian retreat in the idyllic village of Fulmer in the Buckinghamshire commuter belt. The large hall has been turned into a mosque that also houses Fadak TV, which is broadcast across the world by different satellites. In a recent programme, Sheikh al-Habib was filmed cutting a cake to celebrate the death of one of the most important historical figures in Sunni Islam, the BBC reported. The radical cleric also allegedly said: ‘Stay away from Shia, or the hand that helps fund those in Syria, we will cut it off, and I know what I mean.’ Khalid Mahmood, the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Bar, said Sheikh al-Habib had also claimed on air that two male early Islamic leaders who are revered by Sunnis had a sexual relationship together. Broadcasting from leafy Buckinghamshire but only to the Middle East, he cannot be stopped by Ofcom, which only has the power to place restrictions on stations playing to British and European listeners . Ofcom is investigating whether any of these remarks were broadcast to British viewers. A second satellite TV channel, Wesal Farsi, based in north-west London, which is targeted at Iran’s Sunni minority, is accused of transmitting a programme in which a presenter called Shia clerics ‘devils’ and accused them of stealing from God. This station is not licensed by Ofcom. Mr Mahmood described the material being aired on Fadak TV as ‘ten times worse’ than the sections of Salman Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses that led to the British author facing death threats. He added: ‘If somebody was being anti-Semitic, we would take action. If somebody was being racist we would take action – even if it was an Asian person having a go at a black person. And it’s quite right to do that. ‘Because this is seen as intra-faith, nobody seems to be bothered. It is already causing problems in the Gulf and the Middle East. It will start to bubble up here as well.’ The MP called on Ofcom to stamp out sectarian hate speech, and said that the regulator should if necessary be given more powers and resources to investigate foreign-language channels broadcast from the UK. 'Because this is seen as intra-faith, . nobody seems to be bothered. It is already causing problems in the Gulf . and the Middle East.' - Khalid Mahmood MP . ‘We have got to put a stop to it, and it’s the responsibility of Ofcom to do that. If they can’t deal with it, then the police should step in,’ he said. Ofcom investigated Fadak TV in 2012 after Sheikh al-Habib broadcast a sermon in which he questioned the sexuality of a Sunni successor to the Prophet Muhammad. But the regulator concluded that there had been no breach of its broadcasting code and issued the station with ‘formal guidance’. An Ofcom spokesman said yesterday: ‘Ofcom has strict rules forbidding the broadcast of hate speech on TV and we take this extremely seriously. When channels break these rules, we take robust action and have recently fined broadcasters. ‘We are examining the allegations made against Fadak TV, and if it is breaking our rules then we will act swiftly. ‘While people in the UK can watch programmes on the internet or on satellite from around the world, Ofcom has jurisdiction to investigate and take action when a channel is licensed to broadcast in the UK. ‘If individuals are preaching hate in the UK, this is a criminal act and should be reported to the police.’ Sheikh al-Habib could not be contacted yesterday, but he declined to comment when approached by the BBC.","Sheikh Yasser al-Habib accused of stirring tension from Buckinghamshire .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Celtic captain Scott Brown declared his furious team-mates ready to ram taunts from Legia Warsaw players down their throats to secure a Champions League lifeline. The Parkhead skipper missed last week’s first-leg defeat in the Polish capital through long-term injury but was left incensed by the antics of the Poles as they goaded their Scottish opponents at the end of the shock 4-1 win. For Brown, the incident reminded him of the antics of Shakhter Karagandy after Celtic’s 2-0 Champions League qualifying defeat in Kazakhstan last season. Spurred on by such ‘disrespect’ in the first leg, Celtic duly won the return in Glasgow 3-0 to progress on aggregate, with Brown booked for celebrating in the face of Kazakh keeper Aleksandr Mokin at full-time. Turnaround: Miroslav Radovic (third left) celebrates his second goal which gave Legia Warsaw a 2-1 lead over Celtic . Off: Efe Ambrose leaves Celtic with only 10 men after making a challenge on Leiga Warsaw's Michal Kucharczyk . Now the 29-year-old Scotland skipper expects his side to ease the pressure on under-fire boss Ronny Deila by ensuring the Poles face a similar backlash at Murrayfield tomorrow night. ‘The Legia players got a bit  over-confident and celebrated in our boys’ faces — our lads will remember every single thing,’ vowed Brown. ‘The lads will be thinking about that as soon as they go into the game. They will want to be the ones doing the celebrating at  full-time. ‘Last year, it was similar against Karagandy, and it was such a great night when we went through. It was one of those nights people think only happen in fairytales. ‘But we turned it around that night after getting battered over there — and it’s pretty much the same squad of players we have just now. ‘Yes, we have a lot to do in the second leg and it will be hard, but they are not the best team in the world — and everyone is due a bad result. Glum: Injured Celtic captain Scott Brown (centre) looks on from pitchside . Back on track: Radovic (left) celebrates scoring Legia's equaliser . ‘We had ours last week. I have faith in the lads that they can turn it around.’ Yet pressure is mounting on Deila even this early in his reign and Parkhead legend Frank McAvennie fears the new boss was chosen to succeed Neil Lennon solely because he is willing to be manipulated by the club’s directors. McAvennie, part of the Hoops’ double-winning centenary side in 1988, also criticised the board for playing tomorrow night’s crucial qualifier at the home of Scottish rugby, claiming that their chances of overturning the 4-1 first leg deficit would have been greater at Celtic Park. ‘I hope he is not the puppet some people say he is but I fear he might be,’ said McAvennie. ‘What manager comes into a club and is told who his right-hand man will be? It doesn’t work that way. ‘I played with (assistant manager) John Collins and we get on well — but he is a strong character. ‘If Ronny isn’t strong, John will take over. Early smiles: McGregor celebrates his strike with Celtic team-mates . ‘No one had ever heard of this guy but maybe (chief executive) Peter Lawwell didn’t expect to go through and he has got someone to point the blame at. ‘Roy Keane knocked the job back because of the budget but also because he wouldn’t be allowed to bring his own team in. ‘Roy would have attracted more players on a reduced budget than Ronny will. ‘He will be shopping in the bargain basement because he doesn’t know anything else. Lenny tried to get a few players and never got them. ‘You can’t keep selling top players and not replace them. Eventually, you will come a cropper. ‘Hopefully, I am wrong — but they could get beaten again on Wednesday.’ Frank McAvennie was speaking as the Bauer Group announced a deal with the Scottish Professional Football League for weekly live commentary on numerous games across Clyde 2, Forth 2, Northsound 2, Tay AM, MFR 2 and West Sound.","The Parkhead skipper missed last week’s first-leg defeat in the Polish capital .

"By . Katy Winter . After years of yo-yo dieting, Stella Sydee’s weight had spiralled out of control. She suffered from asthma, joint pain and depression and her self-confidence had hit rock bottom. Deciding enough was enough, Stella lost over 8st, rebuilding her self-confidence in the process. And she's now eager to share her dieting and fitness tips to help others reach their own weight loss goals. Scroll down for video . Stella dropped from 17st (left) to a slim 9st and size 8-10 (right) over the course of her weight loss journey . Stella, 42, explains: ‘My weight was affecting every aspect of my life. I was a bubbly outgoing person, but my weight gain was sapping my confidence and I no longer enjoyed going out and socialising. I would stay at home instead and slept a lot during the day. ‘Although I didn’t realise it at the time, food was becoming a secret addiction and I would comfort eat on a daily basis, relying on food to make me happy. 'I knew my weight was out of control, as I had reached nearly 17st, but I didn’t know how I could gain control and make a long term change. ‘My health was also becoming a concern, I was depressed and my joints were beginning to ache. My asthma had also worsened and breathing was often difficult.’ Managing to shed an initial 2st through exercise and changes to her diet, Stella found her weight loss plateaued. Stella's size was effecting her health and she suffered from asthma, joint pain and depression . She decided to join a slimming club to give her more structure and support. ‘Despite my weight, I still exercised with my friend who is a fitness instructor. We went on walks together but I still wasn’t losing enough. I had tried so many different diets and had some success prior to LighterLlife, losing almost 2st, but with more than 5st still to lose I became discouraged and the comfort eating and weight gain returned. ‘This was when my friend recommended LighterLife as the counselling sessions would help me learn about the behaviour leading to the comfort eating and equip me with the tools to keep the weight off for the rest of my life. After an initial loss of 2st Stella's weight loss stalled until she joined Lighter Life and started counseling and a food replacement diet to combat her over eating . With her weight at 15st 3lbs, she . attended counsellor Sharon Hamilton’s classes in Dartford. She undertook . the Total programme, where ordinary eating is replaced by four . specially-formulated food packs per day, alongside weekly counselling . sessions to assess the psychological issues behind over-eating and . ensure a permanent lifestyle change. ‘It . was a turning point in my life. It has taken time, but now after losing . 5st and adopting a healthier lifestyle, I have re-educated my way of . thinking around food, trimmed myself down to a size 8-10 and now weigh a . steady 9st. 'I feel fit, . healthy and confident about myself and I am so much more excited for . life. My bubbly personality has returned and I love socialising with . friends and family and no longer take a back seat. ‘My . family and friends have been amazed by my weight loss journey and I . love it when I see people who I haven’t seen for a while as they truly . don’t recognise me! I love their reactions when they realise who I am, . they are often lost for words! My husband, two sons and my parents have . been particularly supportive throughout this time and enjoy the new more . active me. Stella now loves socializing again and says her old confidence has returned once again . ‘Last time we visited Centre Parcs, I went on the zip wire, in the pool and the water rapids. This was something I would never have done before I lost the weight and it felt great to be able to get involved in fun activities with my family. ‘My love for fashion is something that I can now enjoy and l look forward to shopping for new clothes. 'Before I lost weight I hated clothes shopping and would only buy long tops that covered my body which I wore with jeans or leggings but now I love dressing up in skirts or dresses and heels. 'Exercise and fitness has also become a passion of mine, my gym is now like my second home. ‘Losing the weight and changing my thinking about myself and given me the confidence to start working again. I currently work part-time for an elderly people charity, visiting them in their homes. It is extremely rewarding and has also helped rebuild my confidence. ‘As I feel passionate about helping others, I am also studying Nutrition, CBT and NLP building a career in Weight Management. I want to help other people who struggle with issues around food and self confidence to experience the success I never dreamed possible, equipping them with not only sound nutritional advice but with the essential psychological tools to enable long term change in their lives.’","At her largest Stella Sydee weighed 17st .

"John Collins has insisted that Ronny Deila won’t crumble under the pressure of managing Celtic. The Norwegian suffered a Champions League nightmare in his first major test as the Scottish champions crashed to a 4-1 first leg qualifying defeat to Legia Warsaw in Poland. Facing the mountainous task of salvaging a £15million bounty in the second leg at Murrayfield, Deila will miss today’s friendly with Spurs in Helsinki to put in extra hours on the training field with key first-team players at Lennoxtown instead. Disappointing: Ronny Deila's new Celtic side slumped to a 4-1 defeat to Legia Warsaw . Joking around: Assistant John Collins will step up against Tottenham . Assistant manager Collins will take charge of a development squad including Craig Gordon, Efe Ambrose, local boy Teemu Pukki and Amido Balde against a star-studded Tottenham side. Claiming Deila will prove his critics wrong after criticism of his team selection and tactics in midweek, Collins said: ‘Ronny is a strong character. He has been a manager for a number of years. ‘We have all been in situations where matches haven’t gone your way. ‘As a manager, as a player and a coach, you look forward to the next game and trying to put it right. ‘First and foremost we look forward to tomorrow’s game with the young boys. ‘Then on Wednesday we try to put in a good performance and try to get the result.’ Deila has come under fire for throwing new arrival Jo Inge Berget straight into the Warsaw clash just 48 hours after he signed a six-month loan deal. Disappointing: There were no excuses for the Scottish champions' poor defeat in Poland . The Norwegian had played just 72 minutes of first-team football since signing for Cardiff City in January and his selection raised eyebrows, as did Deila’s decision to pick Adam Matthews ahead of Emilio Izaguirre at left back. Insisting Celtic are still in the tie after surviving two missed Legia penalties, however, Collins shrugged: ‘If you are a manager you get these nights, disappointments and great results. ‘It’s all about trying to bounce back from the disappointments and go again. ‘You can’t feel sorry for yourself. You have to dust yourself down and get ready for Wednesday. ‘We know it’s a big task. But we’ll have a good support cheering us on – which we know will happen, they’ll get behind the team. ‘And we have to respond by coming out of the blocks with high tempo, putting them under pressure.’ Insisting Deila never planned to travel to Finland for today’s Spurs game irrespective of the Legia result, Collins declared: ‘That was always going to be the case no matter how the result went in midweek - but we just need to get ready and turn it around. Tough test: Collins must try to lead a despondent team against Tottenham in Finland . ‘Obviously it’s squeezed between the two big games so it wouldn’t have been wise to bring the first team out here – a three-hour flight, lots of travelling, so they’re at home resting, preparing for a big game on Wednesday. ‘They worked today, they’ll be working on Saturday, and then have Sunday off, ready to go again. ‘The game in midweek was a disappointment. The first half was going along fine but going down to 10 men makes it difficult. And to lose the two late goals makes it a tough task. ‘It’s only half time though - and we have goalscorers in the team. ‘I’m sure we’ll create plenty chances, we just have to take them and keep it tight at the back. ‘It’s a different ball game at home with the fans behind us. If we can get an early goal and light up the stadium, give the players energy, that’s the target.’ Collins was unable to cast any light on reports from Belgium that Lokeren want to sign Balde on a season-long loan deal. ‘I don’t anything about that. I haven’t heard but it could well be true,’ he said. ‘He’s not managed to break in and become a regular. But he has scored a few goals coming on as a substitute. But we’re strong in that department with (Anthony) Stokes and (Leigh) Griffiths and Pukki. So it’s been tough for him.’","Celtic lost 4-1 to Legia Warsaw in first leg of Champions League qualifir .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Organisers of Celtic's thumping weekend defeat to Tottenham are seeking an apology and a refund from the Scottish champions after branding the decision to send a team of kids 'disrespectful'. Faced with over-turning a 4-1 Champions League first leg deficit to Legia Warsaw, manager Ronny Deila stayed with his first team in Glasgow as a development squad suffered a 6-1 thrashing at Helsinki's Olympic Stadium on Saturday. Efe Ambrose, Teemu Pukki, Amido Balde and Craig Gordon were the only senior first team players to travel to Finland. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Christian Eriksen's stunning free kick in 6-1 win over Celtic . Keeping it together: Craig Gordon was one of the few Celtic first team players to travel to Finland . Stepping up: Celtic assistant manager John Coillins took charge of the side in the absence of Ronny Delia . On Sunday Celtic defended the move by saying Deila had inherited the game from the previous management team. But Leino Lonsu of Estonian promoters FC Santos Invest claimed they felt 'cheated' after providing flights, accommodation and a match fee on the proviso Celtic travelled with a strong squad. Lonsu told Sportsmail: 'We are very disappointed about the team Celtic brought over. It was disrespectful to the opponent, to Finnish football fans and to the organisers to field such a squad. 'You could tell when you saw the Celtic team that the match would end like this. So we are extremely disappointed. 'The head coach did not come either - and that was disrespectful towards us as well. Six of the best: Emmanuel Adebayor scores the final goal in Tottenham's comfortable win over Celtic . Outclassed: Celtic's second string couldn't live with the likes of Kyle Naughton . Stars on show: Tottenham fielded a side that included Kyle Naughton and Erik Lamela (right) 'We will be communicating our feelings to Celtic. Because their actions were so disrespectful we want a written apology from the club president and part of the fee refunded. 'We also took care in advance of Celtic's accommodation and travel. We did absolutely everything professionally and what we didn't get back was a team. We feel we have been cheated.' Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino expressed surprise the Scottish champions decided against taking a full squad to the Finnish capital, admitting he expected a tougher game. With £15million on the line in Europe, however, Deila chose to work with his key players on the training ground at Lennoxtown instead. Midfield magicians: Christian Eriksen and Andros Townsend (right) both featured for Tottenham . A Celtic spokesman defended the move on Sunday saying: 'Clearly the match was agreed in February by the club's previous management team and obviously circumstances can change. 'We have spoken to the organisers and they understood the club's position given the Champions League qualifiers. 'Despite us having to send a younger squad they got a fantastic reception from all the fans in Finland and we are very grateful for all the support we received.' However, promoter Lonsu believes the lack of experienced Celtic names ruined the game as a spectacle. 'The Tottenham head coach was disappointed and the fans were all disappointed as well. The match was organised to be a top level spectacle and Tottenham came with almost a full squad. They played their top team thinking Celtic would do the same. 'We know the reason Celtic did this – they have important Champions League games. We understand that. Missing out: Ronny Deila (right) and Kris Commons skipped the friendly to prepare for Legia Warsaw . 'But they signed a contract and according to the terms they were bringing a strong line-up. There was no stipulation for how many top players, it was a general clause. But when the head coach does not travel that is a clear sign of how they are treating the game.' Swansea, meanwhile, have been linked with a shock move for Celtic's Adam Matthews. Manager Gary Monk hopes to bring in three new recruits before the close of the transfer window - and right-back is one position he wants to strengthen. Reports in Wales claim Matthews, a free transfer capture from Cardiff, is interested in a move to his hometown club. Celtic would seek a fee in excess of £3million.","Celtic lost 6-1 to Mauricio Pochettino's side in pre-season game on Saturday .

"By . Paul Harris . At last, she was coming back to where she belonged. Through busy streets, past some of the landmarks of her time in office, Baroness Thatcher was returned to Parliament yesterday, scene of some of her greatest triumphs. After so long out of the public eye, the former prime minister was allowed to take centre stage again on this, the first leg of her final journey. There were no military bands, no massed crowds lining the streets, and none of the pomp and ceremony that will accompany her funeral today. Scroll down for video . Back in Parliament: Baroness Thatcher's coffin resting in the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft beneath the Palace of Westminster . Return: The former Prime Minister served for 33 years in the House of Commons and another two decades in the House of Lords; St Mary Undercroft, where her coffin is resting, is all that remains of St Stephen's Chapel, where the House of Commons sat before the fire of 1834 . First to arrive: Spectators gather by St Paul's Cathedral along the route of today's funeral procession. Many had arrived by 6.30am . But the 30 minutes it took to transport her coffin across London was a prelude to Lady Thatcher’s last stand – her return to the Palace of Westminster, the battleground where she made her name. It began with her coffin being placed into a standard hearse at a funeral directors’ headquarters in North London and draped in a Union Jack. Then five motorcycle outriders and a shadowing police helicopter escorted it through the capital’s busy weekday traffic to a splendid, temporary resting place in readiness for the big day. In defiance of the anarchy threatened for her funeral, the journey was punctuated by simple ripples of applause, and even provoked a few cheers along the way. Cars came to a standstill as drivers realised this was no ordinary procession. Lining the streets: Mourners carrying banners, signs and flags gather along the route, hours in advance . Sign of respect: Bashkim Krasniqi, 28, from Kosovo, holds up a sign along the route. He grabbed his spot before dawn to ensure a good view of the procession . Early birds: Cameras at the ready, these supporters gathered to pay their final respects to the former prime minister . Proud police officers take their places outside St Clement Danes this morning, ahead of the funeral procession . Tourists, passers-by and a scattering of spectators suddenly found themselves witnessing a moment in history. Untypical among them was artist Kaya Mar, 57, holding a symbolic painting of Lady Thatcher and what he called ‘Britain’s haves and have-nots’. He arrived in Britain more than three decades ago from Turkey and France when the Labour-run country was crippled by strikes and left stinking with uncollected rubbish on the streets. ‘I am a socialist,’ Mr Mar told me. ‘But I know Margaret Thatcher had no choice but to do what she did to get the country running again. One day, sooner or later, England will need another Margaret Thatcher.’ Arrival: Lady Thatcher's coffin being carried into the Palace of Westminster yesterday ahead of today's funeral . Mark Thatcher (left) and his children Amanda and Michael with Carol Thatcher in the background and her partner Marco Grass, leaving St Paul's Cathedral yesterday . Grandchildren: Sir Mark's children Amanda, left, and Michael, right, also attended the service in the Palace of Westminster . In mourning: Carol Thatcher and her partner Marco Grass (left). Mark Thatcher with his wife Sarah, leave the home of his late mother, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (right) In the distance as he spoke, the . hearse was about to pass within sight of Downing Street before driving . slowly up to the Lords’ entrance to Parliament. Here, maybe only by chance, the Iron Lady lay briefly in the shadow of a bronze statue of Richard the Lionheart. An . undertaker lifted a large wreath – a circle of white roses with a . hand-written card inscribed: ‘Beloved Mother, Always in our Hearts’ – . from the coffin to allow four pall-bearers in black ties to carry the . casket inside. And then, moments before Big Ben sounded the hour, she was gone from public view. Once, Lady Thatcher would have taken her place inside as the dominant figure at the heart of some rowdy Commons debate, surrounded by baying enemies and noisy allies. Now, in a solitary coffin beneath the silent, vaulted emptiness of an ornate crypt, she was alone. For the next 18 hours, ahead of today’s procession to St Paul’s, she was scheduled to remain in the marble and stone surroundings of the chapel of St Mary Undercroft, deep beneath St Stephen’s Hall. Return: The body of Lady Thatcher lay overnight in the Parliament where she served for more than five decades . Event: Hundreds of well-wishers stopped to pay their respects as the hearse passed yesterday . Escort: Police motorbike riders, dressed in black, travelled alongside the hearse on its journey towards Parliament . The chapel spans more than 700 years of history, and yesterday, 87 of them belonged to Margaret Hilda Thatcher. They . call it Parliament’s ‘hidden gem’, a prized jewel in the palace’s . crown. Like its occupant overnight, it was variously challenged by . disaster, reform and betrayal. Fittingly, perhaps, it once became a hiding place for suffragette Emily Davison when, 102 years ago, she secreted herself in a cupboard overnight to be able to record her place of residence for the following day’s census as the House of Commons. She did not have the right to vote or to stand for Parliament. So far more than 2,300 guests have confirmed they will attend the service at St Paul's Cathedral. 32 – all of the current cabinet ministers are planning to attend. Over 50 attendees associated with the Falklands, including veterans. Over 30 attendees from Baroness Thatcher’s cabinets from 1979-1990 will attend. Two heads of state will attend. 11 serving prime ministers and 17 serving foreign ministers from across the globe are attending. Around 170 countries will be represented by foreign dignitaries (including members of royal families; serving presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers; former PMs and presidents and heads of missions). 11 Overseas Territories will be represented. Eight horses from the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery will be appearing in the procession - 'Mister Twister' is due to lead it. The Metropolitan Police have confirmed over 4,000 officers will be on duty. 6,650 online condolences have been received via the No 10 website. 36,300 views of photos on Flickr released by Downing Street of items related to Baroness Thatcher and pictures from her time as Prime Minister. 1.2million views to the Prime Minister's Facebook content following the death of Lady Thatcher. Over 1,800 media accredited. Two years later, she would die after stepping in front of the king’s horse during the Epsom Derby as a protest. Mrs Thatcher would later benefit from Miss Davison’s feminist cause by becoming an MP in 1959. Now the former prime minister – or ‘stateswoman (retired)’ as her death certificate rather formally described her – lay just a few feet from the brass plaque commemorating the 1911 event. She wasn’t alone for long though. After a private service attended by her close family – including son Mark and his children Michael, 24, and Amanda, 19, and daughter Carol with her boyfriend Marco Grass – friends and political associates, a stream of them filed by to pay their respects. During the night the Speaker’s chaplain, the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, kept a vigil. Soon, friends and supporters from a nation Lady Thatcher helped to shape will be allowed to say goodbye for the last time.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The dark skies of the Isle of Wight provide a stunning backdrop for these colourful images of the majestic Milky Way. Photographer Chad Powell used a Canon 6D DSLR camera to capture images of the spectacular constellation above the familiar beach scenes of England’s largest island. The 22-year-old, who shot the pictures over a year of stargazing on the island, often stayed up until dawn to catch the most dramatic skyscapes. The Milky Way above Steephill Cove in Isle of Wight, England. Photographer Chad Powell used a Canon 6D DSLR camera to capture images of the spectacular constellation above the familiar beach scenes of England’s largest island . The DSLR camera enhanced the Milky Way from the white strip visible to the naked eye into an explosion of colourful lights. Mr Powell, a graphic designer from Ventnor, Isle of Wight, used foregrounds of abandoned theme parks, harbours and lighthouses against the illuminated sky. ‘The perfect conditions to take these pictures are a clear sky on a moonless night,’ he said . 'Light pollution needs to be minimal too, unfortunately for the UK there are very few areas of dark sky, especially in England.' The 22-year-old, who shot the pictures over a year of stargazing on the island, often stayed up until dawn to catch the most dramatic skyscapes. Pictured is the Milky Way behind Castle Haven, a small harbour in Nilton . This stunning image shows the Orchard Bay steps in Isle of Wight.  Mr Powell, a graphic designer from Ventnor on the island used foregrounds of abandoned theme parks, harbours and lighthouses against the illuminated sky . A combination of 120 separate photographs over the space on an hour were used to capture the stars trail on 24 June 2014 (left).  On the right, the Milky Way is pictured above an abandoned roundabout from Blackgang Chine Amusement Park . A panoramic image shows the reflection of the Milky Way in the glass-like water of Flowers Brook. Minor adjustments were made to bring out the contrast and whites in this collection of images . The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars. Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created. Based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, astronomers believe the centre of the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole. Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral. It formed into its current size and shape by ‘eating’ other galaxies. In one image the Milky Way can be seen above Steephill Cove in incredible hues of pink, orange, blue, green and purple. A separate picture captures the stars trail on 24 June 2014 in the Isle of Wight using a combination of 120 separate photographs over the space on an hour. Mr Powell also captured images of the moon shining bright behind St Catherine's Oratory, a 14th century lighthouse. A separate image shows a luminous moon behind Steephill Cove. Other highlights include the galactic core of the Milky Way occupied by two small wooden boats, while a panoramic image shows the reflection of the Milky Way in the glass-like water of Flowers Brook. The majority of Mr Powell’s photographs are single exposures taken in a Raw image format. This captures more detail than a JPEG format which is altered in Lightroom - an editing program - by bringing out the contrast and whites in the image. Mr Powell added: 'Today’s DSLR cameras can gather much more light and capture a lot more detail than our eyes can. 'The Milky Way is still visible to the naked eye in dark sky areas, it just appears as a faint white strip in the sky, which is still an incredible sight to see. 'Before I picked up a camera I never thought it would be possible to take pictures like this without travelling to low light areas such as New Zealand or Africa. 'It’s an incredible feeling being able to share my photographs with people, and make them more aware of what can be seen in low light polluted areas here in Britain.' The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A security expert has warned Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data. He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a file-relay service . that can be used to access the user's address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the . device. However, Apple has denied the claims the backdoor was created deliberately for government or surveillance purposes. A security expert has claimed that Apple's iOS operating system has potentially sinister tools that could be used for government surveillance. Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data . His investigation followed earlier reports . of the NSA spying on Apple products, which suggested a ‘backdoor’ in . iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. A backdoor is a hidden remote access port that can allow outside sources to access a device with little detection. According to a report by Iain Thomson in The Register, iOS devices have data discovery tools that are separate from those used by Apple. The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk. Apple and its CEO Tim Cook (right) have previously . strenuously denied any collusion with the NSA in a backdoor spying . program aimed at users of iPhones (pictured left). The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk . A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device (stock image pictured) that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection . Mr Zdziarski added there is a file dubbed ‘com.apple.pcapd’ on the device that fires up without notifying the iOS device's owner. What is a 'backdoor'? A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection. Should you be worried if you use an Apple device? Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit. So far there has been no evidence that they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack . How would could the government potentially make use of these backdoors? Backdoors can provide access to unencrypted information even if users have chosen to encrypt the data they back up. Data can include the user's address book, stored photos, the voicemail database and any accounts configured on the device. What are the main concerns? Mr Zdziarski focused on three particular services known by the technical names com.apple.pcapd, com.apple.mobile.file_relay and com.apple.mobile.house_arrest. How do these hidden files work? The pcapd service starts a 'packet sniffer' on an iOS device which records all data traffic to and from your iPhone. It's installed by default on all iOS devices and gives the user no warning when it's activated. The file_relay service exists to sweep up large volumes of raw data from particular sources on an iPhone, and then release it in unencrypted form. These include the address book, accounts, GPS logs, photos, notes, calendar files, call history, voicemail and other records. The third service, house_arrest, originally allowed iTunes to copy documents to third-party apps. Now, as reported in ReadWrite, house_arrest has access to wider app-related data, including photos, databases, screenshots and temporary 'cached' information. More information about Apple's diagnostic capabilities is available from the firm's support pages. He explained this can record network traffic and HTTP request/response data from the device and could be targeted via Wi-Fi. ‘This software isn't some legacy code left on the device by Apple engineers for testing - it has been actively updated and expanded in various iOS revisions,’ The Register claimed. Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit, and so far there has been no evidence they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack . Apple responded by saying the services identified by Mr Zdziarski are not deliberately provided for government agencies to exploit. The company added they are for 'diagnostic' purposes, and to allow IT workers to manage their company’s devices. More information about Apple's diagnostic capabilities is available from the firm's support pages. ‘The problem with this is that these services dish out data (and bypass backup encryption) regardless of whether or not 'Send Diagnostic Data to Apple' is turned on or off, and whether or not the device is managed by an enterprise policy of any kind,’ Mr Zdziarski said on his blog. ‘Every single device has these features enabled and there’s no way to turn them off, nor are users prompted for consent to send this kind of personal data off the device.’ In January, Apple strenuously denied it played any role in the National Security Agency's alleged efforts to hack the iPhone. Documents published in Germany's Der Spiegel revealed the NSA actively worked on software that enabled it to remotely access iPhones and their text messages, photographs, contacts, location, voice mail and even their video. The report included an NSA graphic dated 2008 that outlined a system in development called DROPOUTJEEP, described as a 'software implant' that allows infiltrators to push and pull and retrieve data from iPhones such as contact lists. Der Spiegel referred to it as a 'trojan,' or malware that helps hackers get into protected systems. The report did not suggest Apple had cooperated with the U.S. spying agency on so-called backdoors. The Cupertino-based, company said at the time that it had never worked with the NSA to deliberately weaken its products, promising that it would 'defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who's behind them.' The investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA (headquarters pictured) spying on Apple products, which suggested a 'backdoor' in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information.

"By . Daniel Piotrowski . An extraordinarily unlucky little boy has finally had a stroke of fortune. Dexter Heffernan, 3, from the NSW South Coast town of Kiama Downs, was born with cerebral palsy on Friday the 13th, the legendary day of misfortune. It has been a real struggle for little Dexter and his parents, mum Lenice and dad Andrew. The infant has spent eighteen months - nearly half of his life - in hospital. He can't sit, stand, walk or crawl without help. He can only see on some days because of a vision impairment. And he has even battled liver cancer.

But the family are about to get a massive helping hand after a blog post calling for help went viral at the weekend. The post, written by Mrs Heffernan's sister, Carol Laverty, explained how the family needed to renovate their single-level three bedroom brick home to make it disability-friendly for their little fighter. Their home needs to be modified, for instance, so it is wheelchair accessible, and so Dexter can independently access the bathroom from his bedroom. Mrs Heffernan, 34, thought the post was a 'crazy' idea and never expected the outpouring of support the family have received. They have been deluged with pledges of support to fix up their home at 'mate's rates'. 'It's so overwhelming and amazing,' Mrs Heffernan told the Daily Mail Australia. 'I kind of put it down to a bit of a crazy idea that my sister had... I let her run with it and I said 'OK' and then it's all happened.' Dexter is pictured with his father Andrew, sister Charlotte and mother Lenice . His mother described him as a 'very cheeky boy'. 'But he's also very serious. He tries so hard,' she said . The family are about to get a massive helping hand after a blog post calling for help went viral at the weekend . In the blog post, Ms Laverty said the young family were very deserving of help from the community. 'If we could cut a few costs of Lenice and Andrew on their house renovations, we would be giving them a huge helping hand. 'Even while penny-pinching for Dexter, Lenice and Andrew are quick to support others, and other charities. They do so quietly. They do so, because they know who hard it is.' 'These two people are 'givers', and it is not easy for them to be seen as 'that family that needs help'. 'But they are family and they do need help'.

When the blog was placed on social media it received more than 32 Facebook shares, a retweet from The Block Fans V Faves winners Chantelle Ford and Steve O'Donnell and several offers of support, including roofing, bathroom, tiling and glass work assistance. It comes as a relief for the couple, who hold down jobs and are paying off a big mortgage, all while constantly taking Dexter to therapy and medical sessions, caring for his little sister, 19-month-old Charlotte, and preparing for the imminent birth of another little girl. 'He is a very, very cheeky boy, always has been,' Mrs Heffernan told Daily Mail Australia. 'But he's also very serious. He tries so hard.' 'There's something about him - people meet him and they tend to just fall in love with him.' She and her husband never thought too much about the unlucky symbolism of Dexter being born on Friday the 13th. If anything, she thinks it was a very lucky day. 'Dexter probably shouldn't have survived the first couple of weeks of his life. He certainly shouldn't have survived other things - surgeries and what not. But he's still here.

"By . Candace Sutton . Stacey Broll still relives the terrifying moment when Jodhi Meares' 2.5 tonne Range Rover became airborne and hurtled towards her and boyfriend Josh Grossman as they took a quiet Saturday night drive to get ice cream. Ms Broll claims if she hadn't made a split second decision to swerve into the next lane  which happened to be empty, the couple, both aged 21, might be dead or injured and Meares, 43, would have either ended up in hospital or lost her life. Ms Broll is still angry about the accident and is demanding an apology from Meares, who has yet to speak to her in the month since. Ms Meares will face Waverley Local Court on August 5 charged with charged with high range drink driving and with driving while her licence was suspended in relation to the Saturday night smash. The fashion designer, who was once married to billionaire James Packer, and is now engaged to rock star, Jon Stevens, was allegedly almost four times over the legal blood alcohol limit when she was driving the car. Scroll down for video . Physiotherapy student Stacey Broll, 21, was behind the wheel of her silver Rav4 four wheel drive (pictured) in traffic on the night of June 21 in Sydney's eastern Suburbs  when designer Jodhi Meares careened around the corner in her $200,000 Range Rover Sport, smashing into five cars. The 2.5 tonne vehicle then became airborne and hurtled towards Ms Broll and boyfriend Josh Grossman. She managed to swerve her car into the next lane which was thankfully empty, but believes she, Mr Grossman and Jodhi Meares might all have been dead if the vehicles had collided. She thinks Meares is 'selfish' for driving after allegedly drinking almost four times the legal limit and should apologise . Josh Grossman took this photograph (left) of Jodhi Meares' upended Range Rover Sport following the crash in which the allegedly drunk fashion designer's car smashed into five cars, lost a wheel (pictured, left centre) and became airborne, sailing towards the vehicle in which Mr Grossman and his girlfriend Stacey Broll were sitting. Ms Broll said Meares (pictured, right, at a 2011 fashion launch) was curled up in a foetal position between the air bags of her Range Rover Sport and was jittery and 'out of it' Stacey Broll, 21, says Jodhi Meares should say sorry to her and boyfriend Josh Grossman for nearly crashing into them, and to the owners of the five cars she smashed and the people who helped her out of her $200,000 Range Rover Sport after it flipped on its side on the night of June 21 in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs . Neighbour Craig Russell took this photo of Jodhi Meares' Range Rover Sport lying on its side with the designer still in the front seat after hearing a 'massive bang' and running to the window of his apartment above O'Sullivan Road, Rose Bay in Sydney's east. Some of the cars Ms Meares' vehicle smashed into she careened around the corner at high speed can be seen in the photograph . 'Jodhi should apologise to all of us who were there, the people whose cars she smashed into, the people who helped her out of the car, the neighbours who ran out to help. 'I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't swerved . Her car is a monster. It could have crushed mine. 'It landed half way in the lane which I'd been in before I swerved. We were just so lucky there wasn't another car in the left lane. 'I guess I remember it now like it was in slow motion, but it all happened so fast. Stacey Broll (pictured, with the car she was driving when Jodhi Meares almost smashed into it) says she is relieved she managed to pull out of the way of Meares' 'monster' Range Rover, but she still relives the moment and says an 'irresponsible and selfish' Meares should get on Facebook or Twitter and apologise to her and others at the scene . Rock star Jon Stevens (pictured, left) was not in the car when Jodhi Meares (right, at a 2012 fashion function) crashed her Range Rover but afterwards, Stacey Broll says, she heard Meares insisting to police 'I've got to call my husband'. When she did make the call, Ms Broll now presumes to fiance Stevens, the couple seemed to argue. Then police placed her under arrest and took her off to a police station where she allegedly blew 0.181, almost four times over the legal limit . Emergency crews attend the scene of the June 21 crash by fashion designer Jodhi Meares on O'Sullivan Road, Rose Bay in which her vehicle smashed into five cars, became airborne and landed on its side. Ms Meares will face court in early August charged with high range drink driving and driving while her licence was suspended . Jodhi Meares, 43, (pictured modelling her own clothing range, Upside) will face Waverley Local Court on August 5 charged with high range drink driving and with driving while her licence was suspended . 'I was scared to look because I was certain she was dead, but then I saw her curled in a fetal position behind the steering wheel. 'She probably doesn't know who we are and she's rich, so maybe she'll be treated differently. 'But she was selfish to drive when she was so drunk and irresponsible. She's lucky nobody is dead.' On June 21 this year, Ms Broll, a physiotherapy student who works as a receptionist  at a gym, was visiting boyfriend Josh, a building certifier, from her home at St Ives, on Sydney's Upper North Shore. It was a Saturday night and Ms Broll had been at the gym and her boyfriend out fishing when she convinced him  to accompany her on a drive to an ice cream shop at nearby Bondi Beach after 9.30pm. Wreckage: smashed cars (left) and Jodhi Meares' upturned Range Rover Sport (right) pictured after the June 21 crash in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Physiotherapy student, Stacey Broll, who was driving with boyfriend Josh Grossman when Meares' car flipped and would have hit her vehicle, had Ms Broll not swerved out of the way, says Ms Meares owes her an apology . Ms Broll was behind the wheel of her silver RAV4, a small four wheel drive, and had turned into O'Sullivan Road in Rose Bay, in Sydney's eastern suburbs and were braking towards a red light when a black Range Rover Sport careened around the corner from New South Head Road at high speed and smashed into a parked car. 'It was like a domino effect,' Ms Broll said, 'after she hit the first car, five cars all smashed into each other and the impact sent her car into the air towards us. Jodhi Meares was 'jittery' as she smoked and waited while police surveyed the wreckage following the accident on the night of June 21, in which Ms Meares smashed into five vehicles and then flipped her own car on O'Sullivan Road, Rose Bay, in the eastern surburbs of Sydney, narrowly missing 21-year-old student Stacey Broll and her boyfriend Josh Grossman in their much smaller car . 'After I swerved out of the way, her car flipped onto its side. Josh and I got out and I said out loud, ""they're definitely dead"".' Ms Broll said her heart was thumping and she was in shock. She did not at first know who was behind the wheel of the $200,000 vehicle. Mr Grossman immediately called police. 'And then there were neighbours rushing out, people running out of the shops near the corner. 'A girl knew who works at Jimmy Brings came out. Her car was one of those that got smashed. She was really shocked, we all were. 'I saw her with her knees on her chest up behind an air bag. Her eyes were wide open. She looked frightened.' Ms Broll said  a group of men 'manoeuvred' Ms Meares away from the driver's side of the car, on which the vehicle was sitting and pulled her out. 'The first thing she did was get a cigarette. She was jittery and out of it and kept on saying, ""I need to call my husband"". Then the police came and they were trying to calm her down and kept on saying, ""sit down Jodhi"" or ""come here Jodhi"". She didn't seem to know what to do. ""I didn't know at that stage she was Jodhi Meares. I just thought she was an Eastern Suburbs soccer mum. 'The police told us she was drunk.' Ms Broll said she heard Ms Meares phone her 'husband' - who she now assumes was fiance, Jon Stevens - and proceeded to have an argument over the phone. 'It sounded like the other person at the end of the phone was angry,' she said. 'Jodhi was very tense.' Police asked Ms Broll to move her car and then to return to the scene so they could interview both she and Mr Grossman as witnesses. In the month since the crash, Ms Broll said she had thought often of what might have happened if she hadn't got out of the way of Ms Meares' car, and she had also thought about ther owners of the smashed cars. 'There are heaps of ramifications. There might be insurance, but people have lives and are busy and have to get on with things. 'She owns Tiger Lily. She's rich she's still friends with James Packer. Why doesn't she just issue an apology?""She could do it on Facebook or Twitter to all the people who were there, especially the owners of the cars she smashed into. 'She gave me a hell of a fright. She needs to show us some respect.' Ms Broll watched officers take Ms Meares off in a police car. At Waverley police station, police say Ms Meares recorded a 0.181 blood alcohol reading, almost four times the legal limit. She was charged with drink driving and driving while suspended. The maximum penalty for high-range drink driving is a $3300 fine and an 18-month jail sentence. Ms Meares is due to face Waverley Local Court on August 5. Phone calls to Ms Meares' fashion label's Sydney store went unanswered on Thursday.

"Up to 20 wedding guests were injured in train crash at Victoria Falls . By . Sebastian Shakespeare . and Candace Sutton . A member of Peter Holmes a Court's wedding party has described the moment their tourist tram was hit by a freight train in Zimbabwe, killing one guest and injuring 19 others. Holmes a Court, who was in Africa to marry his photographer fiancee Alissa Everett, was 'swollen in lots of places,' but not seriously injured in last week's horror accident. Ms Everett escaped unhurt. 'There were screams of terror, everything went flying,' a friend of the bride-to-be told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'The tram slid 200 to 300 yards, and people were thrown out.' The paper named the dead man as American William Poovey, 44. His wife Kara was treated for a broken jaw in South Africa and is due home in New York this week. Alissa Everett and Peter Holmes have now married quietly following the  train crash in Zimbabwe in which one of their wedding guests died . Peter Holmes a Court and Alissa Everett (pictured) had asked guests to donate gifts to build houses for women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of which will be named in honour of American Willl Poovey who died in the crash . As Mailonline reported on Monday, Mr Holmes a Court's best man Jason Gissing suffered a broken arm and leg in the horror accident. The groom's younger brother, Paul Holmes a Court was on board with two of his school-aged children, one of whom sustained a broken arm. 'Our tourist tram was hit by a freight train as it was approaching a sort of shunting yard,' Paul Holmes a Court told The Australian. 'I don't know why we were on the same line at the same time.' African media ran pictures of the freight train which crashed into the tourist tram carrying Peter Holmes a Court's wedding guests in Zimbabwe on Tuesday, July 1 . Wedding guests on the side of the Victoria Falls railway embankment in Zimbabwe last week in the aftermath of the train crash . The crash happened when a goods train ploughed into a National Railways of Zimbabwe tram that was carrying 30 tourists and 5 crew members at the Victoria Falls main station. 'Whilst the tram train was at the Victoria Falls main station, the train operator stopped intending to change the railway line and the tram train was hit from behind by a goods train which was coming from the same direction.' said Zimbabwe Republic Police national spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba, reported allafrica.com. A National Railways of Zimbabwe spokesman told Mailonline Holmes a Court was not on the train last Tuesday as it travelled to the stunning Victoria Falls, on the border with Zambia. Africa Tourism Authority director Ross Kennedy said the 'thoughts, condolences and prayers . . . of the entire Victoria Falls tourism community . . .  go out to all the families of passengers involved, and especially to the family and friends, of the one passenger who so tragically passed away'. Millionaire Jason Gissing, who was to be Holmes a Court's best man, was flown to South Africa after breaking his arm and a leg in the crash . He said the passengers on the tram were from the US, UK, the Netherlands and Australia. They were staying at the Victoria Falls Hotel at the time of the accident and sightseeing ahead of the wedding. Of the 20 injured, 18 were treated at the local hospital and two were flown to a hospital in Johannesberg where one of them died. The wedding planned in Maun, Botswana was cancelled. Mr Holmes a Court, 45, knows Mr Gissing from his Oxford University days, where he also met George Osborne, Britain's finance minister. His family has close ties with Zimbabwe - Mr Holmes a Court's father, the late entrepreneur Robert, grew up in the African country. 'It is the most appalling disaster,' an associate of Mr Gissing said. 'Jason broke an arm and a leg. It’s very traumatic, but at least he is alive. 'He is being cared for by Professor Ken Boffard, who is one of the best trauma surgeons in the world.' Mr Gissing was airlifted to Johannesburg, in neighbouring South Africa, for treatment. Two days after the crash, Peter Holmes a Court appears to have tweeted that he was looking for a lawyer in Zimbabwe. Alissa Everett is an award-winning American photographer who has covered conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Last year she photographed Peter Holmes a Court for a magazine article about his return to Zimbabwe to trace the history of his father, Robert, who died in 1990. For their wedding gifts, she and Peter Holmes a Court asked that guests give monetary donations to a charity Ms Everett founded for women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Prior to getting married in Zimbabwe, Holmes a Court intended to accompany Ms Everett on a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in 2012 she was 'violently ambushed'. 'I will be joining to carry her (heavy) camera bags, to write on her work, raise the profile of the projects and because I am not prepared to let my bride out of my sight,' he said in a post on their wedding gift registry site. On June 30, Mr Holmes a Court posted a message about the forthcoming wedding describing Ms Everett as an 'amazing woman'. Mr Holmes a Court's first wife, Divonne, and their four children live in Switzerland. Mr Holmes a Court became executive chairman of South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2006 in a joint takeover with Gladiator star Russell Crowe. After becoming CEO, he quit the post in 2008. He and Crowe currently own a 37.5 per cent share of the NRL club. His close friend Mr Gissing, 43, is the co-founder of UK-based online grocer Ocado.  He stepped down from the board earlier this year, cashing in $27 million worth of shares. Peter Holmes a Court (right, with Russell Crowe) is cancelled his wedding after the train crash in Zimbabwe, but has since quietly married Alissa Everett in Botswana . Mr Gissing is married to Norwegian former professional skier Katinka. They live in a $8 million house in London’s Bayswater with their four children. Zimbabwe’s railways are notoriously dangerous, with ageing despot Robert Mugabe having brought the country’s economy to its knees and unable to pay for improvements. The accident is the third involving National Railways of Zimbabwe in the space of a week. The National Railways of Zimbabwe spokesman declined to comment on whether legal action had been launched against it following the crash.

"By . Associated Press . A 90-year-old Ohio man has been sentenced to four years in prison for killing his wife of 65 years — but he could be released after serving six months. Robert Shaw from the Cleveland suburb of Avon was originally charged with aggravated murder for smothering his 84-year-old wife, Virginia, in November 2008. He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in June as part of a plea deal. Shaw is eligible for early . release after he serves six months in prison under the terms of the deal . he struck in June with prosecutors that saw him plead guilty to . involuntary manslaughter. Jailed: Robert Shaw, 90, who killed his wife in what has been described as a mercy killing, has been sentenced to four years in jail by Judge Mark Betleski court at Lorain County Justice Center . He . originally was charged with aggravated murder, murder and felonious . assault for smothering 84-year-old Virginia Shaw on Nov. 13, 2008. So-called 'mercy killings' are illegal under Ohio law. Shaw’s defense has long been . that the death of his wife was a mercy killing to end the suffering she . was enduring because of her many medical problems, which had caused her . to be in and out of the hospital in the months leading up to her death. At 7:20 a.m. Nov. 12, 2008, Shaw phoned a 911 operator to say he had just killed his wife. When . police arrived at Shaw’s home, he surrendered and was taken to a . hospital for weeks of evaluation and observation, according to earlier . news reports of the incident. On the 911 recording, Shaw can be heard saying 'I just killed my wife' because he wanted 'to put her out of her misery.' When the 911 operator asks how he killed her, Shaw replied, 'I suffocated her.' 'How, with a pillow or a blanket?' the dispatcher asked. 'Yes,' Shaw said. Shaw’s voice faltered as he explained what happened. 'She had been in and out of the hospital and came home a couple of months ago, and ... uh ... I can’t talk ...' Helping hand: Mr Shaw's lawyer (left) said, 'He lived a law-abiding life his entire life. Our hope is that he¿ll be released promptly.' Police arrivedthrough an unlocked door to find Shaw sitting at a table. He told officers that they could find his wife in the bedroom. Lorain County Coroner Dr. Paul Matus . performed an autopsy on 84-year-old Virginia Shaw and said she appeared . to die by asphyxiation. The couple had been married for 65 years, Lieux said. Shaw's daughter thanked prosecutors and the Lorain County judge during a hearing Monday for how they treated their father. 'My sister and I would just like to thank . you, your honor, Dennis Will and the (Lorain County) prosecutor’s . office for your kind understanding of our father’s situation,' said . Carol Patsko, the Shaws’ daughter. 'We truly appreciate everyone’s . effort on his behalf and ours.' Speaking from the bench, Betleski . said an early release is not guaranteed but he generally accepts joint . recommendations of the prosecution and defense attorneys in criminal . cases. 'It was clear upon review of the . pre-sentence investigation report this was a situation that Mr. Shaw did . not feel voluntarily involved with, but felt the circumstances with . regard to his wife’s health necessitated his actions, albeit illegal, . are certainly a consideration that has to be appreciated by the court,' Betleski said. Shaw's daughter thanked prosecutors and the Lorain County judge during a hearing Monday for how they treated their father . Shaw's attorney had said his client killed his sick wife to end her suffering caused by medical problems. Shaw, clad in matching gray shirt and pants and black shoes, made no statement to Judge Mark Betleski. The attorney said Monday his client accepts responsibilities for his actions and is at peace with the sentence. 'It’s definitely been difficult for the family on both sides,' said defense attorney Kenneth Lieux. 'Their daughters both lost their mother and their father is going to prison for a period of time.' 'He lived a law-abiding life his entire life,' Lieux said about Shaw. 'Our hope is that he’ll be released promptly.' The situation was difficult for Shaw’s family, who had supported him since he called police to the home he shared with his high school sweetheart. Shaw isn’t in the best health himself and had been free on bond while the case against him has been pending. The Army veteran fought at the Battle of the Bulge in Europe and was retired from a job in truck manufacturing.","Robert Shaw, 85 at the time, killed his wife Virginia, 84, in 2008 .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . PC Saheena Tegally, 35, is accused of swapping numbers and sending a Porsche 911 driver flirty texts after pulling him over on the road . A policewoman is accused of telling colleagues to let an uninsured Porsche driver off the hook after sending him a flirtatious message reading: ‘It’s really hot – I’m in my bikini.’ Saheena Tegally, 26, was on patrol with two other officers when she stopped Richard Myerson in his 911 turbo and asked for his insurance papers, a court heard yesterday. She then allegedly swapped numbers with him and later began sending  ‘inappropriate’ texts and emails. Tegally is then said to have told a colleague to ‘rip up’ his notes on the incident after the driver asked her out on a date. The officer was seen ‘laughing and flirting’ with Mr Myerson before giving him her mobile number and asking him to return to the police station at 11am the next day to present his insurance documents, London’s Wood Green Crown Court heard. The following day, she allegedly told colleagues that he was in fact insured. She is said to have shown them  part of an email chain to support  this – but left out the bit explaining  that his insurance had expired two months earlier. David Markham, prosecuting, said Tegally ‘seemed to be flirting’ during her first encounter with the driver in Highgate, North London, in July last year. ‘PC Tegally offered her personal mobile phone number to Mr Myerson,’ he added. Soon, the pair began messaging each other, the court heard. Tegally was asked in an email by Mr Myerson: ‘Is it hot in London?’ She responded: ‘It’s really hot. I’m in my bikini catching the sun.’ PC Glenn Smith, who was with her when they first pulled over the driver, told the court: ‘She was laughing and joking, over- friendly for someone we had just met and were investigating.’ Another colleague, PC Mike Cole,  said he noticed she was receiving  ‘quite a few’ texts while on duty the next day. He added: ‘I asked who they were from. She replied “Richard the Porsche man. He asked me out on a date.” I asked if she was going and  she replied “no”.’ Tegally later showed her colleagues documents that appeared to indicate Myerson was insured, the court heard. 'Just rip it up': Tegally allegedly tried to get the driver off the hook for being uninsured . PC Saheena Tegally appeared at Wood Green Crown Court accused of perverting the course of justice in relation to insurance documents of a Porsche driver . When . PC Smith wanted details of  his insurance to file a report, Tegally . allegedly told him: ‘Why are you doing the book?

"By . Harriet Arkell . A pregnant would-be glamour model who had a breast enlargement on the NHS has said she would consider giving up smoking - as long as the State paid for it. Josie Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, is expecting her third child in two months, but continues to smoke 20 cigarettes a day. Yesterday she told how she enjoys taxpayer-funded taxis on the school run, costing £6,000 a year, because she claimed she is so hated after having a free £4,800 breast operation that she cannot use public transport. Today the single mother, who is pregnant after working as an escort girl, said she had cut down from 40 cigarettes a day to 20, but would need help from her GP to cut the habit completely. Scroll down for video . Living off the state: Josie Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, says she will give up smoking, but it'll cost us . Unrepentant: Miss Cunningham taunted those angry about her use of public money via Twitter . She told The Sun: 'It's not illegal for me to smoke while pregnant' and boasted of halving her £18 a day habit. Miss Cunningham, who would not comment further on her smoking comments today, added: 'I'm hoping my doctor will be able to help get me off the fags.  But the public will probably whinge about funding that as well.' Yesterday she fuelled the fire of public outrage by posting a provocative tweet saying: 'Sticks and stone may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.' Anti-smoking advice, counselling, drugs and patches are all available on the NHS, but at a cost to the taxpayer. News that Miss Cunningham had had a breast augmentation, funded by the same NHS Trust that refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk provoked outrage across the country. Miss Cunningham later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing, and said the NHS should pay for a reduction. Then she tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash. Video courtesy of ITV Loose Women . Before and after: The former escort had a £4,800 breast operation on the NHS taking her from a 32A to a 36D . But when she became pregnant after working as a £1,000-a-night escort, she admitted she could not uphold her pledge – and now continues to soak up public funds. She has had £1,500 of Botox treatment for excessive sweating, and two months ago, she boasted she would be having £2,500 of free dental work now she is expecting.  And earlier this year, the publicity-hungry mother threatened to have an abortion after being invited to go on Big Brother. Yesterday Miss Cunningham told how she and her children, aged six and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The journey, which costs Leeds Council £30 a day,  would cost around £30 a week by bus, but Miss Cunningham insisted it was worth it, and said taxpayers should be grateful it was taxis rather than more expensive private hire cars. This year Leeds council is having to make savings of £50million from its budget. A spokesman said: 'We are not able to comment on individual cases. However, the council takes matters relating to attendance at school extremely seriously.' There are plenty of services offered free on the NHS for those needing help to give up cigarettes. GPs can provide patients with details of their local NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will offer help from trained advisers. They can draw up a stop smoking plan, and available treatments may include counselling, nicotine patches, gum, inhalers, microtabs, lozenges, and nasal and mouth sprays.  The majority of these medicines are called nicotine replacement therapies (NRT). Patients may also be offered two types of non-NRT medicines - Champix (varenicline) tablets or Zyban (buproprion) tablets. There is also a Stop Smoking helpline, which is free to call, and various group therapies for those who prefer to tackle their problem with others.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Robbers wielding sledgehammers have staged a smash-and-grab raid at one of the country’s best-known five-star hotels. A gang of six men pulled up on three mopeds outside the Dorchester Hotel in wealthy Mayfair in central London at around 1.30am today. They smashed five glass display cases in the foyer, stealing watches and jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds, before speeding off through the city. In the wake of the heist, which police said was well-planned, the thieves managed to shake off pursuing officers just over a mile away in Shaftesbury Avenue. Raid: Six robbers on mopeds have stolen watches and jewellery worth thousands from the five-star Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair (above) after smashing display cabinets with sledgehammers in an early-hours heist . One of the bikes hit a 25-year-old woman in Cambridge Circus as the gang fled, leaving her with leg injuries that required hospital treatment. The glass presentation cabinets were in the main lobby, just beyond the reception and next to lifts to some of the hotel rooms. One of them contained Brequet and Hublot watches which are worth anything between £6,500 and £31,700 a piece. The gang also broke into one cabinet that contained jewellery by high-end American designer Harry Winston who has a flagship store on London's New Bond Street. Other jewellery in several untouched cabinets were pieces made by Faberge. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Detectives from the Flying Squad have launched an investigation following a smash and grab in the early hours of this morning at the Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane. 'Police on patrol in Westminster came across the robbery in progress at the hotel at around 1.37am. High-value targets: One of display cabinets smashed contained Harry Winston jewellery like this (file picture) 'Officers attempted to follow the mopeds but lost sight of them in the Shaftesbury Avenue area. 'A short while later officers came across a 25-year-old woman who had been hit by one of the mopeds in Cambridge Circus. 'The woman was taken to a south London hospital with leg injuries and has since been discharged. No arrests have been made. 'We will not be discussing the value of the items taken at this stage. It will form part of our investigation.' A guest, who declined to be named, said all traces of the raid had been swept out of view by the time he went for breakfast mid-morning. He said: 'They must have dealt with it pretty swiftly to keep us all happy, it's quite a shock. 'They've usually got some very expensive jewellery and watches just 20 metres in but that's all covered at the moment. 'There are a load of cabinets draped with sheeting, but it's discrete and unless you knew what was behind there you'd walk right past it without knowing. 'If the gang managed to get away with anything they'd be laughing, there are Brequet and Hublot watches in those cabinets - and they cost thousands.' Scene: The route the robbers took through central London before shaking off the police . The usual complement of luxury cars . were parked outside the entrance, including an orange McLaren, a black . Ferrari and a purple Bentley coupe glinting in the sun. The . hotel's security and risk manager, Andy Sloan, stood reassuringly at . the entrance, although those arriving would be hard-pressed to spot any . signs of the violent robbery as they walked into the cool atrium. Detective Constable Alex Flanagan . said: 'We are in the early stages of our investigation and I would like . to hear from anyone who was on Park Lane or nearby who may have seen the . robbery or the men making their escape. 'Likewise I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident that took place in Cambridge Circus. 'This . was a well planned and thought through robbery and there may be people . who know who is responsible and I am keen for those with any information . no matter how small to come forward and assist us with our . investigation.' A spokeswoman for the Dorchester said: 'We can confirm that there was an incident at the hotel last night in which showcases were damaged. The hotel security team were quick to respond and the matter is now in the hands of the police. 'As ever, the comfort and security of our guests and employees remains our top priority.' This follows a number of similar robberies that have taken place in London’s West End, where thieves have arrived on bikes and tried to smash their way in to jewellery stores. Masked raiders struck at the Dorchester in 2002 stealing £1million worth of jewellery in a similar robbery.","Six men smashed display cabinets in heist at five-star hotel at 1.30am .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Fancy a swim in a pool that has waves nine-stories high and currents four times faster than an Olympic swimmer? That’s what awaits you if you stumble into the state-of-the-art wave pool named FloWave at the University of Edinburgh. Of course it’s actually designed for engineers to test new technologies for wave turbines, rather than giving confident swimmers a run for their money. Scroll down for video . A new world-class large scale testing facility (shown) which simulates waves and currents for marine energy devices was officially opened at the University of Edinburgh's Kings Buildings recently, called the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility . Complex waves, fast currents and large water spikes marked the launch of the world-class testing facility for marine energy devices. The heart of FloWave is a 100-foot (30 metres) circular concrete basin containing the 82-foot (25 metres) diameter wave and current tank. The 16-foot (five metres) deep tank contains 2.4 million litres (530,000 gallons) of fresh water and is ringed by 168 absorbing wave makers. Additionally, 28 submerged flow-drive units can simultaneously and independently drive current across the tank in any relative direction, with maximum current velocities of 5.2 feet (1.6 metres) per second. A rising tank floor and overhead crane enable quick and easy installation of individual devices, or arrays of wave or tidal current generators. The pool is 82 feet (25 metres) across and 6.6 feet (two metres) deep. It recreates waves and currents from coastlines around the UK, Europe and beyond. Its full name is the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility and it can simulate scale version equivalents of waves up to 92 feet (28 metres) high with currents of up to 14 knots using 2.4 million litres (530,000 gallons) of water. The facility is designed for researchers and industrial partners to develop and refine full-scale devices such as wave and tidal energy converters. It can also be used to test floating offshore wind platforms and vessels to install and maintain offshore projects. By testing devices at scale in a tank, researchers can achieve milestones in days or weeks compared with months or years in open water. This accelerated development could bring clean energy products to market more quickly and cost-effectively, at lower risk. Animation credit to FloWave, Edinburgh Designs Ltd and Dunedin . Arts . The pool can simulate scale version equivalents of waves up to 92 feet (28 metres) high and currents of up to 14 knots using 2.4 million litres (530,000 gallons) of water in an 82-foot (25 metres) diameter circular pool. Here a crowd watches as the pool generates waves during a demonstration . The pool can be used to generate fast currents and high waves. Its currents can go as fast as an Olympic swimmer while its waves can reach up to nine stories high. This allows underwater wind turbines and other technologies to be tested more easily than they can be tested at sea . The £9.5 million ($16.3 million) FloWave facility was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the University of Edinburgh. ‘We are delighted to mark the official launch of this pioneering facility, which will speed the development of devices to harness wave and current power, and further enhance the University’s position as a centre of excellence in marine energy research,’ said Professor Sir Timothy O’ Shea, Principal of the University of Edinburgh. Professor Philip Nelson, Chief Executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, added: ‘EPSRC’s investment in the FloWave facility will help keep the UK at the forefront of marine energy technology research and development. ‘Research here can accelerate the deployment of these technologies which, in turn, will help us meet our low-carbon targets, create jobs and boost growth.’ The facility is designed for researchers and industrial partners to develop and refine full-scale devices such as wave and tidal energy converters. It can also be used to test floating offshore wind platforms and vessels to install and maintain offshore projects . One of the technologies that has been tested so far is AlbaTERN's model WaveNet device, which according to the Scottish company is 'a radical new array-based wave energy convertor that captures energy from ocean waves and converts it into sustainable low-carbon electricity'","New 'pool' at the University of Edinburgh is being used to test technologies .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Throughout evolution, living things have repeatedly developed physically distinct sexes, but how does this actually happen? That’s the question scientists were hoping to answer when they performed a genetic engineering trick on multicellular algae. And they were surprised to find the process through which one gender produces eggs and the other sperm was more simple than expected - and the scientists could switch the gender roles of the algae. Scientists in Missouri have revealed they could induce gender (stock image shown) in cells. They performed the trick by identifying and modifying a gene in multicellular algae. This gene was responsible for giving the algae one of two mating types, but they also made it switch gender . The study, led by Dr James Umen at the Danforth Plant Science Center in Missouri and published in Plos Biology, looked at the multicellular green algae Volvox carteri. A neuroscientist has claimed the expression 'Men are from Mars and women are from Venus' has no scientific grounding, and that instead our brains are changed by the roles society forces us to play. According to Gina Rippon, a professor at Aston University in Birmingham, stereotypes - such as women's supposed inability to read maps, or the idea men are bad at multitasking - have no links to science. Instead of being wired in different ways, Professor Rippon said that men and women are only dissimilar because the world we live in encourages gender role-playing. Speaking in March she said the differences between men and women are caused by the 'drip, drip, drip' of gender stereotypes.According to The Telegraph she said: 'You can't pick up a brain and say ""that's a girl's brain, or that's a boy's brain"" in the same way you can with the skeleton. They look the same.'There is pretty compelling evidence that any differences are tiny and are the result of environment not biology.' The researchers identified the master regulatory gene for sex determination in Volvox. They found that it differed from a related gene in a close relative that did not have physically distinguishable sexes. The findings may also provide a possible blueprint for how sexes in other multicellular organisms like plants and animals may have originated. For plants and animals having male and female reproductive cells - also known as gametes - is the norm. The differences between the two types of gametes in males and females are obvious. Male gametes are small mobile sperm or pollen, while female gametes are large egg cells. However, the evolutionary origins of male and female sexes are unclear because the distant relatives of plants, animals and other multicellular species generally don't have distinct sexes. Instead they have a system in which gametes of one mating type can only fuse with those with a different mating type. The researchers found they were able to identify a gene called MID that controlled two mating types labelled 'plus' and 'minus'. By forcing genetically female Volvox to express MID, the team was able to convert what would have been egg cells into packets of functional sperm cells. Conversely, by using a method of gene inactivation called RNA interference (RNAi), the scientists were able to block MID expression in genetic males causing them to develop with functional eggs in place of their sperm packets. The team was even able to use their gender-swapped strains to carry out successful matings between pairs of genetically male or genetically female Volvox. Here can be seen dishes containing various genders of the multicellular algae Volvox. Top left is a regular male, and top right a regular female. Bottom left is a male made to act as a female, and vice versa in the bottom right. The research could explain the origin of the sexes . The discovery of a master regulatory gene for sexes and mating types in this group of green algae shows that these two forms of reproduction share a common genetic origin. This also hints at a similar evolutionary scenario that may have taken place in the origin of sexes in animals, plants and other multicellular lineages. In addition to the evolutionary insights gained by Dr Umen's research team, there are also practical implications for algal biotechnology. 'Just as is the case for crop plants, breeding will be an important tool for making improved algal strains that can serve as biofuel feed stocks or other purposes,' Dr Umen, . 'However, sexual reproduction in most algal species is poorly understood. 'The identification of a conserved regulatory gene that controls sex and mating in the algae may lead to clues about how sex is controlled in other related groups of algae that are used for biotechnological applications.'","Scientists in Missouri have revealed they have induced gender in cells .

The coin, pictured, has been minted in fine silver and 250,000 will be issued. The Mint said the coin, which is only the second UK £20 coin it has ever made, has been struck to remember the bravery of those who answered the call to fight for king and country a century ago. Created in the art deco style prevalent at the time, the coin depicts the figure of Britannia watching over the first troops leaving for France then the war started in 1914. It bears the current portrait of the Queen on its obverse by Ian Rank-Broadley. A member of staff inspects the new £20 silver coin . Created in the art deco style prevalent at the time, the coin depicts the figure of Britannia watching over the first troops leaving for France then the war started in 1914 . The first UK £20 coin was released last year to celebrate the birth of Prince George. That coin, which featured a St George and the Dragon design, was also limited to a run of 250,000 and has sold out. Mr Bergdahl said: 'I decided to use the figure of Britannia in order to represent all of the allies who took part, most of whom were British or drawn from the British Empire. 'I combined inspiration from two sources: the South African medal for war services and the First World War memorial plaque awarded to those who died, using an art deco style which I felt best reflected the period.' Shane Bissett, the Royal Mint's director of commemorative coin and bullion and medals, said: 'The centenary of the outbreak of the First World War is an occasion of such significance, it was important to us that this coin should takes its place in the Royal Mint's programme of commemoration, remembering the bravery and sacrifice of those who answered the call to fight for king and country.' It will be available from the Royal Mint's website for its face value of £20. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The coin was designed by sculptor John Bergdahl .

"'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime' Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, August 3, 1914 . Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914. The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad. Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’. The initiative was inspired by then Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’ Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lights Out is a way for everyone to mark the First World War centenary and I would encourage people to take part and turn off their lights tomorrow at 10pm for an hour, apart from a single light or candle. ‘This will be a personal gesture in remembrance of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us 100 years ago. They must never be forgotten.’ The national commemorations will begin with a morning service of prayers, hymns and readings in Glasgow Cathedral linked to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. The event will be attended by Commonwealth leaders, Mr Cameron and Prince Charles. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a remembrance service in Liege, Belgium, before joining Prince Harry and Mr Cameron for a commemoration organised by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Mons, where the first and last British soldiers who died on the Western Front are buried. At 10pm, to coincide with the start of the ‘Lights Out’ initiative, a vigil service will be held at Westminster Abbey during which members of the congregation will extinguish candles until there is just one left alight on the tomb of the unknown soldier, which will be snuffed out by the Duchess of Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Poignant: Young drummers in Sandhurst, Berkshire, will lead a special service . During the day, there will be a number of Church of England services attended by other members of the Royal family including the Queen, who will be at Balmoral in Scotland, and Prince Philip, at Sandringham in Norfolk. Other special events will be held up and down the UK, including a commemorative service led by Sandhurst and District Corps of Drums in Berkshire. Labour’s spokesman on the First World War commemorations, Dan Jarvis, said: ‘With the busy lives we lead today, the simple act of pausing, switching off the lights and lighting a candle will be a very powerful tribute.’","People asked to turn out lights for hour between 10 and 11pm tomorrow .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They're not the first pair of police officers to be called into action while off-duty. But they’re almost certainly breaking new ground by making an arrest while dressed in zebra and monkey onesies. PC Tracy Griffin and PC Terri Cave were on their way to a fancy dress party when they encountered a man making threats to kill in a Coventry supermarket in March. Law of the jungle: Terri Cave and Tracy Griffin were on their way to a fancy dress party in these wildlife onesies when they were suddenly called upon to tackle a man making threats to kill in a supermarket in Coventry . The pair wrestled the man to the ground outside the Co-op store and told staff to dial 999. The man was arrested and later charged with public order offences. The two officers, who are based in Solihull, West Midlands, spent the rest of their evening filing reports at the police station rather than heading to the party. On hearing the news of the arrest, their colleagues at the @SolihullPolice Twitter account tweeted: ‘Man threatening to kill people didn’t expect to be wrestled to the ground by our off-duty officer in a zebra onesie. We go that extra mile.’ PCs Cave and Griffen have now been commended for their actions, described as ‘brave in the extreme’ and ‘in accordance with the highest traditions of British policing’ at a ceremony this week. The offender, Brian Eustace, 49, was handed a community order and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work over the incident. At a ceremony in Edgbaston, Birmingham, they received a Chief Constable’s Commendation in front of family, friends and colleagues – this time dressed in their official uniform.

Two servings of tree nuts a day appears to lower and stabilise blood sugar levels in people with the disease, according to evidence collected from 12 clinical trials. Tree nuts cover most types including walnuts, cashews, hazelnuts and pecans, but exclude peanuts. Two servings of tree nuts a day appears to lower and stabilise blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes . A single serving was defined as 30 grams. Nut consumption improved two key markers of blood sugar, the results from analysing data on 450 trial participants showed. One, the HbA1c test, measures blood sugar levels over three months. The other, the fasting glucose test, assesses blood sugar after the patient has not eaten for eight hours. The best results were seen when nuts replaced refined carbohydrates rather than saturated fats. A single serving of tree nuts was defined as about a quarter of a cup, or 30 grams. Participants in the clinical trials were given 56 grams of nuts a day on average. Dr John Sievenpiper from St Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who led the study, said: ‘Tree nuts are another way people can maintain healthy blood sugar levels in the context of a healthy dietary pattern.’ While nuts are high in fat, it is of the healthier unsaturated variety. Although nuts can be high in calories, trial participants did not gain weight.","Two servings of tree nuts appears to lower and stabilise blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is reluctant to pay a group of New York hedge funds nearly £900million, fearing other creditors will also demand money . Argentina was last night locked in last-ditch talks with investors as it battled to prevent a second default since the turn of the century. The Latin American country had until last night to pay lenders £320million in interest payments or default on its debts. But court orders required Buenos Aires to also pay a group of New York hedge funds nearly £900million at the same time – something the Argentinian government was reluctant to do. Economy minister Axel Kicillof was in talks last night in a bid to strike a deal with the so-called ‘holdout’ investors and stave off a second default in 13 years. The country was told to hand over £320million in interest payments to bondholders who agreed to take a 70 per cent cut on their holdings following the financial crisis that rocked the country in the early 2000s. But a New York judge has forbidden the transfer of the funds to take place unless Argentina also pays £900million to another group of ‘holdout’ creditors – a group of US hedge funds that are demanding repayment in full. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner fears that granting what she considers to be the ‘vultures’ their wish could trigger claims from the investors who had previously accepted losses to also demand full repayment. It is feared that a default would plunge Argentina deeper into recession, push up inflation and send the currency tumbling on the international markets. Last week, Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned that the economic cost to Argentina of defaulting again might be 'substantial'. 'I think that for Argentina, if it goes into default and doesn't pay the holdouts, there might be substantial costs in being basically unable to access markets for some time,' he said. But IMF managing director Christine Lagarde last night tried to play down fears that a default would send shockwaves through emerging markets worldwide. 'While default is always regrettable, we do not believe that it would have major substantive consequences outside, on a much broader basis,' she said. The Argentine government had until last night to repay investors £320million, but problems arose after a New York judge banned the payments from taking place unless hedge funds were paid £900million .","Cristina de Kirchner had until last night to repay £320million to creditors .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Some of the most familiar wading birds flocking to UK estuaries in winter have seen major declines in the past decade, conservationists have warned. The latest results from the Wetland Bird Survey have revealed that ringed plovers, redshanks, dunlin, curlew and oystercatchers, which are all among the eight most abundant winter wading bird species in the UK, have all seen populations drop significantly. Ringed plovers have suffered declines of 39 per cent in ten years, while redshank numbers fell by more than a quarter  and the situation for dunlin is almost as bad, with declines of 23 per cent. Conservationists have warned that populations of wading birds coming to Britain in winter have decreased rapidly in the last ten years, with redshanks (pictured) declining by more than a quarter . Curlew numbers have fallen 17 per cent and oystercatcher numbers are down 15 per cent in the ten years to June 2012, according to the Wetland Bird Survey, which involves data collected by thousands of volunteers. The most abundant waders found on UK estuaries in winter are dunlin, with an estimated 350,000 birds, oystercatcher, with around 320,000 individuals, and knot, with 320,000 birds. Knots have also seen numbers decline, by 7 per cent in ten years. But there is good news for species that were relatively scarce a few decades ago, with avocet numbers rising by 61 per cent in a decade and black-tailed godwits increasing by 57 per cent. Wildlife experts said the reasons for the declines of some of the most abundant wintering waders on UK estuaries were not fully understood, but it was likely to be due to a combination of factors. Waterbird counts from across north west Europe show that species are shifting north-eastwards in response to milder winters. Winter population declines in the UK may also be due to fewer young waders being successfully bred and reared in the Arctic, which is experiencing rapid warming. Curlew numbers have fallen 17 per cent in the last decade, as researchers say the decline is indicative of the state of Britain's environment . Richard Hearn, head of species monitoring at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, said: 'The declines in waders and other wintering waterbirds in the UK over the past decade or more, as revealed by the Wetland Bird Survey, are indicative of wider concerns about the state of our environment. 'They demonstrate the unprecedented period of change that these waterbirds are undergoing, and highlight the need for a step change in monitoring and relevant conservation action if we are to avert continued biodiversity loss.' Millions of waterbirds spend the winter on the UK's wetlands, particularly estuaries which provide a rich source of food and many of which are legally protected. Around 15 species of waders winter on UK estuaries in internationally important numbers, with at least one estuary supporting more than 1% of the international population. UK estuaries are also important to many wildfowl such as geese and swans, and other wader species which are present in smaller numbers during the winter or passing through in spring and autumn.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . and Will Stewart In Moscow . Hunter Biden, the younger of Vice President Joe Biden's two sons, is joining the board of directors of Ukraine's largest private natural gas producer, a firm controlled by a former natural resources minister to Viktor Yanukovych, the nation's recently toppled leader. Russian sources are lashing out at the news, with anti-globalization and anti-American commentators throwing rhetorical bombs in Washington's direction and saying the move smacks of American 'colonialism' in the ex-Soviet state. 'For the United States it is in principle quite traditional for the relatives of state leaders to be involved in private business in regions where the American state is rather active,' said Timofey Bordachev, director of the Higher School of Economics Centre for European Studies in Moscow. 'Historically, this practice was widespread in the Latin America region, which was linked to the United States by a semi-colonial relationship,' he told MailOnline. 'We can now see them trying to extend the same practice to Ukraine.' On Thursday the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti headlined an editorial: 'US Gets Hands on Ukrainian State Resources Through Hunter Biden's New Job.' The outlet claimed Washington had taken 'another step to grip Ukraine's state resources. The editorial featured an interview with far-left American commentator Stephen Lendman, who called the move 'one of numerous examples of America's dark side.' Awkward: Hunter Biden (R) is joining Ukraine's largest privately held gas company, and will serve a firm controlled by a former cabinet minister to the deposed president Viktor Yanukovych . Tension: Pro-Russian militants stand guard amid heightened tensions at a checkpoint in Donetsk, Ukraine -- near the eastern Dnieper-Donets Basin region where Burisma Holdings' largest gas reserves are located . 'Washington wages all its wars for . unchallenged dominance,' Lendman said. 'It wants state enterprises sold . to Western corporations at fire sale prices. It wants control over state . resources. Permanent war is official US policy and America's empire of . bases reflects its belligerency. Its agenda is self-destructive and can't be sustained.' 'It's . too late for mere scattered reforms,' he added. 'Unwilling to change, . America is plagued by the same dynamic that doomed past empires.' Eyebrows have been raised across Washington, D.C. since the Moscow Times first broke the news late Tuesday. When he visited Ukraine in April, the U.S. vice president was . supportive of pro-Western demonstrators who deposed the Russia-backed . Yanukovych in February. He stressed in Kiev that Ukraine must 'fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right now.' The country's May 25 election put a Western-backed president in power, but any resulting stability has been short-lived as it brought a backlash from supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the country's eastern regions. Ukraine now teeters on the edge of civil war as Putin has pressed his advantage and scooped up territory, and pro-Russian insurgency forces seek independence for eastern regions and . refuse to accept the election's legitimacy. The 44-year-old Biden . is joining Burisma Holdings at a time when the U.S. and western European . nations are making a concerted effort to help Ukraine assert its energy . independence from Moscow. But Andrey Suzdaltsev, deputy dean of the . Higher School of Economics Faculty of World Economics and Politics, . told MailOnline that 'it is clear that this has nothing to do with investment' in the company. 'Most . likely it has been done at the Ukrainian side's request,' he said. 'It is a kind . of image thing: Ukraine has just received the first tranche of a loan . from the IMF and it of course wants to demonstrate that people from the . American elite will now come into Ukrainian companies and they will be . followed by investment and new technology.' 'It is the kind of element of support in that does not cost the Americans anything,' Suzdaltsev explained. In addition to sabers, the Kremlin has rattled chains in recent weeks, emphasizing that Ukraine owes it billions and threatening to cut off gas supplies, largely as a response to the former Soviet republic's stepwise moves toward the European Union. The Cyprus-registered Burisma said that the younger Biden will head its legal unit and use his platform as chairman of World Food Program USA to seek international support for the company. 'I believe that my assistance in consulting the company on matters of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of Ukraine,' Hunter Biden said in a statement released on the company's website. Viktor Yanukovych (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) have been mutually supportive for years, leading the fallen Ukrainian leader to seek refuge in Moscow this year after pro-Western demonstrators forced him out of office . The company will likely see increased profits in the coming year as it sells to a domestic marketplace accustomed to seeing steep discounts on Russian-supplied gas. Now that Putin has taken an adversarial stance toward Kiev, those markdowns are gone – raising prices nationwide and opening up a path for Burisma to increase its margins. Burisma also announced to weeks ago . that Devon Archer, a college roommate of Secretary of State John Kerry's . stepson, who is heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune, had joined its board . to help attract U.S. investors. The company's new power brokers, according to speculation from Yahoo News, . might be its leverage against Russian intervention: Most of its . holdings are in eastern Ukraine's Dnieper-Donets Basin, a region that's . nearer to Russia than most of the country and a prime long-term target . for a future Putin advance. During his daily press briefing on . Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney punted questions to . the vice president's office. 'Hunter Biden and other members of the family are obviously private . citizens,' Carney offered, 'and where they work is not an endorsement by . the president or vice president.' State . Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki similarly brushed off a question about . whether there were concerns about the Biden appointment, saying, 'No, . there are not.' Kendra . Barkoff, a spokeswoman for Vice President Biden, said in a statement . that his son 'is a private citizen and a lawyer. The vice president does . not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this . company.' The Wall Street Journal reported . Wednesday that Burisma is controlled by Nikolai Zlochevsky, a former . member of Parliament in Viktor Yanukovych's 'Party of Regions' who first . served as minister of environmental protection, and then as minister of . ecology and natural resources – later losing that post and becoming . deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council . until the Yanukovych government collapsed. Grilled: White House press secretary Jay Carney insisted that Hunter Biden is a 'private citizen,' and his new job doesn't constitute 'an endorsement by the president or vice president' Hunter Biden, shown with mom Jill Biden, is chair of the World Food Program USA and a former senior vice president with MBNA Bank . Ukrainian press reports describe a pattern in which Zlochevsky used his positions to approve a large number of oil and gas drilling permits – a sort of financial insurance policy against the kind of regime change that came a few years later. Yanukovych fled Kiev after he was removed . from power and an arrest warrant was issued, accusing him of the . mass-murder of opposition protesters. President Barack Obama added him . to America's international sanctions list in March, blocking him from . entry into the U.S. and authorizing the freezing of his assets. Melanie Sloan, executive director of the left-leaning ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Reuters that the Biden appointment in Ukraine shouldn't be seen as a conflict of interest, regardless of how it dovetails with U.S. policy. 'It can't be that because your dad is the vice president, you can't do anything,' Sloan told Reuters. But Russian observers were less understanding. Boris Kagarlitskiy, director of the Institute of Globalisation and Social Movements in Moscow, called Hunter Biden's hiring part of 'the practice of so-called revolving doors that is widespread in America – when big companies and politicians lobbying for their interests establish links at the level of kinship relationships in one way or another.' 'This practice is now also being extended to Ukraine,' he told MailOnline. Professor Maksim Braterskiy of the Higher School of Economics and National Research University, said that 'at this kind of level business and politics are inseparable: Being the son of the U.S. vice president, it is much easier to talk to other serious businessmen and open the requisite doors. This always has been and always will be the case.' A Russian gas industry source added: 'The arrival of the son of U.S. Vice President to the Board of Directors of the company developing Ukrainian subsoil, shows the apparent interest American oligarchs to energy of Ukraine, which is directly related to U.S. foreign policy interests.'","Hunter Biden will sit on the board of Burisma Holdings, the largest privately-held natural gas firm in Ukraine .

"By . Rose Prince . We are hooked on perfection - and it is the Big Four supermarkets that tricked us into addiction. My blood boiled this week when Tesco executive Matt Simister claimed fussy shoppers were forcing food suppliers to throw away millions of tons of blemished fruit and veg. That is sheer hypocrisy and highly manipulative. If the public are not buying less-than-perfect produce, it is because we have been trained for decades to reject it. Generations of shoppers have been hoodwinked into believing food can not taste right unless it is an ideal shape and colour. Fussy eaters: shoppers have been hoodwinked into believing food can not taste right unless it is an ideal shape and colour . If anything, the opposite is true: by forcing fruit and veg to match a fantasy image, growers are breeding all the flavour and aroma out of the produce, often leaving us with good-looking pap that tastes of nothing. It is driven by the cult of supermarkets. Where once we had a mass of small retailers, with busy green-grocers on every High Street in the land, now we have four supermassive conglomerates - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Between them, they account for more than 80 per cent of the fruit and veg sold in Britain. The problem has been growing since the Sixties, and now it is out of control: all they care about is their profit margin and the dividend they pay to shareholders. Whatever their adverts tell you, do not believe for even a minute that the superstores care about us. To them, the public are simply the people who make them rich. And the casualties are colossal. They create waste at every stage, and we all pay for that: it is madness to throw away up to three-quarters of the food this country produces. Yet that is what is happening: farmers dump half their food because it does not meet the arbitrary standards of supermarket buyers, and then consumers chuck away half of what they buy - because it does not last as long or taste as good as they'd expected. Some of the wastage beggars belief. During last summer's cherry glut, I visited an orchard where the pickers were boxing up tonnes of the fruit but setting aside all those that had been deemed to be the wrong shade of red. Still taste good: But would you buy these misshapen carrots? You might think a cherry is a cherry, but no; if the colour does not match the supermarket's stipulated hue, they will be rejected. At best, the unwanted fruit will go to food processors to be made into jam or pie fillings, or be sold at wholesale markets where standards are not so exacting. Sadly, most of the fruit will be dumped: it might be delicious but it is useless. A farmer in Lancashire who grows cauliflowers told me this year that a burst of sunshine at the wrong time can be disastrous for his crop. In the warm weather, the white hearts of his caulis  turn slightly yellow, and that is all it takes for his vegetables to fail the supermarket  buyer’s test. He will have to plough the whole crop back into the ground - good for nothing but fertiliser. If that sounds crazy, you will not believe  the problems forced on  egg producers. Any egg that is slightly too large has to be rejected. You would think they could be marketed as 'extra value eggs' - get more for your money! One producer told me that for several weeks each year, his hens lay eggs that are a darker shade of brown than usual. Until the colour goes back to normal, he has to shut up shop: the supermarkets do not want them. Search for perfection: Food is being wasted as a result . I refuse to believe there is a single shopper anywhere in Britain who has strong views about how brown an eggshell should be. Part of the problem is that the supermarket buyers are far from being experts. They are novices, constantly rotated between different departments. This year's apple buyer might have been in charge of loo roll procurement last year. That means they have no specialist knowledge, no close relationship with the farmers, and no passion for any particular product. What they do have is a quarterly target. They know exactly how much produce their department will have  to shift if they are to keep their jobs. To give themselves the best possible chance of hitting their targets, they will be ruthless about buying only the produce that customers are proven to buy: the fruit and veg that looks perfect. The French and the Italians think we are insane. When they go shopping, they pick up their fruit and inhale the aroma. They do everything but bite into it - they want to know it is going to taste as good as possible. British supermarkets hate us to touch the fruit. We might scratch it or bruise it. That is why so much on the fresh counter is wrapped in plastic. The packaging projects a subliminal message: smell does not matter, flavour does not matter ... looks are everything. To intensify the message, we are bombarded with 'food porn', pictures of glistening fruit and veg that is unnaturally perfect. Looks are everything: This carrot wouldn't make it on to many supermarket shelves . Instead of tempting us to try delicious flavours, we are being taught to desire food that looks like it is made  of wax. The advertising teams know it is easier to persuade us to desire shiny gleaming things than to educate us about real food. People do not naturally go for knobbly fruit and veg, especially when it carries negative labels like 'misshapen'. Every now and then the supermarkets go through the motions of stocking imperfect produce. They label it 'wonky' or 'ugly', words to inspire us to shop out of pity . . . and when we do not buy it, they blame us. If we protest, they blame Europe. There have certainly been plenty of mad diktats from the EU about how fruit should look, but most were scrapped in 2009. If they wanted to, the Big Four could have us queuing up to buy misshapen produce. They have talked us into buying chickens bulked up with water and steak pies bolstered with horse meat - how hard can it be for them to sell an undersized mango? For example, they could offer packs of winter vegetables with a recipe for soup on the wrapper. All carrots look alike once they are chopped and in the saucepan. Or they could sell bags of discoloured, but succulent, strawberries with the slogan 'Ideal for jam!' That way, we'd all win. Farmers would sell more, less food would be wasted, and prices would come down. But some serious re-education is needed. It could take five years for a new generation to be taught that food tastes better if it does not look  like plastic. However, the supermarkets display almost no interest in education - and there is another problem. It takes oceans of pesticide, fungicide and fertiliser to grow unblemished fruit. Every insect that might dare nibble a leaf or bore a hole has to be sprayed out of existence. The irony is that a lettuce that has been chomped by a caterpillar cannot do you any harm - but the damage to the countryside from pesticide sprays is widespread. These chemical products make billions for manufacturers, and the chemical giants that develop and market them are powerful. They have a vested interest in making sure Britain does not get the urge to go organic and start eating wonky carrots and knobbly apples. For them, the bottom line is money. But for the shoppers, it is much worse: the bottom line is that we are being tricked into eating flavourless, chemical-sodden fruit and vegetables . . . and paying extra for the privilege.","Generations of shoppers have been hoodwinked .
