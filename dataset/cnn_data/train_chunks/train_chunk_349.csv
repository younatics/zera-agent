"(CNN)--He doesn't know how old he is, but he thinks he's 7. His name is Khin Zaw Lin. He's lived in a garbage dump virtually his entire life. Khin Zaw Lin lives in a Thai garbage dump with only his adopted mother and his toy gun to  protect him. I find Lin walking in a festering landscape of rotting food, plastic bags and junk at the Mae Sot garbage dump in Thailand near the Thai-Myanmar border. His parents are long gone. His home is a makeshift shelter made from salvaged bags, cloth and wood. Lin is one of about 300 refugees in the dump who survive on other people's trash. Many are children. Some are women with babies. Their daily routine follows the same pattern: They mill about the dump, waiting for the next truck to arrive, hoping for enough discarded food to get them through the day. Lin pokes through the rubbish with a machete. He says he collects bottles and plastic for three cents a sack. He shows me his feet, which were filthy and ribbed with cuts. He tells me through an interpreter that he can't afford shoes. He walks barefoot through the treacherous landscape. My assistant told me about Lin's home while he was researching another story on the border area in Myanmar, the country once known as Burma. I found it hard to believe at first, but I was curious. I persuaded my camera crew to make the six-hour drive from Bangkok. When we arrive at the dump, people are afraid of us. We'd been told there are orphans living at the dump, but people are wary. They think we are there to take away the orphans or ask for bribes. I tell them I want to help, and I am eventually directed to Lin. He greets me with a soft, hoarse voice. But he's all energy and purpose when he resumes plucking bottles from the mountain of trash. A recycling firm offers the closest thing to steady employment for Lin and his family. It buys what bottles and plastics Lin and others salvage. Lin gives the money to his adopted mother. She tells me that Lin's biological mother gave him to her in Myanmar when he was a baby because she couldn't cope with the responsibility. Life under the military junta in Myanmar can be brutal. The country's economy is collapsing, and torture and rape under the country's military regime is commonplace. Lin's new mother decided to flee to Thailand in search of a better life. She found a garbage dump instead. Still, she says scavenging for food in the dump is actually an improvement on her previous life. As I listen to Lin's story, a question keeps going through my mind: How can a 7-year-old spend his entire childhood in this squalor?  Watch as Lin and others root through the dump » . Perhaps it's because Lin is invisible -- he doesn't have a passport or papers. He is part of special group of refugees from Myanmar that don't officially exist. The United Nations established refugee camps in Thailand for those who flee Myanmar, but the camps are reserved only for victims of political persecution. Refugees fear if they enter a refugee camp, they'll be classified as migrant workers and deported. As a result, these refugees are trapped in the garbage dump -- not enough money to go elsewhere and no prospects back home. I thought I had become accustomed to the grinding poverty I had encountered in parts of Asia. I've met my fair share of children who are denied the luxury of hope. But Lin's story angers me. I feel close to losing all objectivity. Near the end of my meeting with Lin, I ask his adopted mother if she, and Lin, would ever escape the rubbish dump. Her answer is as hard as the world she and Lin inhabit. ""Never."" E-mail to a friend .","Orphan boy eats discarded food to survive .

"(CNN) -- A Marine combat veteran killed by Texas authorities after a deadly shooting spree there has also been linked to the death of his wife in North Carolina, authorities said Tuesday. Lance Cpl. Esteban J. Smith, 23, died Sunday in a shootout with Texas authorities after going on a two-hour rampage that left one person dead and five wounded, according to investigators. Smith's wife, Rubi Estenania Smith, 21, was discovered dead Sunday afternoon at a motel near Camp Lejeune, according to police in Jacksonville, North Carolina. While it was not immediately clear when Rubi Smith died, investigators say her husband began his Texas shooting spree around 4:30 a.m. Sunday. They say he killed Alicia Torres, 41, in Eola, Texas, and also shot two people in Eden, Texas, two people in Brady, Texas, and Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane, just north of Eden. Smith died in a firefight with state troopers and a game warden who arrived shortly after that incident. Two victims, including Doane, remained hospitalized Monday with non-life-threatening injuries. Three other people were treated at a hospital and released. Authorities found an assault rifle, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in Smith's pickup. North Carolina police said they found Smith's wife dead in a motel room on Sunday afternoon after agents with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service working on the Texas incident found evidence on his body and contacted them for help. Police didn't describe the evidence. It appeared Rubi Smith had been stabbed, police said. Esteban Smith, of Bakersfield, California, was a Marine rifleman who served two tours in Afghanistan with the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, the Marine Corps said Tuesday. He first deployed to Afghanistan from August 2010 to May 2011, according to Marine Corps spokeswoman Capt. Maureen T. Krebs. He returned to Afghanistan with his unit in April 2012 and remained there until November, according to Krebs. His service records included a number of routine awards for personnel assigned to combat tours, including the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and a Combat Action Ribbon, among others.

"(CNN) -- Running back Mark Ingram was awarded the Heisman Trophy on Saturday night, becoming the first player from the University of Alabama ever to be named the best in college football. Ingram delivered a tearful thank you after the announcement was made in New York and said he was ""so excited"" to bring Alabama its first Heisman. The 2009 voting was the closest in the award's 75-year history, according to the Heisman Trophy Web site, with Stanford running back Toby Gerhart finishing only 28 points behind Ingram in the balloting. The other finalists were Texas quarterback Colt McCoy, Nebraska defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh, and Florida quarterback Tim Tebow. Ingram, a sophomore from Flint, Michigan, was the top rusher in the Southeastern Conference, gaining 1,542 yards on 249 attempts. He also scored 15 touchdowns. Alabama has won outright or shared 10 national championships dating back to 1925, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Web site, but before Saturday no Crimson Tide player had ever won the sport's most prestigious individual award. Ingram and Texas' McCoy will meet again on the field on January 7, 2010, when their undefeated teams play in the Bowl Championship Series national title game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Read more at SI.com . Florida's Tebow, a three-time Heisman finalist, won the award in 2007 and was seeking to become only the second player to win the trophy twice, after Ohio State's Archie Griffin in 1974 and 1975. The Heisman's point total is reached by a system of three points for a first place vote, two for a second and one for a third, according to the award's Web site. Ballots were mailed to 870 members of the media, as well as 55 Heisman winners and one fan, according to the Web site.","Mark Ingram becomes the first University of Alabama player to win Heisman .

"(CNN) -- ""How do you write to a family that your own father hurt so much?"" Sebastian Marroquin, son of the infamous Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, posed this question in a letter to the families of two of his father's most prominent victims. Rodrigo Lara Bonilla was Colombia's justice minister in the early 1980s and one of the first to aggressively pursue cocaine traffickers. He was murdered in 1984. Six years later, Luis Carlos Galan was a presidential candidate who publicly decried the drug cartels. He was assassinated during a campaign rally in 1989. Escobar ordered both hits, according to authorities. One thing the drug lord and the public servants had in common is that they had children of roughly the same age. Now grown, their children have embarked on a reconciliation effort that was impossible for their parents, thanks in part to a new documentary by Argentine filmmaker Nicolas Entel. Entel's film, ""Sins of My Father,"" chronicles the path toward peace taken by the young men. Marroquin was breaking a silence of 16 years by being in the film. Marroquin, current Colombian Sen. Juan Manuel Galan, Bogota Councilman Carlos Fernando Galan and Sen. Rodrigo Lara spoke collectively to CNN en Español about how they were brought together. The younger Galans and Lara followed their slain fathers' footsteps into politics. Marroquin, who was born Juan Pablo Escobar, ran away from the path his father chose, changing his name once he and his mother left Colombia, after Pablo Escobar was killed in a rooftop shootout with authorities in 1993. ""I learned many things from my father,"" Marroquin says in the documentary. ""The most important one was that if I want to live, I have to do the opposite of what he did. That was my lesson."" Until now, he has lived his life largely under the radar. It took Marroquin a lot of reflection and a lot of time to write the letter because he was fearful of offending the victims' families. ""It was a letter that really moved us,"" Juan Manuel Galan said. ""We felt it was truly sincere, frank and transparent, and that this was a person who was honestly saying how he felt."" Lara, who was 8 years old when his father was assassinated, said he originally sought revenge for his father's death. He still seeks justice for his father's murder, but he has made peace with Escobar's son. Marroquin asked for forgiveness for his father's acts, for crimes that Marroquin did not commit, Lara said. True reconciliation comes from justice being served, Lara said. By cooperating in the film, his message to Colombians is about the ""need to break the country's cycle of violence,"" Lara said. ""To forgive, one must remember, the other choice is to forget,"" Lara said. Putting himself in the spotlight could pose risks because of Escobar's violent legacy, Marroquin said, but he hopes showing the reconciliation to the Colombian public on the big screen will have a positive effect. ""Nothing is more important than peace,"" Marroquin said. ""I think it is worth it to really risk our lives and everything we have so that peace really happens in Colombia someday.""","Pablo Escobar's son Sebastian Marroquin seeks reconciliation in documentary .

"(CNN) -- Florida law kept George Zimmerman from being held accountable in last year's shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, the teen's mom said Friday.

He fatally shot Martin in the Sanford, Florida, neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense. The case became a flashpoint in debates over racial profiling, and thousands attended vigils across the country over the weekend, decrying the verdict. Zimmerman juror to ABC: He 'got away with murder' Fulton asked attendees of the National Urban League gathering Friday to use her ""broken heart"" to ensure ""there are no more Trayvon Martins again.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson feared his father so much he would faint or vomit sometimes when his father entered the room -- even when the pop singer was an adult, according to a book written by a former Jackson confidant. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, Michael Jackson's confidant, sat down with the King of Pop and taped 30 hours of interviews. ""The Michael Jackson Tapes"" includes Jackson talking about his fear of growing old, his relationship with children, his friendships with Madonna and Brooke Shields, and his remarkable shyness around people that made his surround himself with mannequins. Jackson opened up to Rabbi Shmuley Boteach for 30 hours of interviews, which were taped nine years ago and intended for a book Jackson wanted written, Boteach said. ""He was trying to reclaim his life,"" Boteach said Friday in an NBC ""Today Show"" interview. Jackson, who died on June 25 of what the coroner found to be a deadly combination of drugs, ""lost the will to live, I think he was just going through the motions of life toward the end,"" Boteach told NBC. CNN has not independently confirmed Jackson's quotes in the book, but Boteach was known to be a spiritual adviser to Jackson for several years beginning about 1999. Ken Sunshine, spokesman for the family, including the singer's father, Joe, issued a statement on the book. ""We are not going to dignify this with a comment,"" he said. The book was not published during Jackson's lifetime because of the pop star's child molestation trial, which ended with an acquittal in 2005, the author said. The author said Jackson's arrest ended any interest in a book about him. ""I don't want to grow old,"" Jackson is quoted as saying in one interview with Boteach. ""When the body breaks down and you start to wrinkle, I think it's so bad,"" Jackson said. Jackson talked to Boteach about why he was drawn to children, especially those who were sick. ""I love them. I love them,"" he said. Helping children enjoy their childhood is his mission, Jackson said. ""I feel that this is something really, really in my heart that I am supposed to do, and I feel so loved by giving my love, and I know that's what they need,"" he said. Jackson said that while adults ""appreciate me artistically as a singer and a songwriter and a dancer and a performer,"" children ""just want to have some fun and to give love and have love and they just want to be loved and held."" Boteach, in an interview about two years before Jackson's November 2003 arrest, asked Jackson about the young cancer patient who would later become his main accuser. ""He's special,"" Jackson said. Boteach asked Jackson whether by speaking to people like the boy ""part of the pain goes away for them."" ""Absolutely,"" Jackson said. ""Because every time I talk to him he is in better spirits. When I spoke to him last night he said, 'I need you. When are you coming home?' I said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'I need you, Michael.' Then he calls me 'Dad.'"" Michael Jackson's taped statements about his father's treatment of him as a child echoed what he has said previously. ""He was rough, the way he would beat you, you know, was hard,"" Jackson said. ""He would make you strip nude first. He would oil you down. It would be a whole ritual. He would oil you down so when the flip of an ironing cord hit you, you know, and, it was just like me dying, and you had whips all over your face, your back, everywhere. And I always hear my mother like, 'No, Joe, you're gonna kill him. You're gonna kill him. No.' And I would just give up, like there was nothing I could do. And I hated him for it. Hated him."" Joe Jackson has denied physically abusing his son. ""Now, Michael was never beaten by me, I've never beaten at all,"" he told CNN's Larry King in July. He did suggest he used spankings for disciplining his children. Another Michael Jackson quote from the book alleged emotional abuse by Joe Jackson: . ""God bless my father because he did some wonderful things and he was brilliant, he was a genius, but one day he said, 'If you guys ever stop singing I will drop you like a hot potato.' It hurt me. You would think he would think, 'These kids have a heart and feelings.' Wouldn't he think that would hurt us? If I said something like that to Prince and Paris, that would hurt. You don't say something like that to children and I never forgot it. It affects my relationship with him today."" Jackson told Boteach he was still ""scared of my father to this day."" ""My father walked in the room -- and God knows I am telling the truth -- I have fainted in his presence many times. I have fainted once to be honest. I have thrown up in his presence because when he comes in the room and this aura comes and my stomach starts hurting and I know I am in trouble. He is so different now. Time and age has changed him and he sees his grandchildren and he wants to be a better father. It is almost like the ship has sailed its course, and it is so hard for me to accept this other guy that is not the guy I was raised with. I just wished he had learned that earlier."" In the excerpts provided to CNN by the book's publisher, there were no quotes from Jackson discussing his drug use, but Boteach does write about what he saw during the several years he was Jackson's spiritual adviser, starting in 1999. While Boteach said he never personally saw Jackson use drugs, he did suspect it. ""In the time that I knew him, he always seemed intent on me having a positive view of him and nothing untoward was ever done in my presence,"" he wrote. While their close relationship ended around the time of the molestation charges, Boteach said Jackson's parents reached out to him later for help in convincing him to enter drug rehab. ""Perhaps I could inspire Michael to make that decision, and his parents thought I could at least help,"" Boteach said. ""But I knew they were wrong. Michael had long since ceased taking my counsel. He found my advice too demanding. I was an irritant and was treated as such."" He said he told Joe and Katherine Jackson that ""it was imperative for them to save their son's life by becoming available parents in his greatest hour of need."" Sometimes those closest to Jackson were not people -- but mannequins, the book said. Jackson said he was so shy at times he surrounded himself with dummies. ""Because I felt I needed people, someone, and I didn't have,"" he said. ""I was too shy to be around real people."" Boteach, in the NBC interview Friday, said it made his skin crawl to hear that. ""His celebrity had created a degree of isolation where he could not simply feel comfortable around other people,"" Boteach said. ""He thought that everybody wanted something from him. He felt that he was trapped in this cocoon of fame and that there was some exploitative relationship with virtually everyone that he met."" The book does offer insight into Jackson's dating of celebrity women, including actress Brooke Shields. ""That was one of the loves of my life,"" Jackson said. ""I just wished she loved me as much as I loved her, you know."" He told Boteach one problem he had with women was their jealousy of his fame. ""They admire you and know you're wonderful and great, but just they're jealous because they wish they were in your place, with they were in your shoes. And 'M' is one of them -- Madonna. Hate to say that on tape."" CNN asked Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg for a response: . ""Madonna was very fond of Michael Jackson (as she clearly expressed in her tribute to him at the VMA's) and I doubt anything in the book will change her mind,"" Rosenberg said. CNN's Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.","Former confidant's book based on 30 hours of interviews with Michael Jackson .

"(CNN) -- We are not living up to the promise of the American Dream. Even now, our leaders are talking about cutting, instead of creating jobs to grow our way out of the deficit. Congress is ignoring big problems, congratulating itself on avoiding a fiscal cliff of its own creation. The federal budget props up broken parts of our economic system -- big banks, big polluters and big defense contractors -- instead of investing in areas such as education and infrastructure that would benefit everyone. Now, a new breed of companies is leveraging the power of networks and sharing -- and showing us what a more sustainable, prosperous future can look like. One of the most well-known examples is Zipcar. Its tagline, ""wheels when you want them,"" pretty much sums up the company. Zipcar was just bought by rental giant Avis Budget Group for nearly $500 million as part of Avis' push to compete with Hertz's and Enterprise's new car-sharing services. The demographics of car-sharing customers holds promise for future growth as younger, tech-savvy consumers tend to prefer sharing services. Then there is Mosaic, a new addition to the share economy. Mosaic just launched the first online clean energy investment marketplace. (Full disclosure: I am an uncompensated adviser to the company.) Here's how it works: Mosaic connects investors to solar projects in need of financing. The projects generate revenue by selling the electricity they generate, which allows the investors to get paid back with interest. Through the company, you can pick a solar project that you like, make an investment for as little as $25 and get returns starting at 4.5% annually. Of course, as with nearly any investment that isn't federally insured, there's a risk involved. Instead of earning close to nothing on your money at a bank, you can directly invest in things that offer solid returns and create real or lasting value. Together, consumers can start rebuilding the economy from the community up. Together, we can crowdsource investments in American infrastructure and create 21st-century energy jobs all by ourselves. The mega-banks that financed the fossil fuel era aren't well matched to the emerging clean energy economy, which is more decentralized. There are enough rooftops In Los Angeles alone to create 5 gigawatts of clean power. Instead of two mega coal plants, the energy could come from hundreds of thousands of people, all making money by selling energy from their roofs and contributing to a more sustainable and resilient energy grid. Warren Buffett's MidAmerican Energy made news last week with its investment of more than $2 billion in two solar power plants in California. But you know who has more money than even Buffett? All of us combined. All of us who are looking to invest responsibly and grow clean energy are a powerful force for change. In some cities, the demand for car-sharing services is so great that people are renting out their personal cars through services such as RelayRides and Getaround. San Francisco's Scoot aims to be the Zipcar of electric scooters. Services such as Airbnb and CouchSurfing allow people to rent their homes or rooms to strangers vetted by their peers. Through TaskRabbit and Fiverr, anyone can hire a personal assistant to run errands or complete more complex tasks such as accounting for your small business. These sharing services are proving that sharing isn't just for the do-gooders anymore -- it can make you real money. Airbnb hosts make an average of $6,000 per year for renting out their homes. People who loan cars through Relay Rides generally make enough to cover their monthly car payments. And a few people are making $5,000 per month just from completing tasks through TaskRabbit. A few months after the Move Your Money campaign launched in 2011, and on the heels of a controversy surrounding debit card fees, more than 650,000 people turned to opening credit union accounts. Today, environmentalists such as Bill McKibben and his 350.org are leading the charge for divesting from big polluters. The opportunity for people-driven, shareable, sustainable business doesn't stop with solar or transportation projects. We can invest in American businesses that power our country with all kinds of innovative technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, geothermal systems, hybrid and electric cars, and next-generation batteries. And we should put Americans to work making our homes and buildings energy-efficient. We need to avoid a lost generation of young people who will be playing economic catch-up their whole lives. We cannot stop pressing our leaders to help struggling poor and middle-class Americans. But we can never forget that together, we are a tremendous force for change. As we call on Washington to act, we can also call on each other to create jobs and spark the clean-energy economy of the future -- an economy that works for everyone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: A new breed of companies is leveraging the power of sharing .

"(CNN) -- Thanksgiving usually means family, food, football and, of course, the kickoff of the holiday shopping season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. With so much consumption going on, giving back can easily be overlooked. The 92nd Street Y in New York hopes to change that with its social media movement #GivingTuesday. #GivingTuesday is not a charity drive to benefit one cause but a call for many organizations and individuals to give to those less fortunate during this time of year, say its organizers. Retailers around the country will host donation drives in stores on Tuesday. Meanwhile, participants with an online presence are soliciting charitable contributions from their social media followers. ""We began thinking about this around the holidays last year, but work truly began in earnest in the spring,"" said Henry Timms, spokesman for the community center and the movement's mastermind. ""What's been so inspiring is how many organizations and individuals have taken up the charge for #GivingTuesday."" My Take: #GivingTuesday creates better Christmas narrative than Black Friday . The message is ""people don't have to be a billionaire or a big name to be a philanthropist."" Anyone can make a lasting impact when they donate and advocate for causes that matter to them, Timms said. As the hashtag suggests, social media is central to the #GivingTuesday effort. Relying on its social media connections, 92nd Street Y was able to reach millions of people and spread the word about the event. The U.N. Foundation, Microsoft, Goodwill, The Salvation Army and the American Red Cross have joined the effort. Altogether, there are more than 2,000 organizations participating in the #GivingTuesday event nationwide. People can donate to any charity they wish, and #GiveTuesday's charitable partners can use any method they wish to give back. For instance, Microsoft will launch a donor-matching campaign for GiveforYouth.org, a ""micro-giving"" site that strives to fund young people's ambitions. ""This new way of building communities and sharing with one another is the way that modern movements will take hold, and social media is the medium that can connect these communities, not only at greater speeds and across boundaries, but in authentic and lasting ways,"" said Kathy Calvin, CEO of the U.N. Foundation. ""We view social media as more than just the broadcaster for this conversation about giving; it's the connector."" Some groups have even taken a page from 92nd Street Y and created a social media plan to focus their contribution efforts. Shoemaker ALDO will host a donation-match Twitter campaign, inviting its community to tweet what they'll be doing on #GivingTuesday. Each tweet that mentions ALDO's Twitter handle and contains the phrase #GivingTuesday will be matched with a $5 donation to the American Red Cross. Sony will tap Pinterest, the online scrapbooking site, for a ""Pin It to Give It"" donation campaign. From #GivingTuesday until the end of the year, Sony will give a dollar for every Sony product re-pinned on the ""Pin It to Give It"" board, up to $25,000. The money will go to the Michael Phelps Foundation to benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs. It isn't just online that people can contribute to the #GivingTuesday event -- live events are also planned. A benefit auction for Superstorm Sandy victims is scheduled in San Francisco, and at every Simon shopping mall in the country, shoppers will be able to donate to charities. While some may say the Thanksgiving holiday has become too commercialized thanks to huge retails deals drawing consumers to shopping centers before most people have finished washing dishes, #GivingTuesday is not about competing with other events of the season. According to Timms, it's about starting the ""giving season"" and creating a specific day for people and businesses to give back. After reporting a record high of more than $314 billion in donations in 2007, charities saw a combined 13% decline in donations for the next two years, $299 billion in 2008 and $280 billion in 2009, according to Giving USA. ""Our revised estimates show that 2008 and 2009 saw the largest drops in giving in more than 40 years as a result of the Great Recession, exceeding previous recessions' impact on giving,"" Edith Falk, chair of Giving USA Foundation, said in a statement. In 2011, the total amount contributed to philanthropy saw an $8 billion increase from 2010. The Giving USA 2012 Report said that with the country coming out of recession, people are feeling better about their financial well-being, which has allowed them to start donating again. ""We believe that #GivingTuesday can not only inspire more donations, in terms of both donation dollars and volunteer hours, but can help change the dialogue about giving,"" Calvin said. ""This first year has shown us how much people are willing to contribute, even in tough economic times, to make a difference in the life of one person in their community or to groups of people around the world."" Even in tough economic times, people are still willing to give and spend. Holiday sales for this year are projected to reach $586 billion, which is a 4% increase over last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Timms said he thinks people will manage to satisfy their thirst for a great bargain as well give back to a charity. ""Black Friday and Cyber Monday are really important days for our economy, and we all enjoy the chance to get a deal,"" said Timms. ""After two days set aside for getting deals, it feels right to have a day dedicated for giving back."" The event, which organizers hope will become a mainstay during the holiday season, kicks off Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system is figuring prominently in the unfolding aerial conflict with Hamas' military wing in Gaza. Iron Dome is being credited with protecting Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities by blocking some of the rockets fired from Gaza. Over the past three days, 737 rockets from Gaza were fired upon Israel: 492 landed, but 245 were intercepted by the system, Israel Defense Forces said Saturday. Israel and Hamas: How the conflict reignited . What is it? The name Iron Dome evokes an image of a protective bubble over a city. In practice, Iron Dome is a defense against short-range rockets and mortar shells: the system targets incoming rockets and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them midair. Each battery has a firing-control radar to identify targets and a portable missile launcher. The system is easily transportable, with just a few hours needed to relocate and set up. The missile is highly maneuverable. It is three meters, or almost 10 feet, long; has a diameter of about six inches; and weighs 90 kilograms, or 198 pounds, according to the security analysis group IHS Jane's. The warhead is believed to carry 11 kilograms, or 24 pounds, of high explosives, IHS Jane's said. Its range is from 4 kilometers to 70 kilometers -- or 2.5 miles to 43 miles. What the violence means . What are the origins of Iron Dome? Israel began developing the ground-based system in 2007. After a series of test flights in 2008 and 2009, the first deployment of a battery occurred in southern Israel in 2011, according to IHS Jane's and the IDF. The Israel Air Force reported an interception success rate of 70% in 2011, IHS Jane's said. Israel credits ""breakthrough technology"" and the system's radar. Iron Dome confronts multiple threats simultaneously, in all weather conditions, the Israeli military said. ""The radar detects a rocket launch and passes information regarding its path to the control center, which calculates the predicted point of impact,"" the IDF said. ""If this location justifies an interception, a missile is fired to intercept the rocket. The payload of the interceptor missile explodes near the rocket, in a place that is not expected to cause injuries."" Each Iron Dome battery costs $50 million, IHS Jane's said. A missile costs at least $62,000, Israeli officials said. iReport: Photos from inside the protests in Israel . Is the United States involved in Iron Dome? Yes. The initial development was solely by Israel's defense technology company Rafael, but the system has since been heavily sponsored by the United States. In May 2010, the U.S. House approved a plan to allocate $205 million for Iron Dome. In July, President Barack Obama announced $70 million in U.S. funding. ""This is a program that has been critical in terms of providing security and safety for Israeli families,"" Obama said of the system. ""It is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile strikes inside of Israel."" Beginning of ground attack? How important is Iron Dome? Israel has deployed five Iron Dome batteries, but in March, a defense ministry official told CNN that Israel would need up to 13 batteries to cover all its borders. Israel plans to deploy a total of nine batteries by 2013, Israeli media reported. The system is considered a game changer, Israeli officials said earlier this year. ""Eliminating the ability to hit strategic targets may lead Hamas to rethink the efficiency of acquiring the rockets it has used in the past,"" former Israeli ambassador to the United States Dore Gold said in March. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that same month: ""The Iron Dome system has proven itself very well and we will, of course, see to its expansion in the months and years ahead."" Other countries have expressed interest buying the system, including the United States, South Korea and several NATO countries in Europe with military forces in Afghanistan, the Jerusalem Post reported in March.

"(CNN) -- A pair of buildings colloquially known as ""Marilyn Monroe"" has won the prize for best new skyscraper completed in 2012. The curvy, twisting buildings, officially known as Absolute World Towers, and located in Mississauga, Ontario, were designed by Beijing-based MAD architects and Toronto-based Burka Architects. ""The way the two structures twist organically by up to eight degrees per floor is not just a superb technical achievement, but also a refreshing change to the set forms of high-rise routine,"" said an international panel of expert judges when explaining their decision.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When Hong Kong announced the start of the world's largest ivory destruction project, one would expect a massive pyre, with flames engulfing the tusks. That did not happen. Instead, the tusk fragments were crushed into small chunks, placed in fiber drums and incinerated at a temperature over 1,800 degree Fahrenheit at a waste treatment center. The process may have been uninspiring, but it signals a significant move by one of the world's largest markets for smuggled ivory to curb wildlife trade. The ceremonial burning marked the first stage of the government's plans to destroy the 28-ton stockpile of ivory it has confiscated over the years. Ivory bracelets and carved figurines were incinerated along with elephant tusks. The fine dark grey ash left after incineration will be later dumped into a landfill. The government expects to finish destroying the entire stockpile by the middle of next year. Around one metric ton will be kept aside for educational or scientific purposes such as museum displays, according to Hong Kong government officials. Hong Kong follows recent initiatives by several countries, including France, Philippines and the U.S. to crackdown on ivory trade. In January, over six tons of illegal ivory was chipped and ground into powder in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The top business leaders in China have also pledged not to purchase or gift ivory. After experimenting with several methods, the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation department decided to incinerate the ivory to remove any risk of their re-entry into the black market. Burning doesn't completely destroy the ivory, it only chars the exterior. Hammering it into small pieces and burning it at high temperatures are to ensure total obliteration. Speaking at the event, John E. Scanlon, secretary-general of Geneva-based CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), an international wildlife protection treaty, said that the destruction ""does not negate the cultural heritage of historic ivory carvings, nor will in itself put an end to the illegal trade."" The effort is expected to gradually reduce the supply of ivory. In a bid to reduce its availability, three of the Hong Kong's largest ivory retailers announced earlier this month that they would no longer sell ivory products. But, conservationists say there is also a need to curb consumers' growing appetite for ivory. To reduce demand, many groups such as the World Wildlife Fund have been urging the government to legislate a permanent ban on ivory sales.","Hong Kong burned one ton of the 28-ton stockpile of ivory the government has seized in the last few years .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, will step down this summer after a year on the job due to health reasons, according to State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. A statement by Nuland said Crocker confirmed his plan to the Afghan government and the U.S.-led NATO military mission in the country. Crocker was named as the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan on July 25, 2011. A senior U.S. administration official told CNN that Crocker was leaving the job earlier than planned. ""He took it for two years, but the serious health problem he had in Iraq came back, so he is forced to leave a year early for genuinely serious health reasons,"" the official said on condition of not being identified. ""He is sticking it out for a full year, which takes him to"" a donors conference in Tokyo in July. Nuland's statement said Crocker would step down ""for health reasons in mid-summer, following the Kabul and Tokyo conferences."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney hailed Crocker for having done ""an extraordinary job in this current post, and he has been a key part of the implementation of the president's strategy in Afghanistan."" Carney said Crocker had come out of retirement at the request of President Barack Obama to take the ambassador's post and ""the president's enormously grateful for that."" Nuland's statement cited a series of achievements during Crocker's tenure culminated by NATO's approval Monday of a timetable for the U.S.-led military mission in Afghanistan to end combat operations next year and withdraw by the end of 2014. At the same time, NATO will launch a separate, new mission to train, advise and assist Afghan security forces starting in 2015. Nuland's statement quoted Crocker as saying: ""These achievements are the guarantee that as Afghanistan moves to a brighter future secured by its own capabilities, it does so ... in sovereign and equal partnership with the United States in particular and the international community generally."" No further details on Crocker's health problems or departure were immediately available. This is not Crocker's first stint in the Afghan capital. After the Taliban were forced out of power, he was given the task in 2002 of reopening the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, according to his State Department biography. Cameron Munter, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, is also due to leave his post this summer, as previously announced by the State Department. CNN's Elise Labott, Lindy Royce and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","State Department says Ryan Crocker is leaving due to health reasons .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- What has been described as the ""heaviest rain in six decades"" left at least 37 people dead and raised criticism about Beijing's infrastructure and the government's response to disasters. The torrential downpour lasted 10 hours over the weekend, producing gusty winds and a tornado in one suburb, according to local media. The deluge was the largest since 1951, when the state weather record was established, according to Beijing Morning Post, bringing about 6.7 inches of rain in some parts of Beijing, and as much as 18 inches in the suburban Fangshan district. Of the 37 deaths in Beijing, 25 people drowned, reported Xinhua. Another six were killed in collapsing houses, five were electrocuted, and one was hit by lightning, the agency reported, citing the municipal government. The flooding killed 95 people and 45 were reported missing in 17 provincial areas of China, Xinhua reported. Nearly 6.23 million people were affected by the heavy rains, which started July 20. The deaths from the storm triggered a torrent of criticism, even from a state-run newspaper, as well as Sina Weibo, the popular Chinese microblogging site. Some social media users implied the number of deaths was much higher. CNN contacted Beijing's flood control office, municipal government emergency office and municipal meteorological bureau to get an updated death toll. The agencies said that they were too busy summarizing data and couldn't make comments at the time. Questions CNN sent by fax to the state meteorological bureau were not returned by Monday afternoon. Although the weather had cleared in Beijing by Sunday morning, the flooding remained a hot topic, with many expressing outrage over the deaths and what they perceived as a botched government response. The Global Times published an article stating that the downpour ""exposes holes in the modernization drive."" ""In recent years, floods caused by rain storms have repeatedly occurred in Chinese cities. And the latest downpour in Beijing has stirred up a new round of skepticism on the quality of infrastructure amid rapid urbanization."" Many people marveled at how fragile the Beijing's infrastructure seemed for a modern metropolis. Despite the billions of dollars spent to upgrade its roads and buildings, the city's sewage system appeared quickly overwhelmed by the rainstorm. The Beijing-based media group, Caixin wrote on Weibo: ""Why is this happening once and again? Year after year Beijing faces the same challenge, not even hosting the Olympics can provide a solution. That's how vulnerable our capital city can be."" Another user, chuntiangushi wrote: ""We can host the most luxurious Olympics and send satellites into space but can never seem to fix this drainage system. What a shame."" Others disagreed. Weibo user VOo wrote: ""I think our city's drainage system is till much better then a decade ago. "" Others were critical that there was no emergency broadcast system deployed, no government shelters and no special hotlines. Chinese media reported that there were various color-coded weather warnings, but several public policy experts complained in Chinese media that the warnings made sense only to experts, not the general public. Local television broadcasts focused on heroic stories of search and rescue efforts and people helping each other. Traffic was snarled for hours in the aftermath of the storm, leaving drivers and pedestrians stranded throughout the city. Many pitched into help one other as the streets were flooded, sometimes as deep as new figure is about 20 feet (6 meters). Some on Weibo praised the way residents helped each other, calling it the ""Beijing spirit."" ""Beijing is a city with heart and soul. Love will pull us through the hardship,"" wrote user liushuhan. Thousands of emergency responders were deployed and divers had to be brought in to search for anyone trapped. Officials said almost 2 million people were affected by the rainstorm and the economic losses have exceeded $1.5 billion. The floods submerged some power supply facilities and led to blackouts in parts of the city, according to Xinhua. CNN's Steven Jiang, Tian Shao, CY Xu and Madison Park contributed to this report.","Chinese netizens are criticizing lack of prepardeness for the weekend flooding .

"(CNN) -- In this fast-paced, dog-eat-dog, ""I got mine"" country, happiness may seem like a luxury item: something extra, not integral, to the way we measure success. But how backward is this? Happiness is a foundational concept in life. The Founding Fathers considered ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" important enough to go to war over it. They recognized how the success of a new nation hinged on the happiness of its citizens. This is as true today, but the concept gets devalued: How can mere ""happiness"" be a serious concern? The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed Thursday, March 20, International Day of Happiness. The mission is to spark a universal goal of happiness and well-being for people from around the world. Some organizations, like the Happiness Institute, an Australia-based organization that provides services based on the science of happiness, is using it as a start date for a seven-day challenge aimed at boosting your level of happiness. For example, today's challenge focuses on creating a positive vision of your future. Pop culture is already on board with happiness. And happiness sells! From books, to movies, clothing and jewelry and even food, we yearning humans will lay down money for joy. Talk shows and commercials regularly engage our natural happiness craving. The song ""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams has been No. 1 on the iTunes charts for a month. The artist even created a 24-hour video of people who are singing and dancing to the song. Billboard has created a top 20 Happy songs of all time, which include the classics ""Happy Together"" by the Turtles and ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" from Bobby McFerrin. On social media you will find happiness organizations and groups, posts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumbler, and even happy pictures on Instagram. In fact, you can catch hash tags that show how much we warm up to the concept, like, #Happy, #LiveHappy, #HappyDay, #Happiness. You get my point. Happily, there is also some serious science behind all this emotion. For starters, happiness is not about ""stuff."" It appears that winning the lottery may not provide long-term satisfaction. One study found that a year after gaining that winning ticket, well, people often feel no happier and in some cases less happy. Strange, but true. And research shows that once your basic financial needs are met, the way to increase your level of overall happiness has more to do with creating experiences. Indeed, planning a vacation with friends and family will create memories that will serve your well-being better than spending money on lots of material items. Jeroen Nawijn conducted a study with 466 international tourists in the Netherlands. He found that people express greater happiness on vacation. Participants expressed wildly positive attitudes, like, ""having a great time traveling with friends"" and ""this is the best day of my life!"" Happiness is also about being ""present."" Jennifer Aakers, Melanie Rudd, and Cassie Mogilner, from Stanford University, conducted a study that identified five principles that link happiness to how one spends time. A key principle focuses on expanding your time. For example, when you are having lunch with a friend, focus on that moment. Slow down time by not thinking about future events -- such as picking up dry cleaning, grocery shopping or other errands. Instead, toss your phone, tune out the world and tune in to the person in front of you. Small things, but they can make a big difference; they can simply make you happier. No, happiness is not overrated. But so what if it were? If there is anything in life we should overdose on, it is this. Being in a joyful place will help you smile even when times are tough. So, go ahead, pour yourself a glass of happy, because your happy hour is now. Cheers. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- An ATM transaction, a grocery store receipt, a GPS device planted by a concerned car dealer and videos -- including one that showed a 22-year-old woman manhandled, knocked to the ground, then forced into a car just blocks from her Philadelphia home. All of it, among other tips and pieces of evidence, added up. And because of that, Carlesha Freeland-Gaither is thankfully back in Philadelphia where she belongs. The 22-year-old nursing assistant was released early Thursday from Maryland's Howard County General Hospital, having been reunited with her family after a harrowing three days. ""She's doing about as well as you can expect. Obviously, she's traumatized by the entire event over the past few days, so it's going to take a little time for that to heal. But she's doing well. She's back with her family and she's very, very happy about that,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""She had injuries, but nothing life threatening, fortunately,"" he said. The man who authorities say abducted her, 37-year-old Delvin Barnes, has a new home himself, at a detention center in Baltimore County, Maryland. According to a criminal complaint, Barnes admitted to the kidnapping. He also reportedly said he didn't know the victim before he took her. Appearing at a court hearing later Thursday from jail via video conference, Barnes waived his extradition to Virginia where he faces grave charges in another abduction case. That leaves Virginia authorities five days to pick him up. Maryland Judge Darryl G. Fletcher didn't set bail, due to the severity and number of charges in Virginia. It's not clear when Barnes will be arraigned in the Philadelphia case, though it seems unlikely he'll be free when that happens. But at least his alleged latest victim, Freeland-Gaither, is. Philadelphia police Commissioner Charles Ramsey says that's because of ""a lot of police work, a lot of tips from the public. But we were able to track it down."" Cinquetta Barfield, the victim's cousin, told CNN affiliate KYW on Thursday that Freeland-Gaither is ""in good health."" ""God was on our side. Everybody was praying for us and prayer works,"" she said. And the victim's mother, Keisha Gaither, couldn't be happier or more thankful. As she said Wednesday night to law enforcement, the media and the public, ""Thank you for keeping me up. Thank you for being there for us. I'm taking my baby home!"" Abducted Philadelphia woman found alive in Maryland . Taken after visiting godson . On Sunday, Freeland-Gaither went to the house of her mother's godson, her aunt Dayah Freeland said, and took a bus toward home. After she was dropped off in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox area around 9:40 p.m., the suspect's car passed her, turned up the street, then met her at an intersection, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told CNN sister network HLN. It was then that her abductor pounced. Surveillance video shows Freeland-Gaither being confronted by a man, then forcibly led away by him, tussling on the ground before being forced into a car. During the struggle, her glasses and cell phone fell to the road. Freeland-Gaither kept fighting -- even breaking out one of the passenger side windows -- but she couldn't stop the car from speeding away. Abductions are hardly unprecedented, but Ramsey said it is rare to see one captured on video. ""I've been on the job 46 years, (this is the) first time I've ever seen a kidnapping on videotape. (It) really was horrific to watch it unfold."" Police: Car dealer provided key tip . This wasn't the only video that police released. Another, from just after 6 a.m. Monday, shows a man in a dark hooded jacket using Freeland-Gaither's ATM card at a machine in Aberdeen, Maryland, which is about 75 miles from Philadelphia. And on Wednesday, police released an additional video of a man, also wearing dark clothing, making a purchase at a convenience store on Monday. Someone who sold a car to Barnes recognized him from one of the videos and alerted authorities. The dealer had placed a GPS device in the vehicle because of worries about Barnes' bad credit, according to Charles City County Sheriff's Office Capt. Jayson Crawley. ""From that, we were able to trace the car,"" Ramsey said. ""We were able to then contact Charles City (Virginia authorities), ... and things started really falling into place very quickly."" Such devices are put in cars to alert customers if they're behind on payments and, if they don't pay on time, allowing dealers to shut down the vehicle and track it down, said PassTime USA CEO Stan Schwartz, the head of the company that made the unit. In this case, Barnes knew it was there. PassTime has about 1.5 million such units out on the road, but has been only asked by law enforcement 10 to 15 times to track them as part of a criminal investigation, according to Schwartz. He said that the car dealer worked with authorities earlier this week, with the PassTime USA headquarters getting involved Thursday morning. In the Virginia case, Barnes is charged with abduction, forcible rape, malicious wounding with a chemical and other charges related to the early October disappearance of a 16-year-old girl, according to Crawley. That girl managed to escape after two days, walking 2 miles naked and burned into a business seeking help. Like the case involving Freeland-Gaither, authorities believe that case was a stranger abduction, meaning the victim didn't know who took her. ""We used to chill, hang out. He's a good guy,"" a friend of Barnes told CNN affiliate WTVR about the suspect. ""I don't believe it ... He is always looking to help somebody, always looking to bend over backwards. He'll give the shirt off his back if he could,"" Ronald Davis said. Suspect allegedly abducted, raped, burned girl . The travels of Barnes ended Wednesday night in Jessup, Maryland. ""We surveilled that vehicle in the area,"" FBI agent Ed Hanko said of the car Barnes is thought to have used in Freeland-Gaither's kidnapping. ""... When the subject exited the vehicle, that's when Ms. (Freeland-Gaither) was recovered."" CNN's Jean Casarez, Jeremy Harlan, Chelsea J. Carter, Lawrence Crook III, Ed Payne, Jason Hanna, Ray Sanchez, Dana Ford, Chuck Johnston and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, 22, is ""doing about as well as you can expect""

"(CNN) -- Airports aren't exactly stress-free zones -- not yet at least. But it's certainly something airport managers are working on. Still, all the spas, yoga studios and movie cinemas in the world can't detract from the main source of travel anxiety: grueling lines. It's an irksome feature that may soon become a relic, thanks to the advent of mobile tracking technology. Helsinki Airport recently became the first in the world to track passenger movements in real time, from the parking lot to departure gates. ""The whole idea is to get better analytics of passenger flow. Really, it's only because we want to know better where bottlenecks form in the airport during rush hour,"" says Jarno Putta, vice president and chief information officer at Finavia Corporation, which manages the airport. Passengers can meanwhile get updates about their flight status, bookmark where they parked (so they can find their car after their return flight) and chart how long it will take to get through security. Once inside, when they pass partnered shops, they can get pinged with offers. While receiving updates directly to one's phone may seem intrusive, Putta is adamant that the system doesn't collect any personal information. Rather, it uses iBeacons and Wi-Fi routers to collect unique identifier numbers (or MAC addresses), and only from devices with the Wi-Fi settings turned on. ""The MAC addresses we use are scrambled, which means no one can be traced,"" he says. EasyJet makes use of drone inspections . EasyJet is trialing similar technology at London Gatwick, Luton and Paris Charles de Gaulle airports, also using iBeacon. The carrier is starting small -- placing the devices at baggage drop offs and security areas. The EasyJet app also uses the technology to alert passengers to ready their documents at key points. Though still in its early stages, James Millett, EasyJet's head of digital, anticipates it could have father-reaching uses. ""In time, we could see applications supporting individual challenges, like when a customer needs to be in a different location because they are carrying skis, or aren't carrying any hold luggage,"" he says. The European low-cost carrier has been at the forefront of utilizing the newest technology. In May, it started trialing inspection by drone on its fleet of Airbus A319 and A320 planes. The airline is also looking into the use of virtual reality glasses to allow engineers and pilots to capture pictures of potential issues, and send them directly back to base. ""It's another good example of how we're applying new technologies to our business to help us be more effective and efficient,"" says Millett. Passengers need power to opt out . Not everyone is comfortable with the new technology. ""Who wouldn't be creeped out by the idea of having your phone tracked? If I tell you someone's tracking you, and don't tell you why, of course you'd be upset,"" says Jules Polonetsky, executive director and co-chair of the Washington-based think tank Future of Privacy Forum. He adds that, contrary to how it may seem, airport tracking is kept pretty general. ""It's not like it reports, 'hey, this phone belongs to the guy with blue glasses and a shabby suitcase.' It's '38,000 devices were in this location between these hours.' It's critical for airports and retailers to demystify this technology's uses for users."" Transparency is key, says Polonetsky, and airports need to make sure to alert passengers to the when, how and why of this technology, and provide them with an option to opt out -- which both EasyJet andÂ  Helsinki Airport do. Passengers who don't wish to be tracked can either switch off Wi-Fi on their devices, or provide their MAC address to walkbase.com and smart-places.org. (In doing so, the tracking systems knows to ignore the address in the future.) Mainly, though, he recognizes the many potential uses of this technology at the airport. ""An airport is the type of place where you probably do want to get pinged about gate changes, or find out where you can get a cup of coffee once you're checked in, or information on where the gate is and how much time it will take to get to it,"" he says. ""It's a big space, and anything the venue can do to help me navigate it easily and quickly is useful.""","Airports are using phone tracking to give passengers updates on flight status, airport retail deals, more .

"(CNN) -- Waking up Tuesday to the news that my good friend and former team mate Phil Hughes was in a critical state in hospital after a blow to the head in a state cricket match made me instantly realize how fragile life can be. This is a bloke who lives life to the full. When we lived together in London and I was knocking around the flat -- getting stressed about something or the other -- it would be his arm around my shoulder, saying ""You just got to enjoy it, bro"" accompanied by a trademark grin. Phil is the type of guy you'd expect to walk about with a surfboard under his arm, because he's always looking for the next wave. A strong, energetic person, he has transformed much of my thinking about the game -- and even my life. My relationship with him started when I agreed to be the overseas player for the Western Suburbs cricket team in Sydney. Phil was the new young gun in Aussie cricket who had burst onto the scene. We hit it off and I gained so much from this young guy who oozed such confidence. He seemed so fearless and full of life. He was carefree yet deeply focused and hungry; I loved being around all that energy. It made me feel alive and it certainly brought me out of my own introspection. It contrasted starkly with the way I had gone about my career to that time. We made an odd couple. Phil was a breath of fresh air and it was only a few months later that we were sharing an apartment in England while he ripped up county cricket during his first stint playing for Middlesex. I was in awe of this young kid -- five years my junior -- ""What a player!"" I thought. So when I woke up in Abu Dhabi to receive the news about his accident it sent a chill down my spine. I had spent the weekend watching Lewis Hamilton at the Formula One Grand Prix charging towards his second world championship. Frequently, during the weekend watching drivers careering around a track at incredible speeds, my elation at this high-octane sport was tinged with apprehension. My thoughts tracked back to the life of Ayrton Senna, arguably the most naturally gifted racing driver of all-time. Senna was brave, a three-time world champion, but at the same fearful. He was deeply ambitious and individual. Yet in a split second he was gone, losing his life after a crash at Imola in 1994. And then this happens to Phil -- left in a critical state. Cricket is essentially a team sport but the life of a top order batsmen can be isolated and lonely. The hours spent hitting thousands of balls trying to perfect your game can drive you mad. On many occasions, you strap on your pads and go out to train despite feeling well outside of your comfort zone. Pushing yourself to the limit, there is often more apprehension in training than there is in match play. Then there is the lonely bubble under your helmet. Just you and your thoughts. There is always the time to mull over your next move. Being a batsmen is lonely, it takes drive and a courage to face your emotions and your fears. You are frequently tested by the best fast bowlers in the toughest circumstances. But it isn't often you face someone and are truly scared. I have faced 95 mph balls from a bowling machine off 18 yards in an indoor hall, with the lights turned off, and felt horrendous. It has become a regular occurrence in my life. This year, playing for Somerset against Warwickshire, I got a nasty crack to the head. I've always prided myself on the way I play short pitch stuff but that day the angle of delivery, coupled with some foggy processing, did for me. I copped one flush on the side of my helmet. I recall, clearly, being shocked at how dazed I felt and I remember thinking ""I could be in trouble."" I put my hands on my knees, and just waited for things to go dark around me. Fortunately they didn't and, after lying on my back for a couple of minutes and taking on some refreshment, I was able to carry on. So seeing Phil fall flat on his face like that was spine chilling. Phil's accident was a complete freak. For a ball to miss everything and cause such harm to the head is desperately bad luck. Granted, there has been a litany of incidents in recent times where the ball has found a way through the grill of the helmet bruising cheeks and noses, cutting the skin or removing teeth. But for a ball to almost find its way through, under the helmet, behind the ear, and to cause that sort of damage is unheard of. Phil mistimed his shot, was through it too late -- it happens to all of us -- and then got himself into a bit of a tangle. Ninety nine times out of 100, he would simply have been shaken and down on his haunches for a few seconds, before dusting himself off and carrying on. Maybe even hit the next short ball for six. This injury has left everyone in the cricketing world stunned. Our thoughts are with Phil and his family. I feel desperate thinking of everyone -- the love and adoration for him is overwhelming to see. Right now I am thinking of him, that surfboard under his arm, taking on ""Ours"" -- the notorious surfing break located in the Kurnell National Park, New South Wales. And if anyone can ride this wave, it is Phil Hughes.","England cricketer and friend of Phil Hughes gives insight to life as top batsmen .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Gabon have arrested five people for dealing in illegal animal parts, which included the heads of a gorilla and 12 chimpanzees, according to Conservation Justice, a wildlife preservation group. ""This is the first time 13 ape heads were confiscated,"" Luc Mathot, the president of Conservation Justice, said Friday. Along with the heads, two hands from gorillas and 30 from chimps were seized. In addition, 12 leopard skins, a partial lion skin, snake skins and 5 elephant tails were confiscated. Mathot said he was present when the animal parts were laid out at the Forces of Order station in Libreville on January 14, the day after the raid. The five suspects -- a woman from Benin and four men from Nigeria -- were arrested on January 13 in Gabon's capital, Libreville, and have been charged with wildlife crimes for dealing in illegal animal parts, according to Mathot. They could face up to 6 months in jail if convicted, according to Mathot. Other African nations like Cameroon and Congo have stiffer penalties for trafficking -- up to five years. Their next hearing is January 25. Authorities in Gabon worked with the AALF -- an organization developed by Conservation Justice to fight against the trafficking of protected wildlife in Central Africa -- in the operation. ""WWF commends the Water and Forest Ministry and AALF for this important arrest,"" David Greer, a great ape manager for the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement Wednesday. ""However, the massive collection of protected species confiscated in this operation is highly disturbing."" ""Putting these dealers behind bars probably has a direct impact on the lives of hundreds of chimps and gorillas,"" Mathot said.","Authorities confiscated parts from gorillas, chimps, leopards and more .

"(CNN) -- British police investigating the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann will begin digging this week in an area of wasteland close to where she went missing in Portugal, sources close to the investigation have told CNN. Media have gathered outside a cordoned-off area of the beach resort town of Praia da Luz, in Portugal's Algarve region, but it is unclear when digging will begin. Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment on May 3, 2007. Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. CNN understands that London's Metropolitan Police will be in charge of the new digging operation in abandoned terrain close to where Madeleine disappeared. A large investigation team is expected to use dogs and radar in the search and dig a number of holes, sources said. Portuguese police searched the area soon after Madeleine's disappearance, and it is understood they will intervene only if a body is found. Sources told CNN that British police were working on the assumption that Madeleine was dead, while their Portuguese counterparts were working on the assumption that she was still alive and had been taken out of Portugal by a non-Portuguese national who had been in the country for a short time. Scotland Yard -- as London's Metropolitan Police are known -- has not commented on the latest development, other than to confirm that British officers would be in Praia da Luz this week. On May 22, its head of specialist crime and operations, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, told media there would be ""specific police activity"" in Portugal in the coming weeks, relating to Madeleine's disappearance. ""It should not be assumed that this substantial upcoming phase of work in Portugal will immediately lead us to the answers that will explain what has happened,"" he warned. ""What you will see is normal police activity you would expect in any such major investigation."" Rowley said the senior investigator in the case, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, and his team would be traveling to Portugal but would not be commenting on the investigation. He reiterated that Portuguese police had advised Metropolitan Police that they did not brief media on current investigations. ""They clearly stated that if the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) provide any briefings or information on the work they are undertaking on our behalf, or if reporters cause any disruption to their work in Portugal, activity will cease until that problem dissipates,"" Rowley said. ""We have made it clear to colleagues in Portugal that we will not be giving operational updates,"" he said. ""If media interfere with police work, that work will stop."" In July 2013, Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance after a two-year review of the original probe. Portuguese police reopened their investigation last October. At the time, the Metropolitan Police said the two police forces' investigations would run in parallel. Madeleine's parents -- Kate and Gerry McCann -- launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter after she went missing and say they continue to believe she is still alive.","Madeleine disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal in 2007 .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The latest ISIS advance in Syria has brought a swath of the country's north-central Kurdish region under siege, with Kurdish leaders warning of another humanitarian crisis without international intervention. The Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani (Ayn al-Arab in Arabic) is an island, surrounded by ISIS on three fronts and the Turkish border to the north. The town was already mostly blockaded by ISIS, but in the past three days some 60 nearby villages fell under ISIS control, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ""Islamic State,"" as the group calls itself, took 39 villages on Friday alone as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions, the Observatory said. Clashes are constant around Kobani as Kurdish fighters attempt to hold off ISIS, which is armed with heavy artillery and tanks, Kurdish activist Mostafa Baly told CNN. ""Mobilization of people in Kobani is not enough,"" said Redur Xelil, a spokesman for the Kurdish fighters. ""The international community has to take action. If not, there will be a new (Sinjar) genocide, but this time in Kobani."" Sinjar is the Iraqi city that came under ISIS attack last month, causing thousands to flee onto adjacent Mount Sinjar, where refugees became stranded and were starving before U.S. airstrikes helped pave a way for them to flee. The fighting around Kobani has been intense for four days, Xelil told CNN. Masoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdish Region in Iraq, called the ISIS attacks in northern Syria ""barbaric"" and described them as ethnic cleansing. ""I ask the international community to take every measure as soon as possible to save Kobani and the people of Syrian Kurdistan from the terrorists,"" he said in a statement. ""The ISIS terrorists perpetrate crimes and atrocities wherever they are, therefore they have to be hit and defeated wherever they are."" As ISIS encroached on the nearby villages, residents fled toward Kobani, said Baly, the Kurdish activist. There were reports that ISIS kidnapped some of those fleeing to Kobani, including women, children and the elderly, Baly said. At least three rockets landed in Kobani, causing much panic, he said. ""There is a great deal of fear, but people are insisting on standing up to ISIS and remaining steadfast in the face of their attack,"" he said. Turkey opens border . The fear of a humanitarian crisis in Kobani rose as displaced people sought refuge there but became trapped between the fighting and the Turkish border. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Kurds fleeing the violence walked right up to the wire border fence with Turkey, where they initially were not allowed in. They just sat at the border as Turkish Kurds on the other side of the fence tried to persuade the Turkish guards to let them in. The situation on the border could be observed on a live feed from the border and from video footage aired on Turkish news outlets. The refugees also tried to force their way into Turkey, creating chaos as one woman stepped on a landmine. Turkey finally opened the border, relieving some of the mounting pressure in Kobani and allowing refugees to enter Sanliurfa province. ""Four thousand of our siblings will be hosted in our country,"" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told state media. ""Opening our arms to our Syrian brothers is our historic humanitarian responsibility."" Hosting Syrian refugees is nothing new for Turkey and other neighboring nations. About 815,000 registered Syrian refugees were in Turkey as of last month, part of the 3 million total registered Syrian refugees that the U.N. has counted amid Syria's three-year civil war. A further 6.5 million people were believed to be displaced within Syria as of last month, according to the U.N. U.S. military on deck . The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to approve the arming of Syrian rebels as top U.S. military leadership approved a plan to strike ISIS in Syria. The House approved Obama's request Wednesday. The approval allows President Barack Obama to carry out part of his stated strategy to combat ISIS, though some political leaders remain divided on the way forward. With approval in hand to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS, Obama said Thursday the plan keeps with ""the key principle"" of U.S. strategy: No American combat troops on the ground. ""The American troops deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission,"" he said in televised remarks from the White House. ""Their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. ... We can destroy ISIL without having our troops fight another ground war in the Middle East."" Obama said more than 40 countries, including Arab nations, have offered assistance in the battle against ISIS. Long vetting and training process . National Security Adviser Susan Rice, speaking to reporters Friday, said that now that approval to arm moderate Syrian rebels has been given, a long process will start to vet and train those who will be benefit from the measure. U.S. military personnel will train the Syrian fighters outside of Syria, and the process of planning the training and vetting the participants will take months, she said. ""This is a serious training program, and we are serious about vetting those we are training and equipping,"" she said. Rice stepped around questions about whether airstrikes against ISIS in Syria will require an additional thumbs-up from President Obama, repeating the President's own announcement that the United States is ""prepared"" to broaden its actions in the region into Syria. ISIS videos . The advance by ISIS in northern Syria comes as the Islamist group released a 55-minute English-language video warning America against ""direct confrontation."" The video describes the conflict as a fight between believers and nonbelievers, and praises its successes on the battlefield. Earlier this week, ISIS released another video showing a captive British journalist criticizing the American and British governments. Citing the Sunni terror group's brutality, from beheading civilians -- including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- to the mass execution of its opponents, Obama said the United States will not back down. ""With their barbaric murder of two Americans, these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world,"" Obama said. ""But today, they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before: As Americans, we do not give in to fear. When you harm our citizens, when you threaten the United States, when you threaten our allies, it doesn't frighten us. It unites us."" The question now appears to be not if, but when, the United States will strike ISIS in its stronghold in northern Syria. The U.S. military has everything it needs to strike ISIS targets in Syria, a plan that officials told CNN is still waiting on Obama's signoff. ISIS, meanwhile, is modifying its behavior, from the way it communicates to the way it conceals itself, in response to potential U.S. airstrikes in Syria, U.S. military officials told CNN. The officials expressed confidence the airstrikes would be effective. Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul, and Mariano Castillo wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Barbara Starr, Jason Hanna and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Group says ISIS has taken over 60 Kurdish villages in three days .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Kay Hagan's campaign said late Wednesday the North Carolina Democrat missed a classified hearing last winter on the threat from the terrorist group ISIS to go to New York to raise money for her re-election. Hagan admitted earlier this week she didn't attend a hearing because she went to the fundraiser but didn't disclose which hearing she missed. Her decision to skip the Armed Services Committee session -- at which high-level administration intelligence officials filled in senators on top secret details about the group -- is drawing fire from her Republican opponent, North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis, who is narrowly trailing her in recent polls. The Feb. 27, 2014 classified ISIS hearing she missed adds to a long list of Armed Services Committee hearings Hagan has already acknowledged skipping. Her aides had previously explained she missed 27 of 49 public hearings over the last two years because of scheduling conflicts with other Senate business, such as hearings for different committees and meetings with North Carolina constituents. Tillis is betting her absences from the national security hearings will hurt the first-term senator's re-election effort in the Republican-leaning Tar Heel state -- which has a very large military population -- even though he too has faced criticism for missing work in the state capital in order to attend his own fundraisers. ""There is nothing more important than receiving briefings on our national security,"" Tillis told reporters on a conference call Wednesday. ""It's the top responsibility of every Member of Congress. Senator Hagen has failed to do her job. What is her excuse for not showing up to work over half the time?"" Tillis released an ad on Thursday slamming Hagan for missing hearings. Charges that incumbents have missed hearings, briefings, votes, and other official work are popping up in a several closely-fought Senate races this year. The notion that lawmakers are not showing at the jobs they were elected to do infuriates many voters and feeds a narrative that Washington is broken and office holders need to be replaced. Democratic campaign operatives in Washington, who are already battling headwinds in their effort to keep the Senate in Democratic control, conducted private polling on the question so they could fully understand its impact. The results showed the issue is very potent and could damage even seasoned candidates. Senate math seems impossible to some Democrats . In this year's midterm campaigns, Republican challengers have accused Democratic senators Mark Udall of Colorado and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire of missing hearings related to the threat from the terrorist group ISIS. Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Iowa, faced a barrage of TV ads accusing him of not appearing at hearings on the Veterans Administration's recent health care scandal. ""When our veterans needed him, Bruce Braley was AWOL,"" one TV ad this summer charged. In another tight race, Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate Allison Grimes blasted Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for missing hearings of the agriculture and appropriations committees and suggested he was too busy with his leadership duties to deal with the needs of Kentuckians. The allegations that Hagan missed so many Armed Services Committee hearings first came to light last month. But at a news conference Tuesday night, following a debate with Tillis, Hagan was asked directly, ""Did you miss any of these meetings specifically for a fundraiser?"" ""You know, there was one,"" she responded. ""And what had happened at that hearing, it was scheduled early in the day. And then votes were scheduled, and that hearing then had to be postponed later that day. So, yes, I did miss that one."" The fact that she skipped such an important hearing, at which the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency took questions from senators on ""current and future worldwide threats to the national security of the United States,"" according to the committee website, could prove politically difficult for voters to understand. On his conference call, Tillis was asked about why he missed work in the North Carolina House to raise campaign cash. He deflected the question but said, ""Quite honestly, if I had anything approaching the seriousness of the threat of ISIS, I would have canceled anything I was doing."" DSCC ad: Tillis in Koch brothers' pocket . Whether voters will accept Hagan's and Tillis's explanations remains to be seen. But one of the dirty little truths about the way Washington works is that lawmakers from both parties have very busy schedules and don't attend all the hearings of the committees and subcommittees to which they are assigned. Even veteran senators from safe states will bristle at the suggestion they might have skipped a national security hearing or classified briefing to attend something that could be perceived as political in nature. That's because they've learned that voters don't take it lightly.","Sen. Kay Hagan's admission might hurt her chances at re-election .

The group had previously announced in April that Young would be taking a break from the band and that it would be recording a new record without him. When AC/DC announced that it would be putting out the record, ""Rock or Bust,"" this fall, they confirmed that Young would not be returning to the band, ""due to the nature of Malcolm's condition."" They did not go into the specifics of the illness. Young's nephew, Stevie Young, played rhythm guitar in Malcolm's stead on ""Rock or Bust.""

"(CNN) -- Who are the seven women who police say one Indiana man has confessed to killing? ""They're not forgotten, because they're not nobodies. They're somebody,"" said Lori Townsend, whose 19-year-old daughter Afrikka Hardy was found strangled at a Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana, over the weekend. ""They're somebody's daughter,"" she told CNN affiliate WLS, ""somebody's mother, somebody's sister."" Here's what we know so far about the suspected serial killer's victims: . Afrikka Hardy . ""She could walk into a room and just light it up with her smile and her laugh and just her presence,"" Townsend told CNN's Don Lemon. ""Afrikka never met a stranger. She loved everybody. And that was kind of part of her problem. She was a little naive on trusting people."" Hardy, 19, had recently moved back to Chicago after graduating from high school and living for five years with her mother in Aurora, Colorado. Authorities say suspect Darren Deon Vann hired a prostitute through the backpage.com site serving Chicago and arranged a meeting with Hardy at the Motel 6. That was a surprise to her mother. ""I had no idea. That's not the way I raised Afrikka. She wasn't raised up like that,"" Townsend said. ""Her three months out there, she never said that anything was wrong. She never gave me any inclination she was doing this or thinking about doing this."" But even if true, that information is irrelevant, the mother said. ""What matters is that my baby be remembered for who she really is,"" Townsend wrote on Facebook Monday. ""Remember her smile, laugh, tender heart and the fact that she is no longer with us!"" In Facebook posts, Townsend described her daughter as a princess and posted a YouTube video of her belting out a ballad. Hardy's cousins told The Chicago Tribune that she enjoyed singing, loved kids and eventually wanted to own a day care. ""She had plans on going back to school, and we talked about it numerous times,"" one cousin told the newspaper. ""But I guess she started hanging with different people and it took her towards another way."" Teaira Batey . The last time Gloria Cullom saw her daughter, they were grocery shopping together in Gary. ""She said, 'I love you. I'll be back, Mama.' That's what she said to me, and she left, and she went with her friend,"" Cullom told CNN affiliate KARE. ""But she didn't come back that night."" When she heard from her the next day, Batey was crying, sounded scared and wanted someone to pick her up, Cullom said. She was never heard from again. Batey's family reported her missing in late January, boyfriend Marvin Clinton told CNN's Poppy Harlow. At first, they held off because Batey had been known to leave her home in Gary for days or even a week at a time, Clinton said. But as the days passed, he said, they became increasingly concerned and contacted police. ""We know her daily routine. She would go out, you know, and hang out, go visit friends and things like that,"" he said. ""But she would always stay in touch with the family."" Batey, 28, didn't work, Clinton said. ""It was more being home, being a mom, raising her son, doing things as a family,"" he said. Cullom said her daughter was mentally ill and often willing to trust people. ""Like I told (the police) there, she might be grown, but she had a mind like a 12-year-old. She's very vulnerable, but she's a sweet person,"" Cullom told KARE. ""She's very trusting. She never thought that somebody would hurt her if she never gave them no reason to hurt her."" Authorities at one point suggested that maybe Batey had decided to leave and start a new life, but Clinton said he didn't buy it. ""Teaira would not leave her son like that,"" he said. ""She was a loving, kind person ... a bighearted person. Teaira was the kind of person that ... would give you her coat to wear if you didn't have one."" Clinton told CNN affiliate WLS that he's been struggling to tell their 2-year-old son what happened. ""I don't know how to explain it to him right now. ... He's been asking for Mommy a lot, and the only thing I can tell him is, 'Mommy's not here right now,'"" Clinton said. Anith Jones . The 35-year-old was last seen on October 8, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. She was reported missing two days later. Her sister told the newspaper that Jones, who lived in Merrillville, Indiana, ran a booth at a flea market. ""She was a kind, loving woman,"" Yolanda Nowell, a Chicago police officer, told the Sun-Times. ""She was my favorite sister. She was everybody's favorite aunt."" Her 2001 Chevrolet Prism was found parked in the driveway of a vacant house in Gary earlier this month. Police with cadaver dogs had searched other vacant lots and abandoned homes to look for her, the newspaper said. They didn't find her, until Vann pointed them to an abandoned house in Gary. The bodies of two other women were found at the same address. They have not yet been identified. Vann had ""some sort of connection"" with Jones, Gary Police Chief Larry McKinley said, adding that authorities don't know yet what the connection is. Kristine Williams . Williams, 36, was a resident of Gary and a mother of four, according to her mother-in-law, Deborah Berry. Berry told CNN she had not heard from Williams since February but did not file a police report because Williams would often ""disappear."" ""I've been kind of wondering what happened to Kristine. She kind of disappeared,"" said Berry. ""I haven't talked to her since February. She would call me every couple of months. I was like her mother. Her real family wouldn't have much to do with her."" Williams did not have a job, and according to Berry, she had two children from her marriage with Berry's son Siad, and two more children from different fathers. All four were put up for adoption, said Berry. Jane Doe #3 . One victim, described by authorities as Jane Doe #3, was a 5-foot-tall woman with shoulder length blond hair tinted red. She wore a pair of size-3/4 twentyone black by RUE21 blue jeans and white Nike gym shoes size 6, said Lake County Coroner Merrilee Frey. ""We may have a possible lead. We will be conducting DNA analysis with her possible family through the Indiana State Police. As well as all the victims that we have identified, to be able to make a positive identification,"" said Frey . Jane Doe #5 . Frey said a victim known as Jane Doe #5 wore a silver-colored chain-linked bracelet that said ""Best Aunt"" when investigators found her. Fray asked for help identifying the 5-foot 3-inch African-American woman, who she said was also wearing a silver-colored ring with scalloped engravings and another silver-colored ring with a heart shape. Jane Doe #6 . Frey said a victim known as Jane Doe #6 was an African-American woman.

"San Diego (CNN) -- The breathtakingly incompetent way that Disney handled the introduction of what was thought to be the Magic Kingdom's first Hispanic princess has me wondering: What kind of Mickey Mouse operation is this? Given that Hispanics spending power is worth $1.2 trillion, it's not surprising the media and entertainment behemoth wants a slice of it. But Disney's attempt has turned into a case study of how not to market a product to any group, let alone Hispanics. Talk about magic. Apparently, Disney has the power to take Hispanics and ""de-Hispanicize"" them. You start off chocolate, or cafe con leche. Then, suddenly, abracadabra, you're vanilla! News: Backlash for Disney's first Latina princess . The first casualty is Princess Sofia. Meet Disney's newest princess, who is set to make her debut November 18 on the Disney Channel in the TV movie ""Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess."" A TV series is scheduled to follow in 2013 on both the Disney Channel and Disney Junior. Sofia is the latest addition to a very exclusive club that also happens to be one of the most lucrative franchises in the Magic Kingdom. You have the Old Guard: Snow White, Cinderella, Belle and Sleeping Beauty. Then you have the racial and ethnic wing: Mulan (Asian), Jasmine (Middle Eastern), Pocahontas (Native American) and Tiana (African-American). Now here comes Sofia (?). That's the problem. We're not sure what Sofia is. According to Craig Gerber, co-executive producer and writer on the project, Sofia was born and raised in Enchancia, a ""make-believe 'melting pot' kingdom."" Usually, a little ambiguity might not be such a bad thing. We're a multicultural country. So what if a cartoon figure has an ethnic background that is unknown or undefined? No harm done. Except for one thing. As recently as seven days ago, Sofia was Hispanic. In fact, she was introduced -- informally, haphazardly and clumsily -- as Disney's first Hispanic princess by someone who ought to know: the executive producer of the TV movie, Jaime Mitchell. In discussing Sofia with Entertainment Weekly, she confirmed: ""She is Latina."" Mitchell also confirmed that Sofia was the first Hispanic princess to hold court in the Magic Kingdom. The clues were there, but you had to hunt for them. Sofia's name is spelled the Spanish way -- with an ""f,"" not a ""ph."" Her mother has a dark complexion, and her name is ""Miranda."" And that character will have the voice of Latina actress Sara Ramirez of ""Grey's Anatomy."" (Sofia is being voiced by ""Modern Family"" star Ariel Winter.) And Gerber explained that, while Sofia is of ""mixed heritage,"" her mother is described as having come from ""an enchanted kingdom inspired by Spain (Galdiz)."" News: Disney producer 'misspoke': 'First Latina princess' isn't Latina . As the father of two little girls -- ages 7 and 3 -- this was good enough for me. The day the news broke, bracing for a Disney-style merchandizing juggernaut, I playfully posted on my wife's Facebook page a link to the story with the message: ""We've finally arrived. Daddy, open wallet."" Then, ethnic pride gave way to ethnic squabbles. By being coy about Sofia's background, Disney created a vacuum. Into it, stepped three groups -- all pushing their own agendas. There were activists who saw the fact that the company was being vague about the princess as an insult. They asked: If she is Hispanic, what's wrong with that? Why not just admit it? There were Latino bloggers eager to engage in that favorite parlor game: ""I'm authentic, you're not."" If Sofia was Hispanic, why was she light-skinned? What's wrong with dark skin? Then there were those who, responding to the bloggers, pushed back against the idea that Hispanics had to look a certain way to be authentic. Don't we come in all colors? It all gave me flashbacks to college -- and a headache. Meanwhile, Disney had a headache of its own. It had worked out this whole complicated salsa dance that was suddenly getting a lot more complicated. It wanted a Hispanic product that would appeal to Hispanics but would also, apparently, not turn off non-Hispanics. It wanted something that could be specific to one group and yet broad in its appeal, part of an ethnic niche and yet blended into the mainstream. Good luck with that. It was easier turning Pinocchio into a real boy. And now, because Mitchell had spoken out of school, and said publicly what I'm sure the Disney creative team had discussed privately -- that, yes, of course, Sofia is Hispanic -- the company was getting all the blame and none of the credit. And so, this week, it announced that there had been a misunderstanding and that Sofia was, well, just Sofia. Nancy Kanter, senior vice president of original programming and general manager of Disney Junior Worldwide, went to the Facebook page for ""Sofia the First"" and posted a statement that read: ""Some of you may have seen the recent news stories on whether Sofia is or isn't a 'Latina princess.' What's important to know is that Sofia is a fairytale girl who lives in a fairytale world."" Gee, you're kidding. How did I miss that? Sofia may be make-believe, but this public relations blunder is as real as it gets. Whereas my mother's generation, and my wife's had to put up with being ignored and overlooked by the worlds of media and entertainment, Disney has taught my girls that there is something worse -- when being designated ""Hispanic"" is treated as a mistake that has to be corrected. No fairytale ending here. The new Disney princess is not Hispanic and not historic. About this, a lot of Hispanics -- 52 million Americans who don't like being played with -- are going to be, well, not happy. Daddy, close wallet. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Disney's newest princess, Sofia, may or may not be Hispanic .

"(CNN) -- Violence has flared again in northwest Pakistan, where terrorists attacked army troops and two militant groups announced an alliance intent on starting a war against security forces. Pakistani army spokesman Asim Bajwa said in a statement Saturday that close to 60 terrorists struck security forces in Khyber Agency, a region west of Peshawar that borders Afghanistan. The two sides waged a lengthy battle, after which 17 militants were dead while others managed to escape, Bajwa said. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The region has long been a hotbed for armed anti-government activity, not to mention U.S. drone strikes targeting suspected terrorists. Sources: Drone strikes kill 8 in Afghanistan, Pakistan . The Pakistani Taliban has been one of the most destabilizing forces in the Asian nation. In a statement, the outlawed organization threatened to foment more unrest as it announced it will send fighters to Khyber Agency and join forces with the militant group Lashkar-i-Islam.

"Washington (CNN) -- Turns out the ""gotcha"" moment in Thursday's New Hampshire debate wasn't so clear cut. Republican Scott Brown, who is vying for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's seat, appeared to botch a question on New Hampshire geography during the final debate in the contentious race. But after some post-debate map-checking, the former senator from Massachusetts, who moved back to New Hampshire after losing his Senate seat in 2013, actually got an apology from the reporter who questioned the candidate's familiarity with state geography. So did Brown get it right and WMUR's James Pindell got it wrong? Turns out, both were partly right. Poll: Dead heat in New Hampshire Senate race . First, the incident: . Pindell, one of the state's top political reporters, had his sights set on Brown's relative lack of in-state credentials and asked Brown to talk specifically about economic conditions in Sullivan County -- one of 10 counties in the state. Brown didn't get into the specifics of Sullivan County, but talked about the economic conditions ""up North."" ""We're talking about Sullivan County, and I think you were talking about the north country,"" Pindell interjected, referring to the northern tier of the state that doesn't include Sullivan County. ""I'm talking about any place past Concord, actually,"" Brown retorted. Pindell stuck to his line, explaining that Sullivan County is ""west of Concord, it's not north of Concord, Sen. Brown."" That changed after the debate when Pindell apologized on air and said ""Scott Brown was right, I was wrong."" Now, the fact check: . Most of Sullivan County is in fact north of the capital city of Concord, but Sullivan County is also further west of the city than it is north. And a sliver of the county is even south of Concord, according to several maps. So in truth, the vast majority Sullivan County is northwest of Concord, and even Brown conceded in a post-debate press conference that he ""should have been more specific."" ""I've visited every county and I'm going to continue to take that message of independence to every county,"" he said. The nuance didn't keep Shaheen's campaign from pouncing on the opportunity to highlight Brown's outsider status. Shaheen's campaign even announced after the debate that she would head to Sullivan County on Friday.","Scott Brown appeared to botch a question on New Hampshire geography in the final Senate debate .

"(CNN) -- The Qatari capital, Doha, has been selected as host of the 2019 world athletics championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) announced on Tuesday. Doha was chosen ahead of U.S. candidate Eugene, Oregon and Spain's entry, Barcelona at a IAAF meeting in Monaco. It is the first time in the history of the event that a Middle Eastern country has been chosen as host. ""It's a privilege and honor to have the trust of the IAAF,"" the leader of the Doha bid, Sheikh Saoud Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a statement released on the IAAF website. ""I am very delighted that these championships are going to be in the region for the first time. ""I'm confident that with the support of the IAAF we will organize one of the best world championships,"" he added. The first world athletic championships were held at Helsinki in 1983 and have been held biennially since 1991. Beijing's ""Bird's Nest"" stadium -- host to the 2008 Olympic Games -- is set to host the event next year and will be followed by London in 2017. ""I (am) sure that in Doha we will have a wonderful edition of the world championships,"" said IAAF President Lamine Diack, in a statement. This is the second major world sporting event to be awarded to Qatar in recent years. In 2010, FIFA selected Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis rang in his first Christmas at the Vatican with a Christmas Eve Mass preaching a message of love and forgiveness. ""On this night, let us share the joy of the Gospel. God loves us. He so loves us that he gave us his son to be our brother, to be light in our darkness. To us the Lord repeats, 'Do not be afraid,' ... And I, too, repeat, do not be afraid,'"" the Pope said. ""Our Father is patient. He loves us, he gives us Jesus to guide us on the way which leads to the promised land. Jesus is the light who brightened the darkness. Our Father forgives always. He is our peace and light."" He called on the throngs gathered at St. Peter's Basilica on Tuesday to cast aside hatred. ""God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. Yet on the part of the people, there are times of both light and darkness, fidelity and infidelity, obedience and rebellion, times of being a pilgrim people, and times of being a people adrift,"" the Pope said. ""In our personal history, too, there are both bright and dark moments, lights and shadows. If we love God and our brothers and sisters, we walk in the light. But if our heart is closed, if we are dominated by pride, deceit, self-seeking, then darkness falls within us, and around us. Whoever hates his brother -- writes the Apostle John -- is in the darkness; he walks in the darkness, and does not know the way to go, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."" Before the Mass, pilgrims gathering in Vatican City told CNN they were excited to celebrate with the Pope. ""We want to share this special moment with a person who is a beloved person, and we appreciate all he's doing,"" one woman said. Nine months into his papacy, much has been made of the Pope's reforms, among them more scrutiny at the Vatican bank, changes to the church's bureaucratic structure, and a commission to deal with the abuse of minors. And while this year's Christmas liturgy remains the same, experts say we should expect the unexpected. ""He tends to be a surprise, because he does things that are normal, but are very abnormal in terms of the papacy,"" said Gerard O'Connell, a Vatican analyst. ""He brought three homeless men into where he is living to have breakfast with him on his birthday. ... I suspect we will see something else again over the Christmas period."" The festivities began on Saturday, with the Pope's Christmas message to the Curia. He urged the church's governing body to avoid gossip and to focus on service. And then he practiced what he preached, spending three hours at a local hospital bringing Christmas cheer to sick children. There were a record number of requests to attend this year's Christmas Eve Mass. On Christmas Day, tens of thousands of pilgrims are expected to flood St. Peter's Square to hear his message to the world. ""People are listening to him, because he's speaking in a language that's not Vaticanese,"" O'Connell said. ""He's speaking the language of ordinary people.""","The Pope urges faithful to cast aside hatred .

"(CNN) -- It's been that type of year for Serena Williams. Williams collected her 18th grand slam singles title at the U.S. Open in September to match retired legends Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert but prior to that didn't get past the fourth round at the three other majors in 2014. The world No. 1 recently retired due to illness in Wuhan, China and then was a walkover in Beijing with a knee injury -- and on Wednesday at the WTA Finals in Singapore she suffered the joint worst loss of her career. Simona Halep battered Williams 6-0 6-2 to leave the two-time defending champion in danger of being eliminated in the group stage. It matched the number of games won by Williams in 1998 -- when she was just 16 -- against South Africa's Joannette Kruger in Oklahoma. Williams, two days after looking sharp in defeating Ana Ivanovic, made 36 unforced errors in the 14 games and the encounter lasted a mere one hour and five minutes. While Halep went 5-for-6 on break points, Williams went 0-for-6. ""Embarrassed is the way I would describe how I played,"" Williams told reporters. ""Definitely embarrassing."" ""My forehand was off today. It's obviously gone on an early vacation. My serve was at best at the 10-and-under division of juniors."" Halep improved to 2-0 in the Red Group. The Romanian -- one of two debutants at the WTA Finals along with Canada's Eugenie Bouchard -- entered the year-end championships in patchy form but she limited her own unforced errors and covered the court with aplomb. Halep had lost both her matches to Williams last year, with the latter inflicting two ""bagels"" -- or 6-0 sets -- of her own. ""It was my best match of my life,"" Halep told reporters. ""I played unbelievable shots. At an important time I played really well and after today my confidence will be more high."" Ivanovic eased past a listless Bouchard 6-1 6-3 later Wednesday. Both players hit 20 winners but Bouchard committed 31 unforced errors compared to the Serb's 18. Caroline Wozniacki and her pal Agnieszka Radwanska posted upset wins Tuesday over Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova, respectively.","Serena Williams loses 6-0 6-2 to Simona Halep at the year-end championships .

"(CNN) -- He was barely a teenager, while on the other side of the net stood his country's most famous face. A towering figure who had won Wimbledon just one year earlier. Despite the pressure, budding tennis star Marin Cilic handled both his nerves and his racquet well enough to impress Goran Ivanisevic. ""It was an extremely huge experience for me,"" Cilic, now 26, told CNN of his date with destiny in the Croatian capital Zagreb. ""He had been my idol, like for most of the kids in Croatia. He'd just won Wimbledon and there I was -- a 14-year-old kid playing tennis with him. ""It was a dream come true."" It was an experience that also launched Cilic's career. Ivanisevic was so struck by the youngster's potential he recommended that his old coach, Bob Brett, oversee his development. The Australian duly did so and shortly after, Cilic served a more formal notice of his talents when winning the French Open boys' title in 2005 -- beating top seed Andy Murray in the semifinals. The pair would work together until May 2013, separating just weeks before the former would learn he had failed a doping test in April. That seismic news was broken to the big server in June, prompting Cilic to immediately quit the ongoing Wimbledon championships, albeit citing a knee injury as he did so. As he awaited the fallout for what he has always claimed was an innocent mistake -- saying he inadvertently ingested a banned substance while in France, as he didn't realize that his regular glucose tablets were manufactured differently there -- Cilic turned to his boyhood hero. ""It was the obvious decision,"" he says. ""Goran was around me and my team before, and he was a close friend. When I stopped with Bob, Goran and I talked about whether he could help me or not. He felt I could improve a lot."" He was spot on. Despite previously stating he has three personalities -- 'Good Goran', 'Bad Goran' and 'Emergency Goran' for when things go wrong -- Ivanisevic's expertise has resulted in Cilic's most successful season. He has improved his protÃ©gÃ©'s serve and mental strength, and Cilic credits him with the sense of enjoyment he is largely having on court. Checkered Start . Yet they came together at a time when Cilic's career was looking as checkered as Croatia's famous red-and-white flag. He was serving his nine-month doping ban, an act that often proves toxic for fans, media and sponsors, yet the duo were able to start to wrestle back credibility when the suspension was cut on appeal in October 2013. By then, Cilic's ranking had dropped from 12th to 47th. Exactly one year later, Cilic had achieved his highest ever rating -- number 8 -- and also had a grand slam success to look back on. In September, he beat Japan's Kei Nishikori to win the U.S. Open, a success made all the sweeter by not losing a single set in the final, semifinal -- when he trounced Roger Federer -- or the quarterfinal against Tomas Berdych. His combination with Ivanisevic has been alchemical at times. ""Belief,"" the 6ft 6in right-hander replies simply to the question as to what is the biggest thing the colorful Croat has given his compatriot. . ""I think I am capable of making it to the top and being able to win big events."" By a quirk of serendipity, Cilic also feels the four months he was out of the game in 2013 contributed to his fantastic 2014, which delivered four titles -- double his previous best for any season. ""Those four months were very tough, it was a difficult time but I learned a lot of things,"" explained the world no. 9. ""I matured as a person and I became more specific with the priorities in my life and what I wanted to achieve in my career. ""I feel I pushed myself much more this year and I was a little bit more motivated -- that always gives you a bit extra and when you are at the top of tennis, even 1% makes a big difference. ""I feel that the things I did last year, where I was working and preparing for the season, helped me to achieve what I achieved this year. ""When I started this season, I felt really good -- maybe the best ever."" While his period in the wilderness helped recharge his batteries and contributed to his memorable year, the extent of his success may also have led to his only real blemish for 2014. Last week, Cilic made his debut at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals but he struggled in London, losing all his matches in a challenging group involving eventual champion Novak Djokovic, Berdych and Stan Wawrinka. ""It's a little bit disappointing to play like this. I was not expecting it,"" he said after winning just six games in his opening two matches. ""But I feel a little bit tired, and the body feels a little bit tired on the court."" Tears of Joy . His fatigued body may receive a timely boost next week if a long-awaited parcel from New York pitches up in the post. It will revive memories of a month when he played the 'greatest tennis' of his life, even if he says he's watched a DVD of the Flushing Meadows final at least 10 times already. """"The replica trophy still hasn't come, believe it or not. It's still being made in New York so hopefully it will arrive next week,"" he said. ""It's going to be at my apartment in Zagreb and I'm going to have to polish it -- every day!"" His U.S. Open triumph made Cilic one of only three men outside the Big Four to have won a grand slam since 2005, with Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro and Switzerland's Wawrinka being the others. Like the man he befriended as a 14-year-old, Cilic's success has also turned him into a standout star in his homeland. ""I didn't think it was going to mean that much but when I came back, I realized the extent of its effect on people,"" said the man nicknamed 'Chila' by his friends. ""It was one of the best moments of Croatian sports ever but I didn't think it was going to change people's lives for that week or month -- because everybody I saw was extremely happy. ""They were unbelievably proud and whoever I saw on the street was congratulating me. That was the satisfaction for me that I could -- with my job and this achievement -- make people so happy."" On the day itself, even his boyhood idol shed a tear.","2014 has been Marin Cilic's most successful year .

"Little Rock, Arkansas (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is the prohibitive favorite for the Democrats' presidential nomination in 2016. And there are countless political operatives with opinions on how she should run her all-but-certain campaign. That combination has led to tons of unsolicited advice thrown at the former secretary of state, some of it counter intuitive and a lot of contradictory. Here are the five pieces of unsolicited advice being volleyed regularly at Hillary Clinton: . 1.) Run from Obama . President Barack Obama took most of the blame for Democrats' losses on Nov. 4. So shortly after Election Day, a cacophony of anonymous allies were telling Clinton to run away from the president she served under for four years. ""She is not President Obama. Let's not forget, they were a team of rivals,"" one ally told The Hill. ""Now is the time to further enunciate these differences."" Clinton allies expressed similar sentiments to CNN. The thinking goes that if the president is unpopular, Clinton should start distance herself now, as opposed to months down the road when it may be harder. 2.) Run to Obama . Clinton allies have also been telling reporters that because Republican pickups in Senate create a larger target for both her and the President, it would make sense for them to join forces. ""President Obama's legacy is now entirely dependent on the election of a Democratic successor as president who will protect and extend it, not demolish it,"" David Brock, the chairman of a pro-Clinton super PAC, told the Washington Post. ""Should she run, they both now have a common enemy in a Republican Congress that will define politics through 2016."" Simon Rosenberg, the president of the New Democrat Network, echoed Brock in the same Washington Post story. ""Looking ahead to 2016, I think it would be wise for the entire party, but particularly its presidential aspirants, to learn the lesson of [Al] Gore 2000 and the 2014 midterms,"" Rosenberg said, referencing two elections where Democrats ran away from their own president. ""You cannot run away from the president of your party."" 3.) Find a rationale . David Axelrod, President Barack Obama senior political adviser who at one point was hell bent on beating Hillary Clinton, told an audience in Washington, D.C. on Thursday that in order to win in 2016, Hillary Clinton needs to ""not rely too much on that we do have an electoral vote advantage and demographic advantages."" Instead, Axelrod argued that Clinton need to find a rationale for her campaign, and do it quickly. ""I think the danger for Secretary Clinton is that, as was the case in 2007, her candidacy is out in front of the rationale for it,"" Axelrod said, urging the former secretary of state to get out of the ""cocoon of inevitability."" 4.) Deal with your baggage . Rudy Giuliani visited Politico on Wednesday, and the former presidential candidate revealed he had his own advice for Hillary Clinton. ""She's a candidate who, with her baggage, can be beaten by the right candidate who handles it the right way and by the right campaign who handles it the right way,"" the former New York City mayor said. ""As a first lady she tried one thing and failed,"" he added, referencing her push to pass universal healthcare early in her husband's first presidential term. 5.) Ride the populist wave . Robert Reich, a Clinton cabinet official from the 90s and friend to both Bill and Hillary, told MSNBC that in order to win in 2016, the former first lady needed to focus on economic populism far more than her husband did in his presidential runs. Reich said that Bill Clinton got away by ""alluding"" to issues like economic inequality and the decline of the middle class. For Hillary, on the other hand, ""it's got to be central."" ""Now the situation has changed,"" he said. Clinton has been using populist rhetoric in her speeches and regularly focused on minimum wage and economic inequality while stumping for candidates in 2014.","Hillary Clinton is the presumptive front-runner for Democrats in the 2016 presidential election .
Pundits from both parties have gone public with their advice for her possible bid .

"(CNN) -- Congressman Ralph Hall underwent surgery to repair damage to his hip after a car accident, his office said Sunday. Hall, a Texas Republican and the oldest sitting member of Congress, was airlifted to the hospital Saturday following the accident. Doctors at the Medical Center at Plano said the surgery was successful and that the 91-year-old is expected to make a full recovery. The congressman is in good spirits, his office said. No surprise, given that he apparently took being airlifted in stride, joking with paramedics on the way. Hall was being driven by his friend, 73-year-old Howard Zielke, when someone collided with their vehicle Saturday afternoon in Fannin County, Texas, the state Department of Public Safety reported. The other car's driver didn't need to go to a hospital, while Zielke was transported to a hospital in McKinney, the state agency said. Hall, though, was flown to The Medical Center of Plano with what the public safety department described as ""serious injuries."" The idea that Hall might find humor in an otherwise bad situation, perhaps, shouldn't be too surprising. Shortly after losing a Republican primary this spring to tea party-backed candidate John Ratcliffe, thus spelling an end to his 32-year stay in Congress, Hall cracked: ""I figured it out -- damn guy got more votes than I did!"" He pointed out, too, that he couldn't get unemployment yet since he has ""a job here until December 31st."" ""At 91 years old a contract for six months -- you can't beat it,"" he said then, referring to the rest of his term in the House.","Outgoing congressman Ralph Hall, 91, is the oldest sitting member of Congress .

"(CNN) -- Before the final whistle at Monday night's game between the Indianapolis Colts and the New York Giants, trumpeter Chris Botti had already won. The Grammy-winning musician was on the field at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, to perform the national anthem for November 3's ""Monday Night Football."" No vocals, as we've become accustomed to -- just Botti and his instrument. What transpired was so affecting that it left viewers with chills and brought Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne to tears. ""I'm just blessed to be out there,"" Wayne later told ESPN. His performance during Monday night's game pushed Wayne to eighth place on the all-time receiving yards list, ahead of James Lofton. ""It's an emotional game, man, and sometimes it comes out,"" Wayne continued. ""An old wise guy once told me you shouldn't hold back your tears. Tonight was a night with the tears."" Botti, a native of Portland, Oregon, became devoted to playing the trumpet at 12 after hearing Miles Davis perform ""My Funny Valentine."" Now 52, Botti's not only built a successful career as a trumpeter, he's also worked with some of the music industry's biggest names, from Frank Sinatra and Paul Simon to Joni Mitchell and Natalie Cole. His most recent release, ""Impressions,"" won the Grammy for best pop instrumental album in 2012. After his showing at MetLife, many are also saying that Botti turned in one of the best performances of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" ever heard.

"(CNN) -- He is the heir apparent to Tiger Woods, on the course and off it. By the end of Monday, Rory McIlroy's bank balance will take a step closer to matching that of the most marketable star the sport has ever seen. A bumper multi-year deal with Nike, reported by various media outlets to be worth over $200 million, will propel the Northern Irishman into a stratosphere inhabited only by the richest men and women in sport. Though McIlroy may only have two major championships to his name compared to Woods' 14, at 23 he has time on his side as he strives to eclipse the achievements of his new stable mate. And while Woods hasn't been able to recapture the form he showed prior to news of his extra-marital affairs breaking, Nike's courting of McIlroy is an attempt to pin down a star of the present and future who comes with less baggage, according to a sports business expert. ""Nike is in a difficult position,"" Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University told CNN, ""because their number one golf property historically has fallen on hard times, relatively speaking. ""When Tiger Woods crashed his car into a fire hydrant in 2009, Phil Knight of Nike described it as a minor blip. Commercially that's quite interesting because I think they genuinely believed there was still some sustainability and financial value in the Woods brand heading into the future. But that just hasn't transpired. ""Tiger hasn't won a major since then and his public reputation hasn't recovered to where it was. That's a problem for Nike because what you've got to keep in mind is that Nike essentially built their whole golf business on the back of Woods and for a long time the vast majority of their commercial activity and their marketing was based around him. And it was very successful. ""They used not to have a significant golf business but now they do. The problem is that to a large extent, they've been left high and dry. They now have a global golf business without a credible brand spokesperson. ""So essentially what they've been looking for is an heir apparent, somebody with the same competitive characteristics as Woods but without the baggage, as well as somebody who can conceivably carry the brand into the future. That's why I think the length of the deal is absolutely crucial. ""It seems to me that what they're attempting to do is to build a sustainable business on the back of McIlroy over the next 10 years, just as they did with Woods over the first 13 years of their time together."" At a stroke, the deal transforms McIlroy into one of the hottest commercial properties in sport. According to the Forbes list of 2012, McIlroy's deal with Nike will make him highest paid young sports star in the world, taking him well above the $17.4 million he earned in the year up to July 2012. But he still has some way to go to catch Woods, who raked in total earnings of $59.4 million in the same time period. Both trail behind the world's top two highest grossing sports stars, boxers Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, who earned $85 million and $62 million respectively. While Nike's outlay on Woods and McIlroy is significant, it will seem like money well spent should their twin titans end up battling it out going down the stretch at many a major tournament in the years to come. But with both of golf's biggest stars now operating under the same umbrella, even if they don't end up slugging it out for honors on the course, the prospect of both players being available for marketing opportunities is a big draw for Nike, according to Tony Martin, a sport, event and project management consultant at Qatar Atlantic College in Doha. Boulden: Which Nike star will Rory mirror? ""In many respects this is a coup for Nike as they now have some leverage on the two of the most marketable figures in the world of sport,"" he told CNN. ""Golf fans everywhere are longing for the head to head battles between these two, given their considerable differences in age, style and personalities. ""Nike will certainly use their leverage to nurture such competition by ensuring their schedules are aligned to foster maximum exposure to such opportunities. When this begins to happen consistently, and I believe it will soon, Nike reaps the unbelievable rewards. ""This deal is not taken lightly and I am sure all of Nike's significant market research is verifying a likeability scale for this young man (McIlroy) that is off the charts."" Just as Nike will hope McIlroy can match Woods' prowess when it comes to bagging majors and green jackets, they could be forgiven for hoping the 23-year-old won't attract any salacious headlines away from the greens. The sports giant recently dropped disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong after he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for doping offenses, and withstood a barrage of bad press for their client when news of Woods' extra marital affairs broke. McIlroy's only negative press to date has come via the odd misjudged quote -- which can be explained as a byproduct of his youthful exuberance and refreshing honesty in interviews -- and though he has earned plaudits for keeping his feet on the ground, Martin says there is no guarantee how he'll react if he reaches the level of fame Woods currently orbits. ""Rory represents a much different personality than Tiger and on the surface, epitomizes a safe investment for Nike,"" he said. ""However like Tiger, he appears to be a marketer's dream. The problem is, no one truly knows how any individual is going to react to all this money, fame and adoration until they have lived with it. ""These superstar athletes live in a fish bowl where their every comment, action and especially reactions are fodder for the media outlets around the world. Already, controversy is circling with regard to Rory's Olympic participation decision and legal issues with previous sponsors."" The first time the world will see Nike's new double act in action will be on Thursday when McIlroy and Woods line up for the HSBC Championship in Abu Dhabi.","Nike announces multi-year sponsorship deal with golf's world No. 1 Rory McIlroy .

"(CNN) -- Storms battering the southern United States put 32 million people from West Virginia to Florida at risk of facing severe weather Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons reported. By 7 p.m. ET, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had more than 500 delays, according to flightaware.com. The storms are already blamed for two deaths, the first October tornado fatalities in the United States since 2009, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported. Both took place Monday -- one in Alabama and another in Arkansas. Earlier Tuesday, part of the Atlanta area faced a tornado warning. Several inches of rain were pounding large swaths of the Southeast. There were nearly 1,000 lightning strikes in a one-hour period Tuesday morning, Javaheri said. The weather pattern has the Northeast in its sights as well. Some areas could see 3 inches of rain. The expansive storms stretch from Mobile, Alabama, up to Ontario, Canada, Javaheri said. The National Weather Service says there's a chance of severe thunderstorms in parts of eight states, from the Florida Panhandle north to West Virginia. And while there is a threat of tornadoes, ""widespread wind damage may be more prevalent,"" CNN meteorologist Alexandra Steele said. ""Within some of these storms, the winds may gust to 60 to 70 miles per hour."" Deaths blamed on weather . A 75-year-old woman in Dora, Alabama, died when a large oak tree fell on her mobile home Monday afternoon, police said. ""She was sitting on her daybed in the trailer and the tree fell directly on top of her,"" said Dora Police Chief John Duchock. Kenneth Watts, a volunteer with the Yerkwood Fire Department, lived nearby and tried to rescue the woman, identified as Shirley Hicks. ""I tried everything I could to get her out, but there was a tree on top of her,"" he tearfully told CNN affiliate WBMA. ""She was like a grandmother to me."" Her husband was taken to a hospital with head injuries. He's expected to make a full recovery, WBMA reported. Dora is about 25 miles northwest of Birmingham. Early Monday, a man was killed and three members of his family were injured when storms swept through Little River County in western Arkansas, according Sheriff Gary Gregory, who said the house they were in was leveled. Charles Edward Whithem, 33, was found dead in the debris near Ashdown, about 18 miles northwest of Texarkana, Gregory said. ""It's hard to even look at (the home),"" Whithem's uncle Freddie Harrington told affiliate KTHV. ""It's sad. I think of all the good times we had."" The system also flipped cars and destroyed several other buildings in the county.","NEW: Atlanta's airport, world's busiest, has more than 500 delays by 7 p.m. ET .

"(CNN) -- Though he told authorities that the devil made him do it, Satanists disapproved, after a man allegedly shattered a stone copy of the Ten Commandments last week. The man is accused of running his car on Friday into a controversial 6-foot-tall granite tablet of the Biblical edicts erected near Oklahoma City's Capitol, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. He then left his car standing, along with the monument, which -- as photos showed -- was smashed asunder through the second commandment: ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain."" He walked into the Federal Building on foot, where he made threats against President Obama and the federal government, KFOR reported, citing U.S. Secret Service agents. The man told the agents that the devil made him wreck the religious monument, which was placed at the capital in late 2012. He also said that he was mentally ill and had stopped taking his medication. He has been detained at a mental health facility for evaluation. Condemnation came quickly from two sources that have railed against the monument -- the ACLU of Oklahoma and the Satanic Temple. The ACLU filed suit last year against the presence of the monument on state property, and on Friday, said that it would keep fighting for its removal, because it feels it it violates the Constitution. But organization was also ""outraged at this apparent act of vandalism."" ""The Ten Commandments constitute a strong foundation in our clients' deeply held religious beliefs,"" the Oklahoma ACLU said in a statement. The Satanic Temple has demanded to have a monument of its own erected next to the Judeo-Christian one. And it still wants it, but ""only alongside the 10 Commandments,"" it said in a statement posted by KFOR. ""If our monument stands at the state Capitol, we want it to compliment and contrast the Ten Commandments, with both standing unmolested as a testament to American religious freedom and tolerance."" The Satanists could well have that wish fulfilled, but only in part. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has vowed to have the Ten Commandments monument rebuilt. .","A man allegedly rams his car into a Ten Commandments monument .

"(CNN) -- Tim Tesseneer was driving along Daytona Beach on Tuesday with his wife when they noticed the minivan driving through shallow water as it headed south. That was unusual enough. But then they heard the screams. It was two children crying and waving for help out one of the rear windows. Tesseneer threw the car in park and raced over to see whether he could get the children out of the minivan. One child was screaming, Tesseneer recalled Wednesday to CNN's Piers Morgan. ""Please help us, our mom is trying to kill us."" The other child he could see was wrestling a woman for the steering wheel. But the woman just kept saying, ""We're OK. We're OK. We're OK,"" as another man joined Tesseneer trying to get the driver to stop. Then she mashed the accelerator, turned left and shot into the cold, heavy surf of the Atlantic Ocean touching the shore of the Florida city. It was now a battle against the pull of the water, and the second man, Stacy Robinson, opened a door and pulled out the two panicked children. There was a good chance if he and Tesseneer hadn't been there, the children, ages 10 and 9, would have drowned inside the van as it pitched in the water, officials said. ""I have siblings their age, so it was like the big brother came out in me,"" Robinson said. But there was one more child, a 3-year-old girl strapped in a car seat. A lifeguard dove in through a front window and unbuckled the child and handed her to another lifeguard. The vehicle was bobbing in water about 3 feet deep. The mother just walked away, Tesseneer said, silent with a strange, almost ""possessed"" look on her face. A day later she was at a hospital in Daytona Beach awaiting a mental evaluation, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said. Her children, including her unborn baby, were fine. No charges had been filed, Johnson said, as the investigation into why she drove into the ocean was just beginning. CNN is not identifying the children or the woman, who was stopped earlier in the day after her sister called police to let them know how concerned she was for her sibling's mental state. According to a Daytona Beach Police report, the woman was stopped by an officer, who questioned her. In the back seat the kids sat calmly with smiles. The woman told an officer that she feared for her safety and was worried her former husband would harm them. But the officer was concerned that she might have a mental illness. He asked a detective who was there to talk to her while other officers called the sister back. In the report, the officer writes of discussing the woman's behavior with the detective. They came to the same conclusion; she couldn't be held under a Florida law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired by mental illness and who possibly pose a risk of harm. They told her she could go; one officer followed her for a short time. Almost two hours later, she was driving on the beach, outside the traffic lane, drawing the attention of beach patrol and bystanders like Robinson and Tesseneer, on vacation from North Carolina. Sheriff Johnson said the children are now in the state's care. They had been interviewed by detectives from his agency, which was taking the lead because it has more investigators than other departments. The woman had yet to speak with detectives. Johnson said his team will try to determine whether this was a criminal act or one that resulted from a medical issue. No one in his department knows how long the woman had been in town or why she was visiting from South Carolina. She did have family in the area, the sheriff said.

"Washington (CNN) -- As Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu defends her U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana, a new CNN/ORC International poll indicates the third-term incumbent carries a slim advantage over her closest GOP rival in the general election this November. But this is Louisiana, and the election system can be complicated. There are nine candidates -- Republicans, Democrats, and a Libertarian -- on the ballot this November, and if no candidate crosses the 50% threshold, the race moves into a December runoff between the top two contenders. Landrieu currently falls well below the 50% mark at 43% support among likely voters. Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy comes in second at 40%, according to the survey. But the poll's sampling error among likely voters is plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the two candidates are about even. In a state with large swaths of conservative voters, Landrieu is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this year. Republicans, eager to take control of the Senate, have focused on the race as a potential pick-up seat. The GOP needs a net gain of six seats to retake the majority. Politics of fear -- how the GOP is using ISIS against Dems . If the horse race in Louisiana stays relatively the same, Landrieu and Cassidy would be the two candidates heading into the runoff -- and that's when things flip. The poll indicates that Cassidy would fare slightly better in a runoff than Landrieu, 50%-47%. ""Keep in mind that the electorate in December is probably going to be smaller and quite a bit different from those who turn out to vote in November,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. But the poll's likely voter model can only estimate the November electorate, he added, and turnout is going to be extremely important in December. ""Landrieu wins a majority in a two-way race among all registered voters, but we know that only a small fraction of them will come out for a runoff,"" he said. Amid worrisome polls, Democrats make new pitch for women . In her re-election bid, Landrieu has been touting her position as chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee as a boon to her oil-rich state. Like many Democrats in tight re-election bids from reddish states, Landrieu has also kept President Barack Obama at arm's length due to his low approval ratings. The CNN/ORC poll shows that only 40% of Louisiana voters approve of the job Obama is doing in office. Instead, she has been selling a bipartisan record of working across the aisle and voting independent of her party. But Landrieu has faced a slew of negative headlines this fall, including questions about her residency and improper uses of taxpayer-funded travel. And Republicans, including Cassidy, seized on a recent photo showing Landrieu helping a Louisiana State University fan perform a keg stand during a tailgate party. Cassidy, however, is seeking to paint Landrieu as a rubber stamp for Obama. And as a physician and a three-term congressman who was a vocal opponent of Obamacare, Cassidy is trying make health care reform a big issue in the race. As the incumbent, Landrieu has a large fundraising advantage over Cassidy, having brought in $14 million compared to Cassidy's $8.6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Obamadale: The secret weapon that could save Iowa Democrats? Democratic outside groups have invested heavily in the race, spending nearly six times the amount Republicans have spent in opposition. According to the poll, Landrieu does extremely well in urban areas and carries 85% of the non-white population but gets clobbered in the suburban parts of Louisiana. Interestingly, women only slightly back Landrieu more than men, 48%-45% -- a departure from polls that generally show incumbent Democratic women with a wider gender gap that can prove favorably in the voting booth. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International by telephone with 1,013 adult Americans on September 22-25.","A new CNN poll shows the Louisiana Senate race is very close .

"(CNN) -- For nearly 20 days, Louise Troh has had to endure tremendous fear, grief and isolation. When told of the death of her fiancee, Thomas Eric Duncan -- the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States -- she fell to the ground. The man giving her the news couldn't even console her with a hug. But day 21 is Monday: The day the quarantine period is expected to come to an end for Troh, her son and two nephews. If the four do not develop symptoms by Monday, they will have managed to not contract Ebola despite being in close proximity to Duncan. ""We are so happy this is coming to an end, and we are so grateful that none of us has shown any sign of illness,"" Troh said in a statement on Sunday. ""We have lost so much, but we have our lives and we have our faith in God, which always gives us hope."" Mark Wingfield, an associate pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church, told CNN that Troh will not be doing interviews at this time, but plans to write a book about her experience. ""They feel like this is a tremendous miracle that's happened,"" Wingfield said. ""This is a long-awaited day of celebration."" Tears shed for Duncan . On Saturday, loved ones honored Duncan's memory in North Carolina, where his mother lives. In a memorial service at Rowan International Church in Salisbury, his nephew Josephus Weeks and others eulogized Duncan as a kind, compassionate man. Weeks said he wished Duncan would be remembered for his acts of kindness ""as opposed to the person who brought this disease to America, because he didn't know he was sick."" Duncan's willingness to help others may have led to his death at age 42. Former neighbors in Monrovia, Liberia, have said he may have contracted Ebola while rushing to the aid of a woman who collapsed under duress from the disease. She was pregnant, and Duncan did not know she was sick, they said. ""We continue to mourn his loss and grieve the circumstances that led to his death, just at the time we thought we were facing a happy future together,"" Troh said. ""Even though the quarantine is over, our time of mourning is not over."" A quick-strike team . The U.S. military is forming a 30-person ""quick-strike team"" equipped to provide direct treatment to Ebola patients inside the United States, a Defense Department official told CNN's Barbara Starr on Sunday. A Pentagon spokesman later confirmed portions of the official's information. The team will be under orders to deploy within 72 hours at any time over the next month, the official said. The Department of Health and Human Services requested the military team, and the Pentagon has given verbal approval, the official said. The team will include five doctors, 20 nurses and five trainers, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement. The Pentagon has been working to determine what assistance it could offer the civilian health care sector following a White House meeting last week during which President Barack Obama said he wanted a more aggressive response, according to two Defense officials. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered chief of the Northern Command, Gen. Chuck Jacoby, ""to prepare and train a 30-person expeditionary medical support team that could, if required, provide short-notice assistance to civilian medical professionals in the United States,"" Kirby said. Jacoby is already working with the military on the joint team, Kirby said, and once formed, it will head to Fort Sam Houston in Texas for up to seven days of training in infection control and personal protective equipment. The training, provided by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, will begin ""within the next week or so,"" Kirby said. The team will remain in ""prepare-to-deploy"" status for 30 days, he said. It will be able to respond anywhere in the U.S. if ""deemed prudent by our public health professionals,"" he said. Cruise passenger cleared . Sunday's news out of the Pentagon came as a cruise ship plowed through the waters of a Texas port with precious cargo on board -- the end of a small Ebola scare. A passenger had been loosely linked to the only patient to die from the disease in the United States, but health authorities cleared her after an odyssey at sea. After voluntarily isolating herself in her cabin, she remained symptom-free, and her lab tests looked good, the Galveston County Health Authority said. She and a travel partner were allowed to disembark. The drama goes back to the woman's work as a lab supervisor at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the center of a maelstrom of Ebola fears in the United States. It's where Liberian patient Duncan was misdiagnosed and later died, and where two nurses became the first people to contract Ebola in America. Seventy-five health workers and 48 people in the community are under monitoring after coming into contact with Duncan. There are hopeful signs that some of the Ebola contagion scare in the United States could be winding down. Of the four patients being treated, at least two appear to be making a recovery. And the monitoring period for the 48 community members ends at midnight Sunday night, according to Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who is overseeing response efforts in Dallas. ""Thankfully they are all asymptomatic, and it looks like none of them will get Ebola,"" Jenkins said, expressing hope that they would be welcomed home with no issues. ""The community needs to reach out and envelop them in compassion and acceptance because we cannot have the community stigmatizing people. ... They have been through a terrible ordeal."" As for the other 75 people, they are in Day 11 of 21 since Duncan's death and Jenkins said, ""Today is a crucial day for them because is one of the last high-likelihood days that we will see more cases."" The cruise ship incident and a second travel scare came about in a bureaucratic loophole. In an abundance of caution to avoid any possible spread of the Ebola virus, about 50 people associated with Texas Health Presbyterian have signed a document legally restricting where they can go until they are cleared of Ebola. But before the voluntary travel ban existed, the lab supervisor and a nurse, who later came down with Ebola, went on trips and triggered hefty responses. The lab worker had had no direct contact with Duncan but may have handled one of his lab specimens. A doctor on board the ship observed her to make sure she was symptom-free as the incubation period within which the disease would manifest itself approached its end. The other travel scare was set off by one of the nurses who contracted Ebola after treating Duncan. Before her illness was apparent, Amber Vinson took a Frontier Airlines flight to Cleveland, then a flight back to Dallas. There were 132 people on Vinson's flight. After her contagion became known, the air carrier reached out to some 800 passengers out of an abundance of caution, advising them to contact the CDC. Frontier Airlines also took the plane out of service temporarily. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Sunday that he didn't know much about Vinson's condition, but he said Nina Pham, the other Dallas nurse who contracted the illness, was in fair condition and doing ""fine."" Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Hospital apologizes . On Sunday, Texas Health Presbyterian took out a full-page newspaper ad, once again offering an apology. The open letter from Texas Health Resources CEO Barclay Berdan appeared in the Sunday editions of the Dallas Morning News and Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ""As an institution, we made mistakes in handling this very difficult challenge,"" Berdan wrote. The hospital is analyzing the errors and will make changes, he said. The turmoil started in September, when Duncan went to the hospital with Ebola symptoms, and health care workers initially sent him home with antibiotics. They recorded his travel history to West Africa, where a raging Ebola outbreak has killed more than 4,500 people. But they didn't give that detail the necessary attention, the hospital said.

"Cambodia (CNN) -- For Nev Broadis, it's important to act fast when a call comes to rescue a bear cub from the other side of Cambodia. ""There's a vulnerable animal in distress up to nine or 10 hours away, so there's a sense of urgency to get there as soon as possible,"" says Broadis, the regional director of Australian non-profit Free the Bears. ""You put emotions on hold and start mobilizing -- readying equipment, cages, everything we might need."" Free the Bears has been in Cambodia 17 years and in that time has rescued 182 bears, an average of nearly one a month. Some come from private residences, others from wildlife traffickers or even garment factories. The condition in which they find them ""is extremely variable."" ""We had cubs come in [in August] that were just one week old, and they are now doing very well, considering,"" he says, referring to twin sun bear cubs nicknamed ""Jammy"" and ""Donut."" ""Then recently we had one bear arrive in such bad condition that it died as soon as we moved it from the crate and onto the operating table -- even though we had five emergency vets there."" Rescuing Number 182 . The bear they raced off to rescue from the Samlaut district near the Thai border in western Cambodia was a five-month-old endangered moon bear. Known by his processing tag as Rescue Number 182, the male cub was in reasonable shape despite being somewhat malnourished and carrying an injury thought to have been inflicted by a snare. ""When the hunters came along to check the snare, the mum would have left and the hunters would have taken the bear cub,"" says Broadis, as he works to pacify the stressed animal with clucking sounds to imitate its absent mother. ""But there's no sign of any wound or any blood now. It's healed over very nicely actually."" Broadis says most animals arriving at Free the Bears' sanctuary outside the capital Phnom Penh are cubs, some of which were intercepted while being trafficked to so-called ""bear farms"" in neighboring Vietnam and Laos, where they are caged and their bile extracted in a painful process. Bear bile is a source of Ursodeoxycholic acid, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat everything from gallstones to muscle aches. Excess stock is used in toothpaste and shampoo. It's estimated that 13,000 bears are currently held captive in bear bile farms across Asia. Broadis reckons that would likely have been this young bear's fate. Joint Effort . Although on this occasion Free the Bears fetched the cub, that work more often falls on the shoulders of the country's Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team (WRRT), a counter-trafficking program whose operations are supported by U.S. non-profit Wildlife Alliance. The WRRT, which is comprised of government officials, military police and Wildlife Alliance staff, operates a hotline for members of the public to report the illegal trade in wildlife. It also inspects markets, restaurants and border crossings and runs a network of informants. In the most recent quarter, the WRRT carried out more than 60 operations confiscating hundreds of trafficked animals, among them two moon bears and dozens of macaques. The bears were taken to the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center, a 2,300-hectare government-owned facility south of Phnom Penh, where they joined more than 130 bears currently under Free the Bears' care. WRRT's proactive approach was lauded recently by wildlife monitoring group TRAFFIC in a report that assessed more than a decade of Asia's trade of live bears and of bear parts such as paws, meat and bile. TRAFFIC says Cambodia led 16 other Asian nations in the number of seizures: 190 in total, of which 156 were live bears. By comparison, Russia, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos and India managed just 189 seizures between them. TRAFFIC's data shows more than 2,800 bears were trafficked in Asia between 2000 and 2011, but says the true number was far higher. And it warns that three of the four bears unique to Asia in the Ursidae family -- sun bears, moon bears and sloth bears -- face ""illegal and unsustainable hunting for trade."" Chris Shepherd, TRAFFIC's regional director for South-East Asia, says the trade ""is huge [and] it's threatening the native bear species."" The problem is compounded by widespread government inaction. ""Enforcement in a number of places, especially in a number of major trade centers, is really lacking, if it exists at all,"" says Shepherd, adding that the solution lies in large part in better enforcement, education efforts and raising public awareness -- something that non-profits such as Animals Asia and Free the Bears also undertake. ""When it comes to bears [Cambodia is] definitely doing more than most -- I mean it's not perfect but it definitely is a model that's getting results,"" he says. A new home . It was early evening when Broadis and his team arrived back at Phnom Tamao, handing over Rescue Number 182 to Free the Bears' quarantine center manager Kem Sun Heng. Broadis says that on the way out of Samlaut, a place of subsistence farming and red earth roads in the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains, he was struck by the fact that villagers were not surprised to see a bear on the back of a pick-up. That implies trafficking remains common, he says, ""and that's sad."" Getting Rescue Number 182 back safely after 850 kilometers of appalling roads, on the other hand, was a relief, partly because the team knows ""it's one less bear going to its death"" at a bear bile facility. ""There aren't many moon bears left in the wild; they've been heavily trafficked to neighboring countries and their population has been decimated,"" he says. ""So when we talk about losing an individual, that's important for that particular species too, whether it's a moon bear or a sun bear."" As Number 182 was coaxed into his den, the center's two smallest arrivals were snoozing in a nearby room after a meal of milk. Twin sun bear cubs ""Jammy"" and ""Donut"" were just days old when villagers' dogs scared off their mother from her nest in Cambodia's remote north-east. Taking care of the endangered bears is a huge challenge not least because while young they remain vulnerable to infections. But under Heng's expert care, and three-hourly feeding sessions, the sisters are getting heavier: they are now eight weeks old and weigh more than four pounds apiece. ""They are good,"" says Heng during one feeding session. ""They are growing well, they are healthy, they are eating well and they are very playful."" For his part, Number 182 will spend the coming weeks alone in his den undergoing a battery of health checks to ensure he doesn't introduce diseases to the rest of the bear population. Eventually he will be released into a large enclosure with other rescued moon bears. ""We've put some branches in there and he's got a hammock and he's got two guys who are going to look after him, so he'll be fine,"" says Broadis. ""The future's looking bright for this little cub.""","Rescuers from Free the Bears rescue caged bears across Cambodia .

"Washington (CNN) -- The black-robed figure stares straight ahead, stalwart and silent, his head nodding appreciatively. He carries a big stick, which happens to have an American flag attached. And the man proudly stands on a toy truck and a pair of pizza boxes. Say hello to the Justice Clarence Thomas Annotated Bobblehead, about the closest thing a member of the Supreme Court gets to collectible immortality. The sought-after doll -- it's OK to call them dolls -- is the latest release in a pantheon of justices past and present honored in cold-cast ceramic. ""We have fun doing this, but it is a respectful project,"" said Ross Davies, a law professor at George Mason University in Virginia and the creator of the series. ""The rule of the bobblehead toy is that it's not a joke. There's a lesson here. We're trying, in some way, to portray the important work of the court."" The 6-inch limited edition figures originated eight years ago with then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Davies arranged to have the bobblehead just appear on his desk blotter one morning. Court sources say the chief justice loved it so much, he kept it in his office. Seven other current or recent justices have since been immortalized in pop culture history. The Thomas doll will be released in the fall, tied to the 20th anniversary of his service on the high court. It is not sold in stores, available only to subscribers of Davies' engaging law journal The Green Bag (www.greenbag.org). Other legal aid groups also have been provided free copies, for nonprofit fundraising and promotion. They have become real collectors items for the small but influential constitutional and appellate law community. Former law clerks of the honored justices in particular have been known to use all influence possible to secure the keepsake. ""We make them for the joy of it, and then we give them away,"" Davies said. Thomas is portrayed with the meticulous care that emphasizes his particular jurisprudence. In the 63-year-old justice's case, it's his views on federalism, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted today as the founders had envisioned, rejecting calls by some progressives that the document should be considered in the current ever-changing social and political context. The flag Thomas is holding refers to a concurrence in a 2004 case over whether the Pledge of Allegiance should be recited by children in public schools. The jackknifed blue truck refers to a 1995 opinion written by Thomas dealing with whether individual lawsuits in state courts against a company over a pair of serious accidents would interfere with existing federal law. And the pizza box was inspired by his famous quote on a case over whether cable firms had to open their lines to high-speed Internet competition. ""One can pick up a pizza rather than having it delivered, and one can own a dog without buying a leash,"" Thomas wrote in 2005. ""By contrast, the (Federal Communications) Commission reasonably concluded, a consumer cannot purchase Internet service without also purchasing a connection to the Internet."" ""The hard part when designing the bobbleheads is to visually depict the court and its work,"" said Steve McAllister, a University of Kansas Law School professor who collaborated on the design. ""The court is so serious -- big cases and controversial decisions. This is a more light-hearted approach, a way to illustrate their work in a fun but intellectually thoughtful way."" McAllister also clerked for Thomas in his first year on the court in 1991. Court sources say the justice was especially impressed and amused with his image and the highlighted jurisprudence. Unlike the mass-produced bobbleheads, each justice is personally presented with just one of two handmade versions of their head-swiveling likeness. Next up for bobblefication is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, perhaps next year. But at least one other member of the court has received the pop memorabilia treatment: Sonia Sotomayor was the subject of a comic book last year -- ""Female Force"" -- chronicling her pioneering work as the nation's first Latina justice. Sadly, she was portrayed wearing her robe rather than a cape with a Superwoman-like ""S"" on it. Justices go on business trips too . Italy. Austria. Canada. Switzerland. Resorts in Lake Tahoe and Geneva. Summer means quiet days at the Supreme Court as the justices enjoy their nearly three-month recess. But away from the bench, few have time to laze around the house on a ""stay-cation."" Travel plans will take most of the court around the world on separate teaching and speaking stints. Justice Antonin Scalia may be the busiest. He will conduct several classes this month in the Swiss Alps at the Geneva Institute in Transnational Law, co-sponsored by Duke University. In September, he does the same for a Federalist Society seminar on ""Separation of Powers"" at a fancy resort in California's Sierra Nevada. Scalia and colleague Justice Samuel Alito will lead separate study-abroad stints in Rome for law students. Italy seems to be a popular destination. Chief Justice John Roberts conducts a law class in Florence, sponsored by Penn State University. And in neighboring Austria, Justice Anthony Kennedy continues his annual summer teaching symposium in quaint Salzburg. Justice Stephen Breyer will also rack up many air miles. He also goes to Toronto and Vermont for speeches and then to Fargo, North Dakota, where he'll dedicate a new high school.

"Washington (CNN) -- Just a day before voters head to the polls, the New Hampshire Senate race is anyone's guess with the two candidates locked in a dead heat according to two new polls. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen edges out Republican challenger Scott Brown in a WMUR poll out Sunday while Brown is barely ahead of Shaheen by a one point margin in a New England College poll also out Sunday. Both results amount to a statistical tie with both leads within the polls' margin of error. The last word from the WMUR poll of 757 likely voters calls the race at 47% for Shaheen to Brown's 45% -- but 6% of voters say they remain undecided. The New England College poll of 1,526 likely voters gives Brown the race 49% to 48%, but says just 2% of voters are undecided. The race has tightened since the summer when Brown consistently trailed his opponent in every major nonpartisan poll. Brown has effectively closed the gap and his campaign has worked hard since the summer to tarnish Shaheen's independent brand by tying her to President Barack Obama, who pulls a 37% approval rating among the state's likely voters, according to the WMUR poll. Brown has also run several ads playing up the Ebola crisis and the threat from ISIS, saying in a September ad, ""President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the threat, not me."" While the race has tightened in Brown's favor, a larger share of voters' polled by WMUR said they believe Shaheen is most likely to pull through with a win -- 55% of respondents said Shaheen would triumph compared to 49% in October. Shaheen, meanwhile, who has served as both governor and senator in New Hampshire has touted her in-state credentials while branding Brown as an outsider. Brown served nearly three years representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate before moving to New Hampshire after losing his bid for reelection.","Two polls released Sunday showed the New Hampshire senate race a dead heat .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- The exchange of name cards has long been a ubiquitous part of meeting new people in China. But now it's increasingly likely to be accompanied by the frenzied flourishing of smartphones, as the participants add one another on WeChat, the phenomenally popular instant-messaging app made by the country's biggest Internet company, Tencent. While name cards have yet to be completely supplanted, many now also have a QR code which, when scanned into a mobile phone, adds the card's bearer as a WeChat contact. The popular function is one reason behind the rise of WeChat -- called Weixin in Chinese -- which is unseating the Twitter-like microblogging platform Sina Weibo as China's dominant social media. Once a lively forum for public debate that for a time wrong-footed Chinese censors, users are ditching Weibo as tightened government oversight takes its toll. WeChat's greater privacy and wider range of applications make it more attractive to users. Abandoning Weibo . Ye Jun, a 26-year-old project manager in Shanghai, started using WeChat when she upgraded to an iPhone last May. By that time, most of her friends were already using the service, although she still preferred Weibo. That changed in November, when she caught the bouquet at a friend's wedding, and posted pictures of the event on her WeChat activity timeline which, like Facebook, allows users to share photos and status updates with their contacts. ""There were instant comments from my friends. It was fun. I realized that WeChat was a better, more effective social networking tool than Weibo, which has been practically abandoned by most people."" The rise of WeChat . WeChat was launched in early 2011, attracting 100 million registered users in its first 15 months. This was in part due to Tencent's ability to promote the app to its huge base of over 800 million users of its many other services, including QQ, its desktop instant messaging client. Tencent has also been quick in rolling out new versions of the app, adding features such as mobile payment, e-commerce integration, games, marketing accounts for brands, a taxi-hailing function and an online investment fund. Many were quick to gain traction in the day-to-day lives of users. A function that allowed people to give and receive digital versions of Lunar New Year red envelopes saw 20 million exchanged. As of last September, when Tencent's most recent figures were released, WeChat had 271.9 million active monthly users, up 124% from the previous year. Dodging state censorship . There are growing indications that Weibo, once a hotbed of public discussion, from celebrity scandals to holding corrupt officials to account, is losing its appeal. The collision of two high-speed trains near the Eastern city of Wenzhou in 2011 was a watershed moment, seeing harried Internet censors play whack-a-mole with comments by Weibo users, who were critical of the government's handling of the aftermath. Over the next year, the government tightened its grip. Measures included requiring that accounts be registered under real names, and that those posting ""rumors"" be suspended. According to a report by researchers at East China Normal University commissioned by the UK's Telegraph newspaper, a significant drop in active usage came after venture capitalist and high-profile Weibo user Charles Xue was arrested for soliciting prostitutes. He was paraded on state television, and confessed to spreading irresponsible messages online. In addition, a report by the China Internet Network Information Center backs the findings of East China Normal University, claiming the number of microblog users, which includes Sina Weibo and similar services, dropped by over 27.8 million last year. According to Sina's latest figures, Weibo's daily active users are still growing, albeit slowly, with a 4.2% rise in the fourth quarter. The company says third-party claims of a drop in active users are flawed, and chairman and CEO, Charles Chao said during a recent earnings call that the average time users spent on Weibo did not change over the third quarter of 2013. Sina seems to be pushing ahead with the long-awaited spin-off and IPO of Weibo, with reports that it recently enlisted Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to underwrite an offering of up to $500 million in New York sometime in the second quarter for a share of up to 25%. Will one replace the other? The greater control WeChat offers over information sharing looks like one of the factors that makes it appeal more to users. Posts made to Weibo are public, and therefore can go viral in a very short time, while posts made to WeChat timelines are shared only with contacts, and there is no easy way to forward them. Mark Englehart Evans, digital strategist and co-founder of Techyizu, a technology and entrepreneurship community in Shanghai, says this means the two platforms are not necessarily mutually exclusive, although a change does seem to be underway. ""Much like Facebook versus Twitter, there seem to be more than enough dual users, or at least people with both apps on their phones. (But) monthly active users have certainly shifted. I know my Weibo app has gotten dusty,"" says Evans. This shift is palpable when speaking to Chinese social media users. ""It is very obvious that fewer people are using Weibo, because I get less feedback when I tweet and retweet,"" says Duan Wuning, a 29-year-old media professional. ""WeChat status updates are private, so my friends and I prefer to post things about our daily lives there. I have to check WeChat every day to make sure I don't miss important things."" Going global . As Facebook announces its $19 billion acquisition of WeChat competitor Whatsapp, the the question of WeChat's potential for international expansion has come to the fore. Tencent still faces huge challenges in going global. Its functionality could be appealing to users but questions remain over what marketing approach the company will take for a product that already boasts a 100 million-strong user base abroad. ""This will be new for Tencent and very expensive,"" says Evans. ""It will be interesting to see how hard Tencent is willing to spend to win new users outside of China, and if they can scale up all its advanced features such as mobile commerce and banking to other markets.""","Tencent's WeChat, also known as Weixin, is on the rise .

"(CNN) -- A fire erupted Friday at the headquarters of the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorial to United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed on September 11, 2001, officials said. ""There is a potential for 9/11 memorabilia loss due to a fire,"" according to a statement from the National Park Service, but the extent of the damage is not known yet. NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said 10% of the archives and museum collection was stored in the damaged buildings, but much of it was kept in a fireproof safe. Among the items in the damaged buildings was a U.S. flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol on the day of the terrorist attack. The flag was given to the Flight 93 National Memorial last September 11. Its status was not known. Four buildings were damaged, the park service said. Heavy rain helped the firefighting efforts. Seven fire companies responded to the blaze, which started about 3 p.m., said Geraldine Budzina, a Somerset County dispatcher. No injuries were reported. ""I think stuff has been lost"" Ken Nacke, whose brother Louis was on Flight 93, said many 9/11 artifacts -- including notes and other mementos left at a temporary memorial at the crash site -- were being stored in the area where the fire burned. He said he had spoken Friday with the head of Families of Flight 93 shortly after the group president was contacted by the memorial's superintendent. ""I think stuff has been lost,"" Nacke said. ""I just don't know what has been lost. I know the layout of the buildings and I wouldn't be surprised. It's heartbreaking that we spent all this time to have this happen. All the blood sweat and tears that went into building this."" Nacke helped raise funds for the Flight 93 National Memorial and advised in its planning. ""At the temporary memorial, people would leave cards, T-shirts and handmade stuff that was very comforting to us,"" he said. ""That's why it's heartbreaking. I hope none of this stuff is lost."" Cause of fire is unknown . Clouds of dark smoke could be seen billowing into the blue sky over the grounds Friday afternoon on a live webcam. ""We are deeply saddened to learn that a fire occurred at the Flight 93 National Memorial headquarters,"" Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93 said in a statement. ""We understand that no one was injured, and we are grateful for that."" ""Neither the memorial proper nor the new visitor center currently under construction were affected, as the headquarters is located approximately two miles from those sites,"" Litterst said. Initial reports were of extensive damage to the complex, Litterst said. All employees and volunteers were safely evacuated. The cause of the blaze is under investigation, he said. 40 people died in the plane crash . The memorial park is dedicated to the 40 passengers and crew who died when Flight 93 crashed outside the town in southwestern Pennsylvania. The plane went down, killing all on board, as passengers fought back against the hijackers, according to investigations. The memorial, still incomplete, includes a visitor center with traditional and interactive exhibits, public programs and information about the history of Flight 93. United Airlines Flight 93 was traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco when hijackers took over the plane, according to the 9/11 Commission. Investigators said the terrorists were most likely trying to turn the airplane toward Washington to hit a major political target. The 2,200-acre memorial park is managed by the National Park Service. The second phase of construction is to be completed by 2015. Since 2001, more than 1 million people from around the world have visited the crash site.

"(CNN) -- Can we predict the future of medicine? Although designer babies and a disease-free world may or may not come to pass, you can get a glimpse of the most promising and upcoming medical innovations each year, via the Cleveland Clinic. The clinic's Top 10 Medical Innovations list, which has been an annual undertaking since 2007, contains treatments and technologies that are expected to significantly change patient care and save lives. To be considered, each innovation must have a good chance of being available to the public in the upcoming year, says Dr. Michael Roizen, chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic and chairman of the committee that decides the list. The committee must also expect it to have a significant impact on a large part of the population. The process starts with a panel of Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists who submit their ideas. These suggestions, which Roizen said totaled about 700 for the 2015 list, are then narrowed down and voted on by 40 physicians in a variety of health fields. Here's what they selected for 2015: . 1. Mobile stroke unit . Videoconferencing has made its way into ambulances, specifically for treating stroke victims on the go. Hospital stroke neurologists can interpret symptoms via a broadband video link and instruct an onboard paramedic, critical care nurse and CT technologist on treatment. This new technology should improve the speed of medical care, which is important as strokes quickly damage and kill brain cells. 2. Dengue fever vaccine . The World Health Organization reports that about half of the world's population is now at risk for dengue fever, which up until now was preventable only by avoiding mosquito bites. The disease is a leading cause of death and illness in children in some countries. A new vaccine has been developed and tested, and is expected to be available in 2015. 3. Painless blood testing . For those who hate large needles, a nearly painless way to sample blood will be a welcome relief. Plus, it will be cheaper and provide faster results than today's blood test. The new technology takes blood from your fingertip, and the Cleveland Clinic reports that over 100 tests can be performed on just one drop of blood. 4. New way to lower cholesterol . New self-injectable drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors have shown to be very effective in lowering cholesterol. These drugs may prove to be helpful for people with high LDL cholesterol who don't have good results with statins. The FDA is expected to approve the first PCSK9 in 2015. 5 ways to lower cholesterol . 5. Cancer drug that doesn't harm healthy tissue . Although chemotherapy can save lives, it can be hard on the body and attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones. A welcome breakthrough in the world of cancer treatment, antibody-drug conjugates can deliver targeted treatment without damaging healthy tissue. 6. Immune booster for cancer patients . Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to prevent cancer cells from ""hiding"" from the immune system, allowing the body to more effectively fight these abnormal cells. Combined with chemotherapy and radiation treatment, the drugs have shown significant, long-term cancer remissions for patients with metastatic melanoma, one of the most deadly forms of cancer. 7. Wireless cardiac pacemaker . Until this point, wires have been a necessary component in pacemakers. A new wireless pacemaker about the size of a vitamin can now be implanted in the heart without surgery. Its lithium-ion battery is estimated to last about seven years. 8. New medications for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that causes scarring in the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties and a shortage of oxygen in the brain and other organs. Life expectancy is only three to five years after diagnosis, but those numbers may change now that the FDA has approved two experimental drugs that slow the disease: pirfenidone and nintedanib. 9. Single-dose radiation therapy for breast cancer . The National Cancer Institute estimates that 40,000 women in the United States will die from breast cancer in 2014. The Cleveland Clinic cites multiple chemotherapy appointments, sometimes requiring the patient to travel long distances, as a hindrance to successful treatment. Intraoperative radiation therapy is a new solution. It treats a breast cancer tumor during surgery in a single dose, reducing time and cost spent on treatment. What you should know about reducing your risk of breast cancer . 10. New drug for heart failure . About 5.1 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It is managed with a combination of drugs, but a new drug, angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor, has been granted fast-track status by the FDA because of its ability to cut the risk of dying from heart failure more effectively than current treatments.

A ""where is it now"" feature also includes updates on innovations that made the top 10 list in prior years. ""We look in past to see what we voted on to improve the process,"" Roizen said.

"(CNN) -- Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier died of a heart attack in Port-au-Prince at the age of 63, a family member told CNN Saturday. Known by his nickname ""Baby Doc,"" the so-called ""President for life"" actually fled Haiti in 1986 and stunned Haiti when he returned 25 years later. He was charged with human rights crimes within days of his return, but he successfully argued in court that the statute of limitations had expired on charges that included torture, rape and extrajudicial killings. Human rights groups decried the court ruling that spared Duvalier. In February, a Haitian appeals court ruled that the lower court was wrong and that there is no statute of limitations for human rights violations. The ruling reopened the possibility that Duvalier could face such charges, but he died before a judicial investigation decided whether to pursue the charges. Duvalier inherited the title of ""President for life"" in 1971 upon the death of his father, Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier, who had ruled with an iron fist through his paramilitary force, the Tonton Macoute. Just 19 years old when he came to power, Baby Doc became one of the world's youngest heads of state. Haitians initially celebrated his ascension, thinking the young man would be less oppressive than his father, but that didn't turn out to be the case. Duvalier used his father's security apparatus to continue ruling in a totalitarian fashion. Fast facts on Duvalier . His 15 years of rule were a time of repression in Haiti that included the torture of opponents and the taking of political prisoners. In addition, there were allegations that ""Baby Doc"" embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International had documented what they call systematic human rights violations under Duvalier's rule. Both organizations accuse Duvalier of imprisoning and torturing hundreds of Haitians, including journalists, and using violent means to silence voices of opposition. 2012: Human rights groups denounce Duvalier decision . Amnesty gave the public prosecutor in the Duvalier case 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations. Amnesty International's documents told the experiences of cobblers, taxi drivers, filmmakers, mechanics, distillers and even hairdressers, all of whom, they say, were arrested for anti-government activity.

"(CNN) -- Houston may be a city built on the profits of oil and gas, but it has a green dream. The dream is to create a city that is ""more liveable, walkable and bikeable,"" according Laura Spanjian. Spanjian has been the director of sustainability for Houston since 2010, when current Mayor Annise Parker was elected. They have launched several sustainability initiatives under the ""Green Houston"" program and Parker says the city has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter. Spanjian's previous work includes a solar-panel incentive program in San Francisco, as well as directing the creation of its alternative-fuel bus fleet. She spoke with CNN's The City about the challenges Houston is facing and how she wants to get Houstonians out of their cars and out on the streets. CNN: Why is Houston trying to be more sustainable? Laura Spanjian: We are known as producing oil and gas, but we also produce other resources that are important to our economy and to the sustainability. For us it's about being green, but it's also about saving resources and money and being a very efficient and affordable city. The number one thing to think about is trying to improve the health and the quality of life of the citizens. CNN: Does Houston have any geographical advantages or disadvantages? LS: Houston is a very hot and humid city, so there's a lot of air conditioning which leads to buildings consuming a lot of energy. We want to work on an initiative trying to get people out of their cars and to use less energy in their homes. That can prove to be quite the challenge. An advantage we have is that we can make great use of the wind. Texas is the largest wind (power) producer in the U.S.; we now produce 12,000 megawatts of wind (power). CNN: If you had a magic wand, how would you use it for your work? LS: I would want every building to reduce their energy usage by 20% by 2020. I'd love that. I would also love more people to commute less to work, by living closer or by using alternative transportation. Houston is still very much a car city. CNN: Where does your passion for the environment come from? LS: I care about the quality of life; the air we breathe and the water we drink. I think it's really imperative for governments to create healthy cities so people can go out and do other great things. If you increase the health of citizens, it automatically makes cities more attractive, which in turn brings more people to cities, which improves the economy. A lot of people have told me that they came to Houston for a job, but stayed because the city is starting to focus on the quality of life. CNN: What difficulties have you encountered? LS: We have lots of issues with hurricanes but the thing we hadn't had an issue with before was droughts like the one we had two years ago. It definitely made us think about how we build infrastructure and how we can try to forecast and prepare for extreme weather events. We need to realize that it's not just going to be storms in the future. The climate can change on a dime. CNN: How far have you come in your work? LS: Right now we are experiencing a boom when it comes to transportation. Three more rail lines will open next year. We have also started planning for a bus rapid transit line, so we are encouraging the use of electric vehicles. CNN: What goals do you want to achieve by 2020? LS: We are going to see a more liveable, walkable and bikeable Houston, and a population that is craving that and nothing less. Reduced energy usage, increased transportation options and generally a greener city. Our streets will work differently. With density comes the desire for streets to look differently, to accommodate restaurants, bike lanes and be aesthetically pleasing at the same time. The more you change your streets and try to open them up, the more people are outside, so it's exciting!","Ambitious plans to make Houston a more sustainable city .

"(CNN) -- Of all the great films Mike Nichols made over his long career, one stands alone: ""The Graduate."" The 1967 film by Nichols, who died Wednesday, was pioneering in many ways. It captured the youthful zeitgeist through the eyes of Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate who's ""a little worried about his future,"" as the tagline went. It featured existing pop songs as part of the score, now commonplace but then unusual. And it had, at the time, a willfully experimental look, with jump cuts, long takes and odd camera angles. It changed Hollywood, said Mark Harris, author of ""Pictures at a Revolution."" ""By the time 'The Graduate' was at the end of its run, it was the third highest-grossing movie in history,"" he told CNN in 2008. ""Those are the kinds of numbers that make even hidebound executives say, 'We're in a new world.' "" Thanks to the script by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, ""The Graduate"" also had some of the most quotable lines and indelible scenes in movie history. Here are five standouts: . ""Plastics."" A squirmy Benjamin makes his way through a welcome-home party, wanting more than anything to avoid everybody glad-handing him. Unfortunately, he comes into contact with Mr. McGuire, who has one word for Ben, ""just one word."" The line captured everything '60s youth disdained: a corporate job and artificiality. It was named No. 42 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest movie quotations. ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?"" Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, as family friend Mrs. Robinson, awkwardly chat in the Robinsons' lounge. As Mrs. Robinson makes advances -- ""What do you think of me?"" she asks -- Benjamin becomes more and more uncomfortable. ""Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so, this conversation is getting a little strange,"" he says. And that's just the beginning. Kissing Mrs. Robinson . As Ben and Mrs. Robinson begin their affair, the young Ben tries to impress the older woman. But his attempts at being suave go nowhere and he starts to lose his nerve. The portion of the scene in which Hoffman cups Bancroft's breast -- and then bangs his head against the wall -- was improvised, Hoffman observed. He was trying to hide his laughter and Nichols kept the camera rolling. ""The Sound of Silence"" The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack was originally just a placeholder. Nichols and editor Sam O'Steen used their songs, including ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"" and ""April Come She Will,"" to help structure the film. But Nichols liked the way they worked and decided to keep them (along with a score by Dave Grusin). ""The Sound of Silence"" is used three times in the film, probably most strikingly in this scene, where Ben wastes his days adrift in a swimming pool and his nights meeting with Mrs. Robinson. ""Elaine!"" The movie's finale finds Ben heading to a church to stop the marriage of Elaine Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's daughter, and her fiance. Delayed at every turn -- uncertain of directions, running out of gas, locked out of the church -- Ben finally lets cry a pained scream at his beloved. But, as the final shot reveals, even love can't defeat uncertainty.","""The Graduate,"" from 1967, is one of Mike Nichols' greatest films .

"Everett, Washington (CNN)  -- After more than two years of delays, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner made its maiden flight Tuesday in a three-hour trip that the maker described as a success. ""Today is truly a proud and historic day for the global team who has worked tirelessly to design and build the 787 Dreamliner -- the first all-new jet airplane of the 21st century,"" said Scott Fancher, vice president and general manager of the 787 program, in a news release. ""We look forward to the upcoming flight test program and soon bringing groundbreaking levels of efficiency, technology and passenger comfort to airlines and the flying public."" More than 12,000 employees and guests watched as the plane took off at 10:27 a.m. from Paine Field in Everett, Washington. It landed more than three hours later and about 40 miles away at Seattle, Washington's Boeing Field after having flown at a speed of 207 mph at 15,000 feet -- typical for a maiden flight, the company said. During their time aloft, the chief pilot and captain tested some of the airplane's systems and structures while flight data were transmitted electronically to engineers at Boeing Field. ""The flight marks the beginning of a flight test program that will see six airplanes flying nearly around the clock and around the globe, with the airplane's first delivery scheduled for fourth quarter 2010,"" Boeing's news release said. Boeing promises passengers ""a better flying experience"" that includes bigger windows, more luggage space and better lighting. It promises airline operators greater efficiency by burning 20 percent less fuel than current models of comparable size and by providing as much as 45 percent more space for cargo. So far, 55 customers have ordered 840 of the planes. The official price of one is $150 million. ""We think this is going to be a very efficient airplane,"" Jim Albaugh, Boeing executive vice president and CEO, told CNN. ""It's going to change the way people travel."" Despite the delays, Boeing's first new commercial airliner in more than a decade will still be relevant, Albaugh said Monday. ""It's more environmentally friendly, it's more efficient, uses less fuel, it's going to cost the operator less to fly, it's going to allow the passengers to pay less and feel better when they land,"" he said. Boeing's fuel claims are linked to its design. It is the first major airliner to be made mostly of composite materials and, as a result, is lighter. Depending on the configuration, the plane can seat 200 to 300 passengers and can travel more than 2,500 nautical miles. But production delays and technical problems have stolen some of the Dreamliner's luster. Many of the snags in the supply line have been blamed on the army of partners Boeing brought in to help with the construction. ""They did too much outsourcing, too soon, with too little oversight,"" said Scott Hamilton of the aviation consulting firm Leeham Co. ""The customers have been mightily [upset] over the creeping delays."" Albaugh acknowledged that, ""in hindsight,"" the level of outsourcing may not have been the best strategy. ""There a few things we might have kept inside, yes,"" he said. With 10 months of flight tests ahead, the 787s won't start flying commercially until at least 2011, the company said. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" Albaugh said.","NEW: 787 Dreamliner completes three-hour test flight .

"(CNN) -- A worldwide Jewish rights organization is pushing Hungarian authorities to prosecute a man it claims is a Nazi war criminal, recently discovered in Budapest, Hungary, who allegedly sent more than 15,000 Jews to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944. The Simon Wiesenthal Center found Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary as part of its ""Last Chance"" project, said Efraim Zuroff, director of the center's Israel office. The center cooperated with British tabloid The Sun to photograph Csizsik-Csatary, who reportedly is 97, and ask him questions, Zuroff said. ""We're the ones who found him; they're the ones who photographed him."" Csizsik-Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice, which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s, the center said. He topped the Wiesenthal Center's 2012 list of most wanted Nazi war criminals. ""He was a commander of a ghetto,"" Zuroff told CNN. Report: Hitler ordered reprieve for Jewish man . Csizsik-Csatary participated in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, witnesses have told the center. He also played a role in ""deportations to the Ukraine to be killed -- 300 Jews,"" Zuroff said. ""We found eyewitnesses on three different continents,"" Zuroff said. Those witnesses told the center about Csizsik-Csatary's cruelty to Jewish detainees and his role in the deportations to Auschwitz and Ukraine. Confronted by a Sun reporter, Csizsik-Csatary denied the allegations, the tabloid reported Sunday. A witness to the August 1941 Ukraine deportations had nine family members who were deported, he told CNN. Csizsik-Csatary made sure four of them were brought back from forced labor with the Hungarian army so they would be deported and killed, according to Zuroff. During the Auschwitz deportations, Csizsik-Csatary ""forced these girls to dig a ditch with their hands -- young Jewish girls."" Two of the center's witnesses were survivors of that deportation, he said. According to The Sun, which cited documents released by the Wiesenthal Center, Csizsik-Csatary beat Jewish women with a whip he carried on his belt. ""A variety of factors"" led to the center's locating Csizsik-Csatary in Budapest, Zuroff said. ""He wasn't hiding under a false name. ... He had no reason to fear."" Using the last name Csizsik, Csizsik-Csatary arrived in Canada in 1949, telling immigration officials he was Yugoslavian, according to The Toronto Star newspaper. A spokeswoman for Canada's Department of Justice, Carole Saindon, said Monday that ""It was alleged that when applying to immigrate to Canada, (Csizsik-Csatary) provided false information about his nationality, and failed to provide information concerning his collaboration with Nazi occupation forces while serving with the Royal Hungarian Police. It was further alleged that he participated in the internment and deportation of thousands of Hungarian Jews to concentration camps. As a result, the government of Canada revoked his citizenship on August 28, 1997. As deportation proceedings were under way, Csizsik-Csatary voluntarily left the country, Saindon said in an e-mail to CNN. In October 1997, Paul Vickery, head of the Canadian Justice Department's war crimes unit, told Radio Free Europe that when officials went to Csizsik-Csatary's Toronto home, his daughter told them he was living in Europe. Vickery told the network Csizsik-Csatary's name would be placed on a watch list and he would be barred from re-entering Canada. Csizsik-Csatary initially denied the allegations and asked the Canadian government to put the case on trial, but later withdrew that request, The Toronto Star reported in August 1997. ""In his statement of defense, Csizsik-Csatary admitted to some involvement in the ghettoization of Jews, to handing over at least two Jews to the Germans and to attending the last mass deportation of Jews out of Kassa (Hungary),"" the Star said. The Sun said in its Sunday report that Csizsik-Csatary's attorneys claimed he did not know where the Jews were being sent. Of the 12,000 Jews transferred from a ghetto to a brickyard and deported, only 450 survived, the Sun reported. Csizsik-Csatary returned to Hungary upon leaving Canada, Zuroff said. ""Hungarian authorities knew that he was back,"" he said. Authorities in Hungary launched an investigation in September 2011 after receiving information from Zuroff regarding Csizsik-Csatary's residence in Budapest and his role in the Auschwitz deportations, the center said. The Sun reported Sunday that when a reporter knocked on the door of Csizsik-Csatary's two-bedroom Budapest apartment and asked him if he could justify his past, ""He looked shocked and stammered, 'No, no. Go away.'"" Asked about the deportation case in Canada, the Sun said he replied, ""No, no, I don't want to discuss it."" The Sun reporter asked, ""Do you deny doing it? A lot of people died as a result of your actions,"" according to the report. Csizsik-Csatary replied, ""No, I didn't do it. Go away from here,"" and slammed the door, according to the newspaper. The Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement Sunday that Zuroff last week submitted new evidence to a Budapest prosecutor regarding Csizsik-Csatary and his ""key role in the deportation of approximately 300 Jews from Kosice to Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine, where almost all were murdered in the summer of 1941."" ""This new evidence strengthens the already very strong case against Csatary and reinforces our insistence that he be held accountable for his crimes,"" Zuroff said in the statement. ""The passage of time in no way diminishes his guilt and old age should not afford protection for Holocaust perpetrators."" Csizsik-Csatary reportedly was convicted of war crimes in absentia and sentenced to death in 1948 in the Czech Republic, Zuroff said, but the center has not obtained documentation on the case. CNN's Ben Brumfield and journalist Flora Hevesi contributed to this report.","The Simon Wiesenthal Center says it tracked down Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary .

"(CNN) -- An upcoming documentary on Kurt Cobain has more than just cooperation from the rock legend's family. It has the oversight of Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean, 22, as the project's executive producer. Called ""Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,"" the documentary is the first to have the backing of Cobain's relatives. As a result, the film had complete access to Cobain's archive of personal and creative works, some of which has never before been seen. Written, directed and produced by filmmaker Brett Morgen, ""Montage of Heck"" will be released by HBO in 2015. (HBO and CNN are both divisions of Time Warner.) For Morgen, the documentary has been a labor of love and a long-running passion project. ""I started work on this project eight years ago,"" the filmmaker said in a statement. ""Like most people, when I started, I figured there would be limited amounts of fresh material to unearth. However, once I stepped into Kurt's archive, I discovered over 200 hours of unreleased music and audio, a vast array of art projects (oil paintings, sculptures), countless hours of never-before-seen home movies, and over 4000 pages of writings that together help paint an intimate portrait of an artist who rarely revealed himself to the media."" Cobain was best known as the frontman of the seminal grunge group Nirvana, whose music came to define the early '90s and has remained heavily influential since. ""Montage of Heck"" will of course use plenty of the band's work throughout the film, including both songs and performances. Speaking of the project to NME in 2013, Morgen said he envisioned ""Montage of Heck"" being like ""this generation's 'The Wall' -- a mix of animation and live action that'll allow the audience to experience Kurt in a way they never have before.""","HBO to air Kurt Cobain documentary in 2015 .

"(CNN) -- If the local grand jury brings no charges against police Officer Darren Wilson in the case of Michael Brown's killing, street protests in Ferguson, Missouri, are inevitable. Demonstrators angry about Wilson's shooting of the unarmed black teenager in August already decry the grand jury's secrecy and ""lack of transparency."" But for those who believe that the grand jury procedure is some sort of cop and prosecutor conspiracy to trample the rights of minority citizens, a little background on this hallowed institution might be in order. Although prosecutors are often accused of controlling grand jury proceedings, the institution was actually created by the Founding Fathers to provide a wall of citizen protection against overzealous prosecutors. It is a section of the 5th Amendment of the Bill of Rights. The colonists were tired of their British overlords' abuse of law enforcement and were intent on making sure that ordinary citizens would have to approve indictments in any federal criminal case in the newly minted American democracy. The Founding Fathers agreed so thoroughly about the need for the buffer of the grand jury against law enforcement abuse that it was one of the least debated provisions of the U.S. Constitution. George Washington, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson would surely be mystified that requiring a citizen review and approval of a criminal indictment would be considered a violation of civil liberties, as some protesters in Ferguson might believe. In Missouri, bringing a case before a grand jury in a felony case is optional -- prosecutors could have chosen to conduct a probable cause hearing before a judge. Although this would be an open proceeding, a single judge would be making the decision about whether to permit an indictment against Wilson. The prosecutor here believed that a decision of this importance should be left to the collective judgment of the citizens of the St. Louis County grand jury, rather than a randomly selected judge whose motives could easily be attacked and questioned. Members of the public often find the workings of a grand jury mysterious. In most states, the grand jury sits for a month or more, hearing snippets of many cases each day. The cases are presented more as snapshots than feature-length presentations. The prosecutor generally streamlines the case to obtain an indictment, if that's what he or she wants, without revealing too much evidence, which would go in the transcript of the proceeding. This transcript will be turned over to defense attorneys and the prosecution has no desire to help the defense. Grand jurors have the right to ask for additional evidence and even to ask their own questions, but most rely on the prosecutor to present the evidence. It is for this reason that a former judge once said ""a prosecutor could get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich."" This is quite true, because the prosecutor often becomes a trusted friend to the members of the grand jury. A lot of cordial off-the-record remarks unrelated to the case are exchanged, as is normal in any place where people work together daily. I, as a prosecutor, can remember the click of knitting needles as a grandmotherly grand juror worked on a sweater while awaiting the presentation of the next murder case. ""Is this a good one, Mr. Callan?"" she would ask. My reply would be, ""You'll have to wait for the evidence."" Make no mistake though, grand jurors often rebel and proceed on their own independent course. This happens particularly in high-profile cases like this one. In such cases, a wise prosecutor will present as much evidence as possible, revealing both sides of the case. Knowing that the grand jury transcript may someday be released and scrutinized, he will seek to create a record that demonstrates fairness and objectivity in the presentation of the case. Let us hope that this has been done in St Louis. But as in ""Game of Thrones,"" the cops are perceived by most grand jurors as the sentries on the Wall, protecting law-abiding citizens from the forces of violence and disorder. The perception of minority groups from aggressively policed neighborhoods outside ""the Wall"" may be entirely different. But unlike ""Game of Thrones,"" the King can be removed by democratic vote and the sentries replaced. Street protests will not accomplish this, but voting will. In this country, the path to power proceeds through the ballot box rather than street demonstrations. Instead of attempting to dispense with the law of the grand jury and to seek unlawful conviction by mob sentiment, the most extreme demonstrators in Ferguson might be wise to remember the words of my favorite lawyer, Sir Thomas More, as recreated in the movie ""A Man for All Seasons."" More was the chancellor of the exchequer under Henry VIII who chose death rather than dishonor. In the scene where his daughter's suitor, Roper, suggests that it is proper to do anything, including tearing down all laws, to defeat the ""devil,"" Thomas replies: . ""Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, man's laws, not God's! ""And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!""","Paul Callan: Ferguson protests certain if grand jury fails to indict Officer Darren Wilson .
Callan: Protesters might want to skip grand jury process, but it's essential .
Callan: It's better that a citizens' panel handle this explosive case than a single judge .
He says change comes through voting rather than in street demonstrations ."
"(CNN) -- I was in the security line at an airport a few months ago when I watched a fellow passenger do something I'd never seen done before: He dissed the scan. ""I'd like to opt out,"" he said, as a security agent went scurrying for a male agent to give this man a full-body pat-down, the requirement for anyone who refuses to go through the full-body scanner. Wow, I thought, this man really must want to avoid the scanner if he's willing to get groped by a total stranger. The Transportation Security Administration says the so-called backscatter scans, which emit a small amount of radiation, are safe. ""Multiple independent studies have confirmed that the technology used to protect passengers when they fly is safe for their health,"" says TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball. ""TSA takes many precautions to regularly verify that all machines are operating properly."" Another type of airport scanner uses ""millimeter wave"" technology, which uses electromagnetic waves and has not raised the same level of public concerns as the backscatter scans. So why all the worry? In my obnoxious journalist way, I pounced on the guy to ask him why he'd done it. ""I'm a doctor at M.D. Anderson, and I don't want radiation if I can avoid it,"" he said. I was next in line. I'd just watched a doctor at M.D. Anderson, a top cancer hospital, opt out because he wanted to avoid radiation. Does that mean I should, too? I had a second to make a decision. I decided to opt out, too. The pat-down, I learned, is not such an easy option. First, you have to make a bit of a spectacle of yourself by publicly asking for something different. Secondly, it takes time (not a lot, but enough to be a problem if you're running late) and thirdly, I ended up being touched in places previously reserved for my husband and my gynecologist. I began to wonder if the doctor was being a little paranoid. Was the radiation so dangerous that it was worth the hassle and embarrassment? To get a little perspective, when I returned home I randomly asked doctors I respect what they do in the security line. It was a completely unscientific sampling, but it yielded this interesting result: All these doctors are smart people with access to the same scientific data, and yet made very different choices. Doctors who say ""yes"" to the scanners . I started, of course, with my colleague Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon, who told me he hasn't opted out thus far. Many other doctors feel the same way. ""I go through them,"" said Dr. Greg Zorman, chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Healthcare System in Florida. ""The amount of radiation you get isn't worth worrying about."" Dr. Drew Pinsky, an internist and host of a new show on HLN that makes its debut on April 4, called the amount of radiation ""inconsequential."" The radiation you get from a backscatter imaging machine used at many airports is the same amount of radiation you get from sitting on an airplane for two minutes, according to research released this week by the University of California San Francisco. The researchers calculated for every 100 million passengers who fly seven one-way flights a year, six of them could get cancer as a result of the radiation exposure from the full-body scans. The California researchers made these calculations based on information from the manufacturers. Some researchers question whether the manufacturers' measurements are valid. David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University, says he thinks the exposure to radiation is actually 10 times more than what the manufacturers claim. Even so, Brenner (who's a physicist, not a medical doctor) still goes through the scanners at airports because even by his calculations the amount of radiation is still small. Doctors who say ""no"" to the scanners . Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, takes a pat-down instead of going through a scanner when he travels. He says he's concerned about whether the machines are calibrated and inspected properly. ""USA Today did a piece on how badly TSA maintained their X-ray equipment for carryon bags, and this gave me little confidence,"" he wrote to me in an e-mail. Brawley's deputy concurs. ""I do whatever I can to avoid the scanner,"" Dr. Len Lichtenfeld wrote to me in an e-mail. He says as a frequent flier, he's concerned about the cumulative effect of the radiation. ""This is a total body scan -- not a dental or chest X-ray,"" he wrote to me. ""Total body radiation is not something I find very comforting based on my medical knowledge."" Lichtenfeld says it doesn't necessarily give him great comfort that the TSA says the scans are safe. ""I can still remember getting my feet radiated as a child when I went to the shoe store and they had a machine which could see how my foot fit in the new shoes,"" he says. ""We were told then that they were safe, and they were not."" (At first I thought Lichtenfeld was making this up, but you can actually see one of these foot scanners at the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices at the Science Museum of Minnesota.) Another doctor who opts for the pat-down is Dr. Dong Kim, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' neurosurgeon. ""There is really no absolutely safe dose of radiation,"" says Kim, chair of the department of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical School. ""Each exposure is additive, and there is no need to incur any extra radiation when there is an alternative."" This was echoed by several other physicians, including Dr. Andrew Weil. ""All radiation exposure adds to the cumulative total you've received over your lifetime,"" Weil wrote to me in an e-mail. ""Cancer risks correlate with that number, so no dose of radiation is too small to matter."" Doctors exposed to radiation at work are particularly sensitive to this issue, as I learned when I got through security that day in the airport and chased after the doctor who'd opted out. I learned his name is Dr. Karl Bilimoria, and he's a surgical oncology fellow at M.D. Anderson. He says this is a frequent topic of discussion among his colleagues. ""If we can avoid a little radiation in exchange for the two extra minutes needed for a pat-down, then we will,"" he says.","Seeing doctor decline airport full-body scan sparked correspondent's curiosity .
She asked other doctors randomly about whether they submit to ""backscatter"" scans .
TSA says multiple studies have shown that scanners' radiation levels are safe."
"(CNN) -- Never has the Supreme Court said so much when saying so little. When the justices refused to rule on gay marriage cases Monday, it directly cleared the way for the unions to become legal in five states -- Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. A sixth state, Colorado, began allowing same-sex marriages Tuesday morning, with the state's high court throwing out the last remaining legal obstacles in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision. And experts believe five other states -- North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, West Virginia, and Wyoming -- will soon follow. Add them all up and the likely bottom line appears: Same-sex marriage will be legal in 30 states in the near future, many believe. Those states represent more than half of the country and well over half the nation's population. And gay couples in those states will be able to wed legally. ""Now we are in a situation where 30 states have same-sex marriage,"" CNN legal analyst Jeffery Toobin said. ""When you have that many people living in a world where same-sex marriage is legal, (it) makes it inevitable, it seems, that the rest of the country will follow."" For now, though, there are 20 other states that aren't budging. Nearly all of them are in the Midwest and South. That's no surprise, as these swaths of the country have traditionally been socially conservative. Already, South Carolina's attorney general has said he will continue fighting to keep the state's ban in place. So, what's next in the gay marriage fight for those states? Same-sex marriage advocates say they plan to work both the statehouses and the courthouses there. Opinion: How Supreme Court's non-decision helps gay marriage . Politics and the personal . Gay conservatives are undertaking the most coordinated effort yet to change the Republican Party's position on same-sex marriage. Their approach: one state and one Republican activist at a time. The official stance of the Republican Party is that ""the union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard,"" but same-sex marriage advocates within the GOP want it removed, making the language neutral. Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry, a nonpartisan advocacy group, say the stance will soon no longer represent an evolving Republican Party, citing a New York Times public opinion poll that shows 40% of Republicans -- and 56% of Republicans under age 45 -- support same-sex marriage. The GOP and gay politics . There was a joyous reaction from gay couples who immediately sought marriage licenses in Wisconsin while the conservative organization, Wisconsin Family Action, denounced the Supreme Court's move. ""The truth is no court, by any action or inaction, can redefine marriage,"" said president Julaine Appling. ""Federal courts have been arrogantly ignoring this reality. That said, from a legal standpoint, the court taking a pass on these cases means the legal battle for marriage continues in our country."" In Colorado, clerks in two counties issued same-sex marriage licenses just hours after the Supreme Court declined to hear the cases on Monday, the Denver Post reported. Michelle Alfredsen told the Post she was ecstatic about being able to marry her girlfriend Wendy. ""I'm officially Mrs. Alfredsen,"" she told the newspaper. ""We are basking in this moment and celebrating that our children will not have to take on this fight."" The next day, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers ordered clerks in all 64 of the state's counties to issue same-sex licenses to couples who request them. ""There are no remaining legal requirements that prevent same-sex couples from legally marrying in Colorado,"" Suthers said. The jurisdictional front . Advocates of gay marriage have been riding a hot streak, but how long will it last? Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond, believes it's likely that the winning streak may end somewhere on the appellate level. While district judges function more independently, appeals court judges ""tend to be more ideological,"" Tobias notes, and thus it's more likely they cumulatively will express opinions on both sides of the debate. That said, whatever these appeals courts decide might be moot. Experts say this fast-moving wave of decisions will ultimately climax where it began, on the nation's top court -- with so-called ""swing"" justice Anthony Kennedy most likely siding with the winner on the deeply divided court. If you ask University of California, Berkeley, law professor Jesse Choper, there's only one way to put the issue to rest. ""This will only authoritatively be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court,"" he said. By the numbers: Same-sex marriage . In states where marriage licenses are already being issued, there are legal complications to work out. For instance, in Utah, state lawmaker Kraig Powell, a Republican, has started a bill to work on language in state codes governing marriage. The chapter that addresses marriage is titled ""Husband and Wife"" -- that has to be changed, Powell said, according to the Salt Lake Tribute. Back to the Supremes . Toobin, too, sees circumstances where the Supreme Court might need to weigh in, because the tally of states where gay marriage is legal is actually 24, not 30. The reality is, despite what experts believe, justices have not yet ruled -- or refused to rule -- on the same-sex marriage bans in those six states. ""The one thing we know for sure is that there will not be a 50-state ruling (that) same-sex marriage is required in every state in the union,"" Toobin said. ""What is complicated and, frankly, somewhat mysterious, is what happens now in the states where the lower courts have said, 'Under our interpretation of the Constitution, we believe there is a right to same-sex marriage.'"" Ultimately, that could prompt the Supreme Court to tackle this thorny issue the next time it comes around. Will same-sex marriage become a 2014 issue?","NEW: Colorado attorney general orders counties to issue same-sex marriage licenses Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Another gruesome video. Another beheading of a Western captive by ISIS. And another family warned that its loved one may be next. For Alan Henning's family, the nightmare has turned into reality. Now Abdul-Rahman Kassig's family is hoping for a miracle. Both Henning and Kassig risked their lives to help strangers besieged by the Syrian civil war. Over the weekend, hundreds of people attended a service in Manchester, England, to remember Henning. And Sunday night, Kassig's parents issued another plea for their son. Here are the stories of the aid workers snatched by militants bent on using them as political pawns: . Henning: A 'national hero' Not even the calls of 200 mosques in Britain were enough to stop radical militants from decapitating Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from near Manchester. ""Alan Henning was our local and national hero,"" a joint statement from the mosques said. ""We will remember him as a tireless and selfless volunteer aid worker whose only concern was to help people in need."" The mosques also slammed the terror group who took him. ""The killing of Alan Henning was a cowardly and criminal act of appalling brutality by a group who do not represent Islam at all and in fact are an insult to the Islamic faith,"" their statement said. Henning joined a group of volunteers who traveled to Syria in December 2013 to deliver food, water and medical supplies to people afflicted by the country's devastating civil war. He was abducted by masked gunmen the day after Christmas, other people in the aid convoy said. His wife, Barbara, pleaded for her husband's release, but to no avail. ISIS released the video of Henning's decapitation on Friday. It said the killing was a response to the UK joining the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the group in Iraq and Syria. Some of Henning's fellow aid workers believe the British Parliament's decision to authorize bombing ISIS in Iraq may have triggered their friend's slaughter. ""By joining the U.S. airstrikes, we handed Alan, and many other Western hostages, a death sentence,"" aid worker Dr. Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar said. But British Prime Minister David Cameron said the ""abhorrent"" killing of Henning means allies must continue trying to ""do everything we can to defeat this organization."" And as it did in the beheading videos of American freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines, ISIS threatened to decapitate another Westerner.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli security forces said Thursday they have broken up a wide-ranging terror plot, which would have included attacks on a football stadium, abductions and car bombings. Authorities arrested at least 30 members of Palestinian militant group Hamas and seized rifles, ammunition and explosives, said the Shin Bet, the country's security agency. The terror cells were getting orders from Hamas leaders in Turkey, while the operatives got their training outside Israel and were then smuggled back in to carry out the attacks, the Shin Bet said. The arrests were made in September after explosive devices were detonated on August 31 in the West Bank, leading to a full investigation. Among the targets selected were the Teddy football stadium and a light rail station in Jerusalem, the Shin Bet said. There were also plans to carry out attacks and abductions in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, it said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Shin Bet and Israel Defense Forces ""for foiling very dangerous terrorist actions that could have claimed many victims in our country.""

"(CNN) -- After an hours-long search on Wednesday, former model and celebrated restaurateur B. Smith has been found. The 65-year-old, who has Alzheimer's disease, was last seen taking a jitney from New York to the Hamptons on Tuesday, reports CNN affliate WABC. When she didn't show up at her destination, Smith's husband, Dan Gasby, reported her missing and asked the public for help. By Wednesday afternoon, Smith was found by her daughter at a restaurant in New York City, not far from a former residence, WABC reports. It appears that Smith got off the jitney at the wrong stop, and then returned to New York. Smith's husband told the news station that his wife had never gotten lost before. The groundbreaking talent, who in 1976 became one of the first African-American women to land the cover of Mademoiselle magazine, opened up to CBS' ""Sunday Morning"" in June about being diagnosed with Alzheimer's. ""It feels like crying,"" Smith said of the diagnosis. ""Things like that make me very sad."" Still, ""even with Alzheimer's, I think that things are gonna work out,"" Smith continued. ""I'm gonna do my best to make it work out for me, and for as many people that I can possibly help, too."" In addition to modeling and acting, Smith built a restaurant and home entertaining empire. Smith has opened restaurants in New York and Washington, D.C., authored cookbooks and released a line of home goods.","Former model B. Smith was reported missing Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- First, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers addressed rumors that he was gay on his weekly ESPN radio show, saying, ""I am not gay. I really, really like women."" Then former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe penned a nuclear account in which he said his former coach was such a complete homophobe that it may have cost Kluwe a job in the NFL. Both players, in very different ways, illustrate that despite all the progress made by the LGBT community in sports over the last decade, some things are very much the same. Flash back to 2002, and it was baseball's Mike Piazza uttering those recurring words, ""I am not gay"" at a news conference after a midseason tabloid report stating otherwise. Pointedly denying a similar gay rumor more than 10 years later, while obviously personally important to the intensely private Rodgers, highlights that being gay in sports -- or being perceived as gay -- still carries a huge stigma (though mainstream conversations often steer toward men's sports, this problem is rampant in women's sports as well). And this was so, even after the feel good year of 2013, when we saw monumental strides with the coming out of the WNBA's Brittney Griner, MLS star Robbie Rogers and the NBA's Jason Collins. Speculation of homosexuality is still perceived as such a threat that Rodgers, who makes an estimated $6 million a year in endorsements, felt the need to characterize the rumors as ""crazy"" and his radio co-host, in an awkward, fumbling moment, expressed sadness that the rumors were started in an ""attempt to make you look bad."" And according to Kluwe, his vocal support of marriage equality was so intolerable to Vikings assistant coach Mike Priefer, that the coach once said in a team meeting: ""We should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows."" (Priefer issued a statement denying Kluwe's allegations and saying he does not tolerate ""discrimination of any type."") How are young sports fans hearing these messages? If you want to insult someone, the most surefire way is still to use the anti-gay F word. In fact, 85% of youth hear ""gay"" used as a slur on a regular basis and 80% of LGBT youth experience harassment and are five times more likely than their straight peers to attempt suicide. Time and time again, educators will point to the importance of peer leadership in improving this climate, and, more often than not, athletes are leaders at their schools. Yet frequently, the jock culture promotes silence at best or instigates and reinforces abusive behavior at worst. I should know. As a three-time All American wrestler at the University of Maryland, I was one of those athletes who privately condemned an intolerant culture yet did nothing about it. As a straight person, it didn't feel like it was my battle or my place. But in college, my world started to change. In addition to being an athlete, I was also a theater major. Seeing how accepting and supportive my theater friends were to people of all sexual orientations made me look at my locker room differently and question why my sport wasn't as open-minded and proactive. Ultimately, fueled by the reasoned logic and fundamental humanity of the marriage equality battle, I found my voice and started speaking out. Now, as the founder of Athlete Ally, I travel around the country educating and empowering the athletic community to take a stand against homophobia and transphobia in sports. With all the great strides last year, and the commitment from men's and women's pro leagues to fully address inclusion issues in professional sports, at times it has felt like advocacy groups like Athlete Ally (in full disclosure, Kluwe is an ambassador for the organization), GO! Athletes and Br{ache the Silence have already changed sports culture as we know it. While Rodgers effectively put an end to the discussion of personal life and vowed to ""keep on trucking, "" what was left unsaid was any support for the LGBT community or contemplation of the broader questions such rumor-mongering raises about our sports culture and the specter of acceptance. Kluwe's allegations shed new light on why one of the NFL's best players and articulate spokesmen felt pressure to stand down on that type of intelligent dialogue. Rodgers is one of the most respected, revered and highest paid players in the game. His fan base includes straight fans and gay fans. He is admired by youth in this country spanning all sexual orientations. And most of all, the ubiquitous tweet from fans after the gay rumors emerged was: ""I don't care!"" Maybe one day, athletes everywhere, of every orientation and identity, will be confident that they can live by Kluwe's credo: Never be afraid to do what's right. If no one ever says anything, nothing ever changes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hudson Taylor.","Hudson Taylor says we saw two examples that homophobia is still a problem in sports .

"Washington (CNN) -- Charlottesville, Virginia, residents could see one of the region's biggest political footballs flying overhead this week: a drone. The use of an unmanned aircraft was approved Tuesday by the Federal Aviation Administration to help search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. The drone deployment, while legal, highlights an ongoing political debate -- at the local and state level -- on whether use of the aviation technology is a violation of civil liberties. Legal limits on unmanned aircraft use by state and local law enforcements were instituted by the Virginia state legislature in February 2013, earning the support of civil liberties proponents and marking an historic first across the nation. The moratorium lasts until July 2015, when the legislation will be reconsidered and some proponents say it can't come quickly enough. ""There's been an overreaction on the part of state legislatures with respect to this technology,"" said Brendan Schulman, who represents drone operators as Special Counsel at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP. Authorities say the drone, an Aeryon SkyRanger, could be used in the Charlottesville area for as long as they are useful -- news that might anger proponents of the ban, where the city itself voted to outlaw the use of drones even beyond the restrictions of the state moratorium. ""Drones will spy on us without our permission in violation of our constitutional rights under the 4th Amendment,"" said David Swanson, an activist who brought the initial anti-drone resolution to the Charlottesville city council, in February. Schulman pointed out that state legislators' ""knee-jerk reaction"" highlighting privacy concerns is often overblown given state laws which prohibit invasions of privacy. Instead, he said, drone opponents should consider their financial and safety benefits. ""There is absolutely no question that using a battery powered small drone is much more cost effective than a manned helicopter,"" he said, noting that in some circumstances, unmanned aircraft can often replace as many as 100 ground-based volunteers. ""This is like any other technology,"" he added. ""There are great benefits that we can obtain from it when it's used appropriately, and we should not curtail those benefits on the premise that the technology is always going to be abused."" John Coggin, chief engineer of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, said the drone being used this week will be used to ""look closer"" at objects of interest, and will be able to cover areas across the region too difficult to reach with an ATV or even see with a manned helicopter. More than 50 law enforcement personnel are also participating in the search on the ground. So far, police have searched more than 175 square miles in the mission to find Graham, which is now in its third week after she disappeared from the Downtown Mall area of Charlottesville on Sept. 13. investigators have identified Jesse Matthew, 32, as the last person seen with Graham. He's been charged with abduction with the intent to defile. While the search continues both on ground and in air, some groups who supported the moratorium agree that use by local law enforcement should be allowed. The Rutherford Institute, a Charlottesville-based civil liberties organization notable for its hand in advocating for the local moratorium, has rallied behind the use of drones in the Graham case. ""We are all concerned about what has happened to Hannah Graham, and if using aerial drones can find her or at least provide some leads to law enforcement, all the better,"" John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, said in a statement. ""The key moving forward is to ensure that appropriate civil liberties safeguards are in place, but that is a conversation for another day and time.""","The FAA approved drone use for helping in the search for Hannah Graham.
State lawmakers issued moratorium on drone use in February 2013.

"(CNN) -- What are you thankful for this year? For many of you, that's probably a tough question to answer. This year hasn't been easy, between Ebola and ISIS and Ferguson and the economy and ... well, we could go on. But here's the interesting thing about Thanksgiving: The idea to set aside a day for humble reflection and gratitude was itself inspired by troubling times. As the story goes, the first Thanksgiving was held in 1621 by the Pilgrims who'd managed to survive their arrival in the New World and who were eager to celebrate their first successful harvest after a hellish, deadly winter. Almost 250 years later, in the midst of a war that threatened to tear the U.S. apart, President Abraham Lincoln declared that the entire nation would annually honor the last Thursday of November as a ""day of Thanksgiving and Praise."" Even when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried (unsuccessfully) to celebrate the holiday a week earlier in 1939, allowing a little extra time for Christmas shopping, he did so with a nation battered by the Great Depression on his mind. If there's ever a time to pause and think about gratitude, it's in the hard moments. Some people think that they need to share something profound when they practice giving thanks, but we don't believe that's true. Whatever inspires you, gives you hope or makes you smile is fair game. For us, these five moments from 2014 bring about all of the above. What would you add to the list? 1. We saw that nothing is impossible. In May, we got to meet Egyptian para-table tennis player Ibrahim Hamadto, a man who didn't let a life-altering accident stand in the way of his dreams. Growing up in northeastern Egypt, Hamadto (also spelled Hamato) was a big fan of soccer and table tennis. But when he was 10, the future athlete lost both of his arms in a train accident. It took him three years to return to table tennis. When he did, it was an uphill climb. ""It was quite difficult,"" Hamadto said. ""I had to practice hard for three consecutive years on a daily basis."" He tried different ways of holding the paddle and eventually settled on holding it in his mouth to play. Now a silver medalist in the African Para-Table Tennis Championships, Hamadto played against some of the sport's best at the ZEN-NOH World Team Table Tennis Championships in May. ""I want to tell everybody that nothing is impossible, and everybody should work hard for what you love and what you think is good for yourself,"" Hamadto told the International Table Tennis Federation. ""The disability is not in arms or legs; the disability is to not persevere in whatever you would like to do."" 2. Family that was lost can be found. Imagine that you have a twin somewhere out there, one you never knew you had. And then imagine that, through a crazy bit of luck and the gift of modern technology, you and your twin get to meet for the first time. As it turns out, that story actually happened this year -- and more than once. One set of twins, Ann Hunt and Elizabeth Hamel, lived apart for 78 years before a search into their family tree unearthed their connection. And for 26-year-old identical twins Anais Bordier and Samantha Futerman, it was the magical way Facebook has made our world just that much smaller that brought them together after they were separated at birth. Bordier and Futerman aren't the only ones who used Facebook to connect with those long-lost. In early March, a young woman named Katheryn Deprill posted a message on the social media platform asking for help in finding her birth mother, who left Deprill in the restroom of a Burger King more than 20 years ago. The result of Deprill's shot in the dark was the opportunity to meet the woman who didn't want to leave behind her child but felt she had no other options. When the two women came face to face, ""they immediately hugged,"" said an attorney who set up Deprill's meeting with her birth mom. ""It was exciting, emotional, dramatic."" For all the moments that social media can be an annoyance or a playground for bullies, there are stories like these that show how online connections can lead to great things. 3. People renewed our faith in humanity. Read the paper or watch the news, and it won't take long before you're ready to be done with all people, everywhere. But here's a reminder that things aren't all bad: When a bartender in New Jersey confided in a customer that her dog was having an expensive emergency surgery, that customer left her a $1,000 tip to help cover the cost. And when a man in Pennsylvania named James Tully kept getting stopped by police because of his resemblance to cop killer suspect Eric Frein, his community pitched in to help. Tully didn't own a vehicle, and those police stops would happen as he walked five miles to work and back every day. Knowing that Tully was not a suspect but just a guy trying to earn a living, a local woman started an online campaign and raised $22,000 -- more than enough to buy Tully that car. 4. We saw super-rare blood moons. This year, those in North America got to see not one but two blood moons, an eclipse so rare that major figures like Mozart, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Queen Anne and Sir Isaac Newton never had the chance to see one. And the fun isn't over yet. There are still two more to go in 2015. 5. It's never too late to try something new. Just before Thanksgiving, a 100-year-old woman named Ruby Holt made the trip of a lifetime. Since she was a child, Holt had longed to see the ocean, but she never had the money or the time for a trip to the beach. So for her 101st birthday, the thing Holt most wanted was to finally make it to the shore. With help from an organization called Wish of a Lifetime, which helps seniors achieve their life dreams, Holt was able to do just that. The organization provided her with an all-expenses-paid visit to the Gulf of Mexico, where she was able to feel the sand between her toes for the very first time. ""I've heard people talk about it and how wonderful it was and wanted to see it,"" Holt said, according to the BBC. ""But I never had the opportunity to do so."" It may have taken some time, but Holt can now cross ""beach"" off her bucket list.","The Thanksgiving holiday is a time to give thanks .
In that spirit, these are 5 moments from 2014 we're grateful for ."
"(CNN) -- A frail, elderly black man holding a thick, leather-bound Bible stood on the curb within earshot of Ferguson police. The cloud of tear gas that had recently chased away protesters had all but dissipated, though its effects could still be felt. ""We're supposed to love one another,"" he said between coughs. ""We're supposed to love."" Not far over his head a string of Christmas lights with the words ""Seasons Greetings"" glowed. In a few days the city's festival of lights is scheduled to take place, complete with a parade. But now, another round of canisters of tear gas shoots out. Yelling, screaming and gunshots follow. I doubt the festival happens this year. ""Burn this bitch down, burn this bitch down"" could be heard from the crowd that gathered in front of the city's police station as it became apparent Officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted. Quietly, residents had suspected that would be the outcome. But they still had hope. Now, only sadness. And anger. Because another unarmed young man of color has been gun downed by police, and the person responsible for his killing will not be punished for his action. This isn't a tragedy or a mistake or a misunderstanding. This is a problem -- one that continues to plague this country because of the understandable lack of trust between minorities and police combined with the general lack of empathy between blacks and whites when it comes to cases such as these. In a recent CNN poll, half of whites who responded answered either ""almost none"" or ""none"" of the police in their areas are prejudiced against blacks, while 35% of nonwhites held that view. A USA Today study found at least 70 police departments nationwide arrested blacks at a rate 10 times higher than nonblacks. Furthermore, ""only 173 of the 3,538 police departments USA Today examined arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups."" This isn't a coincidence or a fluke. This is a problem too many whites don't see, and too many blacks are besieged by. I have literally lost count the number of times I have been stopped by police, but I remember the first time one drew his gun and pointed it at me. I was 12, walking home from the store with a gallon of milk. He said I looked like someone they were looking for. I've looked like that person ever since. The scenes in Ferguson on Monday night reminded me of the climactic scene in the 1989 Spike Lee film, ""Do the Right Thing."" After police officers kill an unarmed black man, the main character, in his frustrations, tosses a garbage can through the window of a local business. A riot boils over and the audience is left with a bit of a cinematic Rorschach test -- what triggered the violence, the broken window or the man killed by police? Too many times the criminal justice system tells black people our lives do not matter. That's why Ferguson was not alone in its demonstrations Monday night. We've seen the not so subtle, dehumanizing reminders play out so many times this year alone -- reminders that the rules don't apply to people of color and whites in quite the same way. Back in August, for example, KDVR-TV reported 18-year-old Steve Lohner walked the streets of Aurora, Colorado -- the scene of the horrific 2012 movie theater shootings -- with a loaded shotgun around his shoulder. Though Colorado is an open carry state, the 911 calls poured in. Police arrived and calmly asked the teen for his ID. He refused, saying he was carrying the gun ""for the defense of myself and those around me."" On the video the teen captured during the confrontation, an officer speaks to him with his hands down, tucked in his belt -- and not on his gun. Do you honestly believe a black teenager would have the same experience? Especially when you consider that same month, in Ohio -- also an open carry state -- a 911 call was made about a man with a gun in Walmart. Store surveillance video shows John Crawford III picking up a pellet gun in the toy department before stopping by the pet supplies aisle. He was on the phone with the mother of his two children. Within seconds of police entering the store he was shot, according to news reports. Another example -- in March, police in Louisiana said Victor White III, with his hands cuffed behind him, pulled out a gun and shot himself in the back, committing suicide. Six months later, the coroner report reportedly states the fatal bullet entered through his chest and that the gunpowder residue found was not consistent with a close-range shooting. And the list could go on. And on. We still have a race problem in this country. And too many of us work harder at denying race has anything to do with the world we live in today than listening and empathizing with those who are hurting. But tell me, at what point will the kinds of killings that we are seeing time after time after time across this country be described as what they are? Racism. Not the explicit Ku Klux Klan variety captured in sensational footage in documentaries, but the implicit prejudice. The kind that apparently sees a photo of a black police officer greeting his fraternity brother and interpreting their hand gestures as gang signs. A study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that police officers view black children as less innocent than their white counterparts. That's not an unfortunate ""situation."" That's a problem. This condition makes it possible for police to approach a 12-year-old boy sitting on a swing in the park with a BB gun and moments later shoot him twice in the torso -- an incident reported in The Washington Post this week. ""The officer had no clue he was a 12-year-old,"" Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association President Jeff Follmer reportedly told WKYC-TV. Of course not. The Department of Justice provides $400 million in grants to police departments around the country. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP, said she believes this money should come with strings attached such as body cameras, de-escalation tactics and training around explicit and implicit bias. ""What we have continued to see linger is the perception of young African-American men as dangerous and criminal,"" Ifill told Brown Political Review. ""Until we begin to reverse this perception, and until all Americans -- white Americans in particular -- believe in the humanity of black people, we will continue to have these incidents of violence."" But first, we all have to have the courage to admit the country has a problem, not just for minorities, but for all of us. Talking about race does not instantly mean someone is a racist or race-baiter. It could mean he or she is aware of the world -- and its problems -- and not afraid to talk about them. What we are talking about are not accidents, or tragedies or misunderstandings, but a problem. That is, of course, unless you believe the tension in Ferguson is an anomaly -- that you can shoot yourself in the chest with your hands cuffed behind your back or that hundreds of armed black men could point guns at police, threaten to kill them and moments later everyone goes their separate way without incident. Didn't think so.","LZ Granderson: Cases like Ferguson indicate U.S. has a problem, not misunderstanding .

"(CNN) -- Up to 334 retail marijuana stores could be licensed to set up shop in Washington state, officials said Wednesday. New proposed rules approved by the Washington State Liquor Control Board come nearly 10 months after voters passed a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use. Since then, authorities have been hashing out the details of how to regulate production and sale of the drug. Officials said they used population data to determine how many retail marijuana stores can open. ""These rules fulfill the public expectation of creating a tightly-regulated and controlled system while providing reasonable access to participation in the market,"" Sharon Foster, the board's chair, said in a written statement. The board will vote on the proposed rules at an October hearing, and producers and retailers will have a chance to apply for licenses in December. Officials estimate that 13% of marijuana users in the state will go through licensed retailers at the outset, and that the number will increase to 25% by the end of the year, according to Mikhail Carpenter, a spokesman for the liquor control board. Marijuana is illegal in the United States under the federal Controlled Substances Act. But last week the Justice Department said it won't challenge state laws that legalize marijuana and will focus federal enforcement on serious trafficking cases and keeping the drug away from children. CNN Cristy Lenz and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Washington state officials release proposed rules for marijuana sales .

"(CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II has never lost her love of horses. Throughout her 62-year reign, the equestrian life has offered the Queen a sport, a passion and a means to temporarily escape her many royal duties. The Queen's cousin, Margaret Rhodes, called it ""another world"" in a 2013 BBC documentary. ""With horses ... it reduces you to just the person in relation to the animal, and you're not a Queen, you're just a human being,"" she said. Now, the Queen has been honored with the inaugural lifetime achievement award from the world governing body of horse sport, the International Equestrian Federation (FEI). In a meeting of monarchies, FEI leader Princess Haya of Jordan presented the Queen with the award at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace on Wednesday -- watched on by a former FEI president in the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Phillip. ""She is a true horsewoman,"" said Princess Haya. ""She still rides whenever state business allows, and her knowledge of breeding and bloodlines is incredible. ""The bond between the Queen and horses is truly extraordinary and I can't think of anyone more fitting to receive this very special award."" The Queen was only three years old when she had her first riding lesson at the palace in 1930. For her fourth birthday, she received a Shetland pony named Peggy from her grandfather, King George V. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, she could be seen riding a mare named Burmese at the Trooping the Color ceremony to mark her official birthday. Burmese, a gift from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, attended the ceremony with the Queen for 18 years before the mare retired in 1986. A statue of Burmese now stands in Regina, Canada. In equestrian circles, the Queen is best-known for her role as a leading British breeder of world-class racehorses. Earlier this year, top trainer Andrew Balding told CNN the Queen was ""probably the best-informed owner in the country"". In June last year, the Queen won the Cheltenham Gold Cup with Estimate, a four-year-old filly ridden by Ryan Moore and trained by Michael Stoute. In all, horses bred by the Queen have more than 1,600 victories to their name. Nor is she the only Royal to have tasted equestrian success. The Duke of Edinburgh dabbled in carriage driving and played polo -- as have Princes Charles, William and Harry -- alongside his 22 years as FEI president. And the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, won a world title in eventing in 2006, alongside an Olympic silver medal as part of the British eventing team at the London Olympics in 2012. Phillips was emulating Princess Anne, her mother, who won European eventing gold in 1971 and competed at the Montreal 1976 Olympics. ""The Queen has an incredible in-depth knowledge of breeding,"" said British Equestrian Federation chairman Keith Taylor, who attended Wednesday's ceremony. ""It's impossible to think of the Royal Family without thinking of horses. We are truly blessed to have a sovereign who values the horse and its many types so highly.""","Queen Elizabeth II is given an equestrian lifetime achievement award .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian striker Brandao has been handed a one-month jail sentence for headbutting an opposing player, with the severity of his punishment linked to the footballer's role model status, according to one of the lawyers involved in the case. The judicial punishment follows a six-month sporting ban given to Brandao, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia, following the August incident when he assaulted Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta. ""This is an extremely severe sentence compared to the criminal record of my client,"" Brandao's lawyer Olivier Martin told CNN affiliate BFMTV after the three-judge panel's ruling, which also included a $25,000 fine. ""It's all the more severe because of the motivation that was raised by the President of the Court to justify the sentence,"" added Martin. ""He referred to the violence in football stadiums."" Brandao headbutted the Italy international in the tunnel of PSG' s Parc des Princes stadium following the match which the Parisian club won 2-0. The 34-year-old can be seen on CCTV waiting around before striking Motta and then running off out of shot with Brazilian-born Motta following in hot pursuit. Motta's lawyer Francois Klein said ""the court wanted to mark the occasion,"" as Ligue 1 players were considered role models to many people. ""Because these images are widely circulated; it gives the youth an absolutely regrettable idea,"" said Klein. ""It's well known that in many stadiums, suburban or elsewhere, there are similar events that may occur, and it is necessary that professional players lead by example."" Neither of the two players involved were present at the Paris court for the trial. The court was particularly annoyed by the absence of Brandao, who was having surgery in a Saint Etienne hospital Thursday. Brandao is expected to ""benefit from a sentence adjustment,"" meaning he would serve his punishment through a community service rather than in jail. Against PSG, Brandao was playing in only his second match for the Corsica-based club after joining from Saint Etienne in the summer. He was initially suspended for four weeks following the attack which broke Motta's nose. Last season, he was banned for three matches for elbowing another PSG player, Yohan Cabaye, in the head. ""Brandao will be available to play again on Feb. 22, 2015,"" the French league's disciplinary committee said in a statement following his September punishment, meaning the striker will miss 24 league matches in total.","Brazilian striker Brandao given one-month jail sentence .

"(CNN) -- ""Sex and the City's"" Mr. Big always did have a bad habit of putting his foot in his mouth. While doing press for his work with Chivas Regal Extra Scotch, the actor who played that wealthy gent on HBO's iconic series apparently tried to make a joke that's not likely to go over well among ""SATC"" fans. While speaking with Australian outlet News.com.au, Noth dropped this comment about the charming but manipulative Mr. Big and his relationship with Sarah Jessica Parker's romance-loving Carrie Bradshaw: . ""He was what he was. One of the things I tell people is that he never tried to pretend he was anything other than what he was,"" Noth said. ""It was (Carrie) who tried to pretend he was something he wasn't. He was always honest about himself; he never cheated on her. The relationship just didn't work, and he went on to get married while she went on to ... how many boyfriends did she have? She was such a whore! There's a misconception that Carrie was a victim of him, and that's not the case. She was a strong, smart woman."" News.com.au notes that Noth made his remark about the Carrie Bradshaw character with a laugh, which would indicate that the actor was being facetious. As Salon points out, the triumph of ""Sex and the City"" -- and what made it a landmark program during its six-season run -- was Carrie Bradshaw's navigation of being single and all the elation, struggle, boyfriends and one-night-stands that came with it. For once, the idea of getting married was just one of life's many questions for a 30-something woman, not the explicit goal. Questionable humor aside, Noth was more serious about how theshow affected his beloved city, New York. ""The New York that 'Sex and the City' depicted is not the New York that I love,"" Noth said. ""New York was a much bigger, more interesting place than just fashion and glitz and all that crap. It's become its own nightmare. ... Manhattan used to have a real rainbow coalition of class and ethnicity, but it's being pushed out. It's almost like New York became the (fantasy) city that 'Sex and the City' depicted, which I find particularly boring."" A third movie based on the long-running show is rumored to be in the works.

"(CNN) -- Bicycles and airplanes might not seem like the greatest travel partners. Yet two wheels and two wings can co-exist in surprisingly beautiful ways. Consider the airport bike path, an increasingly popular feature at airports around the world. Some allow travelers to pedal right up to their plane, while others skirt airport perimeters, permitting cyclists a closeup view of the behemoths of the sky. Here's a selection of world favorites. Suvarnabhumi Airport (Bangkok) Cycling in the Thai capital's infamous traffic is generally the preserve of the borderline suicidal. A different experience awaits with the newest of the world's airport bike routes. At just more than the 15 miles long, the traffic-free loop circumnavigates Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport (sometimes referred to as Bangkok International Airport). It's free, though cyclists need to show ID for access. The smooth, green-tarmacked track was formerly part of an access perimeter road used during the airport's construction about a decade ago. It's now used by all sorts of riders, notably the rapid, sporty variety, who use it as a training route. This isn't the oddest sporting facility you'll find at a Bangkok airport. The city's older international hub, Don Mueang International Airport, has a Royal Thai Air Force golf course between its two runways. Anyone can play, but be prepared for your golf bag to be checked first for surface-to-air missiles. Really. Kastrup Airport (Copenhagen, Denmark) Whatever Bangkok is to cyclists, the Danish capital is the opposite. Cycling isn't a hobby here, it's a way of life. Throughout the city are miles of carefully planned, segregated bike lanes full of pedaling Danes. Given that, and the fact the city's Kastrup Airport is just six or so miles from the center, it's no surprise this is one of the world's smoothest bike-to-plane experiences. There are a range of traffic-free bike lanes all the way from the city to airport terminal buildings, and you can leave your bike directly outside the airport, assuming there's space (lots of airport employee ride to work). That leaves the conundrum of transporting large baggage. Copenhagen cycling blogger Mikael Colville-Andersen has a solution: he's been known to collect guests, bags and all, from the airport on a cargo bike, the voluminous, box-fronted machines common in the city. One caveat to all this bike joy is that it's largely for the locals -- there is, as yet, no bike rental outlet at the airport. Lanzarote Airport (Canary Islands, Spain) If you've ever had the urge to see the belly of a plane operated by budget carrier Ryanair from a distance of about 20 meters but just didn't know how, here's the answer. Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands, a compact, volcanic smudge off the coast of northwest Africa, is already something of a draw for serious road cyclists with its lightly trafficked roads, idyllic scenery and perma-spring climate. There's also a quiet, largely traffic-free bike lane along the coast from the main resort of Puerto del Carmen to the island's quiet capital, Arrecife. Aside from passing beaches, bars and restaurants, it skirts Arrecife's surprisingly busy seafront airport. Those in the know stop just beyond the fence at the tip of the southwest-facing runway. Takeoffs are exciting -- an increasingly loud roar that crescendos when a plane suddenly shoots overhead. Landings are better. On a clear day (and most days are clear) you can watch aircraft landing lights draw near for several minutes as the plane draws closer, finally just clearing the fence -- and you -- before landing. You know you don't have to duck but you still might. Vancouver International Airport . Vancouver's busy international airport describes itself as ""committed"" to helping more people ride to and from its location on a semi-detached island a little more than 10 miles from the city center. An official airport map has a range of cycling options, including cycle lanes adjoining roads and shared pathways, with no fewer than five sets of bike parking racks scattered between the terminals. If you arrive weary from a flight and decide you simply can't face a ride into the city, the airport's rapid rail transit system happily transports bikes (apart from two hours during peak commuter times). Manchester Airport (UK) Manchester Airport, it's fair to say, isn't on many list of the world's great aviation hubs. But it is the UK's third busiest airport, handling 20 million passengers a year. And it has a defunct Concorde on display. Far less known is that Manchester Airport -- located in the Cheshire countryside about 10 miles from the city center -- possesses an eight-mile orbital cycleway. This bike route is so close to the action it features a pair of tunnels passing under the twin runways. The route also takes in some lovely countryside adjoining the Styal Country Park, and a selection of pubs. It's more often used for leisure riding and plane spotting than riding to catch flights, though some do. Peter Walker is a journalist based in the UK who regularly contributes to cycling publications. He once rode a bike most of the way from Sydney to London.","Manchester Airport has an orbital cycle path with a pair of tunnels passing beneath runways .

"(CNN) -- It sounds like something made up just in time for Halloween. Several reports from France of attacks by people dressed as clowns -- and armed with anything from knives to baseball bats -- have been making headlines in Europe. Taken with the recent sightings reported by some communities in Florida, New Mexico and Indiana, among others, it is easy to wonder what is going on. What is it about clowns? Why these strange sightings now? But to those of us who have been following what is proving to be an unusually lively period of clown reports -- whether they be actual crimes or simply hoaxes -- neither the reports themselves, nor the peculiar interest in these incidents, is all that surprising. For a start, while these developments are notable, the recent outbreak of such activity is actually not without precedent. In the mid-1980s, for example, a number of episodes were recorded on both sides of the Atlantic, first in Scotland and then in various towns across New England, as people reported clowns in ice cream vans attempting to lure children. We also know that clowns inhabit fertile ground in terms of phobias -- after all, they can invoke anything from a fear of masks, to stranger danger, to our anxieties regarding public humiliation. (And that's not to mention the question of why a grown person would dress this way, in a kind of asexual fetishism). Meanwhile, the Clowns of America International, the professional organization representing U.S. clowns, has reported a significant decline in the number of students attending clown school in recent years. So it is possible, then, that these two elements -- the decline in ""licensed"" clown performers and the rise in the number of ""sinister"" sightings -- are more closely related than they seem. After all, all forms of monstrosity are essentially commentaries on the nature of humanity's social relations (the Twilight books and movies, for example, offer a straightforward examination of adolescent sexuality explored through the lens of a vampire/human/werewolf menage.) Indeed, in many ways, the crisis in the clown community mirrors the anxieties that are felt across many sectors of society -- class friction, social estrangement and an economy many still feel uncertain over. Keep in mind that clowns have always been marginal members of society. In the Middle Ages, the fool was a scapegoat and outcast, an egregious misfit with license to speak truth to power. In the 20th century, the two greatest clowns were essentially homeless indigents: ""Weary Willie,"" the unshaven and ragged hobo clown of Emmett Kelly, emerged straight from the American Dust Bowl, while Charlie Chaplin was known simply as ""the Tramp."" In all these instances, clowns enjoy a relationship to society that is tenuous at best. In this sense, it is no great leap to say that dressing up as a scary clown is an expression of anti-social alienation, especially when coupled with another phenomenon that we might term ""industrial nostalgia."" The stereotypical scary clown almost always takes its inspiration from clowns associated with the golden age of the American big top circus. These white face clowns with their colorful hair and costumes are known as ""Joeys"" in honor of the great comedian, Joseph Grimaldi, and evoke a specific time in American history, a time of optimism and potential. But this golden age has passed, and our ideas of clowns are now set against a backdrop of recession, social atomization and a distrust of traditional institutions. When seen from the vantage point of the present, the Joeys of the big top seem hopelessly naive, the leering remnants of an industrial past whose promises are unfulfilled. It also seems no coincidence that the narratives that employ scary clowns so often associate them with failed businesses -- empty music halls echoing with the ghosts of past laughter or abandoned theme parks repurposed as lairs. The idea of the scary clown, then, taps into the frustrations and fears of a time in which so many are feeling themselves pushed into the margins. So, should you think you see a clown peering through your curtains this Halloween, take comfort in the fact that it's nothing personal. The image of that grinning, shock-haired psychopath you are imagining is in your wardrobe will probably start to fade when the economy turns around.

"(CNN) -- Who inspired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to throw a million bucks at South Dakota? A country singing troubadour candidate who plays guitar, drives a minivan and makes a GOP tracker the star of his latest web ad. Meet Rick Weiland, the Democratic hopeful who's trailing former Republican Governor Mike Rounds in a four-way race that also includes former Republican Senator Larry Pressler, running as an Independent and Gordon Howie, also an independent. The ad features Weiland performing a modified version of the song ""Wagon Wheel,"" which was originally written by Bob Dylan and later made popular by the band Old Crow Medicine Show. The original song's chorus ""rock me momma like a wagon wheel"" resonates well with both pop and country music fans. Weiland, who has been turning popular music into campaign ads since the start of his campaign, was looking for a song that would connect more with millennials. ""I was driving around one day and that song came on"" Weiland said. He then thought, ""Well, that's gonna work."" When Weiland first started making music videos into campaign ads, he admitted it that it takes a lot of courage. ""We were a little concerned because no one had done it before,"" he said, ""but we figured, what the heck, let's just keep coming up with good songs. It's been a lot of fun."" Wieland has also turned music into a family tradition, performing in a band with his two daughters, his brother and nephew called the ""Take It Back Band."" They perform regularly throughout South Dakota and even hold music festival events called ""Rick-Stock,"" which is an obvious take on the famous Woodstock festival. Weiland started combing music and politics in 1997 when he was a Regional Director for FEMA under the Cinton administration. ""We actually wrote some great FEMA songs,"" he said while reflecting on his time traveling with his former FEMA colleague and friend David DeCourcy. With years of experience playing and traveling on the road, it's safe to say Weiland took this latest musical endeavor to a new level, modifying the lyrics to fit his campaign message. He plays the guitar while singing his own chorus, ""So I'm runnin' for the Senate but I ain't a big wheel, don't have an army, just my automobile."" Weiland might not be running a $9 million campaign like his Republican opponent Mike Rounds aims to raise, but he does have a new million-dollar bump to sing about. The DSCC will spend $1 million on the race, mostly for television ads and to support field operations, Bloomberg Politics first reported. ""The DSCC obviously must think I can win,"" he said. ""After slugging on my own here for more than a year and half with very little money, I haven't spent all my time fundraising, I've spent my money going to town to town and people are going to vote someone who has earned the privilege to represent them, not someone who is trying to buy their way in."" But it looks like the money won't help Weiland produce another ""Wagon Wheel"" style ad, with the funds expected to flood airwaves with attack ads hitting GOP nominee Rounds. That's something groups have already done, with ads attacking Rounds over his alleged involvement in a visa program scandal in the state. Those types of ads will likely help Weiland, but could also be a boon for Pressler, the independent who surged into second place in a SurveyUSA poll released Wednesday. Weiland is now trailing both Rounds and Pressler by seven and four points, respectively, according to the poll. And the poll indicates Pressler is mostly pulling votes away from Weiland. The investment in attack ads, rather than pro-Weilland ads suggests Democrats are confident either a Weiland or Pressler victory will help them keep control of the Senate. Bloomberg Politics reported that Democrats are confident Pressler, who endorsed Obama in 2008 and 2012, would caucus with Democrats if elected to the Senate, though Pressler has not said who he would side with. It wouldn't be the first time this year Democrats have pinned their hopes on an Independent candidate polling better than his Democratic counterpart. In Kansas, Democrats pulled their nominee out of the race to bolster businessman Greg Orman's bid to unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. Orman also has not said who he would caucus with, though Republicans have tried to paint him as ""Obama's candidate for the Senate."" Pressler also won't get a chance to reproduce his style of advertising, one of which played up a popular Hollywood movie. Pressler's campaign even bought air time during the Oscars to play up the fact that he turned down a bribe in the Abscam scandal depicted in the movie ""American Hustle."" As for Weiland, he's going to keep on campaigning on the ground, and keep on singing. He revealed he has one more campaign music video to release before the Nov. 4 election. It's going to be a modified Johnny Cash classic, but instead of ""I Walk The Line"" it'll be called ""I Draw The Line"" and will go after one of Weiland's campaign staples, getting big money out of politics. Also, here is the Old Crow Medicine Show's version of ""Wagon Wheel."" . CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","Rick Weiland is the Democratic hopeful in South Dakota's Senate race.

"(CNN) -- Israeli police on Friday dropped age restrictions at the Temple Mount, allowing Muslims of all ages to pray at the holy site. But police said they would keep their ""high alert status"" at the Al-Aqsa mosque. The age restrictions were lifted after a Thursday night meeting in Amman, Jordan, between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Jordanian King Abdullah and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest site in Islam. Jews call it the Temple Mount, and Muslims know it as Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary. The Temple Mount has been a flashpoint for violence, and in recent weeks, entry has been limited to women and men above the age of 35. Authorities feared that younger men and teens would cause disturbances. CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","Police lifted age restrictions for Friday prayers .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some voters are facing a choice this November: vote or be shamed -- publicly. Voters in Alaska received a letter this weekend from the ""Alaska State Voter Program,"" which told the recipient whether 11 of their friends and acquaintances had voted in the last three elections and asked a bold question: . ""WHAT IF YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS, AND YOUR COMMUNITY KNEW WHETHER YOU VOTED?"" Despite the official-looking letterhead, the ""Alaska State Voter Program"" isn't a government initiative. The mailer came from the conservative Opportunity Alliance PAC, which is using public voter rolls to shame or peer pressure voters into casting a vote this election, the Alaska Dispatch News reported Monday. And the political group says it will follow up after the election, with plans to send out a new mailer that lists which voters went to the polls on Nov. 4. ""You and your friends, your neighbors, and other people you know will all know who voted and who did not vote,"" the group writes in the letter. The mailer could have an impact on the crucial Senate election in Alaska next week, where Republican Dan Sullivan is looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, especially in a midterm elections when voter turnout slumps. One recipient of the letter told the Alaska Dispatch News she was creeped out when she realized she was Facebook friends with the 11 people listed in the mailer she received. It's not the first time groups have tried to shame voters into heading to the polling booth. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group backed by the Koch brothers, sent voters in Virginia a ""report card"" last year that judged their turnout history at the ballot box-- and their next-door neighbor's. ""You are one of the few individuals in your neighborhood that is not a regular voter. We're contacting you and your neighbors today to let folks know who does and who doesn't vote"" the AFP letter reads, according to local NBC affiliate WWBT. ""Your neighbors who have voted in every election are concerned about our community's well being. They're concerned about the future of America...Are you?"" Voters in other states have received similar ""report cards."" Another group, Values are Vital, sent Florida voters a mailer this spring that even graded their attendance record at the ballot box and also shared their neighbors' voting track record. Liberal groups like MoveOn, the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and America Votes have also pressured voters with voting records.","The Alaska State Voter Program mailed voters in the state this weekend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Party Unity My A--! Not all of Sen. Hillary Clinton's supporters have fallen in line behind Sen. Barack Obama. Not exactly the slogan you want heading into your presidential nominating convention, but one that is being repeated online and in neighborhood bars by a group of disenchanted Democrats, who have dubbed themselves PUMAs. Why are they angry? It all depends on whom you ask. Some of the PUMAs accuse Democratic leaders of rigging the primaries to favor Sen. Barack Obama, while others feel that he is not qualified to be the party nominee, let alone competent enough to lead the country. Kim Mann said she thinks that Obama is too liberal. Webster Tarpley said the senator from Illinois is too conservative. But Mann, a 52-year-old project manager from Manassas, Virginia, and Tarpley, a self-described 62-year-old ""controversial author,"" agree on one thing: Neither wants Obama to be the Democratic nominee.  Watch why some Democrats oppose Obama's nomination » . Even though Sen. Hillary Clinton conceded the Democratic presidential nomination to Obama in early June and urged all of her supporters to vote for him, not all of her backers heeded the call. Hence, the beginning of the PUMA movement. ""What we are really organizing about is to reinitiate Hillary back into the presidential race,"" Mann said during a recent interview at a Washington bar, where she met with fellow PUMAs for kinship and to strategize about how to make Clinton the Democratic nominee. Will Bower, the 36-year-old head of the PUMA pack, and his like-minded Democrats are angry because they charge that the Democratic National Committee unfairly imposed sanctions on Michigan and Florida after both states violated party rules by holding primary contests before February 5. Clinton won both primaries -- Obama's name was not even on the Michigan ballot -- and had those states counted at the beginning, well, who knows what would have happened. ""I have never voted for anything but a Democrat, and I feel that there has been an internal coup, and they are putting forward a candidate that does not represent the will of the Democratic Party,"" Bower said. To be fair, the DNC did go through a lengthy review process of the primary calendar and warned every state that only four -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- would be allowed to hold primaries before Super Tuesday. And if you ask the Obama campaign, it's confident that the senator is up to the job.  Watch more from the campaign trail » . But that hasn't stopped Bower, a Washington resident who recently quit his job to oversee the PUMA pack, and others from trying to subvert Obama's likely nomination to make room for Clinton. ""We have got a convention coming up and although everyone calls him the nominee, he is the presumed nominee,"" Bower said. ""So we need to make sure Hillary gets her name in nomination and those delegates get a chance to vote, because I think there are a lot of delegates who will change their mind by the end of August and realize that Hillary Clinton is the truer Democrat."" Clinton, for her part, is not supporting this effort, and is committed to helping Obama defeat Sen. John McCain in November, a spokesman said. ""She has been very crystal clear that she supports Sen. Obama and wants every Democrat and every one of her supporters to get behind him,"" said Mo Elleithee, Clinton's spokesman. ""She has said repeatedly the stakes are so high and anyone that has voted for her has more in common with Sen. Obama than Sen. McCain."" Bower just shrugs off Clinton's support of Obama. ""Hillary Clinton is a voter, and we are voters and we love her and we will do most of what she asks us to do,"" Bower said. ""But at the end of the day we make our own decisions when we go into the polling booth."" He estimates that there are 250 PUMA-related Web sites and 2.5 million PUMAs online. I am not sure there is metric to measure their enthusiasm, but a preliminary test will come next month when the group holds a conference in Washington to plan for Denver -- the site of the 2008 Democratic National Convention. How many PUMAs will show up? What will be the group's rallying cry? Then the real test will be at the end of August when Democrats convene in the Colorado capital to make Obama the party's official presidential nominee. But will that be too late? PUMAs don't think so. Should the Obama campaign be worried about the PUMAs? A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that more than four in 10 Democrats still preferred Clinton as the nominee. But Obama is leading McCain in early general election polls. And as Clinton continues to vocalize her support for Obama, it is probably safe to say that more Clinton backers will likely fall in line behind him. From donors to volunteers, the Obama campaign said that Clinton's supporters have already expressed support for the senator from Illinois. ""Democrats across the country understand how urgently we need change, not four more years of failed Bush policies -- and we've been very pleased that so many who supported Sen. Clinton in the primary have taken active roles in the Obama campaign, organizing, raising money and most importantly, talking to their friends and neighbors about the clear choice in this election,"" Obama spokesman Nick Shapiro said. If Clinton thinks Obama is the best candidate and the Democratic establishment is backing him, then why else would these PUMAs dislike him so much? ""I have a big concern that we don't actually know what his policies are because you know throughout the primary he had his policies that he would speak about, and since he clinched the nomination on June 3, he's really backtracked,"" said Nili Navot, 28, an education worker from New York who came to Washington for the PUMA happy hour at the bar. ""And you know he has really gone back on a lot of things from public financing to supporting the FISA bill."" If PUMAs are unsuccessful in preventing Obama from getting the nomination, what will they do? Bower and Mann said they would cross party lines and vote for McCain; Navot noted she might write in Clinton's name or not vote at all. Tarpley said he would turn his gaze towards Green Party nominee Cynthia McKinney, Libertarian Party nominee Bob Barr or independent candidate Ralph Nader. Tarpley said a McCain victory might be the best result if Obama is the Democratic nominee. It would allow the party an opportunity to reflect and perhaps ""radicalize it in a New Deal direction."" ""I would say McCain is on track to be a tired old lame duck as soon as he gets into office, and he will face a very hostile Congress,"" said Tarpley, noting that Democrats are projected to maintain majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate. ""I think what you will have is gridlock, and I would say at this point gridlock is about the best you can do.""","Some disgruntled Democrats say party rigged primaries for Sen. Barack Obama .
Despite Sen. Hillary Clinton's urging, not all of her followers are backing Obama .
Some PUMAs say they will subvert Obama's nomination .
Others say they will vote for Republican opponent Sen. John McCain ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The National Republican Senatorial Committee pushed its first TV spot in a $1 million ad campaign in South Dakota to attack the Republican nominee's top two opponents in what has become a competitive three-way race for the seat. The 30-second spot, which hit South Dakota airwaves Tuesday, links Democratic opponent Rick Weiland and Republican-turned-Independent former Sen. Larry Pressler as holding the same positions on gun laws, energy and Obamacare and comes less than a week after Democrats announced their own $1 million campaign to attack Republican nominee former Gov. Mike Rounds. Republicans also deployed two political operatives to South Dakota to boost Rounds' campaign operation. The ad features two balloons with Rounds' opponents names, pointing out that ""Rick Weiland and Larry Pressler have a lot in common."" By the end of the ad, both balloons have deflated because ""when it comes to looking out for South Dakota, they both fall flat."" ""Weiland supports Obamacare, just like Pressler,"" the ad claims, adding that Rounds' Democratic and Independent opponents also favor ""stricter gun laws"" and ""want you to pay more for your energy."" For now, Rounds still leads the four-man pack, which also includes Independent Gordon Howie, a social conservative running to Rounds' right who barely registers in the polls. Country-singing Senate hopeful 'rocks' South Dakota race . A SurveyUSA poll released last week showed the race is a three-way split with Pressler trailing the Republican nominee by just three points, with Weiland another four points behind the independent. Until Pressler gained traction, Rounds was considered a shoe-in for the Senate seat in what is traditionally a red state. By taking on both candidates, the Republican Senatorial campaign arm is gearing up to deflect Democratic ads against Rounds, which could be a boon for either Pressler or Rounds. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's investment in attack ads, rather than pro-Weiland ad buys, suggests Democrats are confident a win from either candidate will be a gain toward maintaining a blue Senate. Pressler hasn't said who he would caucus with if elected back into the Senate -- after a nearly 20-year hiatus -- but has been open and unabashed about his support for President Barack Obama, first endorsing Obama in his 2008 run. It wouldn't be the first time this year Democrats have pinned their hopes on an independent candidate polling better than his Democratic counterpart after the Democratic nominee dropped out in the Kansas Senate race in hopes of bolstering businessman Greg Orman's campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. But some also suggest that the DSCC, which has a bigger war chest than their Republican counterparts, could be trying to thin the NRSC's resources in a state where they likely would not have otherwise pumped cash.","The GOP launched its first of $1 million in TV ad days after Democrats announced a similar buy.

"(CNN) -- Burkina Faso's military chief is now the head of state of the West African nation, after unrest that led to the resignation of President Blaise Compaore. Gen. Honore Nabere Traore said Friday that he has taken over presidential duties and that he will lead the country through a political transition and elections. Faced with violent protests demanding an end to his 27-year rule, Compaore initially dissolved the government but said he would stay in power until elections could be carried out. He changed his mind, and on Friday announced his resignation. Compaore said he stepped down to preserve peace in the country. Traore appealed for calm and called for a return to a normal constitutional process. Security forces, including the military, will continue to maintain order and safety in the country, Traore said. Upon his resignation, Compaore appealed via Twitter for ""free elections to be held in Burkina Faso within 90 days at the most."" France, the former colonial ruler of what is today Burkina Faso, welcomed the President's resignation and called for elections to happen quickly. Unrest has gripped Burkina Faso -- a key partner for Western countries in the campaign against Islamist militants -- since protests against Compaore's government turned violent Thursday. Demonstrators stormed Parliament, setting fire to the building. Compaore had been in office since he took power after a bloody coup in 1987. The opposition had called for Compaore's immediate resignation. In Bobo-Dioulasso, the country's second-largest city, protesters reportedly tore down a statue of Compaore. The incident followed reports of protesters storming the parliament building, where lawmakers were set to vote on a motion to allow Compaore to extend his time in power. Flights in and out of Ouagadougou, the capital, have been suspended, according to the Burkina Faso Embassy in Washington. Embassy personnel told CNN that it was still issuing visas but that there were no flights at the moment. The country was formerly known as the Republic of Upper Volta when it was established in 1958 as a self-governing colony under France. CNN's Faith Karimi, Pierre Meilhan and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Burkina Faso's top military official says he is in charge now .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Crossing borders as a transgender woman is always a challenge. There are many reasons immigration authorities reject you, but sometimes it's simply because they don't seem to understand who we are. My name is Eliana Rubashkyn and I was born in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. I'm a trained pharmacist and speak five languages fluently, and until recently, I was studying for an MBA in Health Administration in Taiwan on a government scholarship. I also used to be a man. Last year, I was forced to travel to Hong Kong to renew my passport because of my altered gender. Hong Kong -- a one-hour flight away -- is the nearest Colombian consulate from Taiwan. The trip was also necessary to allow me to apply for the second year of my graduate degree. Little did I know my life would be turned upside down when I boarded that plane. Confusion, hostility . On arrival at Hong Kong's sprawling international airport, immigration officials reacted with a combination of confusion and hostility after looking at my travel documents. I arrived as a woman but my passport identified me as a man. It hadn't occurred to me to check the implications of changing my sex on my freedom to travel and the way I'd be treated. I was immediately refused entry and told that I was facing being deported. I was detained in a cramped room at the airport and permitted access to the male toilet only, despite my repeated requests to be allowed to use the female facilities. [The Hong Kong Customs department told CNN in a statement that according to their procedures they have to take into account the gender as indicated on the passport. As Rubashkyn's passport still carried the ""male"" gender marker, officials had to follow procedures for those identified as men.] . A deportation letter was soon issued to me, which meant Hong Kong authorities were forcing me to leave. I feared I'd be sent back to Colombia, a place I had left because I suffered discrimination and violent abuse -- including two murder attempts -- precisely because I'm transgender. After hours of crying and appeals to all my Facebook friends using my smartphone, several lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights groups in Hong Kong contacted me and appealed to immigration officials to give me permission to enter the city. [Two independent sources with knowledge of this case told CNN Rubashkyn's release was secured via the local Colombian consulate. Once consular officials were notified, they secured her conditional release, meaning she could enter Hong Kong but not leave for anywhere but Colombia. As a result, she filed a refugee claim with the local UNHCR office.] . Stateless . While the process to become a refugee can take years, the situation was so clear for the agency that full status was conferred in only 12 days. September 30 last year marked the day I became a ""stateless person."" I had effectively surrendered my nationality. [While the UNHCR doesn't comment on specific cases for the security of the refugee status claimant, they provided the following statement to CNN: ""An applicant's sexual orientation and/or gender identity can be relevant to a refugee claim where he or she fears persecutory harm on account of his or her actual or perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity.""] . Yet I was still holding a deportation letter from Hong Kong. My fear of being deported to a place where I am not allowed to be myself and where exposing myself could lead me to face death, forced me to request resettlement with the UNHCR and forget the life I had built in Taiwan. Inner identity . Since I was six years old, I knew that my physical gender did not match my inner feelings and inner identity, and I had to grow in the wrong way being a person I was not. I tried to be myself in my room several times as a teen, by dressing in women's clothes, but when I was in my 20s I decided to show the world the person I really was. I needed courage to go out on the streets as Eliana knowing the hazards that existed in a dangerous city like BogotÃ¡. Colombia is a country where machismo, transphobia and homophobia are deeply ingrained in society. South America accounts for 80% of globally reported trans-people murders since 2008, from a total of 643 cases -- according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), a Geneva-based NGO. Of that figure, Colombia alone accounts for around 12% of cases. In Taiwan I found a safe place to be myself, where I could start my medical treatment and my transition from male to female, while working towards my MBA -- fulfilling a double dream of being Eliana and advancing my career. Over time I could see and feel my body changing. I was becoming a woman only a year after the hormone replacement therapy started in Taiwan. In Hong Kong, this medical treatment was as necessary as food and shelter. After almost nine months in the city in which local LGBT group Rainbow made my survival possible, I moved to New Zealand, where I was allowed to reside in a resettlement center. Hong Kong hardship . The situation for refugees in Hong Kong is more complicated. We are forced to live in miserable conditions, without any control over our lives. We are not allowed to work and study, and Hong Kong only provides us about US$150 per month for food and other basic needs. The city's statutory minimum wage for a 40-hour-a-week employee is US$620 per month. I also discovered other perils. In October last year, I fainted in the street because I was lacking the medical treatment needed as part of my gender transformation. I was sent to the emergency room of the city's Queen Elizabeth hospital. When they realized who I was, I was given basic treatment and placed in a padded room in a psychiatric ward and restrained on a bed. [A statement from the Health Authority, the government department responsible for public hospitals in Hong Kong, said Rubashkyn ""received appropriate clinical treatment and nursing care"" and that ""all arrangements were made based on the clinical needs of the patient.""] . Again, Rainbow rescued me. The group pleaded at the hospital for my release. This followed full UNHCR refugee recognition, which places the person concerned under the agency's protection. [The Health Authority clarified in the same statement to CNN that discharge was to ""handle (a) refugee-related issue.""] . For the UNHCR, the process has been very complicated. Most countries require sex reassignment surgery; few countries allow gender changes on paper if they weren't done on the body. There are few options in terms of countries suitable for me in my situation. They include Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Sweden and more recently, Australia. The struggle for many like me continues, but there is always hope. When it seems there is not a clear reason to continue fighting, my life still has a meaning -- being myself, being Eliana.

"(CNN) -- P.D. James, the British novelist renowned for her crime novels featuring detective Adam Dalgliesh as well as such works as ""The Children of Men,"" died Thursday. She was 94. Faber & Faber, her UK publisher, reported her death on its website. ""It is difficult to express our profound sadness at losing P. D. James, one of the world's great writers and a Faber author since her first publication in 1962,"" the publisher said in a statement. ""She was so very remarkable in every aspect of her life, an inspiration and great friend to us all. We will miss her hugely."" The Guardian reported that James died at her home in Oxford, England. ""Saddened to hear of the death of P.D. James, one of the UK's greatest crime writers, who thrilled and inspired generations of readers,"" tweeted British Prime Minister David Cameron. Over a five-decade career as a published writer, James won countless honors for her thoughtful, probing mysteries featuring Dalgliesh, a Scotland Yard detective who was also a poet. She was named a Grandmaster by the Mystery Writers of America, earned the Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers' Association and received a life membership in the House of Lords in 1991, named Baroness James of Holland Park. She was nicknamed ""the Queen of Crime"" and described as the Dickens of crime writing. Her famed protagonist, Dalgliesh, is a complex, withdrawn figure, ""a dedicated professional policeman, supremely efficient, sensitive but with reticence verging on coldness in personal matters,"" The New York Times described him in 1986. He is widowed and childless. In his introspection and erudition, he was something apart from the usual British detective, even in a culture that created Sherlock Holmes and Father Brown. ""Dalgliesh is probably the most intelligent officer in modern detective fiction,"" Ruth Rendell, no mean detective writer herself, told the Guardian in 2001. James was following in the British mystery tradition even as she longed to tweak it, she told the Guardian. ""If I was starting now, I would almost certainly have a woman professional police officer"" as the main character, James said. ""But when I began, in the late '50s, it was a very different world. Women in the police force mostly dealt with issues concerning women and children. I don't think they were even in the detective force, so I had no choice about sex."" The Dalgliesh mysteries include ""The Black Tower"" (1975), ""A Taste for Death"" (1986) and ""Death in Holy Orders"" (2001). Her novel ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" (2011) continued Jane Austen's classic ""Pride and Prejudice"" as a murder mystery. It was adapted into a miniseries that aired on PBS in the United States. Phyllis Dorothy James was born in Oxford in 1920. At 16, she left school and went to work as a civil servant in the tax office. She married Ernest Connor White in 1941. She became the family breadwinner when White returned from World War II with mental problems. After years in and out of psychiatric hospitals, he died in 1964. James worked her way up through the civil service, spending 10 years as an administrator in a forensics department. James didn't publish her first novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" until 1962 -- when she was 42 -- but she always knew she wanted to be a writer, she told the Paris Review in 1995. ""From an early age, I used to tell imaginative stories to my younger brother and sister. I lived in the world of the imagination, and I did something that other writers have told me they did as children: I described myself inwardly in the third person,"" she said. ""I don't know whether this is significant, but I think writing was what I wanted to do -- almost as soon as I knew what a book was."" And her subject, she said, was a natural for her. As she told the Paris Review, ""I had an interest in death from an early age. It fascinated me. When I heard, Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, I thought, Did he fall, or was he pushed?"" Ironically, her breakthrough work was a non-Dalgliesh title, 1980's ""Innocent Blood,"" which allowed her to retire to writing full time. ""At the beginning of the week, I was relatively poor, and at the end of the week, I wasn't,"" she told the Guardian. Aside from the mysteries, her best-known work is probably ""The Children of Men,"" which was made into a highly praised Alfonso Cuaron film in 2006. It is set in a near future in which a disease has rendered women infertile and humanity is slowly dying off, erupting in chaos in the process. It was making sense of chaos that she found the heart of her mysteries, she said. ""I think the main attraction isn't the horror, it's the puzzle,"" she told the Guardian. ""(It's) the bringing of order out of disorder."" James is survived by two daughters and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. People we've lost in 2014 .","P.D.

"(CNN) -- The arrest of Jesse Matthew -- the suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham -- has resulted in a ""significant break"" in the 2009 death of another young woman in the same area, police said. Virginia State Police say there is a ""new forensic link"" between the Hannah Graham case and the death of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her remains were found on a farm months later. Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death. ""Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question,"" Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters last week. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death is still under investigation. The last major development in the Harrington case came in 2010, when her slaying was connected to the kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in Fairfax Virginia, in 2005. That woman, who survived her ordeal, was able to provide police with enough of a description to make a sketch. That sketch is the closest thing to resolution that Harrington's family has had. Police at the time did not give the name of the woman who gave the description and said only that ""forensic evidence"" linked the two. The revelation that Matthew may be linked to Harrington's death, and the fact that Harrington's death is linked to the kidnapping and rape of the woman in Fairfax, raises even more questions. Police have not publicly connected the dots except to say that his arrest has given them a break in the investigation of Harrington's death. The suspect, Matthew was being held in isolation in a Virginia jail cell. According to CNN affiliate WUSA, there are at least two other women besides Graham and Harrington who have disappeared from the same area since 2009. Alexis Murphy, 17, of Lovingston, and Samantha Clarke, 19, of Orange also went missing there. In July, Randy Taylor, 49, was sentenced to two life terms for Murphy's 2013 abduction and murder, although her body was never found, WVIR reported. ""If you look at the map and place the many missing or murdered young women in our area, it is a startling graphic,"" Harrington's mother, Gil Harrington, told CNN last week. ""I mean it`s a scatter pattern of loss. And either it`s a cluster phenomena or to me -- to my eyes it`s not unlikely that some of it, at least, is attributable to one top-tier predator."" Harrington didn't cite specific evidence for why she believes that at least some of the crimes might be the work of one person, but said she believes that solving the disappearance of Graham is key to unraveling the mysteries. ""Hannah is paramount right now. Her case is acute,"" Gil Harrington said. Authorities took Matthew to Charlottesville, Virginia, on Friday after he agreed not to fight extradition from Texas, where he had been taken into custody after police obtained a warrant for his arrest on Tuesday. Where is Hannah Graham? Investigators think he was the last person with Graham. He is charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, according to Charlottesville police. Graham was last seen September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old, a second-year student at the university. Matthew's father has said his son is not the type to hurt anyone. ""For a big man, he's as gentle as they come,"" Jesse Matthew Sr. told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""The only thing I could see, him, maybe trying to give the girl a ride or help her out."" ""To kill or hurt somebody, that's not my son."" Authorities found Matthew on a Galveston County beach after deputies got a call about a suspicious person camping there. A license plate check revealed he was wanted, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Matthew did not resist arrest, police said. Mike Rodenberg, a vacationer who was fishing near the campsite when Matthew was arrested, said Matthew asked about why he was throwing some of his catch back. ""He seemed real nice. He was real soft-spoken,"" Rodenberg said. ""(He) said he was down here from New Jersey and was looking for a job. I told him if I caught another redfish he could have it."" In addition to Graham's disappearance, Matthew also has been questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault nearly 12 years ago. According to a statement from Lynchburg police, a woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University on October 17, 2002. Matthew was a student there for three years and played on the football team. However, no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case, and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew, said Michael Doucette, the commonwealth's attorney for Lynchburg. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented, Doucette said, adding that there were no witnesses. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know .

"Washington (CNN) -- The word ""terrorism"" in the United States usually brings to mind plots linked in some way to al Qaeda, while the danger posed to the public by white supremacists, anti-abortion extremists and other right-wing militants is often overlooked. Militants linked to al Qaeda or inspired by jihadist ideology have carried out four terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, which have resulted in 17 deaths. Thirteen of them were in a shooting incident at Fort Hood, Texas, in November 2009. By contrast, right-wing extremists have committed at least eight lethal terrorist attacks in the United States that have resulted in the deaths of nine people since 9/11, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation. And if, after investigation, Sunday's attack on the Sikh temple in Wisconsin is included in this count, the death toll from right-wing terrorism in the U.S. over the past decade rises to 15. The shooting suspect, Wade Michael Page, posed with a Nazi flag on his Facebook page and has played a prominent role in ""white power"" music groups. The FBI is investigating the case as a ""domestic terrorist-type incident."" A particular concern for law enforcement is the Sovereign Citizens movement, whose adherents reject all U.S. laws as well as taxation and American currency. An FBI report published in 2011 said ""lone-offender sovereign-citizen extremists have killed six law enforcement officers"" since 2000. The numbers in the New America Foundation database may well understate the toll of violence from right-wing extremists. Another FBI study reported that between January 1, 2007, and October 31, 2009, white supremacists were involved in 53 acts of violence, 40 of which were assaults directed primarily at African-Americans, seven of which were murders and the rest of which were threats, arson and intimidation. Most of these were treated as racially motivated crimes rather than political acts of violence, i.e. terrorism. In the past year, the FBI has concluded investigations into a number of right-wing extremists, in some cases securing lengthy sentences for violent plots. In December, Kevin Harpham of Spokane, Washington, was sentenced to 32 years for planting a bomb at the site of a Martin Luther King Jr. parade. City workers found the bag containing the bomb an hour before the streets filled with parade-goers. After 9/11, there was great concern that al Qaeda or an allied group would launch a terrorist attack involving chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons. But in the past decade, there is no evidence that jihadist extremists in the United States have acquired or attempted to acquire material to construct CBRN weapons. By contrast, 11 right-wing and left-wing extremists have managed to acquire CBRN material that they planned to use against the public, government employees or both. Not included in those numbers were four elderly Georgia men who were arrested in November, accused of plotting to produce the deadly toxin ricin, which they wanted to throw out of a car window as they drove along a highways in the eastern and southern United States. The government says that one of the men, Frederick Thomas, was recorded by an informant as saying, ""There is no way for us, as militiamen, to save this country, to save Georgia, without doing something that's highly, highly illegal: murder."" Right-wing extremist individuals over the past decade in the United States were as likely to use violence as a means to express their political or social beliefs as those motivated by Osama bin Laden's ideology. Even more worryingly, during the same time period, right-wing and left-wing extremist groups and individuals have been far more likely to acquire toxins and to assemble the makings of radiological weapons than al Qaeda sympathizers.","FBI is investigating shootings at Sikh temple as act of domestic terrorism .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just two months after the brinksmanship of the ""fiscal cliff,"" on Friday Washington faced yet another deadline to avoid yet another fiscal calamity of its own making. But this time, something is different. As congressional leaders met in the White House on Friday for what was little more than a photo-op on the day forced budget cuts went into effect, this time there are no 11th-hour negotiations to save the day. There is no last-minute effort to call in Vice President Joe Biden on behalf of Democrats or Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on behalf of Republicans to get things back on track. Obama: 'I am not a dictator, I'm the president' Instead, for the past few weeks, all sides -- the White House and Congress, Democrats and Republicans -- have done nothing but squabble like a dysfunctional married couple about who is responsible for the bad policy that is the forced budget cuts, all while avoiding dealing with the real issues. National leaders' apparent lack of interest in working out an alternative to the cuts was symbolized by the meeting Friday morning at the White House. As if to check off the ""we did everything we could"" box, say couples counselors, President Obama and congressional leaders from both parties met to show that they met -- even though earlier this week, Obama told Hill leaders they needed to be ""ready to talk solutions."" As expected, the meeting produced no breakthrough and Friday night President Obama formally began the process of implementing the forced budget cuts he and Congress have been criticizing for weeks. If it feels like a child helplessly watching bickering parents repeat a dysfunctional cycle of disagreement, recrimination and contempt while not addressing the root cause of what's wrong in their relationship, there's good reason. Spending cut politics: DÃ©jÃ  vu all over again . ""They've lost sight of the big picture because they're so determined to be right and to win the argument, and that's what happens with couples,"" said Sharon Rivkin, a California-based marriage counselor and author of ""Breaking the Argument Cycle."" The need to be right, shaming and blaming are the three major obstacles to a healthy relationship, Rivkin said. ""And that's exactly what they're doing -- the Democrats and the Republicans are doing with each other. They're attacking and defending and really just want to be right. And are not looking at the impact that it's going to have on children and the economy and the country."" Spending cuts: When they'll really bite . In addition to the contempt that seems to be building on both sides, Rivkin flagged misdirected disagreement as another sign that the relationship between Democrats and Republicans has become dysfunctional to the point of needing therapy. ""They're arguing about the wrong things, and that's what happens in couples: You're not even arguing about what's really going on. You're just arguing to win,"" Rivkin said. ""They should be talking about economic growth and how to reduce the budget deficit and how they can be fair,"" the therapist observed. Instead, both sides are squabbling over who originally had the idea for the forced spending cuts. ""You can't win in an argument like that, because it's he said, she said, and they're not getting to the root of the issues."" Teachers: How will you be affected? Then there is Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, a couple that seems to have the most strained relationship in a dysfunctional Washington. Rivkin says that if the two men came to her for therapy, she'd first listen to their gripes about one another. ""And then I'd try to make it more human"" by getting away from their superficial disagreements and appealing to their shared concern for the well-being of the country. ""If I talked to them long enough, there's got to be something that they agree on,"" Rivkin said, adding that finding a point of agreement in a quarrelling couple is ""very powerful."" Obama signs order activating deep spending cuts . Rivkin also said that Boehner's recent announcement that he will no longer negotiate directly with Obama is another sign that the relationship between the two men is in serious trouble. ""The healthiest relationships are the ones where you can negotiate,"" the marriage counselor said, ""where you feel safe to put everything out there."" Laurie Puhn, a couples mediator and author of ""Fight Less, Love More,"" likens Friday's meeting at the White House to a couple's mediation session where both spouses come into the room but refuse to speak. ""OK,"" Puhn said, ""you got the image. You can check off your list (that) you did couples mediation, but clearly nothing could possibly be accomplished."" Like a married couple desperately in need of outside help to understand and resolve their differences, Puhn noted, ""each political party -- the individuals within them -- is all about what I want. Here's what I want. Here's what I need. Here's what I won't do. Here's what I won't give up. Everybody's making demands, and they're each just completely thinking about themselves."" In mediation, Puhn tries to avoid the personal acrimony between a couple and instead focus on identifying a list of underlying issues or concerns in their relationship. Then she focuses on areas of agreement about those issues and sets those aside so the couple can focus on the areas of disagreement. ""You narrow it down ... and what you're left with are the sticking points,"" Puhn said. Then the task becomes avoiding focusing on a single sticking point and, instead, finding some give-and-take amongst all the sticking points. ""Most of the time, people can't identify their actual problems,"" Puhn said of her work with distressed couples. ""And I think that's what we see between the president and the speaker."" Obama and Boehner and both political parties seem to be suffering from another affliction Puhn sees in struggling couples. ""If we're going to fight, let's have a good fight. ... Let's make our goal in a fight to reach a solution. The goal is not to win ... not to persuade your mate."" As a mediator, Puhn said, much of what she does is to control the environment where a couple is brainstorming tradeoffs between their sticking points on critical issues so that one spouse isn't given the opportunity to see the other's willingness to compromise as leverage or weakness. In so doing, Puhn often acts as a substitute for the trust between the couple that has broken down by the time they seek her help. Puhn said Obama and Boehner and Democrats and Republicans in Washington ""absolutely"" need a mediator whom both sides trust who can get them refocused from their entrenched positions to their underlying interests and goals. ""As a politician, you should be able to understand and mediate through what your interests are,"" Puhn said. ""And if you really can't move away from the words and the specific rules on the table and the (governmental) programs you're discussing, what it means is that you're truly just focused on what it's going to look like -- what the image is of whatever you agree to."" Suffering from sequester burnout? You're not alone .","Washington faced yet another fiscal deadline -- this time with no real effort to negotiate .

"(CNN) -- Latino voters went into the midterm election Tuesday feeling like bystanders in an American political process that is broken. An election eve poll of 5,000 Latinos who said they already had voted, or intended to vote, Tuesday was particularly telling -- more than half reported that no one had contacted them to ask for their vote. That's right, no one -- not a political campaign, not a candidate, not a community organization. Perhaps partly as a result, their motivation for voting was deeply personal, with more than a third saying they were voting to show their support for the Latino community rather than for a Democratic or Republican candidate. Such views are consistent with the research we have conducted at the NALEO Educational Fund over the past four years, among ""The Great Unengaged"" -- Latino U.S. citizens who are unlikely to vote because they believe the political system does not work for them and their families, and that political promises are made and easily broken. When they are engaged and asked to vote, they do so not for themselves, but for their families and community. This lack of engagement with the two parties did not stop NALEO Educational Fund projecting that 7.8 million Latinos would vote in this election, up from the 6.6 million who voted in 2010. And although it is too early to know if we hit that mark, we do know this much -- Latino voters are as angry about Washington paralysis as other Americans. (The lack of movement on immigration reform, an issue that for the second consecutive national election ranked as the No. 1 issue for Latino voters, was simply Exhibit A in a list of reasons why the community is frustrated). Yet the failure of lawmakers to address the key issues of interest for Latino voters is particularly perplexing when we look at what happens when politicians do take these voters into account. Colorado, one of the few states with both a large Latino electorate and a competitive Senate race, underscored how it is possible for candidates to reinvent themselves and win an election by softening their approach and addressing the issues of key importance to the Latino community. Cory Gardner, who had opposed immigration reform, was able to transform himself as a candidate by addressing the issues and focusing on compromise. Perhaps this helps explain why incumbent Mark Udall, who largely ignored the issue of immigration in hopes of not alienating non-Latinos, lost -- despite 71% of Latino voters polled in Colorado having said they would vote for him. Many likely felt disinclined to vote for Udall, reflecting the reality that Latino voters are not monolithic, and their vote is up for grabs if parties and candidates speak to their issues. Looking ahead to 2016, the campaign for the White House begins today, and a presidential election has a completely different dynamic than a mid-term election. As each of the past four presidential elections has demonstrated, the road to the White House goes through the Latino community, and amassing the required Electoral College votes requires victory in states where Latino voters make the difference. This was true in George W. Bush's successful elections in 2000 and 2004, just as it was for Barack Obama's campaigns in 2008 and 2012. What happens next in Washington on immigration reform, and the other top issues for Latino voters -- jobs and the economy, education and health care -- will set the stage for the next election. With this in mind, the next would-be president must not only reach out and directly connect with Latino voters on the issues that most matter to them, but also show that he, or she, is from a party that is able to deliver action as well.","Motivation for voting in midterms was deeply personal, says Arturo Vargas .
Many Latinos reported voting for community rather than for party candidate, he says .

"(CNN) -- Want to make Norman Rockwell roll over in his grave? This Thanksgiving, take your hand out of the turkey's body cavity and turn off the football game to make some new traditions with friends and family. A vegetarian yoga retreat or an ethnic food tour of the Lower East Side may seem like an unusual way to spend the Thanksgiving holiday, but making new traditions with those you love can be the perfect way to celebrate the holiday season. Here are six ways you can have the best unconventional Thanksgiving ever, whether you're ready to hop on a jet now or start making alternative plans for next year. Tradition: Arguing with family . Spin: Comedy show . If your extended family shares the same religious, political and sports beliefs, you can disregard this tip. (You might need to check that you haven't accidentally walked onto the set of ""Leave It to Beaver,"" because we don't actually believe you.) Getting a bunch of related, multigenerational people together in close quarters for an extended period of time is more likely to end up looking like something from a slasher film than from a ""Brady Bunch"" episode. The tension quotient rises even more if out-of-towners are staying with you for the holiday weekend. Relieve the tension and get some much-needed laughter by seeing a comedy show Thanksgiving weekend. ""America's Got Talent"" great Dan Naturman is performing at New York's Gotham Comedy Club the day after Thanksgiving. Or visit ""Mulaney"" star Seaton Smith at the Goodnights Comedy Club in Raleigh, North Carolina, for another chance to liven up the mood after Thanksgiving festivities are over. Plenty of other comedy clubs are open across the country. Really, what time of year do we need more stress relief than around the holidays? If they're closed, pelt the door with leftover turkey giblets. Tradition: Turkey coma . Spin: Costa Rican yoga retreat . For many people, simply hearing the word ""Thanksgiving"" evokes memories of too-tight waistbands and a four-hour food coma. While a feast can be a wonderful thing at any time of the year, shake things up during the holiday season by tightening your belt instead of loosening it. Explore stunning Costa Rica and bring harmony to your life with a calming yoga retreat. Blue Spirit Costa Rica's Yoga and Recovery Retreat focuses on healing from any and all addictions (turkey can certainly count as an addiction) through morning and afternoon Vinyasa classes and explorations of the surrounding natural landscape. When not meditating or perfecting yoga poses, you can try surfing, swimming, ziplining and whitewater rafting. Give your body a chance to detox from holiday goodies with the program's gourmet vegetarian cuisine and its Pure Food Option, which offers meals consisting of crisp greens, grains and legumes without oils or seasonings. Tradition: Lying on the couch . Spin: Pushups for charity . Food is supposed to give your body energy. If you're eating enough turkey (and stuffing and mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce and rolls and pumpkin pie) to send you into a motionless stupor after lunch, that's probably not healthy. Even if you can't imagine Thanksgiving without these delectable dishes, you can counterbalance some of the negative effects with some pre- and post-feast exercise. Turkey Trot marathons take place all over the country on Thursday, November 27. For an even less-conventional way to get your blood pumping during Thanksgiving week, try participating in Pushups for Charity, in which the North Texas town of Coppell holds an annual Turkey-Busting Workout to not only fend off the effects of rich holiday foods but to benefit those in need. Bring some canned goods and participate in a free trainer-led workout session to start the season off right. Tradition: Black Friday shopping . Spin: Thailand service trip . If you usually spend your Thanksgiving evening ripping items away from other people in the Black Friday department stores, stop for a minute. Do you even remember what you bought last year? Consider giving to others during a peaceful trip to Thailand to help preserve its natural elephant habitats. When you're not planting and harvesting sugarcane and grass or constructing shade shelters for Surin province's endangered animals, take Thai cooking classes and peruse the local outdoor markets. Volunteers become familiar with the elephants by feeding, walking and even bathing them. If the choice is between bathing an elephant and wrenching a 40%-off scarf out of someone's hand, is it really a choice? Tradition: Hours of football . Spin: Soccer match in Scotland . Although Americans traditionally sink back into their couches on Thanksgiving Day to cheer for whichever team has the most players on their fantasy teams, try enjoying a different kind of football with a trip to a Celtic FC match in Scotland. Sure, you'll miss such classic NFL matchups as the Lions-Bears, 49ers-Seahawks and Cowboys-Eagles. In Scotland, you can actually participate in the uproar of a professional sports game rather than passively watch it in a food coma on your couch. The Glasgow football -- soccer to Americans -- club is playing FC Salzburg on Thanksgiving Day. For 90 minutes of pure action with no pesky stoppages after every down and no padding when the players crash into each other, visit Scotland for a rousing good time in a country that doesn't take its alcohol lightly. Tradition: Eating traditional dishes . Spin: Post-Thanksgiving multiethnic tour . It's almost overwhelming how much time and energy we spend picking out, dressing, cooking and then carefully carving the fattest turkey we can find for Thanksgiving. Not to mention the string of turkey casseroles and sandwiches and soups that follow for weeks afterward. Turkey can be delicious, but how much do you really want to eat? For an exciting twist, join the post-Thanksgiving multiethnic eating tour on New York's Lower East Side. Explore the Jewish East Side, Chinatown and Little Italy with other foodies for some spices and flavors that you can't stuff inside a turkey cavity. While you stroll the city sampling mouthwatering street foods, be thankful that you aren't eating yet another can of wobbly cranberry sauce.","Make new Thanksgiving traditions this year .

"(CNN) -- The carnage from Syria's civil war continues to mount, with 184 people killed Wednesday, 100 of them in Damascus and its suburbs, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Here are the latest key developments in the spiraling conflict: . Diplomatic front: U.N.'s humanitarian chief ""extremely concerned"" The humanitarian situation in Syria has gotten worse, U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said Wednesday. Amos said she is ""extremely concerned that all parties of the conflict are failing to comply with international humanitarian law, which sets out clear rules on the protection of civilians. This conflict has taken on a particularly brutal and violent character."" The Syrian government estimates that 1.2 million people are sheltering in public buildings, and ""many more are staying with relatives and friends,"" Amos said. ""Both those who have fled and their hosts have urgent humanitarian needs due to the widening impact of the crisis on the economy and on people's livelihoods."" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has said it will let aid groups already in the country expand their operations but won't allow new aid to enter. The government is worried the aid would get into the hands of ""armed groups and terrorists,"" a phrase it has used to describe those seeking al-Assad's ouster. The flow of aid has hardly kept up with the pace of violence as scores of people are killed each day and medics resort to makeshift clinics and crude supplies to treat the wounded. The United Nations and its partners are reaching more people each month with food and emergency aid, Amos said. ""Last month, more than 820,000 people were fed,"" and in the first two weeks of August, basic necessities such as hygiene kits and blankets were distributed to more than 60,000 people. On the ground: the bulk of Wednesday's killings occurred near the capital . Nearly half of the 100 people reported killed Wednesday in the capital or its suburbs were killed in Al-qaboun, a neighborhood northeast of Damascus. A spokesman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees told CNN via Skype that pro-regime militias -- called Shabiha -- fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns randomly into houses. By the time they had withdrawn, 46 bodies were laying on the streets, said Omar Al-qabouni, the spokesman. He added that about 15 of the victims had been arrested in previous days, the rest had been seized earlier Wednesday from their houses. ""The bodies bear visible signs of bullets and stabbing wounds,"" Al-qabouni. The neighborhood is an opposition stronghold that has witnessed anti-regime protests since shortly after the civil war began in March 2011, and from which 70% of the residents have already fled, he said. ""The regime is trying to empty the neighborhood from its people so it can secure it,"" he said. Lena Al-Shami, an opposition activist in Damascus, told CNN via Skype that the regime's campaign against rebel strongholds also includes the Damascus neighborhoods of Kafr Susah, where two dozen people were executed Wednesday, and Nahr Aisha, where another nine were killed. Al-shami said shelling from government artillery and tanks represented a ""revenge campaign"" against residents for having sheltered opposition fighters and activists. The activist accounts matched those of other activist networks inside and outside Syria. Amateur videos and photographs posted on the Internet backed up their accounts, showing the bodies of men in what the video said was the Al-qaboun neighborhood. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the footage. In the town of Ariha, in Idlib province, fierce clashes broke out Wednesday between rebels and Syrian troops, according to the LCC. Syria, on state TV, said authorities clashed with ""terrorists"" in Hama suburbs, killed some and arrested many others. State-run news agency SANA said Syrian forces were ""severely hitting the mercenary terrorists in a number of neighborhoods in the city of Aleppo."" Before she was killed in a gun battle in Aleppo, Japanese journalist Mika Yamamoto spent her final moments filming in the besieged city. Her colleagues released her final footage Wednesday. ""They are shooting indiscriminately; they are dropping bombs onto the town from bombers onto people, running about one after the other, without discrimination,"" Yamamoto says in the video, shot Monday. After a single gunshot is heard, the footage ends. Watch the final footage . Wounded refugees enter Iraq . Fighting was under way Wednesday between Syrian forces and the rebel Free Syrian Army near the Iraqi border, in the Albu Kamal area, according to Iraqi army officers at the border. Rebels overtook some Syrian military posts in the area, but regime forces were working to regain control of the area, the officers said. Late Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, Iraqi security officers heard explosions that they identified as fire from tanks and heavy artillery used by Syrian military forces. The Free Syrian Army handed over to Iraqi authorities for treatment 25 casualties, including children and women, said Mahmoud Abu al-Taeib, deputy head of a refugee center in al-Qaim at the Iraqi border. The Iraqi army was on alert, he said. Nearly 4,000 Syrian refugees have crossed the border from Albu Kamal alone. The president's inner circle: Al-Assad's resignation can't be a condition for dialogue . If the West continues to insist on al-Assad's resignation, there is zero chance he'll negotiate with rebels, according to Syria's deputy prime minister. Requiring the resignation ""as a condition before dialogue means that there will be no dialogue,"" Qadri Jamil said Tuesday, according to Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency. ""If this issue is being imposed on us from abroad, it is a very dangerous precedent in international relations."" But the odds of a meaningful dialogue between the regime and rebels appear slim to begin with. The government has said it will offer amnesty to rebels who lay down their arms, but rebels say they can't let the regime's attacks continue without defending themselves and fighting back. The region: Fierce clashes ease in neighboring Tripoli, Lebanon . Sniper fire broke out Wednesday in two dueling neighborhoods in Tripoli: one dominated by Alawite Muslims, the other by Sunni Muslims. The Syrian civil war has aggravated decades-old quarrels between the Jabal Mohsen and Bab al Tabaneh neighborhoods, and factions supporting and opposing the uprising in Syria. Gun battles in Tripoli this week left seven people dead and dozens injured, Lebanese state-run media reported. The strife between Alawites and Sunnis in Tripoli mirrors the conflict in Syria, where al-Assad's regime is dominated by minority Alawites and the opposition is composed largely of Sunnis. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north. They were initially called in to help stop a brewing civil war but maintained a significant presence -- which once numbered 40,000 -- long afterward. In a country struggling to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects, resentment from the occupation lingers. Some Sunni Muslims staunchly oppose al-Assad and sympathize with the Sunni-led uprising in Syria that is calling for his ouster. Support for al-Assad is also plentiful, particularly in the south.

"(CNN) -- One day after Thanksgiving last year, my mother, brother, cousin and I gathered in my 87-year-old grandmother's room at the nursing home. We knew it would be one of the last times we would see her alive. She knew it, too. ""I don't know when, I don't know how, I don't know why,"" my grandmother Mary said that day. ""But I know one thing. God is going to take me home. He's going to take me home."" Home is comfortable: warm like a hug and familiar like the smell of my grandmother's seasoned greens. But so often the ease of intimacy slips into taking our loved ones for granted. It's what crossed my mind as I listened to her that day. What didn't I know about her life? What had I not said? How much of this moment would I remember? Grandmother Mary had not been able to sit at the Thanksgiving table that year, confined to a bed as she recovered after a medical procedure. We visited her on Thanksgiving and afterward to bring home to her. Two months later, she was dead. We knew that she knew how much we loved her. We made sure of it. But there is still the absence of an everyday presence that requires adjusting -- slippers found that bring back a story and smile, a song or smell that triggers a forgotten memory. For decades, our family had incorporated a friendly inquisition into our Thanksgiving gatherings, much to the amusement of guests. Friends, neighbors and travelers joined us, an ever-changing mosaic of characters. But a few traditions stayed the same. There would be an element of service -- volunteering at a soup kitchen, preparing meals to share, hosting those without homes, a visit to the less fortunate. And of course, delectable, savory food: sweet potato pie, yummy stuffing paired with cranberry sauce, gooey macaroni and cheese, luscious candied yams, soupy greens and warm, buttered rolls. I loved it all. But my favorite part of the meal had less to do with what we put in our mouths and more with what came out of them. We are a communicative family, but Thanksgiving always provided a special time to vocalize for what, and for whom we were grateful, and why. Around the table we went, naming the people, places and opportunities that we appreciated that year. It was an exercise in acknowledgment -- and patience. The lists could be long. My grandmother often had the longest list. She had a lot to be grateful for, and this year, these rituals will take on even more meaning as we hope to honor her life, and each other. Giving thanks . We start the meal with a prayer of gratitude for blessings past and present. The affirmation sets the stage for the appreciation of what we have, where we are and who helped us get there. Tell loved ones why you love them . It's often taken for granted that those closest to us know that we love them. But it is always nice to be reminded why. No matter how old we are, my parents still get excited when their children return for a visit. We kids like to roll our eyes, and sure, it can be a little embarrassing, but we love it. To have accepting parents that are demonstrative of their love -- no matter their shortcomings -- never gets old. Let loved ones get to know you . What's great about family is that they know you. What's frustrating about family is that they assume they know everything about you. It is the inevitable tension that comes with being known but still yearning to be discovered. In the past few years, our family added a new question to the Thanksgiving discussion: What's on your bucket list? My very grounded and sensible brother surprised us all when he shared that he wanted to skydive. Another mentioned a dream to write books, though they had worked in social work their entire life. The lovely surprise about this question is the novel things learned about those that are familiar: an opportunity to get to know who we think we know best all over again. Share how you want to be remembered . After the loss of our grandmother, this ritual will resonate even more this year: we share how we would like to be remembered. Perhaps because how we perceive ourselves can be different than how others do, this tends to be the most revealing and a window to how we might experience one another. ""Where we aim isn't where we always hit,"" my mother likes to say. Thus, those ""encouraging"" reminders may be taken as nagging. ""Keeping it real"" truth-telling can be experienced as criticism. Displays of affection can be seen as smothering. When all along, it might be that the intention was in the right place and simply misinterpreted. When we are gone, loved ones can only relive encounters with us via their memories. It can be hard to put into words, but sharing how you want to be remembered -- and living it -- is a gift to loved ones in the time we have together now. How would you like to be remembered? ""As a family man,"" my dad shared. Family, dear friends and cherished memories are what I will be remembering at Thanksgiving this year -- and what I hope to not soon forget.","The loss of a grandmother led to reflection on family and gratitude, Alicia Stewart writes .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Walking is one of the easiest ways to boost physical activity, but if you're like me, you probably don't do enough of it. The Fitbug calculates the steps you take and calories you burn. CNN's medical show ""Vital Signs"" recently launched a Facebook application that lets you share your health resolutions with your friends. I've pledged to walk more in 2009, but I haven't made much headway with that goal. Walking 10,000 steps a day is one of the ways many people choose to meet their recommended guidelines for physical activity as set out by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. I usually love walking, but London's dreary winter has me seriously lacking motivation. In a bid to get on track, I've decided to try out a step counter. The Fitbug is a smart pedometer -- it keeps track of your daily steps, and you can upload the stats onto your computer. Will this be the gadget that helps me break out of my winter gloom?  The expert's view . Pedometers have what researchers call a ""short feedback loop,"" which means they give you the opportunity to immediately impact the information they relay, according to Dr. Dena Bravata, a senior research scientist at Stanford University. Make a Health Pledge and let your friends support you . If you have a goal of walking 8,000 steps and your pedometer shows you're only halfway there -- you can take a stroll around the block and immediately you're closer to achieving your goal, she explains. A systematic review she conducted in 2007 on studies about pedometer use showed that participants who used a pedometer increased the number of steps they take per day by more than 2,000, when compared to people who didn't wear them. While many devices now offer high-tech features like data uploading, any simple step counter can be effective, Bravata says. The key is to maintain a record of your steps and set a specific goal. ""Having a step diary is clearly associated with greater improvements in physical activity. But there is no clear evidence that being able to upload that data makes pedometers more effective,"" she says.  Read about other health monitoring gadgets . My experience . Before I can get my Fitbug activated, I have to register it online and download some software. You synch up the Fitbug to your computer via a USB cable. The process if fairly painless and straightforward. I set up a login, am prompted to name my Bug and take a health questionnaire. After that's completed, I'm ready to get walking. Despite being described as pocket-sized, the Fitbug isn't exactly sleek. I try clipping it to the pocket of my jeans but find it too clunky and instead settle on keeping it in my bag. I don't have much time to keep an eye on my daily progress, so it's a good thing when I receive a text message from Fitbug reminding me to upload my stats. When I do, I'm fairly surprised at the results. I've always thought of myself as a fairly active person, but that's clearly not the case. There isn't one day where I've broken 10,000 steps. I start to get in the habit of checking my Bug a few times a day and even modify the route I take to work to get some extra mileage in. The verdict . I'd never really thought about how many steps I take each day and it definitely made me aware of how little I move around, especially when I'm in the office. Although, I wish the Bug was slimmer -- sometimes I'd forget to tote my bag with me -- so I lost out on some critical steps. I'm not good about keeping a step diary, so being able to upload my information definitely made life much easier. Plus, the Bug holds your data for up to two weeks before it is overwritten. The device offers many bells and whistles that an ordinary pedometer doesn't. It calculates the calories you burn, you can maintain a food log on the site and there are also online forums where Fitbug users can share their stories and questions. But it also costs more than your average step counter. It's sold on a subscription basis -- for $140 (or £84 for members in the U.K.) you get the pedometer and a 12-month subscription. If you have time to make the most of all the special features, the Fitbug is a worthwhile investment. Otherwise, an ordinary pedometer and a notepad will do just fine.","Pedometers are an easy way to increase your level of physical activity.

"(CNN) -- The question of whether there should be American boots on the ground to fight ISIS in Iraq came up again Sunday after President Barack Obama said that despite his earlier vow not to commit U.S. combat forces there, he wasn't ruling out the possibility if confronted with the worst-possible situation. ""There are always circumstances in which the United States might need to deploy ground troops,"" Obama said at the G20 Summit in Australia. ""If we discovered that ISIL had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon, and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes, you can anticipate that not only would [Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin] Dempsey recommend me sending U.S. ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it."" The comments -- along with the release Sunday of an ISIS video depicting the aftermath of the beheading of American hostage Peter Kassig -- reignited the debate on the Sunday morning talk shows. ""I will tell you many of us feel, I think the American people feel, it would be a serious mistake for us to make a commitment of land troops into these theaters,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, told Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, however, thought Obama was wrong in ruling out sending U.S. ground troops, saying on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" ""You don't tell the enemy exactly what you plan on doing or what you won't do."" ""As a result of the mistakes that have been made in the past on the President's part, we now have terrible visions being shown on TV and of course a threat to ourselves here in the homeland,"" Romney said. ""And the right course for this nation is to do whatever it takes to destroy and defeat ISIS."" Dempsey has suggested at least twice that he would recommend U.S. ground troops if he felt they were needed, although he has emphasized he has not yet decided it's necessary to do so. Durbin, when asked whether he would support troops if the current strategy is not enough, replied, ""I can tell you there are many who are anxious to send troops forward, I am not one of them.""","President Obama lays out a worst-case scenario in which ISIS gains a nuclear weapon .

"(CNN) -- The alleged ringleader of a group of Florida A&M University marching band students who beat drum major Robert Champion Jr. in a 2011 hazing incident was convicted Friday of multiple charges related to Champion's death, according to CNN affiliate CFN13, which was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. A jury found former band member Dante Martin, 27, guilty of manslaughter and felony hazing after just an hour of deliberations, charges that could carry a sentence of more than 20 years in prison. ""Mr. Martin having been found guilty as charged, you are adjudicated guilty on these counts, on all four counts of the information as charged. You are remanded to the custody of the Orange County sheriff to be taken to the Orange County jail,"" Circuit Judge Renee Roche said as she delivered the jury's verdict in the case. ""I won't get my son back, but no one wins here. So there should be sadness all the way around for everyone, and we hope and pray to continue our mission to eradicate hazing -- to end it,"" Champion's mother, Pamela Champion, told CNN affiliate WFTV. Champion, 26 of Decatur, Georgia, died after a band hazing ritual in which he was beaten aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida. The initiation requires pledges to run down the center of the bus while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. A medical examiner ruled Champion's death a homicide, saying he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows and internal bleeding from the beating. Champion died in the parking lot within an hour of the assault. Martin is scheduled for sentencing on January 9, 2015. FAMU famed marching band, known as the Marching 100, was suspended for the 2012-13 school year after Champion's death. The college pledged to make reforms and address hazing both on and off campus. FAMU is one of the nation's top university marching bands, famous for its elaborate dance formations and innovative style.

"(CNN) -- Brad Paisley has never shied away from controversial topics in his music: Alcohol helps white people dance. Celebrities can act like fools because people think they're cool. Real guys don't get ""manicured, waxed and botoxed."" But he may have gone a step too far at the Country Music Awards Wednesday night and become one of his own song titles: an ""accidental racist."" Paisley let viewers know that they wouldn't be seeing the new ABC comedy ""Blackâ€¢ish"" that evening -- they'd be watching ""white-ish."" Social media was undecided on whether his dig at country music's predominantly white stars (and predominantly white fan base) was funny or racist. Paisley also ""blew it"" by announcing the sex of Carrie Underwood's baby on stage, though we're pretty sure that one was planned. If he's to be believed, Underwood and her husband, hockey player Mike Fisher, are having a boy. And they could potentially name him Garth, after Garth Brooks. Of course, there were some awards given out during the show as well. Luke Bryan was awarded entertainer of the year. The reigning power couple of country music, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert, took home male vocalist and female vocalist of the year. In doing so, Lambert set a record for most consecutive wins in that category. Little Big Town also wowed viewers with a performance of their hit ""Day Drinking"" and their light-up outfits -- but surprised no one when they won vocal group of the year. And ""Don't Ya"" singer Brett Eldredge took home new artist of the year.

"(CNN) -- Lake Providence, Louisiana, is the parish seat of the ""most unequal place in America,"" meaning it has a higher rate of income inequality than any other parish or county. And until somewhat recently, the poor side of town was missing a key Google Maps feature. I visited the place last year for a CNN Change the List story, and it was immediately obvious the barrier between rich and poor is both economic and geographic. There's an oxbow lake -- Lake Providence -- that divides a largely rich white neighborhood from a primarily poorer black one. I was surprised to find there's not all that much interaction between each side of the lake, which I found reflective of a national ""empathy gap."" After the story published, a reader flagged for me the fact that, at the time, you couldn't search the poor side of Lake Providence using Google Street View. The poor side of town was invisible in that way. I noticed last week that that's now changed, praise be to Google! I'm not sure why, since the company's press office hasn't answered my questions about it. But I'm pleased, no matter what the reason. I think one issue with poverty in America is that it's too often unseen, regardless of what columnist Paul Krugman thinks. That Google left the poor side of Lake Providence without Street View probably wasn't intentional, but it was highly symbolic. I'm glad that neighborhood is now included -- not so people can gawk at it but so it's on even technological footing with the richer side. And so it exists. Here's how Google explained the omission in November: ""We try to cover as many streets as possible but occasionally we miss the odd one or two -- for example there may have been road work that day, a street may have been inaccessible or simply because of human error our drivers may have missed a street,"" a spokeswoman said in an email to me. ""It's also possible that we did drive a certain street, but discovered that when processing the imagery, the photographs collected did not meet our high quality imagery standards due to unforeseeable challenges like shadows, poor visibility conditions, etc. Hopefully we can come back and photograph it at a future date."" ""It wasn't for any reason about the demographics or anything like that -- or it being a poor area,"" spokeswoman Susan Cadrecha added at the time. ""That does not factor into our decisions in any way to map areas. We're constantly updating this imagery and we're constantly trying to make it as accurate as possible. ... We want the whole world to be mapped, that's our eventual goal. We want people to be able to explore different areas."" In other Lake Providence news, volunteers this year finished painting a hopeful mural near the center of town. It shows an image of Dede Willis, a college student who was featured at the start of the video I produced with CNN's Edythe McNamee. Pretty amazing. I hope to learn more about progress in Lake Providence in coming months. And the Census Bureau tells me it is scheduled to release new data on income inequality by county in December, which may offer new insight.","East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, has the highest income inequality in the nation .
The parish seat, Lake Providence, has a lake that divides rich from poor .

He writes that that's since changed; he applauds Google, whatever the reason ."
"(CNN) -- Welcome to the world of rock and roll racing. ""He loves the noise, he knows he's a star, he poses for the photographs,"" trainer Art Sherman --part of the team behind California Chrome, favorite for Saturday's Kentucky Derby -- tells CNN. ""Pure and simple he's a rock star."" California Chrome's joint owner Steve Coburn is even more effusive. ""We've got one elderly gentleman who comes to the races who has a jackass tattoo on his shoulder,"" explains Coburn, a nod to the jackass on California Chrome's racing silks. ""Fans don't do that unless you're a rock star. People flock where he goes."" The equine equivalent of a musical superstar is also the main protagonist in a fairytale on a par with the great Seabiscuit, the diminutive thoroughbred racehorse which defied the odds and delighted a depression-hit U.S. and whose story was turned into a movie 11 years ago. California Chrome must surely have Hollywood executives salivating at the prospect of how events might unfold at at Churchill Downs' historic dirt track in Louisville this weekend. The three-year-old colt's remarkable tale began in the womb of Love the Chase, a mare that Coburn and co-owner Perry Martin bought for $8,000 with a view to breeding. They bred her to the stallion Lucky Pulpit for a reduced fee of $2,000, the first breeding the novice pair had ever undertaken. It could have been a case of first time lucky as their offspring has earned Coburn and Perry more than $1 million in prize money and chalked up illustrious wins at the Santa Anita Derby, San Felipe Stakes and California Cup Derby. His recent run of success -- four wins in his last four outings -- has marked California Chrome out as a pre-race favorite for the Kentucky Derby -- the first race in horse racing's coveted Triple Crown, which also includes the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes -- in the chase for a purse of $2m. Understandably, the horse's value has rocketed, and is now estimated to be around $12m. Coburn and Martin were recently offered $6m for a controlling 51% stake in the horse, which they turned down. The whole story is so fanciful that the horse-owning partnership goes under the name Dumb Ass Partnership or DAP Racing, hence the jackass on their colors. ""When Perry and I bought the filly, one of the barn hands said we must be dumb asses to get into this game and hence the name,"" Coburn explains to CNN. But through every strand and sinew there is a heart-warming tale behind California Chrome. For a start, he races in the purple and green, the favorite colors of the duo's respective wives. Then there's the location where the horse has been stabled. His neighbours at Los Alamitos racecourse in Orange County are predominantly quarter horses, named for the quarter mile horse races that are regularly held at the track where California Chrome is exercised at 7.30 am every morning. If California Chrome wins the Derby he will also become the first California-trained horse to win since Decidedly's success in 1962. Then there is the small matter of his 77-year-old trainer Sherman, who has just 15 horses in his yard but whose history with the Derby dates back to 1955. Back then, Sherman acted as the exercise rider for race winner Swaps, who also happens to feature in the distant bloodline of California Chrome. Sherman, far younger and more energetic than his years would suggest, recalls: ""I was barely 18 years old and my memories are a little bit different now. Back then I was so young, it didn't mean so much. ""I've put 60 years into this business and I thought my chance in the Kentucky Derby had gone. You never say never. ""Now I've got another chance. It's a fairytale and I do believe in fate. He'll be the horse to beat. He's been awesome these last four races, we just hope he has five in him. But it's a different ball game when 150,000 people are screaming at you. But he's a rock star isn't he? That shouldn't be a problem. ""He just loves to run, he'll run all day long. We just need some luck, that plays a big part in such a story. His story is just like that of Seabiscuit isn't it? It'd be a hell of a book or a movie if he pulls it off."" Sherman's first win as a jockey aptly came at Hollywood Park in 1957, where his current wonder horse first announced himself in the big time with victory in last year's King Glorious Stakes. That he should have ever got here bred by Martin, who works for a consumer safety firm, and Coburn, whose company JCP Enterprises makes the magnetic strips on credit cards, is remarkable, bearing in mind this is the first horse that Coburn has ever raced. ""One of the things on mine and my wife's bucket list was to go to the Kentucky Derby,"" he says. ""I'll board the plane this year but I never imagined I'd do it with a horse I own. ""This whole thing is a fairytale coming true, it's a dream. It's better than a movie script because it's coming true. People spend millions on horses each year and we've spent basically $10,000."" The horse's name was also literally picked out of a hat as the two owners and their spouses each put a name into a hat for a waitress at a Californian restaurant to select. The Derby favorite could just as easily have been called Lucky at Love or Big Chapter but Coburn's pick, California Chrome -- a nod to the white markings that are called chrome by horse racing aficionados -- proved the selection.

""We've worked hard for this, similarly Love the Chase, which someone offered $1.5m for. This isn't about the money, this is about the dream and we want to finish off that dream."" Whether that dream reaches fruition in Illinois this weekend is another matter. Some pre-race rain is a slight concern for Sherman and his team but Coburn has never once wavered in his expectation.

"(CNN) -- Japanese car manufacturer Honda is returning to Formula One in 2015 as an engine partner with British racing team McLaren, a deal which will renew one of the most successful partnerships in motorsport's elite class. Their previous five-year collaboration powered Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost to a clean sweep of world titles between 1988 and 1992. The 1988 car, the McLaren-Honda MP/4, has gone down in F1 legend after winning all but one of the 16 races that season. Honda ran its own team from 2006 until the end of 2008 when it dramatically withdrew from the sport because of the global economic crisis. There is currently no Japanese representation in F1 and Honda's comeback to the grid with the multi-year McLaren technology partnership will mark an important step for the island nation, which has a long and successful history in motorsport. ""It's fantastic news for everyone who loves Formula One to be able to welcome Honda back,"" said McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh as the news was announced in Tokyo. ""Together, we're about to embark on a new and extremely exciting chapter in McLaren's history. Together we have a great legacy -- and we're utterly committed to maintaining it. ""Like McLaren, Honda is a company with motor racing woven into the fabric of its heritage. Whilst both companies are fully aware that we're embarking on a very demanding journey together, we're hugely committed to the success of the partnership. ""We'll spend the next 18 months working together to ensure that we're fully established and competitive ahead of our first grand prix together in 2015."" McLaren has used Mercedes-Benz engines since 1995 and will honor its contract with the German company -- which now owns the defunct Honda F1 team -- to use its equipment in 2014. Hybrid technologies . Next season will see the FIA -- motorsport's governing body -- introduce major new rule changes affecting engine technology. The new regulations include the introduction of a 1.6-liter turbo engine with increased reliance on the hybrid kinetic energy recovery system known as KERS. Takanobu Ito, president and CEO of the Honda Motor Company, said the chance to explore new technologies in elite racing was one of the attractions of returning to F1. ""Ever since its establishment, Honda has been a company which grows by taking on challenges in racing,"" Ito said. ""Honda has a long history of advancing our technologies and nurturing our people by participating in the world's most prestigious automobile racing series. ""The new F1 regulations with their significant environmental focus will inspire even greater development of our own advanced technologies and this is central to our participation in F1. ""We have the greatest respect for the FIA's decision to introduce these new regulations that are both highly challenging but also attractive to manufacturers that pursue environmental technologies."" Many engine manufacturers see F1 as an opportunity to showcase the hybrid technologies they are developing on their road cars. Japanese renewal . The return of Honda means there will be four car manufacturers supplying engines to F1 in 2015, the others being France's Renault, Italian luxury brand Ferrari and the Daimler-owned Mercedes. Honda blamed the economic crisis for its decision to pull its team out of F1 in 2008 with then Honda president Takeo Fukui saying in an emotional press conference: ""This difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry ... and the sudden contraction of the world economies."" The new venture with McLaren is important for Japanese motorsport and for the country, which is still regaining confidence following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Japan is the world's third-largest car manufacturer behind China and the U.S. and in 2011 Honda's operations were severely disrupted by the disaster. Returning to F1 also represents an opportunity to restore confidence in both the brand and the Japanese motorsport industry. The economic downturn also affected motorcycle manufacturer Suzuki, which pulled out of the MotoGP Series following Kawasaki's withdrawal in 2009. Honda first entered a works team in F1 in 1964 but withdrew at the end of the 1968 season following the death of Jo Schlesser, who had been driving a prototype vehicle at the French Grand Prix. The company returned to F1 in 1984, providing turbo engines to Williams before agreeing a partnership to supply McLaren. In 2004 Honda bought a stake in the BAR team before taking sole ownership ahead of the 2006 season. The highlight of this second era running its own team was Jenson Button's win at the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. The company had poured huge amounts of capital into F1 and ironically the team was on the verge of great success before pulling out in 2008. Team principal Ross Brawn led a rescue package to buy out the team and continue work on Honda's 2009 car design -- the car would help Button win the world drivers' title and the constructors' championship for Brawn GP that season. Mercedes then bought the team, based in Oxfordshire, England, in 2010 and it is once again on an upward curve, taking three pole positions and two third-places on the podium so far in 2013. F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone has now backed Honda to return to the front of the grid in partnership with McLaren, which lost former world champion Lewis Hamilton to Brawn's Mercedes team after last season and has struggled this year. ""It is a great pleasure to see Honda back in Formula One,"" he said. ""Their engine technology and passion for motorsport make them a natural contender.""","Japanese car giant Honda will return to Formula One as an engine supplier in 2015 .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- A shell landed near a school as children began their school year in the war-weary eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on Wednesday morning, killing at least three adults and shattering what would have been a step toward normalcy for dozens of students. Shells also hit a public transit bus in the city about the same time, killing six people in or near the vehicle, city officials said. The shelling in Donetsk, held for months by pro-Russian rebels, came despite a ceasefire that Ukraine's government reached with separatist leaders last month. A shell landed 5 meters from Donetsk's School 57 about 10 a.m., shattering windows and doors on the first and second floors, local officials said. It was the first day of the school year in rebel-controlled areas of the Donetsk region, a debut that was delayed by a month because of shelling and clashes between separatists and the Ukrainian military. Conflicting reports emerged over how many people were killed at the school. Officials at the rebel-held city office said a biology teacher and two parents died, and five other people were injured.","Shells hit a school and a public transit bus in rebel-held Donetsk, Ukraine, officials say .

"(CNN) -- ""What do you call a Lada driver with a speeding ticket? A liar."" Kimi Raikkonen might not have heard that old joke about the much-maligned car, an icon of the Soviet era, but it might give him a chuckle. ""I had a Russian Lada,"" the Formula One star revealed as he took CNN's The Circuit for a spin in a flashy sports car provided by his team Ferrari. ""I got it from a friend of ours. We changed the engine. It was perfect for us -- free of charge and a very robust car. ""It was red but we painted it black. It never broke down."" The Finn now drives one of the world's fastest vehicles on the F1 racetrack -- which he definitely wouldn't be allowed to paint black -- but the down-to-earth approach of his first car beautifully sums up his underlying normality. The man they call the ""Iceman"" is Formula One's most reluctant star. The 34-year-old is known for his succinct, cool answers when facing the media. And while he doesn't say much, he often says what he thinks. Perhaps his most famous admission came in 2006 when he explained he missed the presentation for the retiring Michael Schumacher, the man he was going to replace at Ferrari the following year, because he was in the bathroom -- or words to that effect. Then there are the off-track headlines, like the time he was filmed falling off a boat during a party. Raikkonen's pithy comments and antics have made him a cult icon among F1 fans but he insists he would rather stay out of the spotlight. ""It'd be perfect to lead a normal life where nobody notices you,"" he tells CNN. ""But obviously you cannot have both. ""Racing and driving is the main thing but there's a lot of other stuff that comes with it. ""I've been long enough in the business to know that it's a big part of it. For me, it's not much fun. ""I'm not a big fan of going places and showing off, I'd rather do my own things. I never try to hide it because it is how it is."" Unlike many other drivers on the grid, Raikkonen is also refreshingly honest about his childhood ambitions while growing up in the city of Espoo. ""I wouldn't say I wanted to become a Formula One driver straight away,"" he explains. ""I actually started out with motocross when I was a small boy and then go-karts. It was good fun and you start wanting more. ""But I still didn't believe that I would even make it to F1 because we didn't have the money. ""I just thought I'd do karts for as long as possible and then do something else."" That something else was two titles in the British Formula Renault Championship. After just 23 races, Raikkonen was signed up by Sauber and fast-tracked into F1 for the 2001 season. He won his first grand prix with McLaren in 2003 and his first and only world title with Ferrari in 2007 before the Italian team effectively paid up the rest of his salary to bring in Fernando Alonso for the 2010 season. Officially retired from F1, Raikkonen flexed his driving muscles in the World Rally Championships and got behind the wheel for two NASCAR races. His team radio in the U.S. series endeared him to new fans with such quotable outbursts as: ""I don't understand how this car can be so hot. My ass is even burning in here."" ""I really enjoy the whole NASCAR thing,"" Raikkonen recalls. ""It's just completely different and fun. It was a good experience. ""Hopefully I can do more (races) some day. I've said I'd like to do some more rallies in the future."" For now, F1's reluctant star is focused on finishing his second spell in the sport with Ferrari, having returned to Maranello after two seasons with Lotus in which he re-established himself on the grid despite the team's financial problems. With two wins and 15 podiums he became hot property, and replaced Felipe Massa at the home of the ""Prancing Horse."" The 34-year-old, who has struggled with an under-performing car this season, says he plans to finish his career with the Italian marque but is giving nothing away on when exactly that might be. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel is expected to sign for Ferrari next year, with Alonso tipped to return to McLaren. ""I have a contract for next year and probably for one more year,"" Raikkonen says. ""But I'm not a young guy anymore. ""I want to do something more with my life than just Formula One. I will finish my career in Ferrari. ""I never lost the passion. I will stop the day when I feel I don't enjoy it anymore."" A new chapter is about to begin for Raikkonen in the near future when his girlfriend Minttu Virtanen gives birth to their first child. ""The biggest challenge will be with a family,"" he says. ""That will take a lot of time and effort."" Asked if he would encourage his child to follow him into motor racing, he gives a typically direct and definitive ""No!"" Raikkonen might not be keen on small talk but he is looking forward to discussing fatherhood with Vettel, his closest friend in F1, who became a father to a baby daughter earlier this year. ""The guy I have most to do with outside of racing is Vettel,"" he says. ""The rest I don't really see as friends, I race against them. ""He's just a normal guy and it's an easy relationship."" On the subject of sharing baby tips with the German, Raikkonen adds: ""Yes, he has more experience..."" He might be one of F1's most-enigmatic and best-loved stars, and still among the highest earners, but in many ways he has stayed true to his roots. ""I have normal cars,"" he explains. ""Maybe when I was young I was a bit more like, 'This nice car, I want to have this and drive this.' ""Not anymore. I drive normal cars without people noticing me, so it makes my life easy.""

"(CNN) -- Japanese authorities are putting new pressure on the owner of the meltdown-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after its admission that highly radioactive water from the site has been seeping into groundwater and the harbor off the plant. A top official said Tuesday that the government wanted the problem solved ""as soon as possible,"" while an official at Japan's nuclear regulatory agency told Reuters on Monday that the issue was an ""emergency."" Three reactors melted down at Fukushima Daiichi after the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011. The result was the worst nuclear accident since the Soviet Union's Chernobyl incident in 1986. The meltdown complicated an already historic disaster. Scientists have pointed to ongoing high radiation levels in the waters off the plant for more than a year to warn of an ongoing leak. The Tokyo Electric Power Company admitted to the problem in July, disclosing that it had found high concentrations of reactor byproducts tritium, cesium-137 and strontium-90 in test wells and in the harbor outside the coastal power plant. ""It's a present reality that the contaminated water is seeping out to the bay without us being able to control it,"" Masayuki Ono, TEPCO's acting nuclear power chief, said this week. ""This is an extremely serious issue we must tackle."" Fukushima tuna study finds miniscule health risks . Ono said the company has built an underground barrier to prevent contaminated groundwater from reaching the sea, but it's a difficult problem. ""We think we are containing the movement of contaminated water in general, but there is a risk of excess water going around or coming over the barrier,"" he said. TEPCO has been struggling to manage vast quantities of contaminated water at the plant since the tsunami, which swamped the facility. It's still pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the plant to cool the crippled reactors, though most of that is recycled. The problem now is what to do with groundwater that's leaking into the damaged basements of the reactor buildings and passing out contaminated, said Michael Friedlander, a former nuclear plant operator and engineer. Radiation damaged more souls than bodies . ""Instead of fixing the wall in the basement to stop the groundwater leakage, they can't because the building is uninhabitable,"" he said. The result is the company is having to store the radioactive water in massive tank farms built around the site -- a makeshift solution with no good permanent fix, Friedlander said. ""Over time, they've had radioactive water leaks on the property and there's probably no question there is some seepage from the buildings themselves,"" he said. ""At the end of the day you have radioactive materials in places where they're not supposed to be,"" and that contamination ""will migrate into places you don't want it."" The issue drew a sharp response this week from an official at Japan's Nuclear Regulatory Authority, a new agency created in the wake of the disaster. Shinji Kinjo, the head of an NRA task force, told Reuters on Monday that TEPCO's ""sense of crisis is weak."" ""Right now, we have an emergency,"" he said. Man who battled Japan's nuclear meltdown dies . And Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said Tuesday that the government wants to see the problem fixed quickly. ""We are going to put our full efforts toward resolving the issues,"" Suga said. Sampling results disclosed in July showed concentrations of tritium in one well as high as 500,000 bequerels -- a unit of radioactive intensity -- per liter of water. By comparison, Japan's maximum safe level of radioactivity in drinking water for adults is 300 bequerels per liter. Ken Buesseler, a U.S. marine chemist, was one of the scientists who raised alarms about ongoing contamination early on. Buesseler told CNN that building new groundwater barriers is may be a futile effort. Google maps show Fukushima nuclear ghost town . ""Think of groundwater like a river,"" he said. ""If there's a flow to the ocean, you can put up a dam, but eventually it's going to go up and over it or around to the sides ... It flows from higher to lower, and the ocean's the low point."" And Friedlander said that may leave TEPCO and Japan's government with two choices sure to stoke further public anger: ""You can either dump it in the ocean, or you can evaporate it."" ""At the end of the day, collecting 400 tons of water every single day is not a sustainable solution,"" he said. Federal officials allowed the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst American nuclear accident, to let contaminated water evaporate, Friedlander said -- but TMI was nowhere near the scale of the Fukushima disaster. ""We're in uncharted territory here,"" he said. Japan signs deal with Turkey to build nuclear plant .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan toddler has died of enterovirus D68, another reminder of the deadly potential of a disease that has infected hundreds nationwide in two months. Madeline Reid died at Children's Hospital of Michigan, where she had been transferred ""for advanced services,"" according to the Detroit hospital's chief medical officer, Dr. Rudolph Valentini. ""The CDC confirmed EV-D68 after her arrival here, and she subsequently succumbed to her illness,"" Valentini said. A Facebook page, dubbed ""Team Maddie!,"" devoted to the 21-month-old's plight also confirmed the sad news. ""Madeline Reid became our angel at 2:55 p.m. (Friday),"" read one post. ""She passed peacefully in her mother and father's arms."" The little girl's death spurred an outpouring of condolences online, from ""rest in peace sweet baby girl"" to ""enjoy your wings."" One of them read: ""Your daughter touched more lives than you'll probably ever know. May your Angel rest now."" Enterovirus is very common, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States. But like the flu or other viruses, not all the roughly 100 enterovirus strains are the same. D68 is particularly pernicious. Authorities say this strain has sent more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illness. It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems. Yet there are exceptions, such as a 4-year-old from Hamilton Township, New Jersey, who went to bed ""asymptomatic and fine"" only to be found dead the next morning, said Jeff Plunkett, Hamilton Township health officer. Boy went to bed fine, didn't wake up -- due to enterovirus D68 . Enterovirus may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness in Colorado, Boston and Michigan. Doctors in Colorado spotted it first: a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter . Staff at Boston Children's Hospital have since identified four patients with the same symptoms. And a child in Washtenaw County, Michigan, has also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus, according to the Michigan Department of Community Health. Parents growing anxious about enterovirus D68 . As of Friday, the CDC and state public health laboratories had documented 691 cases of enterovirus D68 in 46 states and the District of Columbia. Five patients who died had the virus strain, even if it's not certain all of them died because of it. Madeline's case is not yet counted in this tally. There will be more cases, and perhaps more deaths, in the coming weeks, officials said. Part of this has to do with a backlog on samples, with the CDC explaining ""it can take a while ... because the testing is complex and slower and can only be done by (the) CDC and a small number of state public health laboratories."" The virus also has not yet run its course. As the CDC pointed out, ""Enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall. We're currently in the middle of the enterovirus season.""

"(CNN) -- The 1970s were the first full decade after civil rights legislation all but obliterated racial segregation in the United States. And it was in large part because of this great sea change that a bright, bold flowering of African-American popular culture affecting music, movies, fashion, television, sports and literature burst forth, its impact resonating with a breadth and force that had never been witnessed before -- or seen since. Don Cornelius, who was found dead Wednesday, at age 75, in his Los Angeles home, was one of the significant figures of this transformative era. As the creator and longtime host of the TV music-and-dance show, ""Soul Train,"" Cornelius took an established broadcast genre of dancing teenagers, hit records and live performances by pop stars and infused it with assertively African-American style and attitude so electrifying that its appeal crossed racial, ethnic and even generational lines. As filmmaker Melvin Van Peebles helped set off the black-movie boom with 1971's ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song""; as Richard Pryor's ribald, so-real-it's-surreal stand-up comedy hit its stride by mid-decade; as Alex Haley's 1976 epic family saga ""Roots"" became the keystone to a nationwide phenomenon whose culminating TV miniseries is still talked about 35 years later, so did Cornelius establish, through ""Soul Train,"" a crucial gauge for pop music's ebb and flow that no one in the entertainment business could ignore. The elite of late-20th century black pop musicians, from Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, James Brown, Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Diana Ross and Gladys Knight, to the Jackson Five, O'Jays, Spinners, Gap Band and Commodores took live turns on the ""Train"" -- and frequently delivered some of their more potent televised performances. Eventually, white artists such as Elton John, David Bowie, Sting and Robert Palmer played on the ""Soul Train"" stage. Though he wisely never made himself more conspicuous than the music or the dancers, Cornelius' buttery smooth baritone, colorful attire -- though relatively understated when compared to the dancers' flashy duds -- and avuncular presence provided an anchor for the show's dazzling grooves and slick moves. He also became something of a star himself, making appearances at live concerts and political gatherings looking to share some of the youthful energy he presided over as host from 1970 to 1993. Other TV shows may have had live acts. But if you wanted to know how to move your body to funk, disco and soul music, ""Soul Train"" provided the first and best lesson for much of its long and legendary run. Fred Astaire, in a ""60 Minutes"" interview, said he was a ""Soul Train"" fan. One imagines the great man studying and perhaps even attempting many of those moves. If you were a true dance aficionado, you waited every week for the ""'Soul Train line"" in which improbably limber young couples enacted breathtaking inventories of what would become known as ""breaking"" and ""popping."" Before he became an innovator, the Chicago-born Cornelius sold insurance for Golden State Mutual Life for $250 a week. In 1966, he decided to change his destiny, and reduce his salary by $200, to work as a substitute disc jockey, news reader and interviewer at WVON radio. Within two years, he had acquired enough facility as a broadcaster to secure an on-camera job as sports anchor on Chicago's WCIU-TV show, ""A Black's View of the News."" With his own money, Cornelius produced a pilot episode of an all-black version of Dick Clark's venerable ""American Bandstand"" to be telecast on WCIU. He had trouble interesting sponsors until the locally based Sears Roebuck & Co. expressed interest, believing the show could boost its record sales. The program, dubbed ""Soul Train,"" debuted in 1970, achieving such formidable ratings among the city's black community that it was nationally syndicated the next year. Cornelius not only served as ""Soul Train's"" host, but was also responsible for drumming up advertisers and seeking more stations nationwide. Some of these advertisers were black-oriented companies such as Johnson Products Co., the beauty specialists behind Afro-Sheen hair spray. By mid-decade, ""Soul Train"" had powered its way to more than 100 markets. By the time it ceased production in 2006, after a series of guest hosts, ""Soul Train"" had become one of the longest running syndicated television programs in history. One wonders whether it's possible in this digitized age to build a cultural phenomenon from the ground up as Cornelius did. If so, his example of chutzpah and daring will serve as the template for future dreamers and cultural mavens to follow. That, along with the blend he suavely, fervently prescribed to his audiences week after week at the end of each ""Train"": ""Love! Peace! And -- all together now -- Soul!""

"(CNN) -- First, Air Canada decided to suspend all of its flights to Venezuela in late March. And now, Alitalia is following suit. In a statement sent to CNN, the Italian airline says that it's suspending the flights ""due to the ongoing critical currency situation in Venezuela,"" which is ""no longer economically sustainable."" The suspension goes into effect on June 2. For the last 11 years, Venezuela has tightly controlled all cash flow within its borders. Under the Venezuelan system, all money collected in ticket sales has to be deposited into an account controlled by the government. No funds can be withdrawn from the account without permission from the officials who control it. The government sets exchange rates for different sectors of the economy, according to priorities also set by officials. ""The bottom line is the airlines are asking for their money; the money that they've earned for services provided in transporting passengers from and to Venezuela. Unfortunately, again, the government is holding that money and not releasing it to the airlines,"" said Peter Cerda, regional vice president for the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines around the world. He calls the situation ""an urgent issue."" In an interview with CNN, Cerda said Alitalia is not the only airline facing problems. In fact, he says, Venezuela owes 24 airlines around the world a combined $4 billion. Cerda also says in the last year, 11 other airlines have reduced their number of flights to and from Venezuela for the same reason. This year, Colombia's Avianca has reduced itineraries by more than two-thirds. Other airlines represented by the International Air Transport Association are considering suspending all flights to Venezuela. ""We may begin to see a trend of other airlines following suit because simply an airline cannot continue to operate if they're not going to be paid for their services,"" Cerda said. The International Air Transport Association has been in negotiations with the Venezuelan government for the last six months. The last meeting happened a month and a half ago, according to Cerda. He says that even though officials have given them assurances they will make arrangements to pay, they have yet to see a proposal in writing. Discussions to pay off the debt have involved a combination of payments in fuel, cash and bonds. CNN reached out to the Venezuelan officials for comment about Alitalia's decision, but a spokesman said there's no official reaction yet. Addressing the issue in late March, President Nicolas Maduro didn't sound very conciliatory. ""Airlines have no excuse to reduce flights to Venezuela. I will take severe measures against any airline that does so. If an airline chooses to leave the country, it won't come back as long as we're the government. They will have to overthrow us. They won't return. I'm telling this to the owners of international airlines,"" he said. Reacting to Air Canada's decision to suspend flights to Venezuela in late March, Transportation Minister Hebert Garcia said Venezuela remains a very attractive destination, regardless of any actions taken by the airlines. ""Canadians will still keep on flying to Venezuela. I'm sure of that. Venezuela is a very safe country with excellent tourism alternatives like Margarita Island,"" he said. But airline executives and travelers are concerned about the recent social unrest in the South American country. Violent anti-government protests have left more than 40 people dead and around 800 injured in the last three months. All hope is not lost. Alitalia executives say they would consider resuming flights ""once the situation has stabilized,"" a position shared by other airlines.","Italian airline cites ""ongoing critical currency situation"" for its flight suspensions .

"(CNN) -- In 1936, a pregnant single woman in England made the difficult decision to give up one of her newborns, separating fraternal twins. It would be 78 years before the girls were reunited. The two women, now living on different continents, found each other when the daughter of one made a surprising discovery during some genealogical research. Her mother, Ann Hunt, had a twin sister she never knew about. The daughter, Samantha Stacey, wrote a letter to a woman in Oregon, asking if she was born in Aldershot, England. Elizabeth Hamel called England and said she was. In moments, she was speaking to her very long-lost sister. After a year of calling on Skype and getting to know each other, the two finally met on May 1 in California, a long way from Aldershot, where they were born to a mother who worked as a live-in servant. Alice Lamb was a cook and the girls' father -- a man named Peters who never met the twins -- was in the British Army, the BBC reported. Hamel said she was born with a curvature of the spine, the reason Lamb kept that daughter. She couldn't afford to keep both of them. Hamel, who lived with an aunt for the first years of her life, said she had been told as a child that she had a sister. But she knew it would be difficult to find her, especially since her twin likely changed her name when she got married. And she had no idea if her sister had moved from Aldershot, as she had done. When they saw each other for the first time, Hunt was overwhelmed. ""I couldn't speak. I was so happy,"" she said Monday. ""It's like you're dreaming. Even now I have to pinch myself."" The twins don't look much alike and say they have different personalities. But during an interview with CNN, they did act like sisters, sometimes bickering lovingly and sometimes finishing the sentence for the other. Hunt said she is normally more talkative, and Hamel is the more sensible one. They both said they lead very busy lives, which will make staying in touch, already complicated because of the eight-hour time difference, a bit difficult. They share at least one trait, though, Hunt insisted. ""We use our hands in a similar manner,"" she said. Hamel said that while they may not look the same in the face, they have the same feet. They also discovered they married men with the same first name (and same last initial). When they reunited Hamel looked for similarities. ""You think, this is someone like me,"" said Hamel, who is 20 minutes older. Both were raised as the only child in the family, though Hunt had no idea she had a twin until her daughter told her last year. The two have exchanged gifts, something common among reunited twins, said Nancy Segal, a psychology professor at Cal State Fullerton and author of four books about twins. ""These are the kinds of things that twins do for each other but here they have do those gifts a little bit more because they have to make up for all those years that they didn't share one another's lives,"" she said. Segal became involved with these twins when Hamel's son wrote her an email about the unique case. She interviewed Hamel and Hunt to see how environment affects twins who are raised apart. She said fraternal twins are less likely to be close friends and don't stay in contact as closely as identical twins. After spending a few days in the Los Angeles area, the twins are heading to Oregon to catch up some more, Segal said. On 78 years.","Ann Hunt was adopted as a child and never knew she had a twin .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul is receiving blowback from some of his Japanese-American colleagues after using World War II Japanese internment camps to describe what happens when a chief executive oversteps their power. ""Think of what happened in WWII, where the President issued an executive order,"" the Kentucky Republican said in a speech in his home state Friday slamming President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration. ""He said to Japanese people, 'We're going to put you in a camp. We're going to take away all of your rights and liberties and we are going to intern you in a camp.'"" ""I care that too much power gets in one place,"" Paul continued. ""Why? Because there has been instances in our history where we allow power to gravitate to one person and that one person then makes decisions that really are egregious."" As news of the speech spread, Japanese lawmakers slammed Paul for his remarks. ""Rand Paul's comments comparing President Obama's executive order on Immigration with President Roosevelt's executive order that imprisoned thousands of Americans of Japanese descent during World War II could not be more misguided,"" Rep. Mike Honda said in a statement out Monday. ""At best, he is confused. At worst, he is just wrong."" Honda himself lived in and out of Japanese internment camps for four years as a small child, as he referenced in his statement. ""As someone who as victim of executive order 9066, I can say without hesitation that (President Franklin Delano) Roosevelt was wrong,"" Honda said. ""It was a misuse of power. President Obama's order is an appropriate use of executive order because Congress did not do its job."" On Sunday, his colleague and fellow California Democrat Rep. Mark Takano also slammed Paul for his ""insulting"" comparison. ""Senator Paul's comments likening President Obama's executive action that provides immigration relief to millions of people in this nation to the internment of Japanese Americans is insulting - not only to the millions who will benefit from President Obama's executive action, but to the thousands of Japanese who were interned during World War II, including my own mother and father,"" Takano wrote on his Facebook page. ""At best, his comments are revisionist history, wrapped in a logical fallacy."" Doug Stafford, a Senior Adviser to Sen. Paul, told CNN that Paul ""was not comparing the substance, he was discussing unchecked executive power."" ""If you allow a President to take broad, unconstitutional power, you may not like what some of them do with it,"" Stafford said. ""It is important for many reasons to follow the rule of law, and to live within the constitutional checks and balances in our system of government."" America's Bridge 21st Century PAC first posted video of Paul's comments on YouTube on Friday.","Rand Paul made the reference as part of remarks condemning the President's immigration plan .

"(CNN) -- Seventeen-year-olds in the Netherlands can't hold a driving license, let alone hurtle around a track at 200 miles per hour. But that hasn't stopped Dutch teenager Max Verstappen climbing behind the wheel of a Formula One car to make history Friday during practice for this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix and become the youngest driver to participate in the sport. Not bad considering the legal driving age in his native Netherlands is 18. At that age, most are preoccupied by schoolwork and teenage angst. But there's no stopping Verstappen. Next season, Verstappen will be a full-time racer for Toro Rosso, which has historically been a stepping stone towards a drive with the hugely successful Red Bull Racing team. ""Today for me it was all about getting experience in the car, especially on a difficult track like Suzuka,"" Verstappen told the sport's official website. ""I was impressed with the engine power."" The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, Max completed 22 laps of the Suzuka Circuit before engine failure brought his big day to a premature end. His fastest lap of one minute and 38.157 seconds was only 0.443 seconds slower than his more experienced teammate Daniel Kvyat. World championship leader Lewis Hamilton recorded a time of one minute and 35.078 seconds in his Mercedes. ""The car is bigger compared to the one I'm used to in Formula 3 and there are a lot more things to think about while you're driving, so I had to use some laps to get confident with such a different car,"" added Verstappen. ""I was not taking any risks and I drove within my limits for all the session, doing as much mileage as possible. ""I have to thank Red Bull and Scuderia Toro Rosso for giving me the possibility to be in the car already this year on Fridays and get well prepared for next year. ""I find myself very comfortable in this team and I like my working group. I hope to drive also in Austin, Sao Paolo and Abu Dhabi.

"(CNN) -- When Thanksgiving has come and gone, and the turkey gorge is over, you'll probably open up your refrigerator and find all sorts of tinfoil-wrapped casseroles and a lingering eau de sage. What's a severely yammed out but unwasteful eater to do? That's where Melissa d'Arabian comes in. D'Arabian is the winner of season 5 of ""The Next Food Network Star"" and host of the Food Network show ""Ten Dollar Dinners."" She gives us her five tips for Thanksgiving leftovers. 1. Freeze while fresh . Why wait until your turkey has aged two extra days until you realize that you are in over your Thanksgiving head? On Thanksgiving Day, as you are cleaning up after dinner, immediately cube up half the remaining turkey and package it up into quart-sized freezer bags, about a cup or two each portion, depending on the size of your family. Label and freeze, and now you'll have the freshest leftover possible that becomes an easy ingredient in the freezer just waiting to have a second life a month or two down the road in another recipe: pasta, soup, savory pies, omelets, etc. 2. Tired of turkey? Trick your tastebuds . My Saturday strategy for the turkey I still have around? Go ethnic or regional with these creative ideas. Think Thai (turkey pad Thai, for instance), Mexican (turkey taquitos) or Southern BBQ (pulled-turkey sandwiches). A whole different flavor profile will break the mold on Thanksgiving flavors, and you'll fool your palate into thinking your dish is a fresh new idea, not a recycled leftover. 3. Turkey's gone, but what about all the rest? Repurpose your sides . We all have side dishes that we make out of tradition, but that aren't eaten quite as much as we would hope. The result is leftover overload! Cranberry sauce is a major culprit in my house. The solution? Think of cranberry sauce simply as a tart fruit, and use as you would use any other. Make a yogurt parfait, or toss with apple slices and make a cobbler or crumble, or heat up and pour on vanilla ice cream and top with toasted pecans for a sundae. You can even make a fantastic sweet-heat salsa (perfect with my turkey taquitos, above). The other major leftover is the (in)famous yams. One idea: think breakfast! Make a delicious maple-yam compound butter and serve with scones or waffles. Turn sweetened yams into a filling for empanadas, or make cinnamon bran muffins with them. On the savory side, try swirling some yams into your leftover mashed potatoes for a delicious marbled potato side dish. (I know; I didn't give you any ideas for stuffing. But if you have stuffing leftovers, you need a new recipe. I'm just saying.) 4. Ingredients are leftovers too, so scan the fridge . Remember one of my cardinal rules of saving grocery dollars: Wasted food is the most expensive food you buy, no matter how cheap it was at the store. So, be sure to check your refrigerator for lurking ingredients on their last legs so that you can leverage all your leftovers instead of tossing them. Use that leftover heavy cream you bought for mashed potatoes to make a quick homemade spicy butterscotch pudding. Use half a sour cream container to make your mom's crazy Jell-o salad. Find a way to use up the other half (those taquitos bail us out yet again!). A good general strategy is to check your refrigerator weekly (ideally just before menu planning or grocery shopping), and pull any 'must-use' ingredients front and center of the fridge so you don't forget about them. 5. Feel good about less . Sometime between Halloween and the New Year, do a major purge of stuff you don't need and donate it. And if you are feeling the squeeze of the economy as we head into the holidays, volunteer at a homeless shelter, food bank or soup kitchen. There is nothing like helping those who are less fortunate than you to make you feel grateful for what you do have, which will curb overbuying (and overcooking) and keep the holidays focused on what matters: the people in your life. And while it's too late to change how much food you bought for this year, maybe next year this strategy will have you just buying slightly less. But this year, it will make us grateful for having leftovers at all, even if we don't turn them all into a taquito.","Food Network host Melissa d'Arabian offers Thanksgiving leftover tips .

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney has said he has no plans to run for president a third time -- but that isn't stopping voters from wanting him to hit the campaign trail again. Romney pulled the most support from Republican voters with 19% picking him over a fray of politicians floated for the 2016 nomination, according to a Quinnipiac University poll of Americans released Wednesday. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came in second as 11% of voters said they would pick him as the Republican nominee if the primary were held today. The poll offers an early look at what is expected to be a packed Republican primary battle as the GOP looks to take back the White House after eight years locked out of the nation's top post. No Republican has officially announced a 2016 White House run, so far. Get ready: 2016 starts now . While Romney nabbed the top spot among 707 Republicans surveyed following several months of stumping for candidates on the midterm campaign trail, he and his family have said it's unlikely he'll pursue a bid -- though he hasn't shut the door on a potential run altogether. Bush is mulling a presidential bid and his brother, former President George W. Bush said he thinks the odds his brother will run are about ""50-50."" Another Florida politician, Sen. Marco Rubio, who snagged just 2% of support in the poll, has said he is also weighing a presidential campaign and is expected to make a decision this winter. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and conservative activist and neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson tied for third in the poll, gaining a nod from 8% of Republican voters. Christie has widely been viewed as a top-tier contender for the nomination and was even floated as a potential candidate in 2012. Carson has attracted a small but loyal following among the party's conservative base, taking third place in the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll this year -- an informal measure of the GOP base's enthusiasm for candidates. He recently left his post as a Fox News contributor as he weighs a bid. The winner of that straw poll, Sen. Rand Paul, came in behind Christie and Carson with 6% of Republican voters throwing him their support. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, got 5% in the poll. While respondents were split among the 15 Republican names listed in the poll, Democratic voters' preferred candidate is unquestionably former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who pulls 57% of support in a field of six potential candidates after 610 Democrats were surveyed. Liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts came in a distant second with 13% of support while former Sen. Jim Webb, who became the first from either party to launch a presidential exploratory committee, pulled just 1%. Vice President Joe Biden nabbed the third spot with 9%. Warren has excited the Democratic base and was a visible presence on the 2014 campaign trail, though she has said she doesn't intend to run. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a liberal independent from Vermont, has said he is considering a presidential bid and made several trips to Iowa, an early primary state, during the 2014 campaign. Sanders attracted 4% of support in the poll.","Mitt Romney tops the field of Republican presidential field with 19% in new national poll .

"(CNN) -- It was the first win in three Euro 2016 qualifying games for the mighty Die Mannschaft but another unconvincing performance by Germany against the minnows of Gibraltar Friday. The 2014 World Cup winner was expected to at least match the seven goals that both Poland and Ireland had put past Gibraltar in their last two Group D matches, but only managed four. Perhaps suffering a hangover from its Brazil triumph, defeats to Poland and a draw against the Irish, have left Germany in third place in the group. Gibraltar, who only became a full UEFA member last year and are not recognized by FIFA, have only one full-time professional in its lineup, Scott Wiseman from third-flight English side Preston. But it put on a battling performance against a near full strength team picked by Germany coach Joachim Low and deployed in an attacking 3-5-2 formation. World Cup hero Thomas Muller started the scoring and added a second, while fellow Bayern Munich star Mario Gotze was also on the score sheet before half time. The expected goal glut after the break did not materialize with the occasional jeer ringing around the stadium in Nuremberg. The fourth, and only goal of the half, came on 67 minutes when Lukas Podolski's cross was turned into his own net by visiting defender Yogan Santos. ""I am anything but happy, the team didn't measure up the way we had wished,"" Low told reporters after the win . ""We want to play like world champions, so from that perspective four goals isn't enough."" Poland still tops Group D after a fine 4-0 win in Georgia, while Germany, Ireland and Scotland are all tied on seven points, three points adrift. Scotland boosted its qualifying chances with a 1-0 win over the Irish in Glasgow, Shaun Maloney's fine strike in the second half proving decisive at Celtic Park. Germany might have missed its chance to boost its goal difference and confidence, but at least avoided the humiliation suffered by 2004 European champion Greece. Playing at home in Athens, Greece's dreadful start to Group F qualifying continued with a 1-0 home defeat to the tiny Faroe Islands. Under new coach Claudio Ranieri, the team which reached the last 16 of the World Cup, went down to a strike from Joan Edmundsson just after the hour mark. It leaves Greece with just one point from four games, trailing group leader Romania by nine points. Romania strengthened its position at the top with a 2-0 home win over Northern Ireland with defender Paul Papp grabbing both its late goals.","Germany beats Gibraltar 4-0 .

"(CNN) -- Three retiree firefighters from the FDNY died this week from illnesses believed related to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Daniel Heglund, Robert Leaver and Howard Bischoff, who suffered from cancer, died Monday within hours of each other, reported CNN affiliate NY1. ""Losing three firefighters on the same day to WTC-related illnesses is a painful reminder that, 13 years later, we continue to pay a terrible price for the Department's heroic efforts on September 11th, New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said in a statement. Ninety-two firefighters have died of illnesses related to the 9/11 attacks and hundreds of firefighters and ambulance workers suffer from respiratory problems, NY1 reported. All three men rushed to the World Trade Center site on the day of the attacks. They all retired in 2003. Heglund was a firefighter from Rescue 4 in the Woodside section of Queens and had spent 21 years on the job, NY1 reported. Leaver was a member of Engine 202 in Red Hook and served 20 years. Bischoff was a fire officer for 19 years and served with Ladder 149 in Dyker Heights. News of the three deaths comes as advocates seek reauthorization of a program to provide health services to people with 9/11-related health problems at least through 2015. President Barack Obama signed the James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health & Compensation Act into law in 2011. ""I'm asking [leaders in Washington] to be as brave as the people who responded on that day,"" FDNY Union-Uniformed Fire Officers Association President James Lemonda said at a press conference. ""This is not just a firefighter issue. This is an American issue."" Government reports suggest workers at the World Trade Center were exposed to a number of chemicals that were known to be carcinogens, or agents that may cause cancer. Cancer is plaguing a growing number of first responders and rescuers who worked at ground zero after the terrorist attack. These are cancers the federal government says are thought to be directly related to that effort -- cancers like leukemia, myeloma, thyroid and prostate cancers. At the end of July, there were at least 1,646 certified cancer cases that have been documented by Mount Sinai Selikoff Centers for Occupational Health. There were some additional 863 cancer cases among both fire and EMS personnel, according to FDNY, which keeps a separate database for its members. CNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this reort.","All three firefighters responded to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The search for bodies from an erupting volcano in central Japan was suspended Thursday as weather conditions deteriorated. Officials are concerned that heavy rainfall could increase the threat of an avalanche of accumulated ash on Mount Ontake. As of Thursday morning, 47 bodies had been recovered from the mountain, with 42 people identified so far, according to Nagano prefectural police. Ontake unleashed a huge cloud of ash late Saturday morning that billowed down the mountainside and engulfed hikers in its path. Witnesses described hearing a sound like thunder when the eruption began. Authorities estimated there were 200 to 250 hikers in the area at the time of the eruption. Most of them were reported to have managed to make the long trek down the mountain. But some people remained trapped in several lodges on Ontake, and others were missing altogether, local authorities said. Hundreds join search . Soldiers from Japan's Self Defense Force (SDF) have joined hundreds of police and firefighters in the search this week, with 11 helicopters deployed to carry bodies from the mountain's slopes. Though some of the victims were still being examined by the local coroner, the cause of death for those officially pronounced dead was recorded as injury from direct hits by volcanic cinders, police said. The Japan Meteorological Agency -- which has raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3, meaning the public is advised to not approach the volcano -- has warned that another large eruption could take place in the next few days. Mount Ontake, at 10,060 feet (3,067 meters), is the second tallest volcano in Japan after Mount Fuji, and a popular destination for hikers, especially in the fall when richly-colored autumn foliage is on display. The last major eruption of Ontake, which is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Tokyo, took place in 1979, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian Institute. That eruption lasted months, spewing out more than 200,000 tons of ash, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported.","NEW: Bad weather halts search for more bodies on Mount Ontake .

"(CNN) -- By now, people in the United States and elsewhere in the world are familiar with the Tea Party, but there's a new social movement on the political block -- it's called the ""Tequila Party,"" and its leaders say the group is serving as a wake-up call to the Latino voting bloc. Tequila Party organizers describe their movement as a nonpartisan group that launched this year on May 5 -- Cinco de Mayo, to mark the Mexican holiday. It has enlisted both Democrats and Republicans to get the more than 20 million eligible Latino voters to become ""consistent primary and general election voters,"" the movement's website says. In other words, its organizers say, it is not a political party in the traditional sense. It's more about registering to vote and then voting than supporting particular candidates. ""I think first you have to understand the humor of calling it the Tequila Party. We are a culture that likes humor,"" the movement's main political consultant, Agustin ""Gus"" Garcia, told CNN. ""We're not Puritans. Humor is part of our politics as well. We could have called it the 'Cafe con Leche Party.' You have to laugh because there is no logic in racism."" In 2008, during now-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's run to become president, Garcia was her national Latin co-chair. A Democrat, Garcia said he believes there is no better time for the Tequila Party movement. ""There is fertile ground right now for a message like this,"" he added. ""We're appealing to a large group in this nation. We're not appealing to a minority, but to a mass of people. We're united by culture and language."" National Tequila Party leader Belinda ""Deedee"" Garcia-Blase told CNN that the movement ""is a platform for us to position ourselves as consistent voters."" ""This is not a movement in place to endorse any politician whatsoever,"" she said in a phone interview from Tucson, Arizona, where the movement is based. ""We're not going to bash politicians like the Tea Party does. This is about voting and why we're in the situation we're in."" The goal is to influence the 2012 elections, Garcia-Blase said. The group is now in the final stages of organizing a national tour of concerts, events, dinners and rallies in 20 states that will ""encourage a massive Latino 'Get Out The Vote,'"" she said. The kickoff event is June 4 in Tucson, Arizona. The U.S. Hispanic population grew 43 percent in 10 years between 2000 and 2010 -- four times faster than the total U.S. population -- according to figures from the 2010 census. Currently, people of Hispanic origin make up only about 9% of the eligible electorate, according the Pew Hispanic Center. Still, Hispanics were one of the most sought-after voting groups in the 2008 presidential election and were heavily concentrated in at least four battleground states in the presidential campaign -- Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. ""We're one-out-of-four people entering college. We're now becoming more obvious. We're national now,"" said Garcia, who is a Cuban-American who immigrated as a child to the United States in 1961 and now lives in Miami. ""We're no longer regional. We are reflective of a world that is changing. Latins are the neighbor next door that brings global society."" Garcia-Blase is also head of Somos Republican (We Are Republican), the largest Hispanic GOP group in the nation. She says the genesis of the Tequila Party grew out of frustration with the Obama administration's failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform and legislation including the DREAM Act, Garcia-Blase says. But she is quick to clarify the movement is not ""anti-Obama, but pro-social justice."" The DREAM -- Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors -- Act would offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. In December, it failed to pass the Senate during a lame-duck session of Congress. ""The immigration issue is the number-one concern to Latinos right now,"" Garcia-Blase says. ""We've witnessed over 800,000 Latinos get deported. We've heard the cries and the pain and the suffering from families who are being forced apart. Now is a time for us to become better voters."" Garcia-Blase concedes the idea for the Tequila Party was not originally hers. She credits Fernando Romero as being the inspiration behind the movement. Romero is president of the nonpartisan Nevada group Hispanics in Politics. ""The movement is important because it unites efforts from the two major parties and others who want to get involved on issues that their party is not dealing with or their party may be in disapproval of,"" Romero told CNN from his office in Las Vegas. ""This is a collective resolution for the Hispanic community. To this moment I have not received any negative feedback."" Romero first got involved in politics more than 30 years ago as a volunteer for now-Sen. Harry Reid's campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada. ""The principle thing for the Tequila Party movement is border education,"" Romero said. ""Everything else will come through once we accomplish a good community empowerment movement that will allow us to be as effective as we can. The challenges may be that non-Hispanics may try to make an issue of this as a third-party movement. That's a misinterpretation of what we're trying to accomplish."" For first-generation Cuban-America Felix Castillo, 19, a rising Badson College sophomore in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and an unregistered voter, the Tequila Party movement is a good idea in principle, but he's skeptical about its ability to succeed in accomplishing its goals. ""I don't think it's necessary,"" Castillo told CNN. ""I think people my age are really hard-headed. ... I really don't think people my age are going to listen to them."" ""They're going to have to do more than just concerts (to succeed),"" he added. University of Washington Political Science Associate Professor Matt A. Barreto is also skeptical. He has conducted political research on Latinos for more than 15 years and is currently a pollster for Latino Decisions, an independent polling firm that began in 2007. ""My impression is that it's 99.9% driven by Republican Latinos. Everyone that I've talked to about it believes that to be the case. It's more of an effort to try and get the Republican Party to take the immigration issue more seriously and to not ignore the Latino vote,"" Barreto told CNN in a phone interview. ""Based on history, I think they're going to continue issuing press releases and they may hold some events surrounding immigration issues, but I'm not sure they're currently set up with the organizational capacity to conduct massive voter registration drives,"" he added. Garcia-Blase says organizers have not received any funding from Republicans for the Tequila Party and reiterated to CNN that the movement is not at all affiliated with the Republican Party. ""A lot of our leaders are Democrat,"" she said. Right now, Garcia-Blase says, the group has more than 55 grass-roots leaders throughout the nation working to get sponsors for the rallies, which are planned in places with a conventional Latino presence including Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami, but also in non-traditional Hispanic cities like Des Moines, Iowa; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Topeka, Kansas. ""We're working with a group of pro-immigrant-minded business leaders in Florida for financing. It would cost between $5,000 and $6,000 per metropolitan city. We want to bring in a good entertainment like Shakira and Santana. If we don't get the national acts, we'll go local,"" she said. Garcia-Blase, a sixth generation Mexican-American whose parents worked in the potato fields of Idaho when she was a child, says that for now, 100% of her focus is on the pro-Latino movement. The pro-immigration reform advocate says she plans on changing her political affiliation to independent so that she can be taken seriously by critics as a legitimate social leader. ""I used to be a rah-rah Republican. To heck with that,"" Garcia-Blase said. ""This isn't about politics. It's about people. I've always maintained I'm a real Republican, but I've been called names because I defend my community and put people before party. I still get attacked for that.""","Organizers are calling an effort to increase the Latino voting bloc the ""Tequila Party""

"(Mental Floss) -- We've all seen it: that one lonely bag on the baggage claim track at the airport that goes around and around with no owner in sight. What happens to it if no one shows up? Well, it might end up at the Unclaimed Baggage Center in Scottsboro, Alabama. That's where you can visit a store that takes up an entire city block and find everything from the expected (clothing, toiletries, books) to, well, the unexpected. Here are 10 of the strangest items that have gone unclaimed. 1. Hoggle from ""Labyrinth"" -- Unlike other items at the Unclaimed Baggage Center, Hoggle is not for sale. He is now a permanent part of the Unclaimed Baggage Center Museum. If you're not familiar, Hoggle was David Bowie's dwarf-goblin minion in the 1986 movie. 2. A slew of ancient Egyptian artifacts -- From a mummified falcon to a shrunken head, a bunch of objects dating back to 1500 B.C. were found in an old Gucci suitcase. Christie's auction house ended up selling the museum-worthy items in the '80s. 3. A rattle snake -- A live one, roaming free amongst the rest of the unclaimed baggage. 4. A Naval guidance system -- Yep -- a piece of equipment worth $250,000 was lost and never claimed. The people at the Center decided to be good sports and return the expensive GPS to the Navy. Mental Floss: The Mojave Desert's airplane graveyard . 5. Bountiful Barbie (but not in the way you think) -- A woman purchased a Barbie at the Center for her daughter, which isn't at all unusual. After all, kids lose toys all the time. But when the girl yanked the head off her new Barbie, $500 in rolled bills tumbled out of her body. 6. A full suit of armor-- Unlike the Egyptian artifacts, this guy was merely a replica of a 19th century piece. Still, I bet to this day, there's a guy out there who continues to tell the story of the time he lost a suit of armor at the airport. 7. A violin from the 1770s -- Like Hoggle, it resides in the Unclaimed Baggage Center Museum. Mental Floss: What 10 movie props later sold for . 8. A 5.8-carat diamond -- It was set in a platinum ring and packed in a sock. 9. A camera designed for use on a NASA Space Shuttle -- As with the Navy's guidance system, the Center dutifully returned the camera to NASA. 10. A 40.95-carat natural emerald.

"(CNN) -- Thailand's military leader and Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha has unveiled a new interim cabinet in which key ministries will be run by senior military figures. Twelve members of the 32-strong cabinet are active or retired officers of the security forces, including one police general, occupying many of the most powerful roles in the new administration. Most of the rest of the cabinet are former senior civil servants. Military figures will hold responsibility for the defense, commerce, transport and interior ministries, while civilians will take the economics and finance portfolios. Prayuth was selected by Thailand's National Legislative Assembly to lead the government in a vote last month. He was the sole candidate for the post. Members of the assembly had been hand-picked by Prayuth. More than half are also in the military. Prayuth seized control of the country on May 22, 2014 after months of unrest destabilized the elected government, led by former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Close associates . Prayuth has named General Prawit Wongsuwan, a former defense minister and former head of the army, as defense minister, and one of his five deputy prime ministers. Retired general -- and Prayuth's predecessor as military chief -- Anupong Paochinda has been named Interior Minister. Both are powerful military figures with close ties to Prayuth, and who played a role in the 2006 Thai coup. General Udomdej Sitabutr, Prayuth's current deputy as army chief, has been named by Prayuth to lead the army when he steps down from his army position at the end of the month. Sitabutr will serve as deputy defense minister and is also a member of the cabinet. Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong, the head of Thailand's air force who has overseen the new regime's economic direction, will become transport minister. The new cabinet will be required to take an oath before King Bhumibol Adulyadej before it officially begins its duties. The administration is intended as an interim cabinet to allow the new leadership time to implement political reforms before elections are held. Critics accused Yingluck of acting as a mouthpiece for her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in the last coup in 2006 and is now living in exile. After taking power, military authorities summoned leading political officials and other prominent figures. It imposed travel bans and delivered the firm message that dissent would not be tolerated.","Current and former military officers are heavily represented in new Thai cabinet .

"New York (CNN) -- A U.N. official has a message for those worried about chemical weapons in Syria: A plan is in motion to do something about them. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is in the capital of Damascus this week to sort out the plan for the destruction of 12 facilities used to make chemical weapons, Sigrid Kaag said Wednesday. Kaag, the special adviser overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical stockpiles, addressed the Security Council on Wednesday, according to Gary Quinlan, the Australian ambassador to the United Nations and head of the council. He relayed that plans to destroy seven hangers and five underground tunnels are to start later this month and are to be completed in the summer of 2015. The OPCW team is also in consultations to draw up plans for the destruction of chemical weapons facilities that were previously not disclosed by the Syrian government, including a ricin production facility, Quinlan said. In October, Kaag informed the Security Council that there were four chemical weapons sites previously undisclosed, including one production facility. ""There are additional sites that we've become aware of since the initial declaration of production facilities,"" Quinlan told reporters after the meeting. ""So now the question is: sorting out, in Damascus, precisely what is done with those. ""As I said, there's an OPCW team in Damascus right now which is looking at a range of these sorts of issues."" Quinlan made clear that all disclosed chemical weapons had been removed from the country and 98% of the declared chemical materials, which amounts to more than 1,300 tons, had been destroyed. Quinlan commended the effort, calling it a ""difficult task"" because of the ""volatile security environment"" and ""slow-rolling"" by the the government of Bashar al-Assad. Bashar Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, said the remaining issues with the OPCW were technical issues and said that later acknowledgment of other production facilities were ""discrepancies."" Jaafari said the Syrian government has been cooperating with Kaag and the OPCW. Airstrikes in Syria called 'illegitimate' Separately, Jaafari told CNN on Wednesday that the coalition airstrikes in Syria are ""illegitimate."" The United States has led a coalition conducting airstrikes in Syria and Iraq against ISIS, which has grabbed large swaths of land in those two war-torn countries. ISIS now calls itself the Islamic State. Are anti-ISIS airstrikes in Syria aiding Bashar al-Assad? He said that there has been no coordination with the coalition members on the locations of the airstrikes, adding that the only intelligence he received from a coalition member was before the first day of airstrikes in Syria in September. CNN learned then that Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had notified Jaafari of incoming airstrikes. ""The Syrian army is targeting terrorists who are using civilians as human shields, including their own families,"" Jaafari said of the ongoing conflict. When asked about reports of targeting volunteers and medical workers, he said that they are lies to ""discredit"" and ""defame"" the Syrian government. Regarding French involvement, he said that the ""French are directly involved with the Turkish government, sponsoring the terrorist groups in Syria,"" and called it an ""interference in a sovereign state."" He added that he considers the coalition airstrikes even worse than this.","Special adviser speaks to the U.N. Security Council; team is in Damascus this week .

"(CNN) -- Away from the manicured glamor of the Croisette, there's another Cannes -- a Cannes that lies beneath. Beneath the red carpet of the Palais du Festival in the basement, that is. It's a seething, throbbing film market alive with b-movies -- low-budget features with no big name actors attached -- often horrors, thrillers, erotic movies or ""mockbusters"" (more on those later). THIS IS THE CANNES YOU THINK YOU KNOW ... BUT THAT'S JUST CANNES FOR THE A-LISTERS -- THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR EVERYONE ELSE ... It's a galaxy away from the movie screenings of the Official Selection -- the elite group of films chosen by the festival's selection committee from the thousands submitted each year -- of which just 18 go into competition for the feted top prize, the Palme D'Or. THEY MOSTLY LOOK LIKE THIS ... OR LIKE THIS ... So if you find yourself not among those with Nicole Kidman on speed dial and if your budget is a few zeros short of a few million, then head to the Marche du Film you must, to make or break your fortune. Although it's in fact one of the biggest film markets in the world, in reality it's just a sprawling global bazaar, where filmmakers and distributors come and set up stalls and negotiate. But instead of selling electronics or questionably-sourced handbags, they sell movies. Lots and lots of movies. FILMS LIKE THIS ... AND THIS ... In 2013 alone, producers, distributors, financiers, video-on-demand providers and other representatives from more than 1000 companies in 108 countries (including places as far-flung as Albania and French Guiana) came together to haggle over 5,364 films, according to official figures. So, how does an ambitious filmmaker get noticed in this mass of movies? We asked a couple of Cannes veterans and a young Welsh man who made a splash at Cannes a couple of years ago with a Zombie movie called ""Colin"" that he made for $70. STIR UP SOME CONTROVERSY ... Rupesh Paul Productions have announced that they are making a thriller based on the disappearance of Malaysian flight MH370. The film's promotional pamphlet says that it ""tells the story of five people who seek revenge for the death of their loved ones. They hijack a plane... "" Paul denies that the timing of the movie could be considered offensive of the families of the 239 men, women and children aboard the airliner that disappeared on March 8. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A BLOCKBUSTER, MAKE A MOCKBUSTER ... Paul Bales is a partner at The Asylum, a movie production and distribution company based in Burbank, California. The Asylum is known for producing low-budget movies (around $500,000) that riff off big-budget blockbusters and are often released around the same time. On the books this year are ""Sleeping Beauty,"" a twist on Angelina Jolie movie ""Maleficent,"" and ""Apocalypse Pompeii,"" another take on Paul W.S. Anderson's disaster epic ""Pompeii,"" which cost between $80 to $100 million to make, according to Forbes. ""We would love to be able to take credit for the mockbuster. The practice is called drafting ... it's been done almost since the industry started. Just like in bike racing, one racer will ride behind a faster racer and they benefit because there is less wind. ""We've Just been a little more outrageous. Our (movie) titles try to get as close as possible."" AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN AWESOME POSTER ... Make them as outlandish as possible, adds Bales. At Cannes, the trade press pick them up and it's a great way of getting your name out there if you don' have a big budget or a high profile cast. GET A LITTLE HELP FROM YOUR FANS ... U.S. indie label Troma are famous for making low-budget satires with a '50s flavor with titles like ""The Toxic Avenger,"" ""The Class of Nuke 'Em High."" The movie studio has been running for 40 years and, according to co-founder, Lloyd Kaufman, Troma's secret weapon is their fans. At Cannes, Troma fans help the company put on the Troma Parade and street theater they've become famous for, where characters like The Toxic Avenger act out scenes from movies. ""This year, the Toxic Avenger and I have been asked to lead the zombie walk -- there's a zombie walk (at Cannes) that's been going on for about 10 years -- we've been asked to be parade masters. ""That's how we get attention because we cannot afford to take the big billboards."" NOTHING BEATS PERFECT TIMING ... Marc Price didn't expect much when he took ""Colin,"" a zombie movie he made with a $70 budget, to Cannes in 2008. It was a movie he was proud of, but he also realized the timing of his no-budget horror happened to catch the zeitgeist at Cannes that year. ""The global economic crisis was at its pinnacle,"" said Price. ""So, our story fit very snugly into a success out of that."" The press picked it up and the rest was history: Price says the film picked up limited theatrical release in the UK, Japan, the U.S. and Australia.

"Washington (CNN) -- NBC has apologized to Rep. Michele Bachmann after the house band for ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" played an inappropriate song during her appearance on the show Monday, CNN confirmed Thursday. Bachmann received a letter Wednesday from Doug Vaughan, NBC's senior vice president for special programs and late night, that apologized for what happened and called the incident ""not only unfortunate but also unacceptable,"" said Alice Stewart, the Republican presidential hopeful's spokeswoman. According to Stewart, the letter also said the show's band, which played the song ""Lyin' Ass Bitch"" by Fishbone as Bachmann first appeared on stage, was ""severely reprimanded."" ""She accepted the apology,"" Stewart told CNN Thursday. Bachmann also spoke to Fallon Wednesday and had a ""nice conversation,"" said Stewart, who described the late night host as ""remorseful"" and ""a class act."" Fallon had offered an apology via Twitter on Tuesday, but Bachmann then called for an official apology from NBC. The controversy started Monday when the Minnesota congresswoman walked out to greet Fallon on stage, and the show's band, The Roots, played the Fishbone song. Bachmann admitted being oblivious to the slight, telling Fox News on Wednesday that she ""wasn't aware of it at all."" She insisted the treatment she received through the song amounted to ""sexism,"" and she added that it ""wouldn't be tolerated if it was Michelle Obama and shouldn't be tolerated for a conservative woman, either."" Still, she said, ""I'd love to go back again."" Some of Bachmann's ire was directed toward the drummer of Fallon's house band, Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson. ""If that song had been played for Michelle Obama I have no doubt that NBC would've apologized to her and likely they could've fired the drummer or at least suspended him. None of that happened from NBC and this is clearly a form of the bias on the part of the Hollywood entertainment elite,"" Bachmann said. The song choice appeared to be intentional. Prior to Bachmann's arrival on stage, the band's drummer, Questlove, tweeted during the show: ""Aight late night walkon song devotees: you love it when we snark: this next one takes the cake. ask around cause i aint tweeting title."" Despite the song choice, the interview was amicable, with Bachmann and Fallon trading jokes. On Tuesday, Fallon tweeted: ""I'm honored that @michelebachmann was on our show yesterday and I'm so sorry about the intro mess. I really hope she comes back."" The band also issued a statement saying ""the performance was a tongue-in-cheek and spur-of-the-moment decision."" Stewart said Thursday that Bachmann recognized that Fallon ""had no idea this happened."" Fallon has invited Bachmann back on the show, Stewart said, adding that no date was set but ""she would prefer to pick her opening music next time."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: The NBC apology letter called the incident ""unacceptable""

"(CNN) -- As many as 10,000 albinos are in hiding in east Africa over fears that they will be dismembered and their body parts sold to witchdoctors, the Red Cross said in a recent report. The killings of albinos in Burundi and Tanzania, who are targeted because their body parts are believed to have special powers, have sparked fears among the population in the two countries, the report said. Body parts of albinos are sought in some regions of Africa because they are believed to bring wealth and good luck. Attackers chop off limbs and pluck out organs to sell to dealers, who in turn sell them to witchdoctors. Scores of albinos have fled to Tanzanian schools for the disabled or in emergency shelters set up by police in Burundi to avoid attacks, according to the report. ""Thousands more albinos across a huge swathe of countryside ... are unable to move freely to trade, study or cultivate fields for fear of albino hunters,"" the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Tanzanian government officials have said they are mobilizing police to help the embattled population, but admit it is hard to quell the attacks. Most happen in rural areas, where there is not enough police presence, according to Lucca Haule, assistant commissioner of police. ""We don't have the resources in those places ... it is not easy, but we are trying to map out locations where albinos live so that we can better protect them,"" he told CNN earlier this month. In early November, a court sentenced four people to death in northern Tanzania for killing an albino man and selling his body parts. So far, seven people have been sentenced to death for the killing of more than 50 Tanzanian albinos, including children, in the past two years, Haule said. Dozens more are awaiting trial. Albinism is a genetic condition that leads to little or no pigment in the eyes, skin and hair. African albinos are discriminated against and face segregation most of their lives. They also battle a high risk of skin cancer. The aid agency said it is helping albinos find indoor employment by teaching them skin care tips, including using protective hats and long-sleeved shirts. ""Even before the killings began two years ago, albino people in tropical Africa suffered an array of afflictions that made physical survival a desperate struggle,"" said Salif Keita, a Malian albino singer and human rights activist. The Red Cross societies in both countries said they need support to respond to the humanitarian crisis. Since 2007, at least 44 Tanzanian albinos have been killed and 14 in Burundi. Some organizations have put the number at more than 50 in Tanzania.","About 10,000 albinos in hiding in east Africa over fears they will be dismembered .

"(CNN) -- There are times when political ambition spurs political leaders to reach new heights of courage and creativity. To date, the Ebola outbreak of 2014 is not proving to be one of those times. By chance, the deadly infection first arrived on American shores in two states, Texas and New York, where powerful governors are each nurturing dreams of the presidency and eager to posture as men with the right stuff to lead the nation. But Rick Perry in Texas and Andrew Cuomo in New York are both being tripped up by a dilemma that has bedeviled recent presidents: They are trying to govern an irritable, politically polarized electorate that demands and rewards certainty and bombast from its leaders, even in situations that cry out for flexibility and calm. Forced to choose between narrow political advantage and the broader public good, Perry and Cuomo both showed they are willing to take the easy way out. From the very start, it's been clear that the only logical way to stem the Ebola crisis is to contain and control the disease at its source. That means getting medical materials and personnel to the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea without delay -- battling the virus overseas so we don't have to contend with it here. That's a tricky, complex logistical task. Even before the Ebola outbreak, all three nations suffered from poverty, civil wars, rickety infrastructure and a weak health system. Aid workers from America and other nations are frantically trying to build a public health system in places where none existed before (in the hard-hit Bomi region of Liberia, for instance, there are only two doctors for 89,000 people). The virus could conceivably overwhelm the heroic efforts under way. The World Health Organization estimates that the three affected countries already have 10,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola -- but that number could explode to as many as 10,000 new infections per week by the end of this year. In addition to causing a global humanitarian crisis, an epidemic of such proportions would be far more likely to spread to Europe and the Americas, which to date have treated only 18 Ebola patients. The simple-minded reaction here has been to propose banning travel to and from the affected countries and quarantining anybody entering the U.S. from those places. But that, according to health experts, would be a disastrous mistake. ""We have been reiterating at every opportunity that we do not recommend travel and trade restrictions. We need outsiders to get in to combat this outbreak,"" says Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for WHO. ""We need expert logisticians, epidemiologists, communications experts. If the flights are being cut off they can't get in."" But the men who would be president are responding to very different considerations than the health experts are. ""This is all hands on deck,"" Perry declared at a press conference on October 1, shortly after the news that a Liberian man in Dallas, Thomas Duncan, had been diagnosed with Ebola. ""Professionals on every level of the chain of command know what to do to minimize any potential risk to the people of Texas,"" Perry said, seeking to project an image of quasi-military efficiency that turned out to be a mirage. Duncan's death was followed by the news that two nurses attending him also contracted the virus -- and had entered the dangerous, contagious phase of the disease while traveling outside of Texas. Reporters soon discovered holes in Perry's chain of command. At Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Duncan succumbed, a nurse said that boasts about training and preparedness were a myth: . ""We never talked about Ebola, and we probably should have,"" said one nurse, according to the Texas Tribune. ""They gave us an optional seminar to go to. Just informational, not hands on. It wasn't even suggested we go. ... We were never told what to look for."" Perry ended up apologizing for his state's shortcomings -- and, in a crucial concession to the politics of the situation, reversed an earlier position and called for creation of a no-fly list and suspension of travel to and from Ebola-struck countries. In New York, medical authorities handled the state's first and only case of Ebola more effectively than in Texas -- but that didn't stop Cuomo from doing a flip-flop of his own on the issue. About a week after a courageous physician named Craig Spencer returned from helping Ebola victims in Africa, he developed an elevated temperature -- one sign that the virus may be present -- and was transported to Bellevue Hospital, one of the 11 city-run hospitals in New York City. Cuomo, along with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, told New Yorkers to be calm and staged photo ops of himself riding the subways -- something Cuomo almost never does -- to show the public that the chances of being infected with Ebola through casual contact are slim to none. But the next day, Cuomo and his New Jersey counterpart, Gov. Chris Christie, announced without warning that any health workers arriving at New York-area airports who had dealt with Ebola victims will be held in quarantine for 21 days, the incubation period of the virus. The decision, made hastily, went into effect immediately. ""Since taking office, I have erred on the side of caution when it comes to the safety and protection of New Yorkers, and the current situation regarding Ebola will be no different,"" Cuomo said. That was a 180-degreee spin from October 7, when the governor said he would oppose restrictions on travel. ""I don't think it works mechanically to say, 'Shut off entry from any country,' because what happens is you just fly to another country and you then you come in from that country,"" he said back then. What changed in the meantime? Cuomo, running for re-election on November 4, has been hammered by his Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, on New York's Ebola preparedness. And the governor's not-so-secret presidential hopes also depend on selling an image of forcefulness and strength to the nation -- an image that could suffer if he seems ""soft"" on border control. But the story did not end with this weekend's stepped-up quarantine. Sunday night, amid intense criticism from medical professionals -- including Kaci Hickox, the nurse quarantined in New Jersey under that state's rigorous new protocols -- Cuomo once again changed course. He backed down from the strict mandatory quarantine policy he'd just instituted, according to an article in The New York Times, and adopted a less severe one -- allowing home quarantine for those not showing symptoms of Ebola and compensating them for lost income. Make no mistake about it: Forcing volunteers to sit in a quarantine center for three weeks -- Hickox said she was confined to a makeshift tent and treated like a prisoner -- will discourage, and in some cases halt, the desire of good-hearted professionals to volunteer to fight the war against Ebola. Cuomo's hastily modified quarantine-at-home policy is less harsh, but could have a similar chilling effect. Christie continues to embrace the original, more severe quarantine. The great irony is that the politicians, driven by ambition, are going to contain, quarantine, hassle and discourage the people who really do have the right stuff: men and women willing to put their lives on the line to save the rest of us.","Errol Louis: Texas, N.Y. governors took easy way out on Ebola returnees .

"(CNN) -- I was blissed out on vacation when Facebook gave me a one-two punch to the gut. A lovely breeze blew and jasmine hung in the air at the outdoor café as I flipped open my laptop. Among the first things I noticed: A friend had commented on my ex-fiancé's photos -- an ex I am not Facebook friends with, think about only occasionally and haven't spoken to in more than four years. I had nowhere to be and was curious. So with my latte in one hand, I clicked with the other. Boy, do I wish I hadn't. In front of me were wedding pictures. And no matter how long it's been and how wrong I know he and I were for each other, nausea washed over me -- and then came the short outburst of tears. You see, it's one thing to hear that your ex-fiancé got married; it's another to find out by being slapped with the image of him kissing his beautiful bride. In that moment, before I was able to be genuinely happy for him, I was a 43-year-old woman who hated Facebook. But thanks to my friends who learned about my experience by way of Facebook (yes, I see the irony), I quickly realized I wasn't alone. Plenty of others have had those moments when, simply put, Facebook sucks. Of course, there are the exes, including those who said they didn't want kids but are now cradling newborns. But also consider those grappling with infertility who then get blindsided by ultrasound photos and baby announcements. Or the newly divorced mother of three who's working to build a new normal but gets knocked down each time she sees vacation albums of happy, seemingly perfect and intact families. Oh, and don't forget the guy with the crumbling career who must see how another man's soars. I can't help but think about the 20-something kids running around Facebook headquarters, too young to know the hurt of not being able to bear children or failed decades-long marriages. What do they know about these sorts of life challenges? A friend from graduate school, who like me wasn't friends with his ex, had it worse. His ex got married twice, on two different continents, and then -- just when he thought he was in the clear -- she had to have an additional reception. ""I couldn't get away,"" he said. ""It dragged on and on."" And in today's Facebook world, he added, it's not enough to move from pain to acceptance. We also feel pressure to ""like"" what we see. Facebook inspires status envy . ""If I were talking with a friend and I said, 'It's fine. I'm over it. I'm happy for her,' and he pulled out a picture of her on the beach in her wedding dress and said, 'Oh yeah? Look at this. Now how do you feel?' I'd probably have to punch him,"" he wrote. Of course, Facebook offers privacy setting options and ways to block people, which can be a salve -- if, unlike me, you're able to keep up with how they all work. But like it or not, in a world where being part of Facebook seems inescapable, there's a new reality. It's one in which tiny personal daggers may be thrown at you when you least expect them. A social media expert, who refused to be named but works to put all of us out there (yes, I see the irony), had this to say in response to my concerns. ""For every ex girlfriend bummed by an old boyfriend pic there are families reunited, kidney donations offered, old friends reconnected, family reunions planned,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Just because there is Facebook doesn't mean this is a new problem -- women with fertility problems can't avoid seeing pregnant women on the street or seeing babies in strollers either, and newly divorced people or newly broken up with people can't avoid seeing happy couples on the sidewalk."" Tired of baby pics on Facebook? Try this! Fantastic points, to be sure. I get and have benefited from all that is good and powerful about Facebook. I'm not even blaming the company. I'm just formally acknowledging that sometimes it can, well, suck. It can screw you up in the head and heart in a way strangers on the street don't. The happy couple kissing on the virtual sidewalk of Facebook might include the ex. The bride, all smiles, who strolls by on Facebook linked to another man's arm could be the one who tore out your heart and stomped on it. And those new moms pushing strollers on Facebook, the ones who had perfect ultrasound photos and were able to carry babies to term, they might be the high school girls who made you feel insecure, the college roommates you once competed with, the cousins who seem to have it all when you're still struggling. ""Facebook is a happy place, for happy people, posting happy things,"" said one friend, who's had a doozy of a year. ""So when you're in a difficult life situation, it can become a terribly painful place to visit."" So very true, but the thing is this: When I got slapped with my ex-fiancé's wedding photos, I was in a happy place -- nowhere near a difficult life situation. I had no reason to avoid the visit. It was a Facebook moment that put me in a painful place. Like ripping off a Band-Aid, I both heard the news of his marriage and saw the proof in seconds. And it, frankly, sucked. The good news is, I got over it quickly. Half an hour later, I was soaking up the sunshine and could honestly say I was happy for him. But I know I was lucky. There are plenty of others for whom those beatings from Facebook last longer. For that very reason, I cannot possibly ""like"" this part of our new reality.

"(CNN) -- As a group of martial art students are put through their paces in downtown Ho Chi Minh City, grandmaster Nguyen Van Chieu sits at the side of the room wearing a quiet look of contentment. The 65-year-old has devoted his adult life to spreading the word about Vovinam, a form of martial arts originating in Vietnam. The youngsters have put on an impressive show for the cameras, running through Vovinam's frequently spectacular repertoire which includes scissor kicks and choreographed sword fights. That the martial art has such a loyal following in Vietnam is in large part down to the efforts of Van Chieu, who has spent more than four decades fostering its development. At his age, Van Chieu could be forgiven for wanting to put his feet up, but there is always more work to be done, he says. ""My dream is to open an academy, a big school, so people from other countries can come to Vietnam to research and learn Vovinam,"" Van Chieu told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""Vovinam is suitable for all people ... especially it is suitable for training programs for the armed forces and as self-defense for women,"" he says. Founded in Hanoi by grandmaster Nguyen Loc in 1938, Vovinam fuses elements of traditional Vietnamese martial arts and other martial arts from around the world. It combines both hard and soft elements, says Van Chieu, referring to the contrasting methods deployed in martial arts to repel an attack. A ""hard"" approach would see a defender meet oncoming force with force while a ""soft"" approach uses an opponent's forward momentum as a catalyst to disarm or destabilize. ""With its wide variety of techniques, Vovinam is the complete martial art,"" says Nguyen Hung, vice-president of The Federation Vovinam-VietVoDao France. ""For example, Judo uses principally (throwing) techniques, Taekwondo uses kicks and in karate, (there is) no manipulation of traditional weapons."" Vovinam melds all these separate disciplines, employing kicks, punches, throws, self-defense, wrestling and traditional weapons together with a signature leg-grappling technique. This latter move can be quite literally breathtaking to behold and involves a spectacular flying scissor-kick (called a Don Chan) that disables an opponent by seizing the leg, body or even the neck. There are also impressive demonstrations of self-defense with weapons, as the students from Ho Chi Minh City display with gusto. Firstly, a man brandishes a halberd (a six-foot pole with a wide, glinting blade at its tip) before whirling it around like a majorette might twirl a baton. Moments later, two girls carrying swords demonstrate the art of self-defense -- it's like they are rehearsing a stunt sequence for the next martial arts blockbuster. But in Vovinam, the physical is married to mental restraint and composure. ""You must have a strong mind, a strong will to work in any circumstances. The richness of Vovinam also resides in the equilibrium of technical and philosophical practice,"" says Nguyen Hung. Above all, Vovinam is a philosophical martial art which aims to make better citizens for society rather than train fighters, he says. Nguyen Van Chieu has been practicing since he was 16 and started teaching in earnest in the early 1970s becoming director of a training center in the south central province of Binh Dinh. In 1978, he was the first person to reinstate Vovinam in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. After helping oversee the sports resurgence in his homeland during the 1980s, he turned his attentions to developing the sport abroad, organizing demonstration events in more than 20 countries, starting with Belarus in 1990. Today, the World Vovinam Federation estimates that the martial art has one million participants in Vietnam with a further 500,000 active in 52 countries around the world on five continents. In France alone, Nguyen Hung reckons there are around 10,000 practitioners and earlier this year the French capital, Paris hosted the fourth Vovinam World Cup. ""Vovinam was originally Vietnamese and now today has become a martial art for everyone,"" says Nguyen Hung. In 2009, it was accepted onto the program of the Asian Indoor Games before making its debut at the Southeast Asian Games two years later. Back in Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Van Chieu can reflect on a life's work with a degree of satisfaction and pride. ""I've led this martial art life, generally I am not rich. Compared to people who do other jobs, I can be poorer,"" he says. ""I follow this path because of my passion and the spirit of the sport and because I have learned it so I have to repay the debt to my teachers. It's my destiny."" Despite his advancing years, he's still flexible enough to run through a few routines that would leave most sexagenarian's rigid with fear. ""There are many benefits to Vovinam, it gives me physical strength and energy to work. When I practice, I feel healthy and it helps me stay away from the drinking!"" Read more: Ocean is my office .

"(CNN) -- Spread across a 600-kilometer stretch of South Africa's east coast, the former Zulu Kingdom boasts one of sub-Saharan Africa's most eclectic blends of wildlife, history and culture. Largely contained today within the province of KwaZulu-Natal, the Kingdom's historical borders offer the adventure-minded traveler everything from traditional Zulu ceremonies to spectacular safaris, and a remarkably diverse array of scenic beauty. Here is CNN's guide to exploring this unique region. Durban . Most international travelers will find it easiest to start their journey from Durban, the large port city famed for its warm winters, hot summers and golden beaches. From there, take the 30-minute drive from the city center to the Valley of a Thousand Hills -- a Zulu province that takes its name from the myriad of headlands that tumble down the mighty Umgeni River, flowing out to the Indian Ocean. Those with a stomach for heights and a well-toned set of calf muscles should head straight up the 960-meter mountain ""emKhambathini"" or ""Place of the Giraffe Acacia Trees"" -- named after the umbrella-shaped tree that flourishes throughout the region. ""The views from here embody the spirit of the Zulu Nation"" says Ngokozo Mdluli, a local travel guide who specializes in Zulu culture. ""You'll see old colonial outposts sitting across from traditional tribal settlements, all set against an incredible variety of plant life."" See also: All-American opera singer finds South African soul . South Coast . Travel next to the South Coast. Situated just south of Durban and extending 150 kilometers from the Umkomaas River to Port Edward, it's also known as ""Paradise of the Zulu Kingdom."" If you happen to be here between May through to July, there's no excuse to miss the ""Sardine Run"" -- when the biggest shoal on Earth congregates around the South African coastline, prompting an annual feeding frenzy of mammoth proportions. In terms of sheer biomass, researchers estimate the sardine run could rival East Africa's great wildebeest migration, with dolphins, sharks and diving sea birds arriving in pursuit of billions of silvery pilchards. Tourists can view this aquatic spectacle from either land, sea or air. Those who can't get enough sea life will do well to explore the Aliwal Shoal, a world-famous shark-diving spot and, just to its south, the Protea Banks, an underwater museum of shipwrecks and reefs. Zululand . Located in the subtropical northern district of KwaZulu-Natal, Zululand -- as its name suggests -- is the beating heart of the Zulu Kingdom. ""We are a very friendly people"" says Mdluli, who himself was raised in a traditional Zulu village. ""Don't be surprised if on your journey you get invited to share some locally brewed beer with the village elders and you can experience them communicating with the ancestors. If you're lucky you'll be allowed to watch the traditional dance ceremonies."" Mdluli recommends arriving in September to see the biggest cultural event in the Zulu calendar -- the ""Umhlanga,"" or Reed Dance ceremony. Over the course of eight days, tens of thousands of Zulu maidens arrive from their villages bearing a long reed and proceed amidst singing and dancing to the palace of the Zulu King in the royal town of Nongoma. See more: Fusion Journeys . If you've missed the ceremony, you can still catch the four-day monthly Mona cattle and craft show here, where everything from cattle to magnificent examples of beadwork and traditional medicine are bought and sold within meters of each other. Zululand is also home to some of the Kingdom's most diverse and enchanting forests. Among them, the Dlinza forest is an ornithologist's goldmine -- teeming with over 600 exotic bird species. The adjacent Ongoye forest boasts an abundance of rare and endemic tree and plant species. Battlefields . For almost the entire 19th century, the Zulus, Britons and Boers were engaged in a bloody battle for possession of land and sovereignty across Kwazulu-Natal. Many of the most gruesome encounters were concentrated around an immense battleground that stretches from the Drakensberg Mountains, north to Volksrust and east to Zululand, covering plains of astonishing natural beauty that offer more than just famous battle sites. The rough-hewn elegance of the landscape is dotted with poignant reminders of the region's violent history. Among them are haunting memorials on the field of Isandlwana, where the Zulu army killed over 1,000 British soldiers, gravestones at Fort Pearson and the towering monument at Spioenkop, one of the most violent battles of the Anglo-Boer War. To uncover this troubled history, visit the site of the Battle of Blood River -- where causalities were so numerous between the warring Zulus and Dutch Vootrekkers that the river allegedly turned red with blood. Today there are two illuminating museums -- the Ncome and Blood River Museum offering different historical interpretations from each of the opposing sides. The Elephant Coast . Conclude your journey on the animal frontier that is the Elephant Coast. The area includes Africa's oldest game reserve, the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi- - one of the few reserves where you can see African elephants, black rhinos, Cape buffalo, lions and leopards (the ""Big Five"") all in one place. Further east, and just below the border with Mozambique, lies the Greater iSimangaliso Wetland Park. In 1999, the park was given World Heritage status due to its exquisite biodiversity, delicate ecosystems and abundance of natural beauty. Here you'll encounter some of the world's highest sand dunes, meticulous coral reefs, turtle-breeding grounds and mangrove swamps -- the perfect place to get lost in as your journey to the edge of the Zulu Kingdom draws to an end.","South Africa's former Zulu Kingdom offers history, culture, wildlife .

"(CNN) -- Leaders from Britain and Iran met Wednesday for the first time in 35 years, a potential breakthrough conversation that occurs at a time when Tehran is trying to shed Western-led sanctions over its nuclear program and Western nations are trying to garner international support for their campaign against ISIS. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani acknowledged the meeting between him and British Prime Minister David Cameron with a tweet -- picture included -- from the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. ""1 hour of constructive & pragmatic dialogue, new outlook #UNGA,"" read his message on the Cameron meeting. During his U.N. speech later Wednesday, Cameron talked about the meeting, the first since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. After talking about the need for the anti-ISIS coalition to be ""inclusive, engaging the widest possible coalition of countries as possible,"" Cameron touched on his conversation with Rouhani. The two leaders have ""severe disagreements,"" Cameron said, pointing to ""Iran's support for terrorist organizations, its nuclear program, its treatment of its people. All these need to change."" Then again, Cameron added, ""Iran's leaders could help in defeating the threat from ISIL,"" using a commonly used acronym for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. ""They could help secure a more stable and inclusive Iraq and a more stable and inclusive Syria,"" he said. ""And if they are prepared to do this, then we should welcome their engagement."" Cameron's comments came after the UK mission to the United Nations put out a statement on the meeting, saying the two leaders ""agreed that we should seek to progressively improve our bilateral relationship."" That statement referenced addressing ""the future of Iran's nuclear program."" That remains a focus in Tehran, though the hot topic this week at the United Nations is what to do about ISIS. ISIS consists of Sunni Muslims aiming to create a vast caliphate in the region under its strict, distinct version of Sharia law. Its advances into neighboring Iraq could pose a threat to Iran, especially given that Iran is made up predominantly of Shiite Muslims. In fact, Iranian leaders have voiced support for Iraq's government -- which is also led by Shiites -- in its fight against the Islamic extremist organization. Brig. Gen. Amir-Ali Hajizadeh even said that members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard ""stopped"" ISIS from entering the Kurdish city of Irbil, according to a report Wednesday from state-run Press TV. But, in the same story, Hajizadeh ripped the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition as part of Washington's ""psychological warfare"" policy. Rouhani on Wednesday criticized the coalition airstrikes in Syria, saying they do not have ""any legal standing"" because U.N. members haven't sanctioned them. Iran has been one of the biggest allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the man who U.S. President Barack Obama and other Western leaders have publicly said they want out of power -- even going so far as to support moderate opposition elements fighting to oust him. Rouhani used rhetorical questions to make his case on Twitter, writing, ""Wasn't DAESH (#ISIS) the same group who fought the Syrian gov & the Syrian army? How is that they were not categorised as #terrorists then?"" Saying that his country never ""had doubts or delays in countering #ISIS,"" Rouhani tweeted, ""Why is it that #ISIS went from not-so-bad to extremely-bad depending on who they had targeted in their #terrorist operations?"" Notwithstanding such criticism and the fact he didn't meet with Obama in New York, Rouhani didn't close the door to major changes in his nation's relationship with its longstanding, often bitter rival, the United States. ""If we are able to reach a #nuclear agreement,"" Rouhani tweeted, ""a new atmosphere would emerge in US-Iran relations, which I believe would benefit both nations.""","NEW: Iran President tweets on ""1 hour of constructive & pragmatic dialogue""

"(CNN) -- Brazilian football legend Pele's condition has improved, according to a Thursday evening statement from a Sao Paulo hospital. There had been earlier concerns about Pele's health after Albert Einstein Hospital issued a release that said his condition was ""unstable."" Thursday night's release said Pele was relocated to the intensive care unit because a kidney dialysis machine he needed was in ICU. ""He is now temporarily on renal support without any additional support,"" the statement said. The 74-year-old's representative and Pele's Twitter account dispute that the great is in ICU, saying he had been moved to a ""special care"" room with greater privacy. ""I want to take this opportunity to let you know that I am doing fine,"" his Twitter feed stated. Pele was admitted to the medical facility earlier this week with a urinary tract infection. He recently underwent surgery to remove kidney stones at the same institution. Pele is considered one of the greats of world soccer, winning three World Cups for Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970. The Brazilian is also one of the most globally recognized faces in sports. CNN's Barbara Arvanitidis contributed to this report.","Hospital says Pele's condition improved with move to ICU .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire on peaceful protesters in Thailand Friday night, killing one and wounding three, national security chief Paradon Patthanathabut said. Police do not know who the gunmen are. Protesters had gathered in the government district of Bangkok this week to demand the ouster of the country's prime minister and threatened to shut the city down for a month in January. Thailand's army chief has called an urgent meeting of his senior staff for Friday to discuss the protests. The crowd gathered at the Democracy Monument and near the Government House, but had withdrawn from other sites where they had protested a day before, including the Thai-Japanese Sports Complex Stadium. In protests near that complex, one police officer died and scores of people were injured, according to police. U.S. Embassy warning . The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok issued an emergency notice urging caution near the site of protests. ""Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. You should avoid areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations. Be alert and aware of your surroundings and pay attention to local news media reports,"" the embassy said. The unrest came as demonstrators hoped to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office. In a bid to cool tensions, the prime minister dissolved the nation's parliament this month and called for new elections, to be held February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters, who remained on the streets. Thursday's protests, in which nearly 2,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered at locations across the capital, turned violent. Police reported 129 people were injured, including the 25 police officers. A police spokesman had previously reported 35 officers had been injured, but some of the injured had been counted twice. Call to postpone elections . The national Election Commission urged the government to postpone elections. ""The current violence that just took place, it is something that we have already signaled to those who are responsible that it could happen,"" the commission said. ""We urge the government to postpone the election until a joint agreement from both sides is reached."" But Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkarnchana said a delay wasn't possible. ""The election cannot be postponed as it is against the constitution. The reform process can be done simultaneously with coming elections,"" he said. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The current protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck Shinawatra's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Unidentified gunmen fired upon demonstrators .

"London (CNN) -- There were always three pictures of King George VI on the mantelpiece of the various houses Mark Logue lived in when he was growing up -- including one signed and dated by the king on the day of his coronation -- but as a boy in the 1970s and 1980s, Logue doesn't remember wondering why. Only years later, after his father died and Logue inherited a box of papers and scrapbooks, did it all begin to make sense. Logue's grandfather was Lionel Logue, the Australian speech therapist played by Geoffrey Rush in the Oscar nominated movie ""The King's Speech."" Mark Logue -- born 12 years after his grandfather died -- had inherited some archive: Christmas cards from the king and queen, a condolence card from George VI to Lionel Logue when his wife died, and a letter of thanks from the queen for a letter Logue wrote when the king himself died several years later. The papers also include hundreds of letters exchanged by the king and the speech therapist, whom he met more than a decade before he was crowned. ""The content of the letters between them is incredibly friendly as you'd expect between two friends,"" Mark Logue says. ""But there is a kind of etiquette that Lionel still abides by,"" addressing George VI as ""your Royal Highness."" George VI addressed his friend as ""Dear Logue,"" and signed the early letters ""Albert"" -- his name before he was crowned king. The later letters are signed ""George."" Also among his grandfather's papers is what Mark Logue believes is the actual copy of the speech George VI read at the outbreak of war with Germany 1939 -- the climactic scene of the movie. ""In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history..."" the speech begins. The copy in Logue's archive contains handwritten pencil notes, indicating what words to stress and where to pause. ""The King's Speech"" condenses the friendship of the monarch and commoner into about a year, but the real George and Logue knew each other for a quarter of a century. ""The first thing that I came across that startled me was his appointment card,"" Mark Logue says. In tiny handwriting, Logue assessed his new patient, Albert, Duke of York in 1926. The duke ""has acute nervous tension which has been brought on by the defect. He is of nervous disposition... Contracts teeth and mouth and mechanically closes throat... an extraordinary habit of clipping small words - an, in , on - and saying the first syllable of one word and the last syllable of another,"" Logue wrote. The Duke saw Logue almost every day for next two or three months, in advance of a royal visit to Australia, Logue's records show. The friendship lasted for the rest of their lives, although it seems they were never photographed together. At the Coronation in 1937, Logue is seated in the royal box, with his wife, Myrtle. They are so high up, she's using opera glasses. Myrtle died suddenly of a heart attack after World War II, prompting the king to write: ""Dear Logue, I must send you one line to tell you how terribly sorry I was to hear of your bereavement. And I send you all my deepest sympathy in your great grief ...I do so feel for you as I know you had a perfect companionship with her. I am yours sincerely. George."" Mark Logue gets choked up reading the letter generations later. ""It's something about thinking about him hurting after Myrtle's death... makes it kind of real,"" he says. The archive inspired him to write a book with the author Peter Conradi. ""King's Speech"" director Tom Hooper starting looking at Logue's material about seven weeks before starting filming, Logue says -- and was able to add some details to the movie as a result. Hooper hadn't known, for example, that the king took off his jacket and stood to deliver the 1939 speech, since photos of the event show him seated and in full military uniform. And, from Logue's diary, a joke was added. ""I went to Windsor on Sunday for the broadcast... only one mistake... W in weapons,"" Logue wrote. ""After the broadcast I shook hands with the King and congratulated him. And asked him why he stopped on the W. He replied with a grin. I did it on purpose. I exclaimed -- on purpose ? And he said yes -- if I don't make a mistake they won't know it's me."" The movie did make some changes, of course: The real Lionel Logue was more deferential than Geoffrey Rush's character, and rather shorter than his movie counterpart. And another thing the movie does not tell audiences is that the king and the therapist remained close until the end of their lives. George VI died in 1952. The following year, his friend Lionel Logue died too.","The grandson of the Geoffrey Rush character in the movie has the real Lionel Logue's papers .

"(CNN) -- When people come to my house for the first time there exists only a handful of personal items worth showing off as part of the tour. Mind you, it's a rather short and uninspiring tour. The gift shop basically consists of pudding. And I'm usually not wearing pants. Nevertheless, if one does take a quick walk-about of the Bellini manor, the first thing I'll show them is a framed original Rolling Stone from 1972 with Jerry Garcia on the cover. It's pretty much the only thing I own of any interest. Beyond that, I'm left to intrigue visitors with a bunch of large sticks I tossed in a vase. Also, in the kitchen, I have a collection of condiments. None of which ever seem to impress. ""Sir, I appreciate that you have two different flavors of Cholula, but I really just need you to sign for this package."" ""Please. Don't go. I'm so alone."" Fortunately, I finally found the perfect decorative conversation starter to proudly display somewhere within the six cubic feet of space not being lorded over by my dog. And what is this amazing piece of art? Well, much in the Easter spirit, It's a giant friggin' egg! You'd have to hide it behind a Honda Civic. And if your kid can't find it, you failed as a parent. At a foot high and eight inches wide, it's essentially the same size as John Madden's head. (But covered with far fewer leftover, greasy chunks of turducken.) And it would look great in my living room next to the sticks. The only problem is that when it goes up for auction at Christie's in London during a travel and science sale at the end of April, it'll likely gavel for more than $45,000. You see, the reason this particular egg is worth so much money -- and the reason so many people started talking about it online after Christie's put it up for display -- is that it's a fully intact, fossilized ovum of the long-extinct elephant bird. Other artifacts like this have been pieced together from shell fragments. But this one is in mint condition. And if you have the money, what a great way to honor the elephant bird! Up until about the 17th century, the oxymoronically named animal lived happily on the island nation of Madagascar. And at about 10 feet tall, it was once the largest winged creature to walk the planet. But it didn't fly, for that would be asking a lot. ""Fly, stupid bird!"" ""Dude, have you seen me?"" The thing was absolutely enormous -- much bigger than an ostrich. And, apparently, it squeezed out these huge eggs that could feed a small army for a month. Or, I suppose, the entire Kansas City Chiefs offensive line for about ... six minutes. ""Easy there, Geoff. Breathe between bites."" But seriously. They're big. In fact, a single elephant bird egg is about the equivalent of 120 normal chicken eggs. And scientists say the elephant birds' lays (is that the right word?) were even bigger than those of the dinosaurs. Which would have been especially disconcerting to Envyosaurus. Of course, personally speaking as a mammal -- specifically a male mammal -- it's difficult to even imagine what birthing a big, round, shelled oval must have felt like. Which is fine because, really, such considerations don't politely lend themselves to normal conversation. Unless, perhaps, you birthed the spirit of friendship. But even then, it's of questionable taste. ""Ouch, Dave. And then what happened?"" ""I literally exploded with kindness. It was horrible."" There's no saying who might ultimately bid on this elephant bird egg, but, clearly, it takes an eccentric -- someone prone to spending money on things that don't serve a greater purpose beyond just being weird for the sake of weird. ""Jim, what the hell did you just buy?"" ""It's a used toothpick from Shaquille O'Neal. You know, for my collection."" Though, when you think about, that might also be worth having. It would look nice in my vase of sticks.","An elephant bird egg is to be auctioned in London at Christie's .

Cracking a book in the stacks at the his college library would have been a luxury because there were weeks during the school year that Pettiford was gone from campus Wednesday to Sunday. He does not recommend the grind. ""You really had to apply yourself on those trips to keep your head above water,"" said Pettiford, who will have a degree in sports management when he finishes an internship this summer at the Indiana Sports Commission. ""Basically, you better learn to be a teacher and teach yourself. You can miss a lot of class time in-season with athletics."" IUPUI has a thicker frequent-flier portfolio than many schools, but the Jaguars are not the only athletes with study hall at 30,000 feet. Boston College travels to Miami for competition in the Atlantic Coast Conference; Louisiana Tech has league games in Hawaii and Boise, Idaho. East Carolina has a league opponent in Houston, Texas. Now that Nebraska is going to the Big Ten, its athletes will make their way from Lincoln to State College, Pennsylvania, a journey of 1,072 miles. When the latest round of expansion talks in college athletics was being discussed, student athletes' welfare and the travel burden was not, so to say, driving the discussion. But those who work with athletes to keep their grades up insist the simultaneous pressures of academia and athletics can be crushing. ""A lot of the conferences are being realigned because of the commercial market for football,"" said Amy Perko, the Executive Director of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, which is watchdog on college athletics. ""The financial decisions need to be made with an eye toward how they impact the university and all student athletes. What may work with football because football games are on a Saturday may not work for the other 16 sports."" Nebraska is quitting the Big 12 to join the Big Ten because the Cornhuskers can increase the revenue for their athletic department. Officials at the University of Texas said travel considerations for athletes played a role in the university's decision to turn down an invitation to join the Pac-10 Conference, which would include trips to the Northwest. But many observers feel student athletes' welfare had little to do with the decision and UT would have bolted the Big 12 if financial concessions to Texas has not been made. ""I had teammates where points were taken off their grade for attendance, which meant they had to do better on the tests to make up for the points they lost for attendance,"" Pettiford said. ""You are missing quite a bit of classroom lecture time and what you rely on is some older guys who have taken some of those classes to help you."" ""It was a lot of lecture, there were not a lot of passed- out notes. You could look at somebody's notes, but it is not the same as being there and hearing it and writing it down. I got a C+, but it was tough."" Pettiford's mother, Lynn Howard, said she talked to her son every day by phone when he traveled, but did not nag him about school work -- until he got back to Indianapolis from a trip. ""I would ask him when he got back if things were taken care of, and they were,"" she said. ""He never complained about it; he learned early that if he wanted to play, studies come first. I don't think people have any idea what they have to go through with the travel and keeping up."" Dr. Ed Etzel, a psychologist and professor at West Virginia University who has worked with student athletes, said the rigors of travel take their toll. ""Even for the best, most motivated and well-organized students, it can be challenging to deal with trying to be excused from classes, do work in advance or make up work, studying on the road in a bus, in airplane, airport or hotel,"" Etzel said. ""The focus of these trip is to be preparing for, participating in, and subsequently recovering from physically and psychologically demanding competitions. ""It is particularly challenging when travel and competition is during weekdays -- something that is quite common."" When Georgia Tech played a Thursday night football game at Miami last season, the Yellow Jackets left campus after classes on Wednesday, missed classes on Thursday, and returned to campus Friday morning at 1:30 a.m. That is not a friendly schedule at a rigorous academic school like Tech, especially for offensive lineman Sean Bedford, an aerospace engineering major. ""I had a professor in my major, an older gentleman, who didn't quite understand that I was going to miss his class on a Thursday for a football game, he didn't understand the priority,"" Bedford said. ""Losing a day of class at a place like Tech can be tough, so you have to utilize your down time in the hotel. I don't know how the basketball guys do it with so many midweek games. We'll come back from one of those Thursday night games and just be physically exhausted. We have one of those Thursday games at Virginia Tech this season and I have a [experimental fluid dynamics] lab that day. It's something you have to plan for."" It is, after all, rocket science.","College basketball player Billy Pettiford studies on planes, buses, airports, hotels .

"(CNN) -- The investigation into the controversial shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb has been completed, the St. Louis County prosecutor's office said Wednesday. Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed the 18-year-old in the middle of the day on August 9 after telling Brown and a friend to get out of the street. Authorities could have charged Wilson themselves by filing a criminal complaint, but St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch instead opted to present the case to a grand jury to decide whether to indict the officer. Ferguson mayor: Our eyes opened to racial problems . ""The investigation has been basically completed that is being conducted by both the FBI and St. Louis County PD,"" Ed Magee, the spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told CNN. A grand jury is expected to decide by mid-November whether Wilson will be charged criminally for the shooting, which sparked weeks of unrest on the streets of Ferguson and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. The white police officer's shooting of the black teenager was heavily debated throughout the nation. The grand jury, which began meeting in August, is expected to consider whether a crime was committed and if ""probable cause"" exist that Wilson committed that crime. Some witnesses have said Brown assaulted the officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun. Others fingered Wilson as the aggressor. A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Last month, two contractors doing construction work in Ferguson on the day Brown was killed, describe the teenager with his hands up in the air as he was gunned down. The men, who asked not to be identified after CNN contacted them, said they were about 50 feet away from Wilson when he opened fire. A video captured their reactions during the moments just after the shooting. ""He had his f**n hands up,"" one of the men said in the video. The men said they didn't see how the confrontation started. Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting . Feds scrutinizing shooting, police department . Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations -- one into Brown's killing and the other into Ferguson Police Department's overall track record with minorities. One investigation will review the shooting by Wilson, a 28-year-old officer with six years of experience, including four in Ferguson. A civil rights violation would require that Wilson had shown ""racial hostility"" against Brown in the shooting, legal analysts have said. The U.S. Justice Department also announced a second inquiry to examine accusations that the police department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy-handed tactics. The shooting ignited angry protests and instances of looting on the streets of Ferguson. Community leaders criticized what they said was an excessive show of force by police to the demonstrations. Local officials have failed to soothe public outrage. Last week, even after apologizing for his department's actions following the shooting, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, insisted that he's not stepping down. ""This is mine,"" he told CNN. ""I'm taking ownership of it."" Jackson acknowledged that he's heard calls for his ouster but that doesn't mean he'll answer them. ""I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,"" Jackson said. ""Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through."" An apology, with continued unrest . The Brown shooting stirred complaints of widespread racial profiling in Ferguson, which Jackson has rejected. ""It's never been the intention of the Ferguson police department -- or any police department that I know -- to intentionally target individuals because of race,"" the chief said. ""If there is that happening, it's a crime and it needs to be addressed."" Jackson released a video apology to Brown's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to Ferguson's streets to protest the young man's death. In that video, the chief expressed regret that it took investigating officers four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead. The St. Louis suburb of 21,000 erupted again last week after one of three Brown memorials at the site of the shooting burned. While many peaceful protesters took to the street September 23, violent elements within the demonstration stoked chaos, attacking police with guns, rocks and bottles and vandalizing and looting businesses, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. One person threw a Molotov cocktail at a parking structure, and there was an attempt to set a gasoline fire at a custard shop, he said. Two officers were injured, one of whom was struck by a rock below the eye, Johnson said. The City Council has recently taken up measures to reform court procedures and the way the city handles certain fines. The council is also considering a citizen review board to monitor the police department. Complete coverage of Brown shooting and protests .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- More than 400 million people trust Google with their e-mail, and 50 million store files in the cloud using the Dropbox service. People manage their bank accounts, pay bills, trade stocks and generally transfer or store huge volumes of personal data online. Who is ultimately in charge of making sure all this information is secure: the government, the companies or the users? At a lively panel discussion at the annual Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, computer security experts discussed the roll of the government in online security. The debate centered on whether the U.S. government should take the lead in setting security standards for the industry or whether companies are responsible for their own security and that of their users. ""I lose my cool when I hear people from the government say people from the private sector need to stand up. Providing for the common defense is what the government is supposed to do,"" said security systems expert Marcus Ranum. Four ways the Internet could go down . The U.S. government is considering various security bills that address online security standards. One controversial bill, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, would allow private companies to share data with government agencies when there is an attack or breach, without fear of lawsuits from customers over the shared data. However, several civil liberties groups believe the bill needs more restrictions on how the government can use that shared information. Creating laws isn't the only way the government can push for greater security. It can also use its significant financial sway on major companies. ""The government is an enormous purchasing agent in our industry. Why can't the NSA come up with a security standard that they like?"" asked Bruce Schneier, security critic and author. ""Let them go to the operating system companies, the database companies, the cloud providers, and say if you want the government business, you have to adhere to this."" Opponents of the government-control approach say corporations are responsible for their own security online, just as they would be for the physical security of their offices or property. Law enforcement is there to respond to incidents, not make sure the doors are properly locked, they contend. Homeland Security cites sharp rise in cyberattacks . Some of the enthusiasm for the government to take the initiative on cyberthreats is rooted in distrust of big Internet companies. At one point, Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, asked the large audience of security professionals who they trusted less, Google or the government? The majority raised their hands for Google. ""I fear Google more than I pretty much fear the government,"" said panelist Jeff Moss, the founder of Black Hat and DEF CON. ""Google, I'm contractually agreeing to give them all my data."" For now, mutual distrust between the government and the private sector is keeping the two sides from working together as effectively as possible, and the public could suffer because of it. ""The biggest risks right now are not the bad guys,"" said Schneier. ""They are the good guys who are not doing enough."" The users do have some responsibility to protect their data online, but the panelists agreed that regular people will usually bypass any extra steps, even if they are in their best interest, in the name of convenience.

"(CNN) -- One of the biggest holiday weeks is upon us. Thanksgiving is a favorite day for football fans, close-knit families, families who can't stand each other, and of course, amateur competitive eaters. But what's really interesting about Thanksgiving is the day after -- known as Black Friday. It may well be the most publicized -- and puzzling -- commercial day of the year. According to the National Retail Federation, last year's Black Friday attracted more than 90 million online and in-store shoppers. Online shoppers can buy things from the comfort and safety of their homes. But what about those who succumb to mass hysteria at local megastores? We have all seen the ""shopacalypse"" on the evening news, which appears constrained only by the flimsy protection of a few Tensabarriers and some security guys. When you step back and think about it, it seems strange that in an era of increasing civil liability, large retailers would invite this bedlam, and the likely personal-injury lawsuits that follow. There's even a website, www.blackfridaydeathcount.com, which tracks and compiles statistics on injuries and deaths. Are we really surprised people get hurt on Black Friday? Granted, it's an open invitation to every nudnik, whose only qualifications are: 1) They don't have to be at work; and 2) they are willing to wake up at 5 a.m. to elbow their way to saving $3 on a Sony Discman or a Cabbage Patch Doll. So how do we evaluate the liability of a store for injuries on its premises during Black Friday? Let's take a look at common law. Once a person steps onto private property, the law traditionally considered him one of the following: 1) trespasser; 2) licensee; or 3) invitee. Everyone knows what a trespasser is. If you enter (or remain) on someone's property without his consent, you are a trespasser. Deadly force can be used on an intruder in one's home, but that's based on defense of self, not defense of property. You can use a gun to defend yourself at home against an intruder. On the other hand, if you own an abandoned barn, you cannot install trip wires attached to shotguns, poison darts, snake pits or any of the traps from the Indiana Jones movies. You might think an ""invitee"" is someone who is just invited on to the property, say, for a cocktail party, but that's not it. If your buddy invites you over for a Super Bowl party, you're just considered a ""licensee."" This means you are on the property with permission. You're not providing your pal any business benefit, other than emotional support for his team, and divesting him of his chips and salsa. The only obligation your host has to licensees is to inform of the known danger on the property, and any not so obvious danger your host would expect you wouldn't know about. An ""invitee,"" on the other hand, is someone who enters the land for a purpose connected with or benefiting the business owner. When you shop at a store, you're considered an ""invitee."" Historically, a landowner owed the invitee the highest duty of care, to inspect or warn of defects on the premises. In modern times, states and courts alike have increasingly rejected these antiquated distinctions and applied a more universal ""reasonable"" standard to landowners, sometimes even to trespassers. However, whether applying the traditional common law or a modern rule, if you are on someone's property for the purpose of spending money, courts will hold the landowner to the highest applicable standard of care. Even the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has acknowledged the sometimes fatal injuries suffered on Black Friday, and has published crowd management safety guidelines for retailers. OSHA and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 focus primarily on employers providing workers with safe and healthy workplaces, but their guidelines speak to preventing all injuries at retail sales events, with a specific nod to Black Friday. The OSHA guidelines offer suggestions about where a court might look for the standards of care. According to the guidelines, there should be adequate security, and sufficient crowd control measures. A store is not automatically liable if a customer sucker-punches another customer over an X-Box, but it may be liable if the assault were foreseeable and the failure of security measures contributed to the assault. The bottom line is that stores will be liable if people are injured by known, unsafe and nonobvious conditions on their property on Black Friday, especially if stores take no special safety or security precautions, and treat the day like any other day. If a store knows it is expecting several times its normal traffic, it must anticipate the problems attendant to the increased foot traffic, and the potential for riffraff. It's true that no store can ever prevent a meteor landing on the roof. No store can guarantee that another customer won't suddenly go mad and punch another person in the head. No amount of security can prevent the unpredictable -- it's the same problem often encountered by stadiums when drunken sports fans attack. But, if a store is deliberately indifferent to security problems, then it may be liable where it knowingly ignores the behavior of that riffraff. The sweet spot of security is somewhere between the extremes of razor wire and pepper spray, and the minimal effort of a ""no shoes, no shirt, no service"" sign. A simple rule is that stores should be held liable for the increased risk they create -- especially when that risk creation is tied to a direct economic benefit. If a Black Friday sale devolves into the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and the store knowingly allowed dangerous conditions on the property, it's likely that the store will be held liable for injuries on the premises. It's interesting that if you want to hold a rally or protest a grand jury, you might need a permit to exercise your First Amendment rights. But if you are a big-box retailer holding a big-box sale, it seems that as long as you are generating revenue and paying taxes, you can host the retail equivalent of Bonnaroo with nary a complaint. Ultimately, if a mall encourages this behavior, maybe it gets exactly what it deserves. Maybe the Black Friday retailer deserves the Black Friday shopper. So the next time you make fun of people who set out on Christmas Eve for the mall, remember this: The smattering of losers like me may have waited until the last minute to get our shopping done, but at least no one gets hurt in the process.","Danny Cevallos: Black Friday may be the most crazy commercial holiday of the year .

"(CNN) -- The earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan on March 11 last year took an estimated 19,000 lives, caused the evacuation of about 300,000 people, and set off the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The meltdowns of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors ended Japan's plans to produce half of its electricity through nuclear energy. Flotsam from 2011 Japan tsunami reaches Alaska . All of Japan's remaining reactors are offline, and experts believe that strong anti-nuclear feelings will keep them from restarting for some time. Beyond Japan's shores, the crisis has pushed Germany, Italy and Switzerland to end their commitment to nuclear power. Fukushima has given U.S. nuclear regulators four important lessons given a tendency to downplay the far-reaching consequences of disasters and outdated ways of preparing for them. First, we know from multiple disasters that people who live far from predetermined evacuation zones will move themselves and their families to places where they feel safe. We saw this during the Three Mile Island scare when 200,000 people in Pennsylvania -- far more than the 3,500 people advised to leave -- departed en masse from the area. These ""shadow"" evacuations cause gridlock and delays, impeding the evacuations that are actually necessary. Many of the evacuees never return. About one-fifth of foreigners in Japan, many living as far as 180 miles away in Tokyo, have yet to return after the exodus following the Fukushima meltdowns. Beyond simply relocating in the short term, anxiety about nuclear contamination caused many Japanese mothers to permanently take their children out of Fukushima prefecture, leaving husbands with local jobs behind. Policy makers must factor in such behaviors when planning for accidents at nuclear power facilities. Next, Fukushima illuminated the heart-rending choices faced by first responders to disasters. As the scope of the 3/11 disaster became apparent, some Tokyo Electric Power Co. workers left the site of the nuclear power plant to help their own families flee the disaster. We saw a similar situation in post-Katrina New Orleans, when New Orleans police officers evacuated with their families as floodwater rose. Of course, many first responders put their responsibilities to their communities and their posts ahead of their own self-interest. One Japanese mayor stayed at city hall helping to evacuate others rather than returning to his own home to search for his wife, who had been swept away by the tsunami. Planners must take into account the impossible choices thrust upon those on the front lines and factor in their own families' well-being. Third, Fukushima has underscored the ways in which formal evacuation plans are ""fantasy documents."" Lee Clarke of Rutgers University pointed out long ago that documents prepared by firms operating complex and potentially hazardous facilities have to turn unknown risks into known risks for their regulators. Such plans -- which local residents may not read closely if they read them at all -- are produced to ensure that utilities follow the law. The Indian Point reactor, not even 35 miles away from downtown Manhattan, runs regular evacuation drills for people who live within 10 miles of the plant. But drawing a 10-mile circle around a nuclear facility on a map does not contain fallout at that boundary. Many observers protested when a French official running the country's nuclear watchdog agency downplayed the consequences of the approaching Chernobyl radiation in a TV interview. He seemed to imply that the health effects of the radioactive cloud from the May 1986 meltdown had stopped at the border, as if it lacked the proper visa for entry. Radiation from the Fukushima meltdowns spread to the town of Iitate, well outside the 20-mile boundary set up by the Japanese government. All but 100 of the town's 7,000 residents have since moved out. Experts continue to debate the size of safe zones in nuclear accidents. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has agreed to evaluate the possibility of establishing a 50-mile emergency evacuation zone around nuclear power plants in the United States. This is because the NRC itself recommended that U.S. citizens in Japan evacuate from a 50-mile zone around the Fukushima reactors soon after the accident. Past analyses showed that more than half of the population of the United States lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. (Check your zip code at this site to see how far you live from one.) A 50-mile zone would require that millions of Americans be informed of their possible evacuation in the case of an accident, an outcome which would undoubtedly increase anti-nuclear sentiment. Finally, the meltdowns in Fukushima have punctured any ""100% safe"" myths that had survived Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Engineers and planners need to show humility when talking about risks to an ever-more-skeptical public; this is especially true in highly complex and interconnected nuclear facilities, which Charles Perrow of Yale University recognized as susceptible to ""normal accidents."" For some, nuclear power's promise of a stable, carbon dioxide-free power source is worth any risks from accidents and the problem of nuclear waste storage. For others, Fukushima represents the third accident in an industry that has little room for error. We ignore these lessons and underestimate the potential consequences of the next disaster at our peril. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel P. Aldrich.","Daniel Aldrich: The Fukushima meltdowns reveal flaws in nuclear disaster planning .
Huge evacuations caused gridlock, he says, and first responders left for their families .
Aldrich: a 10-mile evacuation radius is a ""fantasy""; at least a 50-mile radius is needed .
Aldrich: Half of America lives within 50 miles of a plant; we can't dismiss the risks ."
"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Somewhere in the world, a child dies of hunger every five seconds -- even though the planet has more than enough food for all. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon laid out this sobering statistic as he kicked off a three-day summit on world food security Monday in Rome. ""Today, more than 1 billion people are hungry,"" he told the assembled leaders. Six million children die of hunger every year -- 17,000 every day, he said. The summit opened with the leaders adopting a declaration to renew their commitment to eradicating hunger. They promised to do so by promoting investment, reversing the decline in funding for agriculture and tackling the effect of global warming on food security. Urgent action is critical, Ban said. In 2050, the world will need to feed 2 billion more mouths -- 9.1 billion in all. The steps Ban proposed included providing farmers with seeds and land and offering them access to better markets and fairer trade. ""These small-holder farmers are the heart and soul of food security and poverty reduction,"" he said. ""Our job is not just to feed the hungry but to empower the hungry to feed themselves."" The summit came under criticism even before it began, with some aid groups skeptical that it would accomplish much. The United Nations hopes that donors will go beyond affirming their support to end hunger and fulfill a promise they made during a Group of Eight meeting in July to increase food aid significantly. Though more than 60 world leaders are at the summit, all but one of the G-8 leaders were absent. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Belusconi is hosting the gathering. The United States sent the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Britain sent two ministers. During his speech, Ban also tied the global warming crisis to hunger eradication. The melting of Himalayan glaciers will affect the livelihood of 300 million people in China and up to 1 billion throughout Asia, he said. And African farmers might see harvests drop by 50 percent by 2020. The United Nations has scheduled a climate summit next month in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""There can be no food security without climate security,"" Ban said. ""They must produce results. ""The world is impatient for us to make a difference. I, too, am impatient. And I am committed."" The United Nations also seeks commitment from the public, making an online appeal for individual donations to fight hunger. The U.N. World Food Program's ""Billion for a Billion"" campaign aims to reach 1 billion individuals. ""If a billion Internet users donate a dollar or a euro a week, we can literally transform the lives of a billion hungry people across the world,"" said Josette Sheeran, the World Food Program's executive director. Small donations can make a big difference, Sheeran said. ""Year in, year out, governments have supported WFP in its mission to feed the world's hungriest people, but they cannot be expected to do it alone,"" Sheeran said. ""It's time for members of the public to act.""","More than 1 billion hungry, U.N. official says at summit for world food security .

"Seoul (CNN) -- North Korea uses multiple techniques to defy sanctions, and shows no signs of abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, according to a U.N. report. An eight-member panel of experts said the country ""is experienced in actions it takes to evade sanctions,"" including using its embassies. North Korean embassies in Cuba and Singapore facilitated its banned arms trade as proven by the North Korean ship, Chong Chon Gang, which was caught with undeclared weaponry from Cuba in July, the report said. The amount of money made from this trade is subject to debate, but ""there is no question that it is one of the country's most profitable revenue sources,"" according to the report. In addition, the report said it investigated allegations that former NBA star Dennis Rodman and his party took luxury goods to Pyongyang in recent months. While not explicitly accusing Rodman of defying U.N. sanctions on luxury goods, it said there was evidence. North Korea's missile capabilities . ""Media reports corroborated by the panel indicate that among items taken by Dennis Rodman and his party during their visits were sporting goods from various countries, five bottles of vodka (United States), one bottle of whiskey (Ireland), two whiskey glasses and one whiskey decanter (Ireland), and a Mulberry handbag (United Kingdom) ) taken by Paddy Power, a company based in Ireland."" The report said some of these items are on the U.S. or E.U. lists of banned luxury goods.

"(CNN) -- In an age when Russian oligarchs and Arab Sheikhs spend billions of dollars on forging the perfect dream team, fan ownership has become a novelty for many of Europe's top soccer clubs. But it is a route that might just be the salvation of struggling Spanish team Real Oviedo, thanks to a social media campaign that has gone viral. Once a top-flight contender with La Liga heavyweights Real Madrid and Barcelona, the 86-year-old club -- based in the northern mining region of Asturias -- has until Saturday to raise €1.9 million ($2.4 million) or face extinction. So far Oviedo has received over €1 million in a period of just nine days -- with €274,000 coming from those who heard about it via Twitter, according to board member Juan Ramon. There is a Twitter hashtag set up -- #saverealoviedo. The football community is also doing its part to save the third division club, whose ""cantera"" youth academy -- or quarry -- is responsible for unearthing some of the gems of Spanish football. Names such as World Cup winner Juan Mata, Arsenal's little magician Santi Cazorla and Swansea's star striker Michu are all graduates. The English Premier League stars have joined forces to help save their former club, while Real Madrid legend Raul has bought €1,000 worth shares to keep Oviedo in business. Real Oviedo and Sporting de Gijon are the two major clubs in Asturias, once the heartland of Spanish coal mining and one of the country's most prosperous regions. But its coal industry has receded and the European debt crisis has engulfed Spain. Substantial investment has been hard to find as the Spanish government grapples with harsh austerity measures and chronic unemployment. In a desperate attempt to salvage the club and guarantee its future in the short term, the board of directors announced a share issue earlier this month to attract investment. The scheme -- open to anyone with a spare €11 ($13) -- has become an instant Twitter sensation, and football fans around the world have been quick to show their support by purchasing shares. However, Spanish football expert and long-time Real Oviedo supporter Sid Lowe says he is unsure whether the social-network campaign will be enough to save the club before the looming deadline. Lowe -- who has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of Oviedo's plight among football fans -- told CNN the worldwide response from supporters is ""absolutely astonishing."" Last week, queues formed outside the club's 30,000-seater stadium, the Estadio Carlos Tartiere, as fans clamored to buy a stake in their beloved club. ""The financial target is quite modest in football terms ... but serious investment for the club is very hard to find, particularly in a place like Asturias,"" Lowe said. 'A perfect storm' After 13 consecutive seasons in La Liga, Oviedo dropped to the second division in 2001. The real turmoil began in 2003, when mismanagement from the club's directors bought the Asturian team to the brink of bankruptcy. The boardroom turned into a political battlefield as relationships soured, aggravated by a series of poor performances on the field, according to Real Oviedo shareholder Rodolfo Diaz. Diaz -- an Oviedo supporter since the 1970s and a season ticket-holder for over 20 years -- has stuck with the club through good times and bad. He told CNN that 2003 was like a ""perfect storm"" for Oviedo. ""In modern times, Real Oviedo has been a victim of greed and businessmen who wanted to make profits quickly,"" he said. Today, Diaz is pleased to see that control of the club is back in the hands of the supporters and that football fans globally are buoying the club through charitable donations. ""As a linguist, football is that universal language that we all speak and we all understand. It allows us to bond,"" he said. ""This bad situation has generated a very positive spirit through Twitter."" Club ownership . Real Oviedo is not the only Spanish club to embrace shareholder power. Barcelona -- touted as the best football team in the world -- is governed by a group of fans called the ""socis."" In return for an annual fee of €140, members are tasked with electing the club president and voting on matters affecting the side. In Germany, it is a requirement for clubs in the league -- known as the Bundesliga -- to be 51% owned by supporters or members to ensure they're managed responsibly. Ramon believes an influx of shareholder fans provides a ""great opportunity"" and can create a more financially stable and healthy environment for football teams. ""Across Europe, a movement is developing that aims to promote the influence of fans at football clubs,"" he told CNN. On November 7, Supporters Direct Europe, the association of European football fans, presented a list of recommendations to the European Parliament in Brussels, including greater involvement for supporters in their clubs and financial fair play. ""The social role of football is of great importance,"" said Ivo Belet, a member of European Parliament involved with the movement. ""This is the reason supporters should have a say in the management of their clubs."" Uncertain future for Oviedo . Although the future of Real Oviedo remains far from certain, Diaz says he would expect nothing less of the club he has followed since he was a boy. ""It is quite a poetic situation -- a club on the verge of extinction -- and I think in the last minutes everything will be solved. In injury time, we will come out fighting and gain victory."" Diaz thinks Real Oviedo will play until the end of this season, even if the club does not meet its November 17 deadline -- when the team faces a tough trip away to the reserve side of second-placed La Liga club Atletico Madrid. ""It's the same of story for the fans, we will suffer to the very end.""","Real Oviedo's story has become an instant Twitter sensation as football fans snap up shares .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Beth Rutstein rolls up the sleeves of her T-shirt, juggles a stack of fliers and knocks on the door of a stranger's home. She's on a mission to save lives. After wiping sweat from her face beneath the sweltering afternoon sun on a recent Thursday, she ascends another set of stairs leading to a front door and knocks. No one answers, but she's greeted warmly by neighbors sitting in the shade of the covered connecting porch. ""We're here doing free HIV testing,"" she tells them, handing over a flier. ""We decided to come here because 19143 has one of the highest rates of HIV in the entire city."" That's the ZIP code for southwest Philadelphia, one of many urban neighborhoods across the United States that account for the bulk of the nation's HIV cases. Rutstein, a second-year medical student, is one of 60 outreach volunteers who spent their summer going door-to-door alongside health care workers testing residents within the 19143 ZIP code. This part of Philadelphia -- like many other urban neighborhoods in the United States -- has an HIV infection rate on par with many sub-Saharan African nations, including Sierra Leone and Ghana, according to UNAIDS. In fact, more Americans are living with HIV infections today than ever before partly because of an increase in testing and treatment options, according to the Centers for Disease Control. About 1.2 million Americans are HIV positive, with a rate of 50,000 new cases each year, according to the CDC. Yet, 20% of those infected are unaware they are HIV positive. AIDS survivor: Epidemic isn't over yet . In Philadelphia, more than 19,000 residents have HIV, with the highest rates among black residents living in low-income neighborhoods with limited access to health care facilities and services. ""About 40 to 50 neighborhoods account for about half of the United States' infections,"" said Amy Nunn, founder of Philadelphia's Do One Thing, Change Everything Campaign. ""In Philadelphia, a few neighborhoods have very high rates of infection, and those few neighborhoods are driving the overwhelming share of infections."" To change that, Nunn and her team enlisted volunteers to go to those neighborhoods, knock on doors, get people tested and, if HIV positive, get them free treatment. While many volunteers get a ""no thank you,"" they have tested more than 160 people since the program started in July. So far, no one has tested positive for HIV. The door to door campaign is not the first HIV outreach in Philadelphia, but it is arguably the most ambitious. The Do One Thing program aims to diagnose as many people as possible, as well as create a prevention model that can be replicated in other U.S. cities. The program also gets its message out through social media, billboards, community and church leaders, as well as local health centers. Part of the problem is combating a lack of awareness about who is at risk for getting HIV. ""A lot of people, even in 2012, think this is a gay disease,"" Nunn said. ""But that's not the case, especially in Philadelphia."" Opinion: End the HIV stigma . Southwest Philadelphia resident Dennis Brown was shocked to learn that his neighborhood has one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the city. He agreed to get tested for the virus for free on the spot. Inside the mobile medical RV -- complete with two examination rooms and waiting area -- health worker Danielle Parks swabbed Brown's cheeks and gums as part of the routine, rapid HIV test. ""This is a preventable disease,"" Parks said. ""Blacks carry the burden of genetic diseases from high blood pressure to diabetes. HIV is the one thing you don't inherit. It's the one thing we can prevent."" Compared with other races and ethnicities, African-Americans make up a larger proportion of HIV infections at all stages of the disease, according to the CDC. In 2009, 44% of all new HIV infections were African-Americans -- most of them men, the CDC found. About 20 minutes after his test, Brown gets the results. ""It says I'm not positive,"" said Brown holding up his HIV/AIDS results card. ""It's better to know than not to know. It made my heart sink to hear about the rates in southwest Philly."" Nunn said she is confident that her grassroots effort will not only spread awareness about HIV but also provide more access to treatment. ""We're taking all of our tools and putting them in one of the hottest zones in the city to see ... if we can really make a difference in eradicating racial disparities in HIV infection,"" Nunn said. ""One of the biggest problems is that a lot of people don't think that they're at risk for HIV, and so what we're trying to do is get as many people tested as possible so we can link people who test positive to treatment services."" Her grassroots outreach is a key component of the United States' first HIV/AIDS national strategy, launched in 2010, which emphasizes providing support in the communities most affected by the disease. This summer, as Nunn's volunteers hit the streets, the United States hosted its first International AIDS Conference in Washington, something that was only possible because of the removal of a travel ban preventing HIV-positive people from entering the country. Treating HIV has come a long way since it was first discovered in the early 1980s. The virus, which can lead to AIDS, is most often treated with a cocktail of anti-viral drugs that not only reduces the likelihood of AIDS infection but also decreases the chances of transmitting the virus. FDA panel recommends drug to prevent HIV . After seeing statistics for HIV infection rates blot out specific neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Nunn decided she wanted to try something different. So she turned to testing models in Kenya that reached people at their homes and in their neighborhoods, reaching people who otherwise might not have been tested. This model helped get people who tested positive into treatment much earlier in the course of their infection -- helping to stop the spread of the virus. Just because the HIV rates are higher in certain parts of the city doesn't mean the issue doesn't impact the broader community, said Rutstein. ""It's not just this ZIP code and this census track,"" she said. ""The fact that I can jump on a trolley and get here means that I'm close enough to have to worry about it."" Back in Kingsessing, Eric Brown spotted the RV parked in his neighborhood offering free HIV tests and wandered in on his way home. Brown, a 25-year-old father of two, lost his mother to AIDS a decade ago. While she wasn't infected during her pregnancy, the disease hits close to home for Brown. He said he tries to get tested whenever he can. While waiting for the results, Brown answered a series of questions from rapid test volunteer Ladonna Smith. ""I didn't tell people about my mom, I didn't say what she had,"" Brown said. ""She was dying slow and then went to hospice. I was there when she died."" ""Are you ready,"" Smith asked. ""Yes,"" he said matter-of-factly. ""You are negative for HIV,"" she said. It's the answer he expected. With his results card and a few fliers for neighbors, Brown headed home. ""I was really touched by him,"" said Smith watching him walk out of view. ""He knew she didn't have to die, but it didn't break him and he's not bitter."" 30 years of AIDS moments to remember .","HIV is prevalent in many low-income neighborhoods in U.S. cities .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- For his first event in New Hampshire on Thursday, Sen. Rand Paul agreed to do some phone-banking at U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown's headquarters in Manchester. The Kentucky Republican sat down at a long table, where he was flanked by the state's GOP chairwoman Jennifer Horn and Brown's wife, Gail, who were also making calls. Brown, who Paul endorsed at a separate event last month, was out of town. Nine journalists — roughly half with cameras — gathered quietly in front of Paul to observe. Rand Paul: Ebola is 'not like AIDS' No one answered Paul's first phone call, and an aide from the headquarters stepped in to dial out to the next person. The same thing happened after the second. After the third, the aide had briefly looked away and didn't immediately jump in to redial. ""Alright, let's keep going,"" Paul said, looking around and sounding agitated. ""Who's helping me?"" The aide quickly returned to the phone and pressed the right buttons. Paul seemed puzzled that the system didn't do that on its own, and it was becoming clear that those few seconds of entering new numbers were becoming a waste of time. Mitt Romney, Scott Brown pair up after 2012 pause . The doctor in him had a solution. ""I just thought of a software update for you,"" he said, suggesting they use a program that automatically calls the next name on a list after an unsuccessful attempt. He repeated his prescription to Horn. The phone-banking marked an example of Paul's no-frills, straight-to-the-chase personality. He's not one to make jokes or put on a smile in awkward moments just to fill space. In a stark contrast to the effusive styles of many politicians, he's indeed eager to ""keep going"" and unafraid to show impatience at times. That's in part because he maintains an aggressive, fast-paced schedule, crisscrossing the country to campaign for 2014 candidates and raise his national profile as he prepares a potential presidential bid. His visit Thursday — a campaign-style, four-city blitz across the state -- was his fourth time to New Hampshire since early last year. With its first-in-the-nation primary status, the state is a big attraction for White House hopefuls. Another few calls went unanswered Thursday morning, and each time the aide stepped in to help. Paul would sit back in his chair cross-legged with every call, staring down blankly at the table as the media looked on. ""We're going to have to plan ahead before we get to the next office,"" Horn said, with a slightly frustrated tone. She then recommended that he just leave a message, but Paul didn't like the idea. After the eighth attempt, he lowered the phone. ""Bad number."" Horn decided to try something else. She took over his phone and called someone whose number she knew by memory and who she described as an undecided voter. But she didn't get through. She had to dial out again. This time it didn't ring. The aide came back to help redial. No one answered. ""Ok, you're not going to talk to anyone this morning,"" Horn laughed nervously to Paul. ""Put me back on the random thing,"" he said. ""I'm going to eventually get someone."" He cracked a slight smile that seemed to bring some relief to the situation. They urged him to leave a voicemail again, but he refused. Then, suddenly: ""Hey is this Carol? This is Rand Paul, how are you doing?"" Having reached someone on his twelfth call, he made his pitch for Brown. A former U.S. senator from Massachusetts who was defeated by Elizabeth Warren in 2012, Brown is running for the Senate again, this time from neighboring New Hampshire where he had a vacation home. He officially moved to the state less then a year ago. ""I don't know exactly what made his decision as far as relocating here,"" Paul said, answering an apparent question from the voter about Scott's transition. The attack on Brown as a carpetbagger is a strategy used by Brown's opponent, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, in what's become an expensive and competitive race. ""I know he's had a lot of roots here,"" Paul continued, before spelling out Brown's connections to the state. Paul went on to describe Brown as an ""honest"" man and talked up the former senator's economic positions. He hung up after they spoke for several minutes, only to find that he had to punch yet more buttons, telling the system whether the voter was still undecided or not. ""Alright, I finally got through to somebody,"" he said, appearing satisfied. ""Did you convince them?"" asked Gail, Brown's wife. ""Well,"" he said, lingering with reluctance, ""They're still undecided."" At the end of the 13-minute ordeal, he stood up and issued his recommendation to the aide for a fourth time: ""If you can figure out how that can go automatically...it could have gone a little faster,"" Paul said. ""But also maybe your younger people who can see the phone are better at it than me,"" he joked, drawing a laugh out of the aide while Paul grabbed his upper arm — politician style — to say goodbye. Paul, Horn and Brown drove about 20 minutes to the next stop in Concord, where they would phone-bank once again. This time, someone was on the other line for Paul's first call.","Rand Paul was in New Hampshire for the fourth time since early last year.
The state is a must-stop for presidential hopefuls.
This time he was campaigning for other candidates in the state before the midterms.

"(CNN) -- It stands at the entrance to the Panama Canal and took longer than the waterway to build, but a brightly colored biodiversity museum designed by architect Frank Gehry has finally celebrated its official opening . BioMuseo, a 4,000-square-meter exhibition space and botanical park, has been commissioned to highlight Panama's natural wonders and its role as a geological bridge between two continents. With its vivid appearance, BioMuseo has become a familiar sight to ships using the Canal's eastern gateway and to people using the nearby Bridge of Americas that connects to an offshore archipelago. Although its shape is reminiscent of Gehry's earlier works -- which include landmarks such as the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles -- its bold color scheme is a departure. It's Gehry's first in Latin America, despite the fact his wife is Panamanian. Repeated delays . The museum was first conceived in 1999, but bureaucratic issues caused repeated delays, meaning it took 15 years to complete -- five more than the Canal, which opened in 1914 after a decade of construction. Visitors to BioMuseo will pass through a series of galleries incorporating interactive dioramas, including ""Panamarama"" -- a three-level, 12-screen projection space intended to create an immersive rainforest experience. Built on a former U.S. military base, the exhibition is described on the museum's website as ""a combination of art and science that leads the visitor to experience a marvelous phenomenon.""

"(CNN) -- Friday's crash of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two, with its tragic loss of life, comes just three days after the failure of Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Antares re-supply mission to the International Space Station. Launching spaceships is obviously a very difficult business. The payload sits atop a huge amount of fuel, often weighing many times more than the satellite or material being sent into space. Every physics student knows the rocket problem: You need a lot of fuel to get a heavy spacecraft moving, and the weight of the unburned fuel itself has to be lifted as well. To increase the weight of the payload a rocket can lift, more fuel is needed, enough to lift the extra payload weight and lift the weight of the extra fuel. It's kind of like compound interest. Add more mass to the payload and you have to add a lot more fuel. The payload carried on the failed Antares rocket was reportedly about 1% as heavy as the spacecraft plus fuel. That means the majority 99% was working hard to lift the 1% dead weight. Early rocket designers realized the advantage of using two separate lift stages. After the fuel in the first stage has completely burned up, its container can be jettisoned, lightening the total spacecraft weight by much more than the burned fuel. The second stage can then accelerate the payload faster than if the empty fuel tank were still attached. The first stage has to do the most work because it lifts the full weight of payload plus fuel from a dead stop. The second stage has an easier job since the rocket is already moving and is much lighter without the weight of the first stage fuel plus container. Another design advance was to operate stages in parallel. That accelerates the rocket faster because at no point are any rocket stages dead weight. Analysis: Will space accidents deter pioneer tourists? The history of rocket development is littered with explosions, back to the first reported rockets in 14th century China and Korea. Even sophisticated systems well along the development path, like NASA's space shuttle, had failures. Orbital Sciences and Virgin Galactic are still developing their technologies and processes. NASA's long record of mostly successful launches made spaceflight look so routine that we may have forgotten how difficult it is. Could the modern world do without launching materials and people into space? Probably not. Satellites and other spacecraft are an integral part of navigation, weather, space science, earth science and ultra-fast global communications -- not to mention robotic and human exploration. Even if we forgo exotic trips to Mars, an awful lot of technology here on Earth won't work without space assets. Launching America into space isn't for the faint of heart. But it's still the future.","The crash of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two comes on heels of a rocket explosion .

"Washington (CNN) -- A super PAC backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch is dropping $6.5 million into six competitive Senate races in a final ad push to send Republican candidates to the upper chamber. The television ads, which will air in Alaska, Arkansas, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire, link Democratic candidates in each race to President Barack Obama, reinforcing Republican messaging throughout the 2014 midterm season that has pushed the Democratic candidates in each of those states to keep their distance from the President. Local residents are the face of ads in the six states, saying either ""there are lots of reasons"" or ""there are many reasons"" why the Democrat doesn't deserve their vote. And the voters go on to say in similar form that, ""A vote for [insert Democratic candidate here] is a vote for President Obama."" The ads also close by directly endorsing the Republican candidate for Senate in each race, a push not seen from groups in the Koch political network before 2014. That's because Freedom Partners Action Fund is the first super PAC in the Koch's web of political groups that can do so under campaign laws. And while super PACs, unlike nonprofit issues groups, are required to disclose their donors, super PACs can also directly support individual candidates. The group was founded in June and the Koch Brothers donated more than $4 million to Freedom Partners Action Fund, according to the group's October quarterly disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission. The super PAC has also launched ads in several congressional districts in the last week and plans to push additional ads in key states before the election is over. ""We'll launch additional ads, it's just for these states these are kind of our close out messages,"" the group's spokesman James Davis said.

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- A few reflections from survivors of the massacre at an Aurora, Colorado, theater from CNN interviews: . 'That's when I felt a big ole bang in my leg' Bonnie Kate Pourciau, 18, said she is ""not a huge Batman fan, really,"" but decided to go to the movie after she and her friend Elizabeth Sumrall stopped at a hotel in Aurora en route from Seattle to their homes in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When the gunfire broke out, Pourciau told CNN affiliate KMGH from her bed in Aurora Medical Center, she thought it was special effects in the movie. But she soon realized what was going on. ""That's when I grabbed Elizabeth and we ducked under our seats."" Crouched behind her seat, she prayed. ""Lord, just protect us, keep us safe,"" she recalled thinking. ""That's when I felt a big ole bang in my leg."" Once the shooting stopped, Pourciau tried to run from the theater, but didn't get far. ""Of course, I fell because my knee is all gone,"" she said about the bullet wound that shattered her knee. ""I tried to run and just stumbled and fell."" By now, Pourciau and her friend had separated in the panic, and another movie patron risked his life by helping her scramble to the exit, where she and Sumrall reunited, she said. ""Elizabeth laid me on the concrete,"" and a police officer and a member of the National Guard soon approached. The officer carried her to a patrol car and the member of the National Guard wrapped her leg, which had been losing blood quickly. Despite the chaos, Pourciau said she felt calm. ""I was overwhelmed with the sense of security and peace -- that it was going to be OK,"" she said. Having already undergone three surgeries on her leg, Pourciau said she expected to be transferred Thursday to a hospital closer to her home. 'A silver lining to a very dark cloud' Baby Hugo was born Tuesday morning to Katie and Caleb Medley. They had gone to the movie as a treat before the expected delivery this week of their child. The gunfire did not strike Katie, but Caleb was shot in the face. He lost his right eye, suffered brain damage and is in critical condition. His brother said Caleb seems to understand what happened, but it was unclear whether he knew he has a baby boy. ""He's making small improvements, baby steps every day,"" said Seth Medley about his eldest brother. When the baby was taken into Caleb's hospital room, ""he moved his hand towards the baby, trying to feel his son, trying to touch him."" Caleb's heart rate and blood pressure rose, Seth said. Caleb had been doing standup comedy routines in Denver and was working full time at Target, but he had no health insurance, his brother said. Seth Medley said becoming an uncle was bittersweet for him. ""We were all looking forward to this,"" he said. ""It's a silver lining to a very dark cloud, but we all know Caleb, we know he's a fighter, we know he's not going to stay out of that child's life for any length of time if he can avoid it."" Christian Bale visits victims, families honor lost loved ones . 'There were kids, mothers and fathers' Josh Nowlan survived the bloodbath in Aurora, and his friends hail him as a hero for shielding them with his body. Nowlan was shot in the left calf and right arm in the process. ""Of course I'm glad it's over with, and I'm glad I'm alive and I get to see my kids,"" Nowlan, whose sons are 7 and 9, said as his voice cracked with emotion. ""But I also think about, you know, the other people that weren't as lucky as I was. There were kids, mothers and fathers that were there, and they're dead. I'm still alive."" Nowlan said he wants to go back into the screening room where the killings took place, ""look down at that same seat and say 'I beat you. You did not take this life.' "" Tales of heroism abound from tragedy . 'You don't want to leave knowing that you said something' Corbin Dates says he's not sure how he survived the killings. He and a friend both escaped unhurt, and he said he has ""a blank feeling inside"" when he looks back at the building. Remembering the victims . But the experience left him sounding somewhat philosophical. ""Certain circumstances can happen at any time,"" he said.

Her friend and co-worker, Alex ""Sully"" Sullivan, was shot in the head, and Blache found out Saturday morning that he didn't survive. ""He was the whole reason we all went,"" Blache said from her hospital bed. Brain condition may have helped saved shooting victim . Blache served in the Air Force until four years ago, and her service included a stint in the Iraqi capital Baghdad. But at home, in a moviehouse, ""nobody was prepared"" for the violence that was unleashed, she said. ""If you're going over to a war zone, you know there's the potential that you're going to be shot at. Potential that mortars are going to come over the wall.

"(CNN) -- Yes, Americans are stressed over the economy. A new poll finds that Americans are sleeping less because of economic stress and demands of modern life. Our day seems shorter, schedules are crammed and precious sleep hours are sacrificed -- tossing, turning or working. Adding onto that is Daylight Saving Time, which begins Sunday at 2 a.m. when Americans will have to set their clocks ahead by an hour. Released this week, the National Sleep Foundation's annual poll estimated that Americans get an average of about 6.7 hours of sleep during a weekday. The annual Sleep in America poll estimated the hours of sleep have gradually decreased. Over the last decade, the poll indicates that a growing percentage of Americans is getting less than six hours of sleep and the number of people who get eight or more hours is dwindling. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. National Sleep Foundation is a nonprofit organization of researchers, patients and health care facilities. It said it does not solicit or accept funding for its annual Sleep in America polls. ""In the last few years, we've seen the economy take a nose dive, and more people are affected by that,"" said Dr. Raj Kakar, a medical director at the Dallas Center for Sleep Disorders. ""More people are stressed. Stress is associated with sleep deprivation, anxiety, depression and sleeplessness. The economy is a major factor why people are losing sleep."" The findings echo a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association, which reported last year that 52 percent of 7,000 respondents were losing sleep at night from stress. Aside from financial anxieties, in just a decade society has become more around-the clock and more complex. ""This has been more insidious over two decades,"" Kakar said. ""With the advent of the Internet, cell phone, Blackberries, we're seeing our society is increasingly 24-7.  People are able to be active at any time from anywhere, and it causes people to be more active around the clock. This increased activity is essentially giving sleep less importance."" The mean hours of sleep on a weeknight dwindled from an average of 7 hours in 2001 to 6.7 hours this year, according to the Sleep Foundation's poll. It could be that life in 2009 has more distractions, said Dr. David Schulman, the medical director of the Emory Clinic Sleep Disorders laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia. So what's taking time away from sleep? ""It's been entertainment, Internet, playing games or TV. People have all sorts of distractions they didn't have back then (in previous years),"" Schulman said. Centuries ago, people routinely slept eight to nine hours a day, he said.  But now, only about a quarter in the survey reported getting eight or more hours of sleep. Doctors warn about the effects of sleep deprivation, such as car accidents, depression, anxiety and cardiovascular problems. Doctors recommend seven to eight hours a day. Schulman likened sleep deprivation to chronic alcoholism. ""When you're chronically drunk, you can't tell when you're drunk,"" he said  ""If you're chronically sleep deprived, you can't tell when you're sleepy. You lose the ability to detect how tired you are. It's not unusual to fall asleep behind the wheel."" But there is contradicting research on how much sleep Americans are getting. John Robinson, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, challenged the notion that people are sleeping less in the 24-7 treadmill of modern life. ""There has been no decline in sleep. It's been sustained,"" he said, according to time-use surveys that date back to 1965. Robinson, a past director of the Americans' Use of Time Project, monitored time-use diaries to track how people spend their day. Since 2003, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau have gathered time-use information that has consistently reported that Americans sleep 8.6 hours a day. Dr. Neil Kavey, director of the Sleep Disorder Center at New York-Presbyterian at Columbia University Medical Center, said the statistic is difficult to believe, especially from his New York City practice. ""I can't believe that people get that much sleep in this busy world of ours,"" Kavey said.  ""I think a lot of people need 8.6 hours of sleep, but I think very few people get it."" The huge disparities in the results from the Sleep Foundation's poll and the government's time diaries could be attributed to different methodologies, experts on each side said. The Sleep Foundation's annual findings are based on a telephone survey of 1,000 people in which the participants are asked to estimate the number of hours they usually sleep. Meanwhile, the government's time use surveys ask people to detail hour-by-hour how they spent the previous day. Between 2003 and 2005, about 37,000 people were surveyed. The time use surveys may overestimate sleep, because sleeplessness such as insomnia, tossing and turning and lying awake are categorized as sleep, said Dr. Chris Drake, clinical psychologist at Henry Ford Hospital Sleep Disorders and Research Center in Detroit, Michigan. ""You may actually sleep four hours, but you're in bed for eight hours,"" said Drake, who is a board member with the National Sleep Foundation. ""They're counting that as eight hours of sleep."" Despite differences in the average hours, researchers and experts agree that stress and work rob a person of  sleep. During tough economic times, people might work longer hours to avoid the risk of running behind on their workload and the possibility of a layoff. If a person is working more, he or she borrows that time from sleep. ""That's a bad loan,"" Kavey said.  ""There's a lot of bad loans going around. Borrowing from sleep is a bad way to go."" And modern society gets some of the blame. ""Our society has valued people who brag about being able to function on very little sleep as a mark of someone who is aggressive, dynamic, successful,"" Kavey said. ""Well, forget that. Admire someone who puts focus on sleep and is not making mistakes (from sleep deprivation).""","Annual sleep poll estimates Americans get less sleep, averaging 6.7 hours a day .

"(CNN) -- It's been a big year for Chile's airline industry. In June, the country's flag carrier LAN completed its takeover of Brazil's biggest airline TAM. In recent weeks the aptly named merged group, LATAM, has welcomed the continent's first ever Dreamliner 787 to its runways. Another one is due to touchdown before the end of 2012 - and a further 30 will arrive within the next ten years. The $4.9 billion order represents one of the largest investments in LAN's history. LATAM's CEO Damien Scokin says it will make a big difference to the firm's growth strategy and hopes to get commercial flights running as soon as possible. ""The 787 is going to start flying as of two weeks from now to Buenos Aires, just to train pilots,"" he told CNN's Richard Quest. ""Once they are trained they will start flying to Los Angeles and after that initial phase of two months, there will be aircraft for Europe. They will fly Santiago, Madrid, Frankfurt."" Despite the formation of the LATAM airlines group, LAN and TAM will continue to operate as separate entities for the time being. The new Dreamliners will fly under the LAN branding, as its parent group is keen to capitalize on the weight of the individual brands in their respective regional markets. ""When you integrate companies which are as big as LAN and TAM, there are so many opportunities and so much money in terms of pursuing things. You have to have a very clear head in term of what not to do. ""We don't see right now a value to the customer in integrating the brands - we have two wonderful brands. TAM is highly valued in Brazil and abroad and LAN is a household name in Latin America. It's a wonderful problem to have."" Despite the global downturn, LATAM's main goal is growth through its existing route network domestically, regionally and internationally. Mr Scokin added: ""In the last few years our planes are filled much more on the Latin American end than on the developed markets end. We are feeling that slow down of the economy. ""But we are Latin Americans. We lived with ups and downs for years, so this is far from scary for us."" With a significant number of Dreamliners already ordered, there are obviously no plans by LATAM to take it one plane at a time. And Mr Scokin has spoken of his hopes to buy even more of the aircraft, thanks to an increased balanced sheet provided by the recent merger. ""Our financial strengths will be increased by having a larger operation,"" he said. ""We will be able to buy more of these planes in very good financial conditions, which have also been traditional advantages of these companies. ""As I said we increase our ability to fly to more places because of traffic rights, so there is a bunch of opportunities that open for us as a result of the integration."" A key decision that hasn't been made since June's merger, is which air alliance LATAM will be joining. There are two options to choose from, TAM's current deal with Star Alliance -- or, more likely, LAM's agreement with One World. Mr Scokin says he won't be pushed on giving an answer and no concrete decision has yet been made. ""We are not sure yet. For a company like LATAM, with such a leadership in the region, remaining unaligned is definitely an option,"" he added. ""We will give you a call right after we make the choice.""","South America's first Dreamliner to start flights within two months .

"(CNN) -- Nissan Motor Company announced the return of the Datsun brand after 30 years, with plans to introduce a low-cost car in several emerging markets in 2014. In a nod to the growing importance of developing markets, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn made the announcement Tuesday in Indonesia, one of three markets the new car line will debut. ""The Datsun brand has a global mission, but when you go on a global mission you start with priorities and today we said our priority are three: They are Indonesia, they are India and they are Russia,"" Ghosn said. ""That doesn't mean that we are going to be limiting it to there. This is the first step of development, which are these three markets, but absolutely not excluding other high growth markets or other emerging markets from the range of Datsun,"" he added. The Datsun brand first emerged in Japan in 1923 but was phased out in the 1980s as the company focused on mid-market buyers and its upscale Infiniti brand, launched in 1989. The new line will capitalize on the Datsun tradition of low-cost, sporty cars marketed in burgeoning economies where many young drivers are first-time buyers. The company also plans to include a ""green"" line of Datsun cars. Ghosn drew an analogy to Japan's economy when it launched the Datsun brand and today's Indonesian economy, which has grown steadily at about 6% per year. The country is the fourth most populous nation in the world with 250 million people. ""Datsun was introduced to Japan to bring reliable, afford and contemporary technology to consumers who had too few choices,"" Ghosn said at the Indonesia press conference. ""Today, this is the very situation in Indonesia. There is a growing segment of up and coming customers who have few choices. They can buy motorcycles, they can buy used vehicles or they can buy a new vehicle but one based on older technology. We will offer them an exciting new choice."" The company also announced plans to invest $400 million in Indonesia production, adding 3,300 jobs and producing 250,000 vehicles by 2014. Nissan sales outlets will increase to 150 in Indonesia by 2015, the company said. ""Datsun is part of our company heritage and will now contribute to its future,"" Ghosn said.","Nissan Motor Company announced the return of the Datsun brand after 30 years .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- An Army officer testifying at a military hearing Wednesday that he first thought the rapid rate of gunfire suggested there was more than one shooter in last November's Fort Hood massacre. Maj. Stephen Richter of the Army Medical Corps told in chilling detail that he felt the shooter stalking him and could see the red laser from the gunsight flickering in his eyes. He said the gunman then turned away from him, distracted by gunfire from the civilian police officers who had rushed to the scene. Richter, testifying via video link from South Korea, said all the shooting ceased when Maj. Nidal Hasan was brought down by police fire. Hasan is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens of others in the rampage. Richter said he called out when he saw the gunman's uniform and identification badge. ""I remember saying to the police officer, 'He is one of us,'"" Richter said. Still convinced there were other shooters, Richter said that after Hasan was felled by the police fire, he grabbed Hasan's handgun off the ground and prepared to fire it himself at any additional attackers. The gun was jammed, he said, and he burned his fingers on the barrel as he tried to clear it. The barrel was hot from firing what apparently was scores of rounds. In earlier testimony, Army Criminal Investigation Division special agent Kelly Jameson said 146 spent shell casings had been collected. Sources close the prosecution later clarified that he was referring only to those found inside the building where the shooting began. Another 68 were collected outside, for a total of 214, they said. And Army investigators said Wednesday that the gunman still had 177 rounds on him when he was shot by police. The two police officers also testified Wednesday. One of them, Maj. Mark Todd, testified that he found extra magazines and a second handgun, a revolver, after Hasan was shot four times. Todd and his fellow civilian police officer, Sgt. Kim Munley, described the gunfight outside the building where the final stand-off occurred. ""I challenged him, 'Halt, military police, drop your weapon,'"" Todd said. ""He raised his weapon and fired."" Munley, who was widely praised for her role in ending the shooting, admitted that she did not know how many times she had hit the gunman. ""I did not see him fall from my shots. No,"" Munley said. During her testimony, prosecutors showed a video automatically recorded by a camera mounted on the dashboard in her police car as she raced toward the shooting. In addition to the sound of sirens wailing and fast driving on the way to the scene, the video shows Munley dashing out of her vehicle and bystanders pointing to where the shooter was. Munley is then seen racing off camera. Moments later the tape provides clear audio of repeated gunfire. A separate police car ""dash-cam"" was introduced during Todd's testimony, but because of a technical glitch there was no audio. Neither police camera recorded the video of the final confrontation. Munley said she exchanged fire with the gunman and was injured herself. She told of the difficulty of getting off an accurate shot at the start of the confrontation because of people in the background. In the final moments, ""I realized he was closing in,"" Munley said. ""We began to exchange fire again. He was shooting and I was returning fire."" After she was wounded three times, Munley was on the ground and her police weapon ""malfunctioned,"" she testified. The gunman walked up and kicked her weapon away. He did not shoot her again and Munley said he appeared to be having problems with his own weapon. She described the man, whom she identified as Hasan, as solemn, with no expression, a description other witnesses have described in the previous days. Listening to her testimony Wednesday, Hasan gave no reaction, occasionally looking down. He wore his usual fleece watch-cap pulled low on his brow and had a blanket bunched up around his shoulders. Munley said she remains on medical leave but expects to return to work on November 1. The defense spent longer in cross-examining Munley than any of the other more than 50 witnesses heard so far in this Article 32 hearing, pointing up small differences between her testimony and what she told investigators immediately after the shootings. During the period of the final shots, Todd made repeated calls for Hasan to drop his gun. He said the gunshots seemed to echo between the buildings. ""It sounded like thousands of shots being fired,"" he said. Asked whether he knew if he hit Hasan, Todd replied, ""I see [sic] him wince a couple of times."" In the end, Hasan fell to the ground, and Todd ran up, kicked his gun away, turned him over on his stomach and searched him. That's when he found the additional gun, extra ammunition magazines and a cell phone. New testimony shows that the deadly massacre could have been much worse if Munley and Todd had not arrived when they did. Army Criminal Investigation Division officer Duane Mitchell said 177 unexpended rounds were recovered from Hasan in both 30- and 20-round magazines. He also explained that he had two gun sights to help him shoot accurately: a red laser gunsight for low-light conditions and a second green laser, which is most effective in sunlight. Mitchell showed receipts found in Hasan's car for gunsight batteries, providing a glimpse into the planning for the attack. At the end of the morning session, the defense entered objections to the introduction of autopsy reports for the 13 fatalities, saying they had been denied funding for an independent pathologist. The investigating officer, Col. James Pohl, who acts as the presiding judge in the case, said he would receive the autopsy reports only to identify the victims and their cause of death. Nine people died after being shot in the Army medical processing center and four more died after they were rushed to the base hospital. The prosecution said it planned to complete presenting its case on Thursday. The defense has been told it can take up its case November 8. A pause of at least one week in the proceedings had been planned to allow Fort Hood to mark one year since the shooting and to honor the victims and those soldiers and civilians who exhibited special heroism. An Article 32 hearing determines if there is enough evidence to proceed to a court-martial.","A witness says he saw the red laser from the gunsight flickering in his eyes .

"(CNN) -- Coaching the Mexican national team is proving to be a difficult assignment. When Mexico parted company with Victor Manuel Vucetich and replaced him with Miguel Herrera on Friday, it marked the third time in a month El Tri changed their football manager. Vucetich didn't have much time to mold the side, as he was only brought in when interim boss Luis Fernando Tena got the boot. Tena himself inherited the position after Jose Manuel de la Torre received his marching orders earlier in September. Vucetich won his first game 2-1 against Panama, needing a late goal to earn all three points, but lost his second 2-1 at Costa Rica. Mexico, a proud footballing nation that has appeared in the last five World Cups, won men's Olympic gold in 2012 by topping Neymar's Brazil and captured the under-17 World Cup in 2011, only scraped into a World Cup playoff when fiercest rival the U.S. scored two goals in injury time to beat the Panamanians 3-2 on the road. Had Panama hung on for the victory, it, not Mexico, would have faced New Zealand next month in the two-leg shootout to reach Brazil. Vucetich, who has 25 years of coaching experience, likely didn't help his cause ahead of the game against Costa Rica when he labeled his team ""arrogant."" ""In our game, sometimes we exaggerate, we become arrogant,"" he told reporters. ""I think this is the moment that we should reflect and show, above all, on the pitch that we need to win."" Vucetich revealed Thursday that he had been axed, with Mexico's football federation officially announcing the coaching shuffle Friday. Mexico's struggles in qualifying came as the U.S. topped the group, Costa Rica finished second and Honduras claimed the third and final automatic World Cup spot. While Mexico reached the second round in South Africa three years ago, Honduras was last in its group and Costa Rica didn't qualify for the tournament. On paper Herrera, a former defender for the national team, should lead Mexico to Brazil since New Zealand is ranked 79th by FIFA and Mexico stands 24th but the recent disarray won't hurt the Kiwis' chances of playing at a second straight World Cup. Herrera guided Club America to the Mexican Clausura title in May. Vucetich not the only manager to go . Vucetich hasn't been the only manager to lose his job despite his team making the playoffs -- Croatia fired former national team defender Igor Stimac after a 2-1 loss at Scotland. He was replaced by Niko Kovac, the former hard-nosed captain of Croatia. Australia sacked Holger Osieck following back-to-back 6-0 defeats against Brazil and France despite the Socceroos being one of the first nations to book a spot in Brazil.","Mexico fires manager Victor Manuel Vucetich after only two games in charge .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a dramatic slap at congressional authority, a divided Supreme Court has struck down a key part of a law that denies to legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses. The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as only between a man and a woman. The vote Wednesday was 5-4. ""Although Congress has great authority to design laws to fit its own conception of sound national policy, it cannot deny the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. He was supported by four more liberal colleagues: Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Read the ruling . The case examined whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry. At issue was whether DOMA violates equal protection guarantees in the Fifth Amendment's due process clause as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their states. The key plaintiff is Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, 84, who married fellow New York resident Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007, about 40 years into their relationship. By the time Spyer died in 2009, New York courts recognized same-sex marriages performed in other countries. But the federal government didn't recognize Windsor's same-sex marriage, and she was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than those that other married couples would have to pay. So, Windsor sued the federal government. A federal appeals court last year ruled in Windsor's favor, saying DOMA violated the Constitution's equal protection clause. ""Today's DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for #MarriageEquality. #LoveIsLove,"" President Barack Obama's official Twitter account posted soon after the decision was handed down. Kennedy, in his opinion, used sweeping language to affirm the rights of gays and lesbians. ""For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the state (of New York) acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status. This status is a far-reaching legal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship between two people, a relationship deemed by the state worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages,"" he said. ""DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect."" But Kennedy -- a moderate-conservative who proved once again to be the ""swing,"" or deciding, vote -- made clear the ruling is limited: ""This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages."" Thirty-five states have laws banning same-sex marriage. Key quotes from the ruling . Under DOMA, Social Security, pension and bankruptcy benefits, along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions, did not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions. In a thunderous dissent, read from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia slammed the majority for its ""exalted conception of the role of this institution"" -- the Supreme Court -- ""in America."" ""Few public controversies touch an institution so central to the lives of so many, and few inspire such attendant passion by good people on both sides,"" he said. ""Few public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly the beauty of what our (Constitution) framers gave us, a gift the court pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight: a system of government that permits us to rule ourselves."" Scalia added, ""Some will rejoice in today's decision, and some will despair at it; that is the nature of a controversy that matters so much to so many. But the court has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat. We owed both of them better. I dissent."" Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito also dissented. Windsor was in New York when the ruling came down. She told reporters that she was overjoyed. ""We won everything we asked and hoped for. Wow,"" she said. ""I'm honored and humbled and overjoyed to be here today to represent not only the thousands of Americans whose lives have been adversely impacted by the Defense of Marriage Act, but those whose hopes and dreams have been constricted by the same discriminatory law."" Marrying for the benefits . Windsor thanked the supporters who cheered her on throughout the case. ""Because of today's Supreme Court ruling, the federal government can no longer discriminate against the marriages of gay and lesbian Americans. Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA, and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as Thea and I did, but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else,"" Windsor said. ""If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it. And she would be so pleased."" The Defense of Marriage law was defended in the high court by House Republicans, after Obama concluded the law was unconstitutional. Traditionally, that role would fall to the solicitor general's office. But president ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA in court. That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law. By striking down the DOMA provision, the court decided the standing question was not at play in this case, and it had jurisdiction to decide the larger questions. A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA. That law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize such marriages performed in other states. Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans and other benefits. After historic rulings, what's next? The case is U.S. v. Windsor (12-307).","NEW: Edith Windsor, who sued the federal government, says she is overjoyed by the ruling .

"(CNN) -- It's not only global tycoons and car manufacturers that are greasing the wheels of Formula One -- countries are doing it too. Traditionally governments have invested in F1 by stumping up cash to stage races but now they are cutting deals with drivers and teams. The Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA funds Pastor Maldonado's drive for Williams. This summer Sauber announced a partnership deal involving three backers with close links to the Russian state that will see the Swiss team fast track teenager Sergey Sirotkin into a race seat in time for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix in 2014. ""It's a huge responsibility that I have,"" Maldonado, who had the personal approval of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, told CNN. ""I have a complete country pushing in my back so every day we do not do very well, I have some pressure."" But why do countries want to invest in the fickle world of F1 in the first place, where there is no tangible return on their investment? McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh explained to CNN: ""Last year Formula 1 was watched by over half a billion people. ""There are only two world sports -- football and F1. It's natural that as F1 expands the calendar and goes into new markets [people] want to be involved and invest in the sport."" Global markets . Christian Sylt, co author of Formula Money, an annual report examining all aspects of the sport's finances, believes countries now have a role to play in filling the gap left by F1's traditional investors. ""The departure of the car manufacturers left a big hole in the budgets of many teams,"" said Sylt. ""In 2008 and 2009, F1 lost Honda, BMW and Toyota while Renault also slashed its spending. This meant that, according to Formula Money's data, team owner spending plummeted from $1.6 billion in 2008 to $611 million in 2010, despite the addition of two new teams. ""In turn, teams have had to look for new sources of funding to maintain their budgets."" F1's peripatetic players visit five continents and 19 countries in 2013 -- and in 2014 there are additional races scheduled in Russia, Austria, the United States and Mexico. Part of the sport's appeal is that it immediately gives its backers structured access to nearly 20 global markets. ""If a government thinks that it can increase trade and tourism by presenting an image of itself as a technologically savvy, glamorous destination and a center of sporting excellence, then F1 is a good way to achieve this,"" Sylt continued. ""F1's values of technology and glamor are often something that developing countries want to align themselves with. ""It's not so common in F1 at the moment, but this is already a big source of funding in its feeder series GP2. Huge responsibility . ""In the last couple of years logos for countries including Venezuela, Monaco, Romania, Angola, Russia and Colombia have all appeared on the cars and Venezuela even title sponsors the Lazarus team. ""As these drivers move into F1, they will bring their sponsors with them and we'll see more and more countries getting involved as F1 sponsors."" Sponsoring a driver or team is also a powerful marketing tool. As well as the traditional logos prominently painted on the car's livery, Venezuela now gets a mention every time Maldonado is strapped into a car. But how do the drivers cope with these unique patriotic pressures of essentially being an ambassador in a racesuit? ""I have more than many responsibilities,"" Maldonado explained with a half smile. ""I am the only one in Venezuela who has Formula 1 on his back. It's quite hard for me to keep everyone happy."" Like most F1 racers, the 28-year-old Williams driver progressed from karting through the junior ranks before winning the GP2 title in 2010. But there is no doubt that the final step into an F1 race seat was sweetened by sponsorship from PDVSA to the tune of a reported $45m a year. ""PDVSA and the sponsors I had in the past, and that I still have, believe in my talent,"" said Maldonado, who is still aware that he has to sing for his supper. ""I was the first racing driver who was racing with the colors of PDVSA, the main oil company of the country. ""In Venezuela we don't like to lose, we always approach to win."" Maldonado was not the first F1 pilot from Venezuela -- that honor went to Italian born Ettore Chimeri in 1959 -- but he became the first Venezuelan to win a grand prix in Spain during the 2012 season. ""You know, F1 after my victory last year became a very popular sport,"" Maldonado explained. ""We have two live TV channels so it's getting bigger and bigger -- which is why I have even more responsibility."" Presidential problem solver . This season has raised Maldonado's stress levels even further. The Williams car has lagged behind its midfield rivals and Maldonado finally won the team's first point of the season in Hungary -- the 10th race of the year. The portents on the eve of the season had not been good. The team held a celebratory preseason lunch on 5 March but later that evening Venezuelan President Chavez died following a long battle with cancer. The death of Chavez, a self-styled"" 21st Century socialist,"" left Venezuela in a state of flux and it arguably deprived Maldonado of his biggest supporter. When asked how much the late president had personally helped his career, Maldonado answered: ""A lot. ""It was not only my career it was the career of many racing drivers, Rodolfo Gonzalez (GP2), E.J. Viso, who is in IndyCar; many, many racing drivers."" Maldonado twice appeared on Chavez's chat show Alo Presidente but said he did not speak to the late president on a regular basis, though he added: ""He was very close to the drivers."" There have been divisive opinions on Chavez's legacy. Commentators say he did a lot of work to lift people out of poverty in Venezuela but that his autocratic style of governance damaged the nation's democracy and left the country with daunting economic challenges. But Maldonado says the charismatic Chavez, the man who helped shape his career, is greatly missed. ""We miss him,"" said Maldonado who grew up in the city of Maracay. ""Everyone misses people like that who were important for the country, the position he took, what he did for the poor. ""He connected with the people and at the same time he was listening to the problems they had, analyzing everything with his team, his ministers and directors, they were trying to solve all of the problems of the people."" Being backed by the state has intrinsically linked Maldonado to Venezuela in so many ways. He is indebted to PDVSA for his position in F1 and in turn he feels he is an ambassador for Venezuela, his compatriots and the legacy of President Chavez. When countries decide to directly invest in F1's drivers, the responsibility lies heavily on the racer's shoulders. Does Maldonado expect Sirotkin, the driver Russian investors plan to push into a Sauber seat, to feel the same kind of pressure? ""It depends,"" Maldonado explains. ""I don't know very well the Russian guys. I know the Venezuelan guys - for sure there is a lot of pressure!"" Slums of Venezuela . PDVSA's sponsorship deal with Williams is due to expire in 2015. It is understood that the terms of the agreement stipulate a Venezuelan driver must race for the former world champion constructors, and not necessarily Maldonado. CNN contacted PDVSA but they declined to comment. Even if Maldonado finds himself without an F1 drive in the future he is already determined to pay back part of his debt he believes he owes to his country through the Pastor Maldonado Foundation, a charitable organization that he set up in 2005. ""We want to find a new driver from the very poor slums of Venezuela and give him the opportunity to become a race driver in the future in F1,"" Maldonado, who was encouraged into motorsport by his father and uncle, explained. ""We are focused on finding someone who is not even close to motor racing. At the moment we are staging a small go kart championship and then we will select two or three racers and then put them in Europe with good teams, all paid for by the foundation. ""We also help some with education, some who have lost their homes in tragedies and other sports. ""But now we are planning to find the second or third Venezuelan driver for a Formula 1 drive."" Maldonado is using his foundation to repay what Venezuela has given to him -- and, even better, he hopes it will also find a successor to drive forward the expectations of a nation.","Formula One is attracting state funding form nations such as Venezuela and Russia .

"(CNN) -- Islamist militants took almost full control of Mogadishu on Thursday, less than 24 hours after Ethiopian troops withdrew from Somalia's capital, a witness reported. Ethipian troops invaded Somalia in 2006. The Ethiopian forces pulled out their last remaining bases in the city late Wednesday after two years propping up Somalia's transitional government. Forces from different Islamist groups -- including the hard-line al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- immediately seized  every base the Ethiopians abandoned. ""The city is almost under Islamist rule,"" said a local journalist who did not want his name revealed. ""You can hear different names of the Islamist groups taking control in many parts of the city."" The journalist said the militants were in ""full force"" in most of Mogadishu. However, they had yet to claim control of the city's seaport, the presidential palace and a major junction on the south side. Ethiopia invaded Somalia in December 2006 to install a U.N.-backed transitional government in Mogadishu after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The invasion had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union that captured Mogadishu earlier that year of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. The Islamists responded with a guerrilla campaign against government and Ethiopian troops. Efforts to replace the Ethiopians with an African Union-led peacekeeping mission faltered as the violence worsened, and heavy fighting in Mogadishu and other cities drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. The lawlessness also spilled onto the seas off the Horn of Africa, where international vessels are routinely hijacked by suspected Somali pirates who demand large ransoms. And the transitional government was wracked by a power struggle between Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and President Abdullahi Yusuf, who resigned in December. Hussein said Thursday that he would run for president now that Ethiopian troops had gone. Ahmed attempted to fire Hussein for being ineffective. But Hussein said the president did not have that power, and the vast majority of members of parliament backed Hussein in a vote of confidence.","U.S.-designated terror group among militants seizing control of Mogadishu .

"(CNN) -- Practically from the day the Space Age started on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union launched the first human-made satellite into Earth orbit, it's been like this. Every time there's a conspicuous breakthrough in space, somebody, somewhere will find a way to kill the buzz. After Philae's touchdown on the comet Wednesday, this hashtag #WeCanLandOnACometButWeCant (as in #WeCanLandOnACometButWeCant find a missing plane on our own planet) started trending in the Twitterverse. Ah, yes. And Americans are especially good at this grousing. People have been shouting ""Oh, wow!"" and then ""Oh no!"" since the 1950s. Americans on the one hand were alarmed that their Cold War nemesis had rockets big enough to hurl heavy metal projectiles at us and on the other were camping outside at night to see the little beeping ball fly over their backyards. Americans' consensus love-hate for space exploration has assumed many forms over the years. Once the nation got over its collective shock-and-awe of Sputnik, its citizenry demanded that its scientists and politicians figure out a way to get our own projectiles up there ASAP. We did it, with some notable disasters on the way, at which time the moaning over whether we should spend so much taxpayer money on such risky endeavors would begin. We were taken back to those dismal days in recent weeks when a rocket launched by the privately owned (but government contracted) Orbital Sciences Corp. with cargo for the International Space Station exploded in midair shortly after lifting off from Wallops Island, Virginia. Three days later, SpaceShipTwo, built by Virgin Galactic (private, not taxpayer, dollars in this case) as a working prototype for a passenger spacecraft, broke up during a flight test over California's Mojave Desert and crashed, killing its co-pilot and seriously injuring its pilot. Both these catastrophes were too reminiscent of the serial test failures of the 1950s in which rockets regularly blew up before reaching the stratosphere and test pilots seeking faster, higher records in the same Mojave skies lost their planes and their lives. It was through such trial and error that, eventually, America got proficient enough to send satellites and people into space and succeed much more often than it didn't. And we fell in love. The romance of space flight became part of our national identity, especially after we started sending humans of our own. As we exceeded our planetary boundaries by sending probes, and then men to the moon, other boundaries seemed less daunting and forbidding. And yet, with many cheering and goading the country to fly higher, farther and faster, there were just as many Americans wondering if too many of our resources were being squandered for what was mostly a speculative endeavor. My own cheerleading for space travel was often countered with some spoilsport, honest and sincere, complaining that all that money being shot into the skies could be put to better use on Earth: e.g. Why do we need to go to Mars when we have all these problems on Earth to solve? For a long time, I had no strong counterargument. But now, with the space shuttle program literally mounted in museums and no government plans to return to the moon or head for Mars any time soon, I find myself asking how that solving-problems-on-Earth thing is going now. I'm still waiting for a sensible answer, but I don't think one exists. The urge to explore and push ourselves out into the universe is not mutually exclusive from the effort to improve our own minds and environment. Consider: Last year, 7 million people visited the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, beating out New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art by roughly a million. Many of them look at vintage spacecraft and archival mockups and openly wonder where our yearning for adventure has gone since the turn of this century. Even the movies bring this up. ""We used to be explorers and pioneers,"" says a character in the just-released science fiction spectacular, ""Interstellar."" ""Now we're a generation of caretakers."" Christopher Nolan's film conceives a potential future in which what's left of NASA has gone underground to figure out options for humankind literally choking to death on ecological decay on Earth. In this future, it seems as though the moon-landing-denial constituency has gained such a foothold in the public schools that a student can get in trouble for suggesting we did in fact land on the moon. Can't we all just be happy that human beings can do what the European Space Agency did this week? Probably not. I'm just waiting for some troll to claim that it isn't a real breakthrough unless Americans do it first.","Gene Seymour: Philae landing amazing, but people still grouse about whether expense worth it .

"(CNN) -- When rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings didn't work for Eddie Freas, he sought another way to kick his 20-year drug and alcohol addiction. Eddie Freas fights drug addiction by putting all his energy into training for triathlons. He swam 2.4 miles. He biked 112 miles. He ran 26.2 miles. The Pennsville, New Jersey, resident found relief in triathlons. ""I feel better when I'm working out,"" said Freas, 33. ""It does wonders for the mind. The reason I started running -- it was a switch that went off in my head. I started feeling positive and feeling great about myself."" Freas spent his youth in pursuit of drugs. At the age of 13, he snuck bottles of Amaretto and rum from his mother's liquor cabinet. He also developed a taste for marijuana and cocaine. By his senior year of high school, Freas was kicked off the wrestling and football teams after failing a drug test. Then in 2007, after a three-day binge, ""I came home and was crying,"" Freas said. ""I was so depressed. I turned on the TV."" The set was tuned to ESPN, which was airing a story about a former drug addict who competed in triathlons. The program's subject was Todd Crandell, who had lost a college hockey scholarship because of a drug addiction. After 13 years of using drugs, Crandell started competing in Ironman races and championed finding positive ways to fight addiction through his program called Racing for Recovery. ""Having an athletic background, I was drawn to getting back in shape,"" Crandell said. ""It makes you turn intellectually and spiritually fit. Exercise is essential. It decreases addiction, depression and you use it as part of the recovery."" Freas was entranced by the parallels. ""His whole story seemed like mine,"" Freas said. ""That's why it hit me so much. It was my story but it happened to somebody else. I knew I had to get back into fitness."" He took a bus to Racing for Recovery's office in Sylvania, Ohio. There, Freas said he learned to ""stay clean and use other things -- fitness, instead of drugs."" On his first day, Freas pushed himself to run 10 miles. ""It killed me,"" Freas said. ""I was just motivated. I was sore for a week and I gradually got into it. As soon as I started including fitness into my everyday lifestyle, it made it so much easier. It kept me busy and because of the physical fitness, it was making me feel better about myself."" He pushed himself to run farther and raced in his first Ironman competition in 2008. ""It's different when you use drugs, you temporarily feel good and afterwards, you feel like doing more drugs,"" Freas said. ""When you go for a long run and do physical fitness, you feel good doing it."" Research in animals and humans show that exercise can be a mild antidepressant. ""It isn't a huge surprise when you consider many positive effects exercise can have with regards to the brain chemistry: dopamine, serotonin, endorphin, epinephrine -- these are all associated with mood altering effects,"" said Dr. Cedric Bryant, the chief science officer for the American Council on Exercise. ""If they're able to get this natural high, through a natural endeavor such as exercise, it allows them to replace the means to achieve that high with a more positive approach."" One study showed that women trying to quit smoking were more successful when they exercised. And the National Institute on Drug Abuse held a conference last year to explore the possible role of physical activity in substance abuse prevention. ""The thought centers around the release of mood-altering brain chemical, mainly endorphins,"" Bryant said. ""It gives you euphoria or what you call 'runner's high.' "" Crandell said some people who battle drug addiction ""want something more than sitting in support groups filled with smoke, complaining about drinking."" ""I've had some of my naysayers from other programs who say you've taken one addiction and replaced it for another,"" Crandell said. ""I've taken addiction and put into a new focus that includes exercise. Exercise for me is essential to my recovery and well-being."" The purpose of Racing for Recovery is not to turn everyone into an athlete, but to focus on positive pursuits in a person's life. ""Whatever you lost during your addiction, that should be your Ironman, not just running,"" Crandell said. ""If your goal is to become a teacher, let that be your Ironman."" After Freas spent six months in Ohio, he returned to his hometown. ""I didn't want to come back home, because this was where I did all the dirt, all the partying and stuff,"" Freas said. ""As time went on, I had to come back here. My life is turned around. I got to help people in my hometown."" Back in New Jersey, Freas helped train Dustin Deckard, 19, a former high school star wrestler, who is recovering from a four-year heroin addiction. Deckard wanted to get clean after a near-fatal overdose. ""I have to be clean the rest of my life,"" Deckard said. ""Sometimes that overwhelms me. I just feel that sometimes it's not fair that other people can go out and have fun and drink and do whatever at a party. But me -- if I do anything -- it's off. I can't stop. I definitely have troubles with that."" Freas and Deckard have developed a brotherhood. ""I know how he was feeling, being down, not wanting to use drugs,"" Deckard said. ""I just relate to him in every way. We both used. He's also into sports and into wrestling like I was. That's what's cool."" This Sunday, Freas and Deckard head to Racing for Recovery's half triathlon at Monroe, Michigan where the teen will race for the first time.","New Jersey man finds solace in exercise after spending youth on drugs .

"(CNN) -- How much has the South changed? That's the question at the heart of one of the most important cases the Supreme Court will take up this year. The case weighs the fate of one of the most important laws in American history: the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A century after the Civil War, Congress created that law to give African Americans the right to vote, not just on paper, but in fact. The key provision was Section 5, which decreed that jurisdictions with histories of discrimination, mostly in the South, had to get Justice Department approval before they changed any aspect of their voting rules, right down to the location of polling places. There is little doubt that, in the years immediately after 1965, the Voting Rights Act achieved a revolution in voting rights for African-Americans in the South. In subsequent years, Congress has reauthorized the law several times, most recently in 2006. Increasingly, covered jurisdictions have found the process of submitting their changes to the Justice Department, which is known as ""pre-clearance,"" as a demeaning anachronism, and Shelby County, Alabama, went to court to argue that the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional. The court will hear the case, Shelby County v. Holder, early next year. The Obama administration strongly supports the act, but the president's election -- and re-election -- may be among the best arguments against the law. There is little doubt that African-Americans suffered pervasive discrimination in the 1960s, especially at the polls. But now we have a black president. Doesn't that prove that African-Americans have reached at least rough equality in the electoral realm? Not necessarily. When reauthorizing the law, Congress compiled a record of thousands of pages documenting the legacy of discrimination that lingers in the covered jurisdictions. The government asserts that the justices should defer to Congress in deciding whether the problem of voting rights is solved. Still, the Obama administration has to deal with a very important likely adversary in this case: Chief Justice John Roberts. The court heard a similar challenge to the Voting Rights Act in 2009, and the court sidestepped the core issue, resolving the case on procedural grounds. But there was little doubt, in Roberts' questions at oral argument or in his opinion, that he believes, constitutionally speaking, times have changed. The chief is unlikely to look for a procedural way out of controversy for a second time. The controversy over voter suppression in the 2012 elections might have a paradoxical effect on the future of the law. Democrats argued that the efforts to impose Voter ID requirements and the like amounted to discrimination against African-Americans and thus could be seen as justification for preserving the Voting Rights Act. But several of the acts of alleged voter suppression took place in states -- like Pennsylvania and Ohio -- that are not covered by Section 5 of the act. That may help the plaintiff's core argument: Times have changed in the South. In any event, it's likely to be a close vote. What happens if the law is overturned? The answer may be: not much. The South may not need the act anymore to protect the voting rights of minorities. If that's true, that would prove the plaintiffs' main argument in this case. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Toobin.","Jeffrey Toobin: 1965 Voting Rights Act secured voting rights for blacks in the South .

"(CNN) -- Sweden's chase for what is widely suspected to be a submerged Russian submarine operating within its territorial waters can't help but remind older Swedes of the fact that, during the Cold War, Swedish waters were thought to be regularly covertly probed by submarines belonging to the Soviet Union. Indeed, back in 1981, the ""Whiskey on the Rocks"" incident saw a Soviet attack submarine carrying nuclear-tipped torpedoes run aground on the shoals not far from the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. Fast forward more than three decades, and Vladimir Putin's Russia is by no means the threat -- materially or ideologically -- that the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. But the fact that the Russian leader has made it clear that he does not accept the advance of democratic regimes onto Russia's doorstep -- whether they be tied either to the European Union or NATO -- is bound to mean that this latest incident will have echoes of times past for many Swedes. And Putin has been willing to match words with action. With a plan under way to modernize Russia's military over the next decade, Moscow has increasingly been willing to flex its armed muscle not only in Ukraine, but against other neighbors as well. In the case of Sweden, this has included Russian simulated air attacks against Stockholm, the buzzing of Swedish ships and planes by Russian aircraft and, as recent as this September, the alleged violation of Swedish airspace by two Russian Su-24s, a supersonic attack aircraft. Putin's jabs at Sweden are undoubtedly also tied to the fact that the government of Sweden has, in reaction to Putin's revanchist policies, increased its operational ties to NATO and neighboring NATO states even while remaining formally outside the alliance. In fact, the submarine chase that is now occurring comes on the heels of Sweden's participation in a Baltic Sea military exercise that included vessels and aircraft from Denmark, Poland and the Netherlands. Such cooperation is needed precisely because Sweden has, like the rest of Europe, spent much of the post-Cold War era cutting its defense budget and the size of its armed forces. For example, Sweden's navy today has fewer than 10 surface combatants, no operational anti-submarine warfare helicopters and only five submarines. It was only two years ago that Sweden's top military officer admitted that his forces could only defend a small segment of the country for about a week without outside help. All this suggests that the hard reality is that Sweden is in Moscow's sights -- and not just because Stockholm leans toward the West in its policies. The region's geography means that any conflict in the Baltic region would almost certainly involve Sweden. Kaliningrad, Russia's major military enclave on the Baltic Sea, is hemmed in by Poland and Lithuania on its borders and Sweden by the sea, and control of the latter's airspace and seas could be decisive if a major conflict should occur. In mid-September, Swedes went to the polls and rejected a third term for the center-right coalition that had governed Sweden since 2006. The new government is an alliance of left-leaning parties led by the Social Democratic Party and has pledged to increase defense spending. No doubt, news of a possible Russian sub trolling in Swedish waters will bolster public support for the government's decision to up Swedish military capabilities. The question Stockholm will face is whether the planned increase -- less than $1 billion over 10 years -- will be sufficient to make up for the two decades of decline and adequate to deal with Russian plans to expand its military strength. For decades, the Swedish government has avoided taking explicit sides between Brussels and Moscow. But the Swedes will find sitting on the fence to be increasingly uncomfortable when Putin is your next-door neighbor.","Vladimir Putin's Russia is by no means the threat the Soviet Union was during the Cold War .

"(CNN) -- When most people think of chocolate, Swiss confectionery houses and Belgian pralines spring to mind. It's a picturesque scene. It's also not the truth. That chocolate bar you're usually unwrapping from its delicate silver foil probably comes from Africa. In reality, 68% of cocoa grown in the world is from small-family farms in Africa, with a third of the global supply hailing from a single cocoa production powerhouse in the continent: the Ivory Coast. Yet, hundreds of miles away from Ivory Coast's fertile lands in West Africa, childhood friends Stephen Sembuya and Felix Okuye are hoping to one day become the continent's next cocoa kings -- while helping to put their country on the global chocolate map. ""We are branding our chocolate 'Uganda,'"" says Felix Okuye, co-founder of Pink Food Industries, a food startup in Kampala. ""Uganda is not popularly known as a cocoa-producing country,"" he continues. ""As we brand our chocolate, the world out there will know that there is cocoa and chocolate coming from Uganda."" The duo's entrepreneurial journey started after Sembuya inherited his family cocoa plantation. But instead of following the usual path of producing cocoa to be exported to EU countries, the two friends decided to start manufacturing cocoa products themselves. Last May, their startup began selling a variety of locally-made treats, including milk chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa butter and white chocolate. ""We took it upon ourselves to teach ourselves,"" says Okuye. ""So with the savings we had we began with the minimum, and as such we also developed artisan equipment, to process our products."" 'Small player' The two Ugandan entrepreneurs might be working to ensure people know where their treat is coming from, but their country is still far from being considered a leading cocoa power player -- unlike countries like the Ivory Coast and Ghana. The Ivory Coast's lion's share is increasing year-on-year with cocoa bean production in the country expected to reach an estimated 1.730 million tons for the 2013/2014 cocoa season, compared to 1.449 million tons recorded for the previous period. In comparison, last year Uganda produced an estimated 20,000 tons of cocoa, according to data from the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Ghana's cocoa crop forecast has also increased to 920,000 tons for the 2013/2014 period ending in September, up from 835,000 tons, in part due to favorable weather conditions. Meanwhile other countries on the continent including Cameroon, Nigeria and Togo grow thousands of tons of beans per year. Despite the strong hold many West African nations have on the continent's cocoa bean growth, all is not lost for Ugandan producers. ""We're not talking about the same scale at all but I would say that Uganda is a smaller but significant producer at 20,000 tons,"" says Michael Segal, information and media officer at the ICCO. ""In terms of volume, they have a long way to go -- having said that, there has been a lot of activity there recently."" Segal continues: ""There seems to be a lot of impetus behind developing the cocoa market and they have good experience already from having developed the coffee market. If they really got behind it, there is room in the market for them."" And it does seem like the Ugandan government has thrown its weight behind local cocoa growers, having established the Cocoa Development Board to oversee the industry from under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries. John Muwanga Musisi, a coordinator from the ministry's Cocoa Seedling Project says there is currently an estimated total of 9,000 small cocoa producers in the country, ""with well over 25,000 hectares planted with cocoa at various stages of maturity and production."" He continues: ""It is predicted that with the level of planting taking place today, [the] land area planted with cocoa will increase to over 50,000 hectares within the next five years, which will produce well over 50,000 metric tons, to earn Uganda over $125 million."" Big dreams . In global terms, chocolate consumption across Africa is fairly uncommon, apart from South Africa and a few markets in North Africa. Yet, in recent years, the ICCO have tracked some growth in the gross import of chocolate and associated products to Uganda. ""Most of sub-saharan Africa have negligible consumption,"" explains Segal. ""The fact that we are tracking some sort chocolate import [into Uganda] is an indication the local market is becoming more sophisticated."" Meanwhile back at the Pink Food Industries plantation, the founders are working to generate local buzz around the brand. Having launched just six months ago, Sembuya says they've already had a lot of interest from Kamapla-based buyers. He adds, however, that they aren't going to pigeonhole themselves as just a chocolate startup. ""I'm using the social media because everyone seems to be going on social media all day,"" he says. ""I'm selling a lot here in Kampala which is why I'm getting lots of the market. I'm selling to fewer people but [in] huge quantities. But we already have assembled a line to produce biscuits, candy and corn flakes too."" At the moment, the two enthusiastic entrepreneurs are limiting their sales to the capital but hope to branch out across the country soon. Okuye says: ""We believe that now we have a product out of our very own cocoa in our farm, we now have the confidence to promote cocoa growing in Uganda.""

"(CNN) -- Last month, the Yemen-based branch of Ayman al-Zawahiri's international terrorist network, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), released a worrying statement  calling on Muslims around the world to forget their differences and renew their efforts to carry out operations against American targets, be they civilian, governmental, military or diplomatic. But this was by no means the most troubling aspect of the communique. More important than the threat -- which, let's face it, is nothing new -- was the fact that this was the second statement from AQAP in recent months to go against al-Zawahiri's official policy towards ISIS and express its wholehearted support for the group's actions in Syria. The mere fact that AQAP has released another call for unity among Syria's jihadist factions is worth ruminating on for a number of reasons. It is indicative of the fact that the al Qaeda network is even more decentralized -- fragmented, even -- than first meets the eye. After all, AQAP was expressing its support for a group that had not only long rejected the authority of al-Zawahiri, its nominal leader, but is also engaged in the most bitter of hostilities with another al-Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra (JN). Making overtures to a group responsible for the death of thousands fighting for your closest ally in Syria is as significant as it is surprising. In releasing this statement, being outspokenly supportive of ISIS for the second time in just over a month, AQAP was sticking its neck on the line. However, its hubris paid off and the fact that we have, once again, heard nothing from al-Zawahiri compounds suspicions of his feeling blindsided and disempowered by the rise of ISIS. This latest message indicates just how much the global jihadist dynamic has shifted since the anti-ISIS coalition airstrikes began in August. Clearly, ISIS and al Qaeda are no longer as irreconcilable as many might have imagined back when the self-declared ""caliphate"" was inaugurated in June. This phenomenon, something dealt with at length in Quilliam's latest report on ISIS, does not bode well. Indeed, were ISIS and al Qaeda to cooperate in the pursuit of their often identical goal, the threat would be profoundly more difficult to resolve. Certainly, there is a long way to go before this could happen, but that does not mean its slowly increasing likelihood should be ignored. And it is not only al Qaeda affiliates that have made overtures to Syria's warring jihadists. In September, for example, jihadist powerhouse Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi spearheaded a ""global initiative"" to stop infighting in Syria and focus on the ""real"" enemy, in light of the ""Crusader campaign"". This was a significant about turn for a man who had, in the past, referred to ""IS"" in the most pejorative of terms. Statements of support are very different to pledges of allegiance but, whatever the case, a trend towards reconciliation does seem to be emerging. Among jihadists, ISIS is no longer the pariah it once was and, whether we like it or not, this is a direct result of coalition planes dropping coalition bombs on jihadists in Syria. This is unsurprising. As many predicted back in June, intervention against ISIS has been effortlessly worked into the ""War on Islam"" paradigm, that great legitimizer of Islamist-motivated violence. In a reimagining of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" we are seeing jihadists rallying around the flag of anti-Westernism. This trend may be slow, but the fact that it is happening at all is deeply alarming. Moving forward, it is imperative that the West -- the United States in particular -- rolls back its military involvement in Iraq and Syria and ups the ante in terms of its humanitarian and diplomatic efforts; the coalition must stop playing into the ""Crusader"" paradigm. This means that -- and I've said this before -- regional, Sunni-majority countries must take the crisis into their own hands, force an end to the Assad regime's crimes and bring profound change to Iraq's political status quo. Without that, jihadists across the world will continue on the path toward rapprochement, something that must be stopped immediately.","AQAP last month called on Muslims to forget differences focus on American targets .

"(CNN) -- Depending on who you ask, Crimea's decision to secede from Ukraine was either an unconstitutional split manipulated by Russia or a move consistent with international law upholding the region's right to govern itself. The United States and its European allies say Sunday's referendum vote violated Ukraine's newly reforged constitution and amounts to a thinly veiled attempt by Russia to expand its borders to the Black Sea peninsula under a threat of force. Moscow asserts Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in an illegal coup, which ended Ukraine's constitutional authority. Russian President Vladimir Putin argues Crimeans should have the right to decide how they want to be governed going forward. So who's right? ""The answer depends on what your perspective is,"" said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. ""The U.S. is buying into the argument of the Ukraine government, which is that the secession of Crimea from Ukraine is not constitutional under the terms of the Ukrainian constitution,"" Rothkopf said. ""The alternative argument is that all peoples have a right of self-determination and that if the people of Crimea choose not to be part of Ukraine, that is their prerogative in the same way that it was the choice of colonial powers to break away from the imperial powers that claimed them or parts of the former Yugoslavia were free to head off on their own,"" he added. Ukraine 'will never accept' Crimea annexation, President says . The standoff between the United States and Russia resembles tension from the Cold War era. ""We'll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world,"" President Barack Obama said on Monday. ""The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity; and continued Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy,"" Obama said. The United States and Europe imposed travel bans and froze assets of senior Russian and Crimean officials. The Obama administration went a step further by banning entry and freezing all U.S. assets held by any Russian government official or people with close financial ties to 11 people, including advisers to Putin. Legal or not, Crimean referendum will shape Ukraine crisis . Separate from the vote, Crimean lawmakers approved a resolution on Monday that declared the Black Sea peninsula an independent, sovereign state and requested to join the Russian Federation. Putin later in the day signed a decree that recognized Crimea's independence, the Kremlin said. He will address a joint session of Parliament on Crimea on Tuesday. Putin spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently by phone and stressed the Crimean referendum was in accordance with international law, including Article 1 of the U.N. Charter regarding the principle of self-determination. ""It was emphasized that Russia will respect the choice of the Crimean people,"" according to a Kremlin statement summarizing that conversation. Obama told Putin during a phone call on Sunday that ""Russia's actions were in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" according to the White House. Putin pushed back, according to a statement from the Kremlin, and said the situation in Crimea is akin to Kosovo's breakaway from Serbia in 2008. ""Regarding the March 16 referendum in Crimea, Mr Putin said that the decision to hold the referendum was in line with international law and the U.N. Charter, and was also in line with the precedent set by Kosovo,"" the Kremlin said. ""The referendum was organized in such a way as to guarantee Crimea's population the possibility to freely express their will and exercise their right to self-determination,"" it said. West hits back at Russians over Crimea . Even within Crimea's pro-Russia majority, opinions about the legality of seceding are split. Voters proudly proclaimed their support for rejoining Russia as they stood in line in dreary weather to vote. However, one, who was too afraid to speak to CNN on camera, proclaimed the referendum illegal. The ethnic Tatars and younger voters have also questioned the legality of secession. Many of the Tatar minority boycotted the referendum with some leaders calling it ""a farce"" forced by armed men. As the United States and Russia attempt to hash out their differences, pressure mounts for Putin to move quickly and carefully in resolving the Crimean crisis, Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute told CNN International. ""He basically has two choices. Choice Number One would be to move fairly quickly to annex Crimea and that is going to then seem as a very naked land grab and will make it very difficult then for a dialogue to move forward,"" Pifer said. ""That move will likely mean Western nations will ratchet up the level of sanctions, Pifer said. ""The alternative is they take the vote but that the Russians don't move very quickly,"" Pifer said. ""They let Crimea basically stay in some limbo status which will create some opportunity perhaps for negotiation that can diffuse this crisis.""

"(CNN) -- Happy Taylor Swift album release day! It may not be your thing, but the legions of the Swifties have been eagerly awaiting ""1989."" Some of them downloaded a track of silence just to get their TS fix. With her first purely pop album, Swift is winning raves. Billboard's Jem Aswad declared the album ""Swift's best work -- a sophisticated pop tour de force that deserves to be as popular commercially as with Robyn-worshipping bloggers; an album that finds Swift meeting Katy (Perry) and Miley (Cyrus) and Pink on their home turf and staring them down."" ""1989"" is being closely watched to see whether it can help pull the music industry out of its slump: No single artist has been able to pull off a platinum album this year. Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield writes in his review that ""Swift has already written enough great songs for two or three careers. 'Red,' from 2012, was her 'Purple Rain,' a sprawling I-am-the-cosmos epic with disco banjos and piano ballads and dubstep drops. ""Deeply weird, feverishly emotional, wildly enthusiastic, '1989' sounds exactly like Taylor Swift, even when it sounds like nothing she's ever tried before,"" Sheffield adds. ""And yes, she takes it to extremes. Are you surprised? This is Taylor Swift, remember? Extremes are where she starts out."" Swift also has some high-profile fans. A video of superstar Kelly Clarkson covering the new album's first single, ""Shake It Off,"" in concert was posted on YouTube over the weekend. ""Seriously, everyone gives Taylor a hard time, but she can write a hook,"" Clarkson said. ""I'm just saying.""","Swift's new album is out Monday .

"(CNN) -- A number of Morocco's riads (traditional courtyard houses) have been transformed into incredible boutique hotels over the past several years, giving travelers a cultural and luxurious experience that was once off limits. A classic riad is built around a central courtyard with a garden and fountain. The interior often features lavish ornamentation -- glazed ceramic tiles (zellij) in colorful geometric patterns on walls and floors, carved pierced white stucco work, painted wooden ceilings (zouakt) and shiny polished plaster walls (tadelakt). ""There is extraordinary diversity among Marrakech riads, whose aesthetics range from the ornate flourishes of traditional Moroccan style to ultra-modern interiors that wouldn't look out of place in a New York City loft,"" says Cyrus Bozorgmehr, a Briton who manages several riads in Marrakech. ""With owners living as far afield as Italy, Tahiti and the United States, each brings their own vision -- so each riad has a unique identity, infused with the personality and history of the person behind it and their relationship with Morocco,"" adds Bozorgmehr, who estimates Marrakech has more than 1,000 riad hotels. International fixtures . Opened in 2014, one of the new breed is Riad Jaaneman. It juxtaposes Italian contemporary style, art deco furnishings, marble bathrooms, iPod docks and Boffi bathroom fixtures with Moroccan-patterned headboards and tadelakt walls. In the five-suite riad's Partenope suite, green marble from South America, track lighting and ebony tadelakt walls adorn the bathroom. Dark brown Emperador marble from Spain and tobacco-colored tadelakt walls decorate the bathroom in another suite; the bedroom is decorated with African artifacts and has two walk-in dressing rooms. An outdoor pool and hammam (traditional steam bath) are here, and riad staff organize day trips to the Atlas Mountains, skiing, cooking classes and yoga. Owner Leonardo Giangreco, an Italian-born former investment banker in London, left finance in 2010 to ""reinvent myself."" He bought the riad in 2003 to live in, spent two years restoring it and plans to display part of his contemporary art collection here. Traditional elements . In contrast to Riad Jaaneman, Riad El Amine in Fez boasts traditional Moroccan craftsmanship. It has two courtyards. One features zellij-adorned columns flanking an aqua-tiled reflecting pool. A second with a fountain strewn with rose petals in a nine-pointed star-shaped niche and geometric-patterned ceramic tiles. One of the 11-room riad's eight suites features a lavender-curtained four-poster bed with silk purple and gold pillows. Others have colored-glass arched windows. Its owner, a Moroccan travel agent, purchased two riads in 2004, and had new tile and stucco work handmade to mimic the old. ""It was the restorations of these ancient courtyard houses -- mostly by expats -- that really saved the ancient poverty-stricken medinas from falling into complete disuse and slums,"" says Joel A. Zack, president of Heritage Tours Private Travel in New York, which custom designs tours to Morocco. ""Fifteen years ago, they were very different places. It's the perfect example of adaptive reuse that saved an entire historic quarter, and helped grow economy and tourism significantly."" Riads have no windows facing the street -- all face the courtyard. Entryways are often plain doors on a blank wall in a tiny alley in the medina. These unremarkable exteriors offer absolutely no clue to the wonders within. ""You see the look of terror on their faces when guests often first arrive at a riad, at a sometimes unmarked door in a dark alley,"" says Bozorgmehr. ""They don't know if they'll ever find their way back, until they get into their comfort zone. It's the Islamic way -- no ostentation outside the house, you show your wealth inside."" Latent luxury . When the King of Morocco decided to open the Royal Mansour Marrakech hotel in 2010 as the last word in opulence, he chose to build 53 brand new riads. Each is a three-story, one- to four-bedroom jewel box, furnished in a riot of ornate zellij, carved stucco and wooden screens, painted wooden ceilings, silks and brocades in spare-no-expense fashion, with a private courtyard and roof terrace with pool and fireplace. Giving riads the ultimate luxury twist, King Mohammed VI added three restaurants helmed by three-Michelin-star Paris chef Yannick Alleno, serving Moroccan, gourmet French and Mediterranean cuisine. There are also a 2,500-square-meter spa with 13 treatment rooms, two hammams, indoor pool, gym and Pilates studio, a library with a telescope for stargazing through a retractable roof and 24-hour room service and private butlers, who travel by underground tunnels for privacy. Guests receive stationery with their names lettered in gold. Five-meter-high walls surround the faux medina surrounding the Royal Mansour, a short walk from the Djemaa El Fna, the raucous square alive with snake charmers, magicians, potion, food and drink peddlers and storytellers at night. CEOs and political leaders have stayed in its biggest riad, the four-bedroom, four-bathroom Riad d'Honneur, which sprawls over 1,800 square meters. You can book that for a mere $48,945 per night. Marrakech's first expatriate riad owner is believed to be oil heir J. Paul Getty Jr., who bought a deteriorated riad in the late 1960s and hired Bill Willis, an American interior designer, to decorate it. The designer's own Marrakech riad, an ultra-flamboyant Arabian Nights-style fantasy where he entertained guests like the Rolling Stones and William S. Burroughs, has appeared in ""Architectural Digest"" and other design magazines. Willis, who became the designer of choice for jet set Marrakech expats from Yves St Laurent to Fiat heiress Marella Agnelli, helped catapult Moroccan interior design to international attention. The city's first riad hotel was La Maison Arabe, a 26-room riad with a renowned Moroccan cooking school, which opened in 1997. ""For those who truly want to experience authenticity, the right riad can be an amazing experience,"" says Joel Zack of Heritage Tours Private Travel. ""Most do not offer the amenities of a full hotel, but they are gorgeous, each room is different and they offer a magic and a sense of being in Morocco and its hospitality that is absolutely unbeatable.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department is dispatching election monitors to 18 states to watch for discrimination against minority and disabled voters in Tuesday's midterms. Monitors from the department's Civil Rights Division will be in 28 jurisdictions throughout Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. ""This year, as citizens across the country go to the polls on Election Day, I want the American people to know that the Justice Department will stand vigilant -- working in a fair and nonpartisan manner to ensure that every voter -- every voter -- can cast his or her ballot free of intimidation, discrimination or obstruction,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a video message announcing plans to send out the monitors. The midterms will be the first elections since the Shelby County v. Holder case that saw the Supreme Court strike down portions of the Voting Rights Act that required some states to clear changes in their voting procedures with the Justice Department before implementing those changes. Holder said the monitors will gather information on local polling practices and watch to be sure voters aren't treated differently based on their ethnicity, that disabled people are able to access their voting locations, that provisional ballot requirements are followed and that bilingual election materials are provided. He also blasted ""restrictive measures"" like states' voter identification laws that make it ""more difficult to vote.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday it has joined the whistle-blower lawsuit against cyclist Lance Armstrong that was originally filed by a former teammate. The Justice Department will file its formal complaint in 60 days. Armstrong, the onetime legendary and now disgraced cyclist, has admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs. He was the team's lead rider when the U.S. Postal Service sponsored the team from 1996 to 2004 and Armstrong won six of his seven Tour de France titles, the Justice Department said. The civil lawsuit alleges that Armstrong and former team managers submitted false claims for government funds to the sponsoring Postal Service by their ""regularly employing banned substances and method to enhance their performance"" in violation of the sponsorship agreement, the federal announcement said. ""Today's action demonstrates the Department of Justice's steadfast commitment to safeguarding federal funds and making sure that contractors live up to their promises,"" Stuart F. Delery, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the civil division, said in a statement. Read the lawsuit . Between 2001 and 2004, the Postal Service paid $31 million in sponsorship fees, but that affiliation has now been ""unfairly associated with what has been described as 'the most sophisticated, professionalized, and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,' "" said Ronald C. Machen Jr., U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. ""In today's economic climate, the U.S. Postal Service is simply not in a position to allow Lance Armstrong or any of the other defendants to walk away with the tens of millions of dollars they illegitimately procured,"" Machen said. The suit that the Justice Department is joining is by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis and was unsealed by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Wilkins. It provides details of the payments Armstrong and his team received while they promised to abide by the rules of cycling's governing bodies. Those rules prohibited the use of certain performance enhancing substances and methods. ""This lawsuit is designed to help the Postal Service recoup the tens of millions of dollars it paid out (to) the Tailwind cycling team based on years of broken promises,"" Machen said. The suit also names as defendants Johan Bruyneel, who had managed the U.S. Postal Service and Discovery racing teams on which Armstrong raced, and Tailwind Sports, which was the team's management entity, the Justice Department said. The Justice Department is joining the lawsuit's allegations against Bruyneel and Tailwind, but it isn't intervening in the suit's claims against several other defendants, the agency said. The U.S. Postal Service supported the Justice Department intervention. This so-called qui tam case allows the resources of the federal government to intervene on the side of a whistle-blower. If the suit is successful the government stands to recoup millions, and Landis stands to claim a sizable share of the proceeds -- possibly in the millions of dollars. The government had been working on the case for several weeks in advance of a likely federal intervention. ""The defendants agreed to play by the rules and not use performance enhancing drugs,"" general counsel and executive vice president Mary Anne Gibbons said in a statement. ""We now know that the defendants failed to live up to their agreement, and instead knowingly engaged in a pattern of activity that violated the rules of professional cycling and, therefore, violated the terms of their contracts with the Postal Service."" The lawsuit accuses the former management of Armstrong's team of defrauding the federal government of millions of dollars because it knew about the drug use and didn't do anything. The federal government had been evaluating for weeks whether to intervene in the lawsuit. An attorney for Armstrong, Robert Luskin, said that ongoing discussions between the federal government and Armstrong's legal team had collapsed. ""Lance and his representatives worked constructively over these last weeks with federal lawyers to resolve this case fairly, but those talks failed because we disagree about whether the Postal Service was damaged,"" Luskin said. ""The Postal Service's own studies show that the service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship -- benefits totaling more than $100 million."" Armstrong's attorneys declined to comment further on Friday's Justice Department announcement. Former teammate Landis, who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test, filed the lawsuit in 2010 against the team, which was sponsored the U.S. Postal Service. Landis was a teammate of Armstrong on the Postal Service-sponsored team from 2002 to 2004, and his lawsuit was filed under the False Claims Act, the Justice Department said. That act is commonly called the whistle-blower law. The law permits the federal government to investigate allegations and intervene, the Justice Department said. The act was originally passed in 1863 when government officials were concerned that suppliers to the Union Army during the Civil War could be defrauding them. In 1986, Congress modified the law to make it easier for whistle-blowers to bring cases and give them a larger share of any penalties collected. Whistle-blowers can now take home between 15% and 30% of the sums collected in their cases. For years, Armstrong had denied drug use and blood doping, but he publicly admitted such use in January, three months after international cycling's governing body stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles. That stripping came after a damning report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency accused Armstrong and his team of the ""most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program"" in cycling history. That agency praised the Justice Department's announcement. ""The U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team was run as a fraudulent enterprise and individuals both inside and outside of sport aided and abetted this scheme and profited greatly,"" CEO Travis T. Tygart said in a statement. CNN's Terry Frieden in Washington and Jason Morris in Dallas contributed to this report.","U.S. Justice Department will file formal complaint in 60 days .

"(CNN) -- For years, Lance Armstrong carried a growing burden of doping accusations up increasingly steep hills, accumulating fans, wealth and respect along the way. On Wednesday, he crashed. In one day, the renowned cyclist and cancer survivor lost a major endorsement deal with Nike -- once worth millions of dollars -- and the chairmanship of the cancer charity he founded 15 years ago. While stepping down as chairman of Livestrong was Armstrong's idea, losing Nike's support wasn't. Opinion: 'U.S. Postal doping predates Armstrong' Nike, which initially stood by Armstrong, dropped him Wednesday with a terse statement citing what it called ""seemingly insurmountable evidence"" that he participated in doping. Hours later, brewery giant Anheuser-Busch followed suit, saying it will let Armstrong's contract expire at the end of the year. Nike and Anheuser-Busch said they still plan to support Livestrong and its initiatives. The American Cancer Society, which has had a long relationship with Armstrong, said only that it would continue to collaborate with Livestrong. Armstrong walked away as chairman of the Livestrong cancer charity ""to spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career,"" according to a statement posted to the group's website. He will remain on the charity's board of directors, but he will turn over the reins to founding chairman Jeff Garvey. LIVESTRONG supporter: 'Conflicted' about my wristband . The move comes a week after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency detailed what it called ""overwhelming"" evidence of Armstrong's involvement as a professional cyclist in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program."" The seven-time Tour de France winner has consistently denied the claims, and legions of fans and corporate supporters had backed him -- until now. Armstrong founded the Livestrong charity in 1997 after his own successful treatment for testicular cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs. He came back from the disease seemingly stronger than ever, winning the first of his seven Tour de France titles less than three years after he was diagnosed in 1996. His success inspired cancer patients worldwide, spreading his reach far beyond the insular world of cycling and cementing his place in celebrity culture. He became rich, dated a rock star and appeared in movies. The bright yellow ""LIVESTRONG"" wristbands distributed by his charity became a potent symbol for perseverance in the face of adversity. People should look to that legacy in assessing Armstrong, Livestrong's president said. Read more: Evidence of Armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says . ""Lance's devotion to serving others whose lives were irrevocably changed by cancer, as his was, is unsurpassable,"" Doug Ulman said in a statement issued after Wednesday's announcement. ""We are incredibly proud of his record as an advocate and philanthropist and are deeply grateful that Lance and his family will continue to be actively involved with the Foundation's advocacy and service work."" But a long chain of accusations has trailed Armstrong. In 2002, a 21-month investigation into allegations that Armstrong's team used banned substances during the 2000 Tour de France closed after finding no evidence of illegal drug use. He later sued the author of a book that accused him of having used performance-enhancing drugs and the International Cycling Union cleared him of 1999 doping allegations in a 2006 report. In 2010, former teammate Floyd Landis accused him of doping. Federal prosecutors also looked into the allegations but closed their case in Feburary without pressing charges. That's when USADA began its investigation. In its report, released last week, the anti-doping agency made public testimony from Armstrong's teammates and others who said Armstrong was among team members who used banned performance-enhancing substances and tried to hide it from testing officials. The report is part of USADA's request to international cycling officials to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles. The International Olympic Committee is also reviewing the evidence and could consider revoking Armstrong's bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney games. Armstrong is already banned from competing in events sanctioned by U.S. Olympic governing bodies. Armstrong has said he never has failed a drug test and has consistently denied participating in any banned practices. Armstrong's lawyer, Tim Herman, called the report last week a ""one-sided hatchet job"" and a ""government-funded witch hunt."" He did not return a call on Wednesday. Opinion: With Armstrong's disgrace, will anything change? So far, Armstrong's woes haven't affected the charity's ability to raise money, according to Livestrong spokeswoman Katherine McClane. Donations to the charity have actually boomed since August, when Armstrong announced he was ending his legal fight to stop USADA's investigation, she said last week. That's because, according to McClane, the charity's main audience -- cancer patients and their families -- isn't troubled by Armstrong's woes. ""The last thing that's going to enter your mind is news from the cycling world,"" McClain said Wednesday. According to Livestrong, Armstrong has helped raise nearly $500 million, including $6.5 million of his own, for cancer research, treatment and support in his role as Livestrong founder and has helped ""dispel the stigma and misconceptions about the disease."" Read more: Highlights of the Armstrong report . Livestrong will need to find a new way to present itself to the world without Armstrong as its face, said Eric Martin, a partner with Boost Partners, a Richmond, Virginia, strategic consulting firm. How? Focus on ""real-world heroes who have faced down cancer while loving a sport more than the spotlight,"" Martin said. ""At this point, what they need to do is re-establish the authenticity of their cause and the way to do that, in my opinion, is to reconnect with what people really admire in their heroes,"" Martin said. Howard Bragman, an expert in crisis communications and vice chairman of Reputation.com, an online reputation management company in Los Angeles, said the future of Livestrong is uncertain. ""I personally hope that Livestrong is stronger than Lance Armstrong because they have done -- and continue to do -- amazing work for people with cancer,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. But he said he had little doubt that the impact on Armstrong would be devasating. ""It doesn't get any worse than this, OK?"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""Imagine losing the prestige of all your Tour de France titles, millions in endorsements, stepping down from the organization he loves and founded, that's been his public mission -- and, possibly the worst thing of all, which is public humiliation.""

"Pahoa, Hawaii (CNN) -- The lava flow has slowed, if not stalled altogether. Still, authorities warned Thursday that the threat to eastern Hawaii residents -- much like the oozing, simmering, destructive lava itself -- hasn't gone away. Darryl Oliveira, the director of the Hawaii County Civil Defense, told reporters that ""there's been no movement forward"" at the front of the destructive lava stream between Wednesday and Thursday. ""But there's lots of activity behind it,"" Oliveira said. ""... There are breakouts along the margins that we'll have to watch and be wary of."" The lava began moving toward the area of Pahoa, on Hawaii's Big Island, in June, when a volcanic crater vented and released the river of liquid rock. It's been creeping along ever since, with authorities warning at one point the main road in Pahoa could be overcome by Friday morning. The lack of recent movement changes that equation, though the main flow -- which is about 20 yards wide at its tip, expanding to 100 yards farther back -- is still within about 480 feet of that street. There's no guarantee of what happens next, including whether the stream resumes its forward movement or whether any of its offshoots encroach on people or properties. A USGS geologist has said the lava flow could continue for 30 years. As Matthew Patrick, a geologist with the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, explained Thursday: ""The flow is still active, and there is still scattered activity in the flow. ""So it's just a matter of where that activity is at any given moment."" On Wednesday, Oliveria said about 20 families in the path of the lava have been told to evacuate. Many others have packed up, ""prepared to move at a moment's notice"" should they, too, get the order. ""You can see some of them walking around; they are still very upset, distraught, frustrated -- the full range of emotions as they're dealing with this crisis,"" the civil defense director said Thursday. So far, thankfully, no homes have been buried. Nor have any vehicles. Instead, it's mostly grass and vegetation that have been immersed and scorched. This isn't a lazy river, after all. It's a 2,000-degree river of molten rock, the kind that a firefighter can't use a hose to stop. ""As it moves across soil, you can hear and smell the fire,"" said Troy Scott of the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency. ""It is incredibly hot ... the heat is very strong."" That's why there are ongoing efforts to make sure people and property are protected, as well as to clear out any hazardous materials, such as those at a one-time gas station, in the lava's potential path. Local civil defense officials got some help Thursday, in the form of 80 Hawaii National Guard members. Oliveria explained that these guardsmen will drive around on patrols as an extra set of eyes. He said, ""As long as we need them, they'll be here."" What to know about volcanoes . CNN's Martin Savidge reported from Pahoa; Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- The jury may still be out for many Arsenal fans over the future of coach Arsenal Wenger but few can argue about the Frenchman leading the Londoners to the Champions League knockout stages for a 15th consecutive year. He achieved his latest qualification after goals from Yaya Sanogo, his first for the club at the 19th attempt, and Alexis Sanchez secured a 2-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund's compatriots Bayer Leverkusen and Spaniards Atletico Madrid also made it through to the Last 16 on Wednesday. ""It's not easy to be consistent so I am very proud of that,"" Wenger said after the game. ""The club deserves a lot of credit."" The problem in many Arsenal supporters' eyes is that the fine record merely papers over cracks that may well be exposed when the Last 16 kicks off in February. The Gunners, who have never won the competition but who finished runners-up in 2006, have failed to reach the quarterfinals in each of the last four seasons -- losing to Bayern Munich (twice), Milan and Barcelona. Compounding this frustration is the fact that the side has seldom impressed in the Premier League, with Wenger last finishing in the top two in 2005. On Tuesday, he may have been conscious that he was taking on the man often touted as a leading contender to replace him at the Emirates -- Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Victory against a side that had already secured qualification came at a familiar cost though, with both Sanogo and midfielder Mikel Arteta going off with injuries. Little surprise then that Wenger was hoping for some positives, following a season in which key players like Olivier Giroud, Jack Wilshere and goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny have all been forced onto the sidelines. ""From now until February we must improve as a team, get encouragement from this win and hopefully have more players back,"" Wenger added. In Group D's other game, Anderlecht won their first match of the campaign when beating ten-man Galatasaray 2-0, with Chancel Mbemba netting both goals. Having ended Dortmund's 100% record, Arsenal have an outside chance of now finishing top of the group -- providing they win in Galatasaray, and Dortmund trip up at home to Anderlecht -- and so avoiding the heavyweights in the next round. Bundesliga Blowout . That was precisely what Bayer Leverkusen were hoping to do but they capped off a record week for German sides -- albeit for the wrong reasons. They lost 1-0 at home to Monaco which, in addition to Dortmund's defeat and those of both Bayern Munich and Schalke on Tuesday, meant Germany's four Champions League entrants all lost in the same week for the first time ever. Monaco scored with their only effort on target, just as they did when hosting Leverkusen in September, and Group C is still wide open -- with three sides capable of going through. Leverkusen still managed to ensure progress on Wednesday but their nine points are now only one better than Monaco's, while Zenit St Petersburg -- who beat Benfica 1-0 -- have moved onto seven. Meanwhile, last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid created their own slice of history when progressing from the group stage in consecutive years for the first time ever. A Mario Mandzukic hat-trick helped them to a 4-0 victory over Olympiakos and the Spaniards will qualify top of Group A unless they lose heavily in Juventus next month. The Italians need a draw to progress after winning 2-0 in Sweden against Malmo, with Fernando Llorente and Carlos Tevez earning Juve's first away win in the group stage for two years. Perfect Start . Defending champions Real Madrid are still the only side in the competition with a 100% record after Cristiano Ronaldo's goal in Switzerland was enough to a earn a 1-0 win over Basel. The victory was the fifteenth in a row for Carlo Ancelotti's side, so equaling Real's best runs, achieved in the 1960-61 season under Miguel Munoz and three seasons ago under Jose Mourinho. Victory away to Malaga in La Liga on Saturday will create a new record. In Group B's other game, Liverpool stopped a run of four consecutive defeats but still had to settle for a 2-2 draw away to Ludogorets. The Bulgarians scored late to deny the five-time champions all three points, but the equalizer changed little -- with Liverpool still needing to beat Basel at Anfield next month to go through. Ludogorets are the only side that Liverpool have scored against in the group, whereas Ronaldo, who has now netted in his last 12 away Champions League games, has struck against every team. In a statistic Arsenal fans may want to shy away from, the Portuguese has scored 43 Champions League goals since the start of the 2011-12 season -- precisely the same tally as that boasted by Wenger's Arsenal in the same period.","Arsenal, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all qualify for Last 16 on Wednesday .

"London (CNN) -- A British man charged with planning either a ""Mumbai-style"" terror attack or an attack on a prominent person said in secret recordings that he had been to Syria and reveled in the idea of being labeled a terrorist, a court in London heard Thursday. Erol Incedal, 26, is accused of preparing terrorist acts with the intention of committing terrorism, and of having documents on how to build a bomb. He denies the charges against him. Police first detained Incedal, a British citizen of Turkish descent, over a traffic violation in London in September 2013. During a search of his car, they found a piece of paper with the address of a property tied to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair written on it. Police planted a secret listening device in Incedal's E-Class Mercedes before releasing him. The recordings have been revealed this week at Incedal's trial, which will be partially held in secret. While the judge has allowed some reporting of its opening phases, journalists and members of the public will be barred from observing other parts of the trial. The prosecution says the recordings from inside Incedal's car give ""a flavor"" of the law student's frame of mind in the weeks before he was arrested again in October of last year and formally charged. In one clip, Incedal and his associate Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar claim to have been in Syria. ""In Syria, the weather was ...,"" Rarmoul-Bouhadjar says, before Incedal interjects with, ""Wallahi, it was like minus-20 degrees because we were on a mountain!"" ""Another word, 'terrorist.' That's a great word, Mounir. There's never been a greater word than that to describe us,"" Incedal tells Rarmoul-Bouhadjar in another clip. The jury also heard recordings of Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar purportedly using code words in a discussion about buying a gun. Incedal told his partner: ""Update me at every stage and just say 'yeah the sausage is nice, there's enough sauce in it.' "" ""What's the sausage?"" Rarmoul-Bouhadjar asks. Incedal replies: ""Bullets. If there's not enough sauce in it, you'll have to make that decision if we're gonna take it or not. If it's less than five, it's not worth it."" In another clip, the pair appear to be discussing the quality of their potential purchase. ""It is only about a grand, so I don't think it is going to be a great quality,"" says Incedal. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar asks, ""It fires?"" Incedal replies: ""Mmm ... it's not a replica."" In another recording, Rarmoul-Bouhadjar appears to suggest to Incedal that he should leave his wife. ""I think you should separate,"" he tells Incedal. ""She has mentally become unstable."" ""Do you know what I'm worried about now? She knows some of our secrets,"" Incedal replies. ""She don't know much but she knows I was, like, in trouble. ... I'm not saying it's going to happen, but she might just chat s**t."" Police finally decided to swoop in on October 13, 2013. Specialist firearms officers stopped the pair in east London and shot out the tires of Incedal's car to prevent an escape. They arrested both men and seized several iPhones and other mobile phones from the car, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors say Incedal's iPhone had a number of images on it, including an image of a YouTube page for a song called ""O Islamic State"" and an image of a page of titles by Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical U.S.-born cleric who was killed by an American drone strike in late September 2011 in Yemen. Both men's iPhones concealed an SD card between the phone and the phone's protective case. Both SD cards contained three identical files, including a ""Car Bomb Recognition Guide"" and a ""bomb making"" Word document, parts of which were considered ""viable"" but also incomplete, the court heard. Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar communicated via email and Skype, using code words and aliases to refer to the words ""Kalashnikov"" and ""Mumbai-style,"" the prosecution said. More than 160 people were killed in November 2008 when 10 Pakistani gunmen associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings in Mumbai, India. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar has already pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a document that could be used in a terror attack. Officers searching Incedal's south London home also found a document on top of a wardrobe referring to a ""Plan A"" that appeared to be a checklist for an operation involving ""three to four workers,"" ""two tennis rackets,"" ""one months' surveillance,"" and renting a flat nearby, Prosecutor Richard Whittam said. Incedal's wife, Kadeejah Baluch, was home at the time with Incedal's three children and another child. Police also searched a second address in west London that Incedal had failed to disclose to police at the time of his arrest. That search turned up a laptop with Incedal's DNA all over it and several Nicolas Cage DVDs, among other things, the court heard. It is unclear when the alleged terror plots were to be carried out. But during an argument with his wife that was captured by the police listening device inside his car, Incedal says: ""I'm never going to be around for very long anyway ... at least my last few months of life, I'll live with peace of mind."" The trial continues at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","A British man charged with planning an attack said he had been to Syria, court hears .

"(CNN) -- Critics of climate action like to say that helping our environment would hurt our economy. Climate-change denier Sen. Jim Inhofe has written that ""manmade catastrophic global warming was the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people"" and that cap-and-trade legislation could cause the loss of over 4 million jobs. Inhofe's views matter since he could become the new chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works if Republicans win the Senate in the November elections. But three new studies show climate action can improve the economy and create jobs. Though transitioning to clean energy future will cause some disruption, unchecked environmental damage would cause catastrophic economic loss. So how can climate action help economy? Business leaders and economists said in a report that new technologies can spur both economic growth and better climate outcome. Finance experts at the International Monetary Fund -- hardly a bunch of tree-huggers -- made a similar point. In their paper about carbon pricing, they concluded that higher carbon prices can benefit individual countries even if others don't match them. And economist Robert Pollin and his colleagues have shown that for every $1 million of investment in clean energy, the U.S. can create 16.7 jobs compared with only 5.3 jobs from fossil fuel investments. Overall, green energy investments combined with carbon taxes can create 2.7 million jobs in areas such as renewable energy, construction, manufacturing, transportation, new technologies and services -- even taking into account the transitional job loss from fossil fuel industries. We should pay attention to these ideas. American energy policy is backwards. Federal and state governments give out over $20 billion in annual subsidies for fossil fuel exploration and production, which benefit highly profitable companies such as Exxon Mobil, Shell and BP. But if the U.S. implements even a modest federal carbon tax, we could generate $170 billion by 2030 to create jobs and build bridges, roads and schools, reduce budget deficits, and cut taxes to spur private investment. Without carbon taxes, we treat our environment -- air, oceans and fresh water -- as a garbage dump where we fill up excess carbon. But the garbage can is overflowing because carbon emitters don't pay the full price for carbon emissions. Think of it this way: It's like a bad neighbor who dumps garbage in the neighbors' yards. That person saves money, but everyone else pays to clean up the foul mess and the entire neighborhood suffers. Just like with trash, carbon taxes must bear the full cost of their negative effects. The first dollar of any carbon tax must help communities and workers in the transition to green economy. In fact, many fossil fuel job losses already have taken place. West Virginia coal mining employment fell from 120,000 in 1950 to 25,000 by 2011. Carbon taxes are not the real threat to coal miners and their communities -- greedy energy companies are. These companies make profit but leave fewer jobs and harm communities. Compensation to job losers, paid from carbon tax revenues, can be modeled after federal programs such as the Trade Adjustment Assistance for displaced trade workers or the Pentagon's program that helps communities that lose military bases. There are successful policies that have reshaped market incentives to give clean energy and green jobs a fair chance. In 2011, Germany expanded wind turbines and solar energy, aiming to replace all nuclear power. Thirty percent of the country's electricity is now derived from renewables. Germany's massive investments are driving down wind turbine and solar technology prices, making them more cost-effective. Los Angeles, urged by an alliance of environmentalists, unions and community organizations, is changing a basic city service -- the commercial trash pickup -- to cut emissions from garbage trucks, increase recycling and encourage industries to use recycled materials,to achieve a ""zero waste"" target by 2050. These new trash policies will also create better, safer and higher-paying jobs. So the economic cost of moving to a clean energy economy is not anywhere near what the fear-mongering of Inhofe and others would have you believe. Instead, we can create jobs, help those who are in transition, and save our precious common resource -- the planet where we all live. We just have to use our brains. As one marcher at the recent People's Climate March aptly puts it in his protest sign: ""Global Warming and No Jobs -- Two Problems, One Solution."" There is only solution, and we must embrace it.","Rick McGahey: Critics of climate action think helping environment would hurt economy .

"(CNN) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday quarantined an international flight in New Jersey after a passenger became ill on the plane, authorities said. United Airlines Flight 998 from Brussels, Belgium, touched down at Newark Liberty International Airport at 12:15 p.m. CDC quarantine officers met the plane after one of the 255 passengers was vomiting on the flight, officials said. The passengers were released at 1:50 p.m. and permitted to go through customs, said Erica Dumas, a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesperson. The sick passenger and his daughter were taken to a hospital for evaluation. Passengers said it took another two hours to clear customs and retrieve their luggage. The incident comes amid heightened concerns after Thomas Eric Duncan, who had recently arrived from Liberia, on Tuesday was confirmed as the first case of the deadly Ebola virus diagnosed on American soil. Duncan arrived in the United States after a connection in Brussels. The possibility of a new case was knocked down later Saturday by the New Jersey Department of Health. In a statement, it said that University Hospital ""in coordination with federal, state and local public health officials evaluated two individuals who arrived"" Saturday afternoon. ""The symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola,"" the health department said. ""The second individual, who was traveling with the patient, was asymptomatic."" The health department said that both passengers will be let go and ""self-monitoring,"" meaning they'll be in charge of gauging their health. This statement appears to close the book on this situation, from the health department's perspective. But it was a very different story just a few hours earlier. CDC officials removed the man and his daughter while other passengers remained on board. The two passengers were escorted by CDC officials in hazmat gear. Dumas said the response was standard procedure with sick passengers, but it was unclear how long the protocol has been in place. ""They were wearing masks and gloves on the plane,"" said a passenger from Paris who identified himself only as Chris. They came with whole suits like you see on TV everyday in Africa."" Passenger Rich Burchett told CNN he was sitting next to the sick man. ""He nudged me and asked me to get the flight attendant,"" Burchett said. The man told him, ""I need a flight attendant. My eyes are floating. I've never felt this way before. They hurt."" According to Burchett, a flight attendant asked the man where he was traveling from. He responded: Liberia. ""Immediately they both left and some time passed and they came back and asked him for his name,"" Burchett said of the flight attendants. ""He handed them his passport. They came back with white masks and asked [the man and his daughter] to put them on."" The sick passenger and the girl were taken to the back of the plane, Burchett said. The plane landed about an hour and a half later. An announcement was made about a sick passenger. People were asked to stay in their seats. More than an hour passed. ""They told us they were waiting on the CDC and everyone realized the gravity of the situation,"" Burchett said. Nearly two hours after the flight landed, Burchett said, an announcement was made: ""Everyone can leave. He is not contagious."" Passengers were given forms to fill out so that the CDC can follow up with them. They were handed an information sheet with Ebola symptoms. ""We did get an announcement from a representative of the CDC that we were held as an abundance of caution,"" Burchett said. Burchett and other passengers were critical of the response. ""My concern is, if this were something that were highly contagious, we did not seem to have a very good reaction plan,"" he said. ""We seemed very uncoordinated at the airport. I hope we learn from it."" Passenger Henry Costa, a talk show host from Monrovia, Libreria, said the man did not initially show signs of illness. ""He didn't seem sick and then all of sudden I saw them taking him out,"" he recalled. ""He looked strong but they say he was vomiting."" Costa said he had spoken with the man and his daughter before the flight left Liberia. ""He was lively,"" Costa said. ""His daughter was very inquisitive. She asked so many questions. Apparently, it was her first time flying."" The man and his daughter were taken to University Hospital, where the emergency room will not accept anyone else for four hours, CNN affiliate WABC reported. In a statement this week, the CDC said quarantine inspectors meet arriving aircraft and ships reporting ill passengers or crew to assist them in getting appropriate medical treatment. The agency CDC has a network of quarantine stations at 20 ports of entry and land-border crossings. ""If the flight crew of a commercial aircraft arriving in the U.S. becomes aware of an ill person on board which may include a person with Ebola symptoms, the captain is required required by law ... to report the illness to the nearest U.S. Quarantine Station, who will arrange the appropriate medical response at the flight's destination airport,"" the statement said. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? On Saturday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden addressed the growing concerns about the deadly disease. ""We have already gotten well over 100 inquiries of possible patients,"" Frieden told reporters. ""We've assessed every one of those ... and just this one patient has tested positive ... We expect that we will see more rumors or concerns or possibilities of cases, until there is a positive laboratory test, that is what they are."" How the Ebola virus spreads . CNN's Kristina Sgueglia, Greg Botelho, John Bonifield, Jennifer Bixler, Shimon Prokupecz, Jennifer Henderson, Christina Alesci and Daniel Verello contributed to this report.","Health department: Passenger had ""minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola""

"Melilla (CNN) -- A morning thunderstorm has left the waste ground outside Melilla's compound for migrants and refugees slick with orange mud. Hanging around under overcast skies, a knot of men -- unshaven and dressed in a motley collection of T-shirts -- watch a convoy of Spanish military vehicles rumble by. They have reached this tiny Spanish enclave in North Africa overland -- from Mali, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Some just want a better life in Europe; others are fleeing war. Some have clambered over the three 20-foot (6-meter) fences topped with razor-wire; others have bought forged Moroccan passports to take advantage of Moroccans' eligibility to enter Melilla as day-laborers or to trade. But the Spanish authorities fear that among this tide of the helpless may be some intent on bringing jihad to Europe, using the same routes used by people-smugglers across North Africa. The heavy police presence in Melilla -- the military helicopters, armored vehicles and patrol boats -- are part of their response. So are regular police raids on the poor, crowded neighborhood of Cañada, which sits on a hill overlooking the city center, with its elegant art-deco and modernist buildings, its elegant central park along the Avenida de la Democracia and sweep of sandy beaches. 'Not welcome"" Foreigners, and especially journalists, are not welcome in Cañada, where at least one wall bears graffiti in support of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and others urge reclaiming everywhere from Sudan to Iraq as Islamist states. The imam of a mosque in Cañada is not available to talk. We are variously told he is sick or fasting, and are warned not to film in Cañada's precipitous alleys. The tension is greater than usual following a joint operation by Spanish and Moroccan security agencies last week. Eight men were arrested in the neighboring Moroccan town of Nador. The alleged ringleader of a cell said to have been recruiting would-be jihadists for Iraq and Syria was detained in Cañada. Mohamed Said Mohamed was arrested at his home, within a few hundred yards of the fence that separates Melilla from Morocco. The operation to arrest Mohammed was not without incident. A crowd gathered and threw stones at police in riot gear. At one point, witnesses said, police fired in the air as they tried to extricate Mohamed. Everything you need to know about ISIS . Spanish police would also like to arrest his brother, Said Mohamed Zakarias, a former Spanish soldier trained in using explosives. After leaving the army in 2010, Zakarias headed south to Mali, where he joined the jihadist group MUJAO, an offshoot of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In early 2012, MUJAO and other groups occupied nearly half of Mali, before French intervention drove them back into pockets of the Sahara. Spanish officials believe Zakarias moved onto Syria, and from there was in touch with his brother about recruiting young men from Morocco to join ISIS. The Moroccan government estimates some 2,000 Moroccans have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria, just as hundreds joined the insurgency in Iraq between 2005 and 2009. Mohamed was swiftly flown to Madrid to face a judge, Javier Bermudes. Denying him bail, Bermudes said Moroccan authorities determined that two men from the cell, had gone to an area of Syria and Iraq controlled by ISIS in July. Bermudes also expressed a fear widely held among Spanish officials, saying in his ruling that ""the threat posed by Spaniards or foreigners linked to Spain joining ISIS, or their hypothetical return to our country, is manifestly clear."" This year, Spanish security forces have arrested 44 people - some in Melilla, some in Spain's other North African enclave of Ceuta, some on the mainland. According to the police, members of a Melilla group rounded up in May had dispatched 26 men — 24 Moroccans and two Spanish citizens — since 2012 to join Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and MUJAO. The migrants' center in Melilla is overcrowded, and according to some subsisting there, increasingly unhygienic. Designed to accommodate some 400 people, CETI holds more than 2,000. The Madrid government's representative in Melilla, Abdelmalik El Barkani. told CNN Tuesday that the conditions at the CETI were not ideal, but the care of migrants was adequate. ""Even though there are many more over the capacity, they have had all necessities covered, and they have been able to eat,"" he said. ""I believe that there they are much better than before they arrived in Melilla,"" El Barkani said. Other illegal migrants live on Melilla's streets. It seems a dead-end to many who have risked their lives to gain a toe-hold in Europe. 'Humiliated and abandoned' Some of the men loitering outside were from Kobani, the Kurdish town on the Syria-Turkey border now under an intense assault from ISIS. Thirty-four-year old Khalid Barazy has been in Melilla more than a month. ""The suffering that we've been living, it's impossible for another human to comprehend. For the last two days it's been raining and we've been sleeping under it,"" he said. ""We escaped death and now we're imprisoned here. Humiliated and abandoned. An entire people is being slaughtered. We escaped death and no one will grant us refuge."" At once angry and despondent, Barazy added: ""My family are scattered between Turkey and Syria. Some are fighting ISIS, some have fled, some died."" Barazy said that he and others from Kobani had first fled to Turkey but even there felt ISIS' presence. And so they had embarked on the long journey west. A few of the lucky ones had been able to fly to Algiers and travel overland into Morocco. Others had crossed one conflict zone after another, through Egypt, Libya and Algeria in a journey taking months. Another of the group, Mahmoud Bozan, said he had been smuggled across the border into Morocco and then into Melilla. He was clearly at his wits' end. ""It cost us catastrophic sums. Some people sold their houses, their furniture to get here. And look where we've ended up? I wish we'd stayed in Syria to kill and be killed. It would be better than the camp here."" Their situation is full of ironies. As Barazy and others languish in Melilla, some from the Spanish territory and the Moroccan towns around it yearn to travel in the opposite direction, to join the war they have fled. They may use the same people-traffickers to help them do so. And according to Moroccan officials jihadist cells often share in those smuggling revenues. Barazy and the hundreds like him trapped in Melilla may gaze wistfully at the ferries leaving for the Spanish mainland while their asylum requests go unanswered or unresolved. What Spain fears is that others in Melilla, or planning to come here, see those ships as a passage to bring terror to Europe.","Melilla is a tiny Spanish enclave in North Africa .

"(CNN) -- Far from the sea, a man-made coral reef is taking shape -- and it could change medical operations forever. Step inside the OkCoral lab in Israel's Negev Desert and you'll find row after row of quietly bubbling fish tanks, each containing a precious substance. It is hoped the coral grown in this surreal ""farm,"" could one day be used in bone operations -- encompassing everything from dental implants to spinal procedures. Unlike animal and human bones, coral can't be rejected by the body, say medical experts at the company CoreBone, which manufactures bone replacements from coral. Grown in the lab, this coral is also free from the diseases you might find in the oceanic variety. Start-up science . Assaf Shaham founded the unusual laboratory six years ago at a cost of $2.5 million, with an ambitious vision of tapping into the billion dollar worldwide bone grafting industry. But first he'll need the approval of authorities in the European Union and U.S., with a decision expected next year. The father-of-two's dedication to the business is astounding -- if not a little disconcerting. ""In six years of growing corals, I haven't left these four walls for more than 12 hours -- not even once,"" he said. ""For me, it's 100% learning as I go. I take the mother colony, and I cut off a branch of the coral with a diamond saw. Then I glue it to another base made out of cement."" The delicate ecosystem needs constant care to ensure the water's salinity, temperature, and chemical make-up is perfect -- any variations and the coral could die. The fish swimming around each tank are essentially the ""worker bees"" of the artificial reef. They eat the algae growing on the coral, their feces helps feed the coral, and finally, their movements in the water keep the coral strong. And much like the traditional canary in the coalmine, if the fish die, you know something's not quite right in the water. Clever company? Happily for Shaham, his ambitious experiment appears to be thriving, with coral in the lab growing at ten times the normal rate. Just a small container of the coral costs roughly $5 to $10 to produce, and sells for around $250. One of the biggest benefits of the business is its environmental sustainability. ""We have a constant supply,"" says Ohad Schwartz of company CoreBone. ""We don't have to worry that in several years, harvesting from the sea could be forbidden."" It's a concern they'll never have to think about, when harvesting these remarkable fruits of the desert. Watch: Meet the richest man in Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- They are global sporting superstars, and they've got a story to tell. From former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to ex-England captain David Beckham it seems everyone is releasing autobiographies in a blaze of promotion and headline grabbing excerpts -- and all in time for Christmas. But whether the intention is to set the record straight, settle a few old scores or simply tell it like it is, the majority tend to live and die by their ghost writer. Trying to capture the authenticity of the subject's voice and cram the book full of interesting anecdotes can be a daunting task. But with the help of one respected author of several big football autobiographies, Ian Ridley, whose book on former England captain Tony Adams sold a million copies, here are 10 key components to a successful sporting tome. Story telling . Perhaps the most obvious commandment for any sporting book is that the subject matter has to be interesting. While a big name can usually be guaranteed to bring with them a loyal following who will buy whatever they release, the more casual observer needs a little more persuasion. Ridley's most famous subject was former England soccer captain Tony Adams, who famously battled alcohol addiction throughout the most successful parts of his career. Another focused on former footballer Steve Claridge's issues with betting while his most recent, on former English Premier League referee Mark Halsey dealt with his recovery from cancer. ""The subject of the book has to be honest about these things,"" Ridley told CNN. ""As a writer you have to press ever detail out of them and make sure you draw out the material."" Capture the voice . Any book must bring the character to life in their own words -- it is no good having David Beckham hypothesizing over the French renaissance period. But get the ex-England captain talking about the influence of Alex Ferguson on his career or any of his famous 'hairdryer' moments and people will be gripped. ""You have to capture their voice,"" Ridley explains. ""Ghostwriting is much more of a skill than is recognized."" One good example is the recent autobiography of Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, entitled 'I am Zlatan', that manages to captures his supreme confidence. For instance, the Paris Saint-Germain forward, who continually refers to himself in the third person, notes: ""An injured Zlatan is a properly serious thing for any team."" Mining the seam . The odd five minute chat here or there isn't going to cut it -- an author needs to live and breathe his subject for months if not years. That dictum is especially crucial if your sporting figure isn't particularly effusive at the outset -- as the relationship between the two grows so does the material. ""With the Adams book (the process) took about 18 months,"" Ridley said. ""Don't forget this was in the days before the Internet, which meant research was a lot more time consuming. Initially we did three months of interviews -- about 40 hours of tape."" Lessen outside influences . Obviously, the publisher is king in the process but Ridley says it is important to keep their influence -- and pressure -- to a minimum. ""I have never been under pressure from a publisher and I have never extended a deadline,"" he said. ""As a journalist you are used to meeting deadlines and of course you don't get paid until you deliver the manuscript. ""I have never been told how to structure a book, though in the editing process they might come back and say we need more of this and we would have a discussion about that."" Any publicity is good publicity . That old adage rings true even more than ever in the instant digital world of today. Despite huge chunks of Ferguson's books being reproduced -- much to the chagrin of his ghostwriter Paul Hayward -- it helped get the juicier bits of the text out in front of the public. ""You get worried they are ignoring the depth of the book,"" Ridley says. ""Such is the difficulty of selling books. But any publicity is good publicity. ""There isn't the bravery or the courage anymore in publishing especially with anything that isn't mainstream."" Drown out the detractors . Any autobiography worth its weight is bound to offend someone or other -- the more the better in terms of publicity -- but it is important the author sticks to his guns. Ridley's book on Adams contained a plethora of sensational snippets from the footballer''s life, not all of them savory and saccharine. When the proofs were sent to David Dein -- then former vice-president of Adams' club Arsenal -- he was deeply unhappy says Ridley and was worried it painted the club in a bad light. But after pointing out the consequences to Dein of attempting to gag Adams, Ridley saw the ex-Arsenal vice-president's attitude completely change upon the book's publication. ""When the book was released Dein came over to me with a smile on his face and said it was flying off the shelves in the club shop. He was delighted."" Get it serialized . Any self respecting autobiography must be trailed in a leading national newspaper to ensure maximum coverage ahead of its release. Not only does this help to prick the nation's consciousness it can provide some valuable income in a world where the digital market is shredding the publishing industry slowly and steadily. Serialization deals sometimes outweigh the advance for a book thanks to a lot of big names releasing books than turned out to be big duds. ""The publishing industry is in a mess in terms of the digital revolution, especially selling books in hard cover and paperback,"" Ridley said. ""Publishers have been burnt by ordinary sports books that were so dull, but that huge sums had been paid for. Now advances are very poor and you get what you can for serialization rights."" Press the flesh . Despite smashing UK sales records by selling 115,547 in its first week of release and making £1.4 million ($2.24m), Ferguson is still hitting the road for a series of speaking events to promote his autobiography. All but one of the six dates dotted around the UK have sold out and cost £40 a ticket, which includes a signed copy of the book that is currently retailing at £25 ($40). Not only does this help with sales but it also helps to keep Ferguson and his book in the public eye, with many newspapers -- both regional and national -- covering the events. Embrace the digital revolution . These days social media plays a huge role in the promotion of sports books with Twitter and Facebook campaigns an integral part of any launch. As part of Beckham's media blitz the public were invited to a 'global book signing' via the former Los Angeles Galaxy star's Facebook page, whch has 30.5 million 'likes.'. Fans from across the globe were able to get a personalized digital autograph on e-books from Beckham, during a session that included a question and answer section. ""I always like innovative and original ideas,"" said Beckham. ""What has been created is ambitious but it should be a fantastic event. ""I love the interaction with my fans, but not only will I be able to do this in London, I will be able to sign for them in locations across the world."" Be determined . An extension of 'drowning out the detractors' includes a commitment to getting the book out on the streets in the first place. When Ridley and Halsey lost a publishing deal they determined to print it themselves -- in Lithuania. There followed three months of under-the-radar work that felt like the plot of a spy novel,"" Ridley said. ""For guns, read books. I was introduced to a middle man who ran the merchandise to printers in Lithuania."" But the hard work has been worth it with Halsey's book garnering bags of column inches in the media and plenty of publicity. Ian Ridley is the author of Mark Halsey's autobiography Added Time: Surviving Cancer, Death Threats and the Premier League.","Several high-profile figures have recently released sporting autobiographies .

"(CNN) -- To Disney or not to Disney? For many travelers, especially those with children, it's not even a question they ask. They already know the answer. ""Yes."" To these visitors, Disney is Mickey Mouse, princesses, magic and fun. It's happy memories of childhood brought back to life in your children, a clean place where the rides are safe and the Disney characters are always happy to pose for pictures with your kids. That's Deb Koma, who visited once as a child and walked back into the Magic Kingdom in the mid-1990s with her young son. ""It was so perfect, everybody was so happy, everything was so maintained,"" said Koma, who now works for the AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. ""You were in a perfect fantasy world. That, and my little boy loved it."" But for other vacationers, Disney inspires a firm ""no.""

Mitchell, who will be heading to Orlando, Florida, this year for a work conference but will not be taking his family with him, even though his job will cover most of the costs of his trip. ""We do not enjoy Disney,"" wrote Mitchell, who went to Disney World as a child, via e-mail. ""We believe it symbolically represents the excesses of our extremely individualistic society."" What is it about Disney that creates such a strong response from its dedicated fans and foes? Whether you love or hate or merely tolerate the expansion of what Walt Disney started in 1923, there's no doubting that Disney is popular and its influence is everywhere. All of those theme parks, resorts, cruises, movies, television shows, toys and other Disney businesses earned the company $11.3 billion in the last three months of 2012. More than $3 billion of that money came from Disney cruises and its 11 theme parks and 43 resorts across North America, Europe and Asia. One more park is under construction in Shanghai. People like Disney. It ranked as the third most well-regarded company--behind only Amazon.com and Apple--in a recent Harris Interactive survey of people's opinions of the most visible companies' reputations. Fortune ranks Disney as the most admired entertainment company and the ninth most admired overall, behind Apple (1), Google (2) and Amazon.com (3). Still, there is this cultural split. Disney just rubs some people the wrong way. Whatever people think about Disney, it's probably what they're also thinking about American society and its values, said Manchester University sociologist Robert Pettit. ""Disney does such a wonderful job of representing American culture, they're almost synonymous with America,"" said Pettit, who teaches a three-week course, ""Disney and American Culture,"" that includes a Disney World site visit. ""They are master storytellers, and they have the narrative business down pat."" And behind the magic, ""Disney is a capitalistic corporation bent on consumerism, and that's what drives our economy,"" he said. ""It brings out people's opinions about our society and culture in general. You can love them or be very critical of those aspects of our culture and society because it portrays them so well."" Why Disney might want to 'Escape From Tomorrow' The magic of their children's reactions . Disney is magic for Edward and Harriett Yu of Los Altos, California. The Yu family and their two daughters have happily visited Disney theme parks about every two years, and the family has sailed on two Disney cruises. Edward Yu even booked a family reunion on one of the cruises last year, reserving 10 cabins for his extended family two years in advance. ""For us as parents, it's a chance to connect back to our own childhood and brings back happy memories,"" wrote Yu in an e-mail. ""Now that we have kids, it's priceless to see their reactions as they experience the parks/rides/shows for their first time. Words can't describe the preciousness of seeing our little ones thoroughly enjoying themselves on Disney attractions."" Because it's Disney, ""we know we can expect top-notch entertainment each time we go,"" wrote Yu, 46. ""And there is an expectation that guests behave properly, which I appreciate."" Yu isn't a Disney apologist: He says that Disney's princess influence can be a bit much. He also wishes there were more healthy food options at the parks. ""You figure a park of Disney's caliber could make the food experience better."" But he thinks it's worth the occasional visit just to see the expressions on his girls' faces. Beyond Mickey Mouse: Disney tops cruise ship rankings . The Disney purist . It just made sense to Punam Patel that she would get married at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, this week. Patel, 26, grew up 15 minutes away from the theme park and visited several times per week with her father and two siblings. Her dad would drink from his Mickey Mouse coffee cup with its free refills while the kids went on rides, and he'd bring it home to wash for another day of free coffee. One cafe cook still working there remembers cooking breakfast for her on the weekends, Patel said. When Patel and her future husband decided on a two-month engagement and a small wedding reception, she quickly booked the park's $5,000 wedding garden package for just 20 people (including the bride and groom). Her father-in-law has given the couple a Disney cruise for their honeymoon to schedule whenever they'd like. But Patel won't visit Walt Disney World. ""I grew up going to Disneyland, and that's the original park,"" she said. ""I'm a Disney conservationist. Walt Disney World looks so big, and it's not him (Walt Disney). I think you lose the intimate magic that happens at Disneyland. It's way more corporate. Disneyland feels like being at home."" Excesses of commercialism . For Lindsay Potts and her family, a good vacation is spending time with their extended family, outdoors and in nature. Potts hasn't ever visited any Disney parks but she says that paying lots of money to stand in line for ""fast-paced, high-pressure"" entertainment isn't for her. (Her husband visited Disneyland and Disney World as a child.) She also doesn't want to support Disney. ""Spending hundreds of dollars to wait in lines and be surrounded by consumerism does not appeal to us,"" wrote Potts, who lives in Brownstown, Indiana. ""Disney is a brand and also portrays a certain lifestyle that aligns with current corporate American culture. ""We have chosen to live a more alternative life style that is rooted in sustainability, equality and entertainment that is independent of television and popular media."" The princess stereotype . Alissa Guntren of Bloomington, Indiana, went to Disney World in Florida as a child, but she won't be taking her daughters to Disney theme parks either. No matter how far Disney's princess stories have come, she doesn't want her daughters limiting themselves. ""While I am not averse to my daughters exploring fantasy worlds, I find that Disney and Disney products present children, especially girls, with a very limited fantasy world -- one in which a prince will sweep them off their feet so that they can then live happily ever after,"" wrote Guntren in an e-mail. ""I want my daughters to be confident as individuals, not to grow up thinking there is a prince out there waiting to save them."" ""In addition, I have a difficult time with the princess body types that Disney presents children with, which is an idealized adult female body type and not an appropriate one for my young and impressionable children to try to emulate."" Consumer behavior expert Kit Yarrow isn't surprised that people have such strong emotional reactions to Disney, positive or negative. ""People have strong feelings about it because Disney is such a prominent part of their childhoods,"" said Yarrow, chair of Golden Gate University's psychology department in San Francisco. ""Whether you went to theme parks or watched movies and cartoons or got the goodies in some way shape or form, it's touched nearly everybody's lives."" The feelings Disney is able to evoke are incredible, she said. People who love Disney feel the perfection and happiness of the culture. ""And that's exactly what repulses other people; a 'plasticness' that other people find offensive. In a world that is increasingly crass and negative, it's a positive, predictable happy place. "" Everything in moderation . Brooklyn minister Ann Kansfield, 37, has a word of caution for parents keeping their children completely away from Disney -- or anything else. Her parents didn't take her to Disney theme parks because it would have been expensive to fly the family of four from Rochester, New York, to California or Florida. They were saving for other things. Kansfield doesn't remember wanting any Disney toys. ""I really just wanted to ride the rides,"" she wrote. ""I definitely realized by high school that I wasn't going there any time soon."" After a couple months of dedicated Superstorm Sandy relief work, Kansfield and her family were on a cruise with the chance to take a day trip to Disney World. ""I'm really thankful that my parents hadn't taken me to Disney before, because it made this trip extra special,"" she wrote. ""Plus, I did feel like a little bit of a Disney rebel -- finally getting to go. ""Parents can do everything in our power to limit our children's access to the Disney Industrial Complex, but even when we limit it, they'll find other ways to watch the shows, sing the songs and be involved with Disney-something-or-another. We choose to enjoy it together as a family in small doses, which seems reasonable.""","Disney represents magical stories and fun family to fans .

"(CNN) -- People have always known that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive. What is surprising, now that we have the data to compare societies, is how clear the effects of inequality are. A wide range of social problems are worse in societies with bigger income differences between rich and poor. These include physical and mental illness, violence, low math and literacy scores among young people, lower levels of trust and weaker community life, poorer child well-being, more drug abuse, lower social mobility and higher rates of imprisonment and teenage births. The differences in performance of more and less equal societies is often enormous: Most of these problems are between twice and ten times as common in countries like the United States, Britain and Portugal, which have large income differences compared to countries with smaller income differences like the Nordic countries or Japan. For example, taking high, medium and low inequality countries, the homicide rate in the United States in 2009 was 50 per million population compared with 18 in Canada and 5 in Japan. The police, prisons and public services needed to defend ourselves against these problems are expensive and often not very effective. But the underlying causal processes are fairly clear. The problems that get worse when there is more inequality are all problems that become more common lower down the social ladder within each society. TED.com: What explains trust and morality . Greater income inequality seems to amplify and intensify the effects of social status differentiation -- bigger material differences creating bigger social distances. So the most common trigger to violence seems to be people feeling disrespected and looked down on. Although social class imprints its effects on us from earliest childhood onward, greater inequality makes these effects more marked. But inequality does not harm the poor alone. The effects are so large because almost everyone is affected. The benefits of greater inequality are biggest at the bottom of society, but a number of studies suggest that a large majority -- perhaps 90% or 95% -- of the population benefits from greater equality. We cannot say what happens to the superrich because they are a fraction of 1% of the population and we do not have separate data on their health, violence or drug use. Because position in the hierarchy has always been important to well-being, we have an inherited sensitivity to social status that works rather like ranking systems among some monkeys. However, human beings have lived in every kind of society from the most egalitarian (such as the hunting and gathering societies of human prehistory) to the most tyrannical dictatorships. Where there is more equality we use more cooperative social strategies, but where there is more inequality, people feel they have to fend for themselves and competition for status becomes more important. TED.com: How we read each other's minds . Crucially important is the quality of social relationships. Because members of the same species have the same needs, they can, all too easily, be each other's worst rivals -- fighting for food, nesting sites, territories, sexual partners and so on. But human beings, as well as having the potential to be each other's most feared rivals and competitors, also have the opposite potential: We can be each other's best sources of cooperation, assistance, help, learning and love. Depending on our social relationships, other people can be the best -- or the worst. Of paramount importance in our social development was to avoid conflict and competition for basic necessities. That is why we eat together. It is also what the religious symbolism of communion is about. Whether society has great inequality and a strong status hierarchy, whether there is a strong sense of superiority and inferiority, tells us whether we are in the same boat together and depend on cooperation and reciprocity, or whether we have to fend for ourselves in a dog-eat-dog society. What matters is not simply adults' recognition of inequality and social status; it is also a matter of how the parental experience of adversity is passed on to children to affect their early development. The sensitive period in early childhood that shapes development exists in many different species. Its function is to enable the young to adapt to the kind of environment they will have to deal with. Among human beings, that is primarily a matter of adapting to the social environment: . Are you growing up in a world where you will have to fight for what you can get, watch your back and learn not to trust others because we are all rivals, or are you growing up in a world where you will depend on cooperation, reciprocity and mutuality? * * * .

"(CNN) -- Rachel Washburn once carried pompoms. Now she carries an M4 carbine. The military brat who became an NFL cheerleader is today a first lieutenant in the United States Army. On Sunday, she was honored as a Hometown Hero by the Philadelphia Eagles, the team she cheered for from 2007 to 2009. The Bronze Star recipient served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, including one as a member of the Army's new Cultural Support Program. It was a dangerous and stressful job, where she would go on missions with special operations forces and help search and talk to Afghan women and children. ""We could be their voice during missions for engagement to ensure security on objectives, and we could help search and secure the females and the children during missions,"" she told the Philadelphia Eagles website. Spoken like a true soldier -- which is not surprising given her father, Lon, served many years in the Army and Air Force as a pilot. Rachel Washburn, 25, said she learned during her Army training to think of a happy place when confronted by stress. For that, she liked to think of her first game as an Eagles cheerleader. It was a beautiful August day and she was lined up for the pregame dance. It is one of her best memories, she said. She also recalled fondly her trips to hospitals in Philadelphia and a USO trip to Iraq. Cheerleading is more than just dancing on the sideline and looking pretty, she said. ""We're all beautiful women who are there to be entertaining at games, but also, we are incredibly involved in the community, which is something that I am incredibly proud of,"" she told the Eagles. Washburn is not a Philly native. She said she is ""from a little bit of everywhere"" after having moved at least a dozen times while growing up. But she loved Philadelphia from her visits there and applied for an Army ROTC scholarship at Drexel University. She also joined the dance team. Her next steps took her to tryouts for the Eagles cheerleading squad. She made the team on her first try. After she graduated, Washburn joined the Army and went to Afghanistan, where near the end of her first tour she helped deliver a baby during a snowstorm while communicating with medical personnel by radio. She told USA Today that during her second tour she was a platoon leader of an intelligence unit. She is considering re-enlisting next year, she told the paper. Her father nominated her for the Eagles honor. ""I watched her go through two tours in Afghanistan and all of the things that she sacrificed,"" he said. ""It was not a very easy couple of tours and I just really kind of thought, 'Man, what a homecoming that would be if (the Eagles) recognized her for that.'"" She returned from Afghanistan in November and is stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia.","Rachel Washburn grew up with a military father and moved many times .

"SIMI VALLEY, California (CNN) -- Half of all U.S. Marine Corps units at their home bases are below the levels of required readiness, according to the new commandant of the Marine Corps. Speaking Saturday at a bipartisan national security conference at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Gen. Joseph Dunford said, ""Fifty percent of our units that are at home station today, they are at a degraded state of readiness."" Dunford said that includes ""equipment shortfalls, or personnel shortfalls, and the reason is because of the high operational tempo we have today."" The problem for the Marine Corps is that the units back home -- not already out on the front line -- are the most critical to have ready in a crisis, said the general, who took command last month. ""Units at home station are exactly the units that will respond to the unexpected. They will be the units to respond to a major contingency and those units are not at the level of readiness that we want them to be today."" Dunford said the major problem is the mandatory budget cuts as part of the so-called sequestration process. He noted that about two years ago the Marine Corps had been making progress in improving readiness from its previous rate of 60% of units not being ready to deploy. But he said ""increased requirements"" for Marines in high-threat areas such as the Middle East have caused the problem to grow worse again. ""The big issue is the ability to respond to the unexpected contingency or frankly some of the contingencies that we plan for. And the bench that responds to those contingencies is the bench right now that is suffering the greatest degraded readiness, "" Dunford said.","New commandant laments budget, stretched resources .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- Fujairah, one of seven emirates which make up the UAE, is putting new meaning into the saying ""build it and they will come."" As members of OPEC tussle with a 20% drop in oil prices since June -- and question if they should trim production at their November meeting -- the UAE is forging ahead with a crucial piece of its energy strategy. Sitting south of the world's busiest oil shipping lane, the Strait of Hormuz, the tiny emirate of Fujairah is emerging as a global energy hub. Mousa Murad, general manager of the Port of Fujairah, saw the area's potential in 1991, during the first Gulf War. A traffic jam of more than 200 tankers, triggered by concerns of bomb attacks, was lined up at the mouth of the Strait. Murad told CNN this was a ""light bulb moment"" for his team. ""We thought we should be thinking about how we can serve shipping as maritime services,"" he said, referencing the bunkering service initially offered. Today, the once sleepy emirate is doing far more than just loading fuel for ships. After Iran threatened to shut down the Strait in 2008, oil-rich Abu Dhabi decided to leverage Fujairah's strategic location on the Indian Ocean with unimpeded access to the seas to reach clients in Asia. China, Japan and South Korea are Abu Dhabi's top three importers of UAE crude. The game changer was a decision by the UAE government to build a $3 billion, 240-mile oil pipeline from Abu Dhabi's Habshan field into Fujairah, with a capacity of 1.5 million barrels a day. The pipeline, opened two years ago, can handle about half of the UAE's daily production. Thangapandian Srinivasalu, a 30-year veteran of the business and executive director of Gulf Petrochem, laid out the energy hub's potential while taking me through a map of the facility. Srinivasalu said Fujairah has something those in Asia and Europe don't: plenty of oil in its neighborhood. ""Unlike Singapore or Rotterdam, which are the leading ports, you are surrounded by crude producers, surrounded by refineries,"" said Srinivasalu. ""This is what interested us the most, and it's very peaceful."" Indeed, it is almost eerily peaceful. On a clear day, looking east from the balcony, one can see Iran. With rising demand from Asia, and two thirds of proven reserves sitting in the region, the UAE will continue to up the ante with more spending. By June 2016, the port is expected to be able to manage huge crude carriers known in the business as ""VLCCs,"" which handle two million barrels per load. Future plans include building a LNG import terminal to use natural gas to fuel power plants, saving the oil for export. Malek Azizeh, commercial director of Fujairah Oil Terminal, told me those investments are ensuring the expanding terminal is catching the attention of the energy industry. He points to, for example, the joint venture he is helping launch in December with China's Sinopec and Singapore's Concord Energy. ""All these things, add them up and it gives you a perfect scenario for somebody to take a step forward and get out of the usual thing and do something different,"" Azizeh told me as we toured the construction of the site's massive holding tanks. In an irony not lost on the executives, it was threats by Iran in 2008 which triggered this investment. If talks with Tehran over its nuclear program go well and sanctions are lifted, this expanding hub could eventually welcome Iranian crude.

"Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine and the European Union ratified a political and economic agreement Tuesday in a step leaders hailed as a ""historic moment."" The EU Association Agreement includes free-trade provisions, although they will not come into force until January 1, 2016. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to drop the agreement last year in favor of closer ties with Moscow triggered the popular unrest that led to his ouster, Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and months of fighting in eastern Ukraine. European lawmakers backed ratification in a vote in Strasbourg, France, while Ukraine's parliament voted at the same time in Kiev to approve the deal. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted afterward, ""355 votes for. EU Association Agreement has been ratified. Glory to Ukraine!"" Addressing his parliament before the vote, he said the Ukrainian people had ""reversed the express train going East"" toward Russia and thanked the EU for its support. ""This is an historic moment,"" European Parliament President Martin Schulz told EU lawmakers. 'Special status' Ukraine's parliament also voted Tuesday in favor of legislation that would give ""special status"" to rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions and grant amnesty to the separatists. A shaky ceasefire is in place between the pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces who have been battling for control of the region. The ""special status"" legislation applies only to the area of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions currently under the control of the separatists, according to the Ukrainian parliament's official website. The granting of amnesty will apply only after the separatists have given up their weapons, handed over all those being held hostage and ended their occupation of public buildings, according to the legislation. This, in effect, means disarmament must take place before criminal cases are dropped. The amnesty will not apply to those suspected of carrying out the July shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board the plane died. Rebels reject disarmament . However, Andrey Purgin, the first deputy Prime Minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, told CNN that the Ukrainian government in Kiev can forget about disarmament in exchange for amnesty. ""It will never happen,"" he said in a phone conversation. Purgin said the Donetsk rebel leadership considered the special status legislation as no more than a basis for future negotiations with Kiev, and felt under no obligation to accept its initiatives because it does not consider itself part of Ukraine. ""This was a decision of the Ukrainian parliament, not of our parliament,"" he said, adding, ""This law will not stop the fighting."" Purgin also said the legislation marked a step forward in one sense because it represented a partial acceptance by Kiev of the existence of the Donetsk People's Republic, whereas previously the rebels had been simply dismissed as terrorists. Under the new legislation, a vote for local deputies will take place on December 7, and a new ""people's police force"" will be created in that area. Also among the powers being granted are the right to use the Russian language rather than Ukrainian in all areas of public life, including public institutions, courts and education. Local authorities will take part in the appointment of prosecutors and judges, rather than the decision being solely in the hands of government in Kiev. There are many Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, which historically has had close ties to Russia. U.S. envoy: Road map to democracy . Moscow has made clear that it is opposed to Ukraine's pivot toward the West. But Western leaders -- who accuse Moscow of sending troops and military equipment over the border into Ukraine to help the pro-Russia rebels -- have welcomed the move. The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, said via Twitter that the ratification of the Association Agreement would provide a road map ""for building a prosperous, European democracy, grounded in rule of law/anti-corruption."" The decision to delay implementation of the free trade part of the agreement for more than a year followed talks Friday between representatives of the EU, Ukraine and Russia, the Kremlin said. The EU and United States have imposed economic sanctions against Russian interests over Moscow's intervention in Ukraine. Military exercises . Meanwhile, more than 1,000 European and American forces are engaged in training exercises this week in western Ukraine, far from the Russian border. The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, Sergey Naryshkin, opened a new autumn session Tuesday in which he warned that ""the updated version of the Cold War is becoming a reality nowadays."" He was critical of NATO, which has voiced its clear support for Ukraine, although the country is not a member of the defense bloc. ""By supplying Kiev authorities with weapons, NATO countries would be meddling with Ukraine's internal affairs and aiding in war crimes,"" he said. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Tuesday the deployment of ""a full-scale, self-sufficient"" military force in Crimea was a priority in light of current events in Ukraine, state news agency Itar-Tass reported. NATO issued a statement Tuesday condemning elections reportedly held in Crimea on Sunday. ""We continue to condemn Russia's illegal and illegitimate 'annexation' of Crimea and its continued and deliberate destabilization of eastern Ukraine in violation of international law,"" NATO said. ""We stand united in our support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders."" Pro-Russian Rebels release captive Ukranian troops .

"(CNN) -- The father of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who desperately needs new lungs told CNN on Wednesday night that the family was ""very excited"" after a judge's ruling that could help his daughter get a transplant. Sarah Murnaghan's father, Fran, said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360Ëš"" that his daughter, who has cystic fibrosis, has declined slightly in the ast two days. ""But we're very excited with the news today, that she will have the opportunity to be equally judged and have the opportunity to receive lungs,"" he said. On Wednesday, the family asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius from having the agency that oversees transplants apply a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants. The judge granted the injunction and ordered Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive the rule in Sarah's case. The injunction is valid for 10 days. Health and Human Services declined to comment ""on an ongoing legal matter,"" said spokesman Tait Sye. But a letter from Sebelius was sent to the organ network Thursday morning, directing them to comply with the judge's order. ""I understand that ... last night at 10:34 p.m. Eastern time, OPTN created a second candidate record for Miss Murnaghan with a birthdate that makes the system treat her as a 12-year-old,"" the letter says. ""I also understand her original record remains active, so she retains her priority for pediatric donors."" Sarah could die within weeks without a transplant, her parents have said. But they don't expect her to be moved to the top of the list. ""We have never, ever asked that Sarah get special attention or be placed in front of anyone more severe than her,"" her father said. ""So if there ... is another adult who is more severe, who has a higher lung allocation score, they will still get their lungs first."" Where someone is placed on the adult lung transplant list depends on several factors: blood type, distance from donor to potential recipient and a lung allocation score. The score is derived from medical factors like test results and the patient's diagnosis. Sarah's parents said her score is a 78. Anything above 60 is considered a high score, according to reports published on the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network website. Fran Murnaghan said Sarah was not aware of the specifics of her parent's quest to have the policy changed but was told about the judge's ruling that will help her. Dying girl's plight sparks fight over organ transplants . ""She is so strong,"" he said. ""It's amazing when you get to speak to her how strong and positive she is."" The Murnaghans had argued that since the number of children's lungs available through organ donation programs is so small, Sarah -- and other pediatric patients like her -- should be added to the list of people waiting for adult lungs, prioritized by severity of their illnesses. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, five children received lung transplants in the first three months of the year and 72 were on the waiting list. A spokeswoman for the United Network for Organ Sharing said the group was awaiting clarification from the court on the ruling. Two days ago, the Murnaghans asked Sebelius to change the rules. She has previously told the family that she doesn't have the authority to intervene in a particular case, but she also called for the policy review. Any change could take up to two years. Several lawmakers have urged Sebelius to act. Sen. Pat Toomey and Rep. Patrick Meehan, both Pennsylvania Republicans, co-signed a letter to the secretary saying in part, ""You have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for Sarah and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs."" Toomey issued a statement Wednesday saying he was happy the judge acted quickly. ""Now Sarah has a chance for a lung transplant, and I plan to keep fighting for her and others who deserve to be eligible,"" he said. ""As I've said all along, Secretary Sebelius should use her authorities to make medical need and suitability, rather than age, be the primary criteria in determining how organ donations are prioritized."" Meehan said he will continue to fight to have the ""arbitrary"" policy changed. The Philadelphia girl has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated. Adult lungs are far more available than lungs from children, and doctors have said they believe modified adult lungs might save the girl's life. CNN's Ross Levitt, Saundra Young, Chris Welch and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","Father says daughter has declined in past two days, but the ruling has them all excited .

"(CNN) -- Way back in the winter of 1982, I was a fifth grader at Lakeview Elementary -- and I was not happy. Because it was late in the year, and because I lived in a town, Mahopac, New York, with about six-and-a-half Jews, I was required by law to participate in the school's annual holiday concert. It was, for a boy who always felt resentful over having to spend December 25 inside Ming's Chinese Restaurant, the worst of the worst of the worst. Of the 11 songs we were told to sing, 10 were Christmas carols. Of those 10, seven or eight evoked either Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. Finally fed up, one day I swallowed my anxiety and approached Mrs. Hart, our fifth-grade teacher -- a woman who scared the living hell out of me. Jeffie: ""Ms. Hart, I have a complaint."" Ms. Hart: ""What do you want?"" Jeffie: ""I'm Jewish."" Ms. Hart: ""So?"" Jeffie: ""I don't think it's fair that there are no Chanukah songs in the concert."" Ms. Hart: ""Don't be stupid."" That was that. I put on my stupid white collared shirt and my stupid red tie, and when the special night arrived I crooned loud and proud about the miracle of Jesus Christ's birth. OK, admittedly I stood there and opened my mouth a few times while gazing longingly toward Lori Raffa. Later that evening, I told my father that I would never engage in such an endeavor again. ""Why?"" he said. ""What's the big deal?"" I was stunned. ""It is a big deal,"" I said, ""because these people act like Chanukah doesn't even exist. It's all Christmas, all the time, and we get no equal treatment whatsoever."" ""You're right,"" Dad said, ""and it's an absolute blessing."" It took me several years to grasp my father's thinking but, with 41 Decembers now under my belt, I agree 100% with his take: There's no better time to be Jewish than December. I know ... I know. Christmas is sooooo-o-o awesome. Presents! Ham! A tree! More presents! As a Jewish boy in a Christian town, I heard these paeans over and over and over, and I even used to believe them. Why, oh why, couldn't we celebrate, too? Then, one Christmas Eve Dad took me into the city to observe the madness. We entered Macy's (ground zero for 1980s holiday madness) with nary a care in the world, kicked back and soaked in the insanity. There were people fighting over the last Rubik's Cube and Cabbage Patch doll; folks nervously gazing down at their crumpled lists -- contained in their faces the looming stress of the emptying wallet, of the materialistic mayhem, of the pure, unadulterated holiday hell. ""Does this look fun to you?"" Dad asked. ""Um, no,"" I said. ""It doesn't."" ""Is this what you want Chanukah to be?"" ""No,"" I said. ""Definitely not."" We returned home, lit the menorah, belted out our off-tune rendition of ""Rock of Ages"" and exchanged the regular sixth- or seventh-night gift. Probably socks. Maybe a Hall & Oates record. My father is a quirky guy: a Brooklyn-born Jew who spent his childhood attending Hebrew school and avoiding bacon. If anyone has pride in his religion, it's Stanley Pearlman. And yet, Dad never seemed to mind Mahopac in all its Christmas splendor, or carolers standing at the front door, or the inane school concert. I'd moan and complain and cry, and he refused to flinch. His stance was a simple-yet-wise one: Enjoy it. Enjoy it all. Take an evening drive to see all the lights. Buy eggnog at the supermarket. Walk into Dennis Gargano's house and smell the pine needles. Study the ornaments, suck on a candy cane. ""I love Christmas,"" Dad has said myriad times, ""because it's not my holiday. There's no stress or pressure. You can embrace it without having to own it."" Hence, this past Friday I took my daughter Casey out of school for our annual New York City fun day. We roamed through Toys R Us and the Disney Store, watched the Macy's Christmas puppet show, walked past Santa's village. The decorations were nice and the lights, while blinding, were pretty. But everything was overcrowded and excessively hyped. The materialism was painful. The anxiety was palpable. ""This,"" Casey said to me, ""is pretty crazy."" ""No,"" I replied. ""This is fantastic."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman lived in a town with few Jews, and had to sing in the school's holiday concert .

"(CNN) -- For a year, journalist and author David Eimer traveled the edges of China exploring a side of the country that obliterates expectations. ""Most people are unaware of the sheer diversity of China in terms of ethnic minorities,"" says the former Beijing resident and China correspondent for the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. ""I met people who have blond hair and blue eyes and look completely European but are 100% Chinese in terms of upbringing and language."" The Chinese government officially classifies 55 ethnic minorities. During his travels through Yunnan, Tibet, Xinjiang and the Dongbei region, Eimer met many of them. These are people distinct from the Chinese majority -- the Han -- with their own languages, cultures and histories, who happen to be living within China's national borders. Eimer has collated their stories in his latest book, ""The Emperor Far Away: Travels at the Edge of China,"" published in July by Bloomsbury USA. CNN spoke with Eimer (now based in Bangkok) about his travels and China's ethnic minority communities. CNN: Why write this book? David Eimer: There are a hundred million people living in China who aren't Han. I wanted to go to those regions and give them a bit of voice. CNN: Your favorite place from your travels? Eimer: Deep south of Yunnan. It's got great food, it's not a politically sensitive area. Almost half of Chinese minorities live in the south of Yunnan. If you want, you can see Hakka villages, Dai villages and a fair number of tourists do go there for that. The Chinese like to think of Xishuangbanna [an autonomous prefecture within Yunnan Province] as their own Thailand. It doesn't have a coastline, but the food, language and climate are all similar to Southeast Asia. CNN: Any memories stand out from the area? Eimer: One of my favorite experiences was trekking through villages along the border with Burma and staying with families along the way. You just arrive and ask around, pay them RMB 50 ($8) and they'll say, ""sure,"" and you can drink rice wine with them. CNN: Which was the most difficult place to cover? Eimer: Tibet just because of the controls the government places on foreigners who go there. As a journalist you're not meant to be there, but it's not a problem for tourists. It's a stunning part of the world. You'll see scenery that you don't see anywhere else on the planet. (But) Tibetans are the hardest people to really engage with. You won't want to get them in trouble by asking sensitive questions, and a lot are scared by the heavy PLA and wujing (paramilitary) presence. The food is really bad. The hotels aren't really hotels, they're just like plain concrete-floor rooms with no showers. There was a space of 10 days where I had one shower. CNN: What was wrong with the food? Eimer: They can't grow vegetables so it's all imported. I love Chinese food but I have to say Tibetan food is my least favorite. It's dumplings or fried rice and a bit of yak meat if you're lucky, so yeah it grinds you down a bit. CNN: What was the appeal of Dongbei, China's northeast region? Eimer: It's right next door to North Korea and Russia and I don't think people realize that there's like a ""third Korea"" within China. There are a couple million ethnic Koreans living in Dongbei along the border, they are given leeway in terms of speaking the language and going to schools that teach in Korean. They are all watching South Korean soap operas and listening to K-pop and eating dog (a common North Korean dish) and kimchi inside China. Chinese Koreans are all from North Korea, but culturally they are South Korean, they haven't been cut off and isolated. CNN: Did you get to the Russian border area? Eimer: When you head toward Russia it just looks like Siberia. I was there in winter and the landscape is bleak, lots of snow and under-populated areas. I was interested in Manchus in this region. The Manchus were the only minority that ruled China in the past. I thought it was interesting to see their homelands and how they had been absorbed to the point of having only 100 people left who can still speak the Manchu language. CNN: Did you meet any Manchus? Eimer: The only genuine Manchu person I met was in Xinjiang, thousands of miles away from what was once the Manchu heartland. There's a specific ethnic minority in Xinjiang -- the Xibe -- who are closely related to the Manchu and who are the descendants of soldiers sent to guard the edges of the Qing Empire in the 18th century. Xinjiang is now the only place in China where you're likely to hear someone speaking an approximation of Manchu. In fact, although around 10 million people in China register themselves as Manchu, most are mixed Han and Manchu, a result of extensive intermarriage, so there are very few people left who are 100% Manchu. CNN: In the book you seem pessimistic about the Tibetan and Uyghur independence movements. Eimer: I'm pessimistic about Tibetans and Uyghurs gaining independence. To split the country is ultimate heresy for the CCP (Chinese Communist Party), it will never happen and they will do everything to prevent it. Sadly the situation now in Xinjiang and Tibet has gotten to the point where violent extremism is the way forward rather than reconciliation. You're not going to see Uyghurs sitting down in Beijing for talks. Giving Ilham Tohti life in prison sends the message: it's our way or no way. [A Uyghur economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, Tohti was found guilty of ""separatism"" and sentenced to life in prison by a Chinese court in September.] . The situation will only get worse. It will present really big challenges for the CCP. Are they going to effectively keep one-third of China's landmass under virtual martial law? CNN: Would you say Taiwan and Hong Kong are heading down a similar road? Eimer: What's happening on the fringes, you can include Hong Kong into that. Hong Kong is it's own place. It's not the mainland. In Xinjiang and Tibet, CCP rule is being challenged more and more, and the same goes for Hong Kong where (they're) doing it in a peaceful, nonviolent way. I think it's interesting that the pressures the CCP are getting are from parts of the country that were previously regarded as reasonably docile. They weren't prepared for Hong Kong people to stand up and say ""no"" and they have to be careful because Taiwan is looking very closely at what's going on in Hong Kong to determine whether One Country Two Systems will work for them. CNN: Some argue that China is already doing the best it can to keep an incredibly large country and population relatively united. Eimer: Managing China is insanity. How do you do it? I still think China is the most fascinating country in the world for many of these reasons. China is more like an empire. Managing China has always been difficult, which is why the book is called ""The Emperor Far Away."" CNN: What do you always travel with? Eimer: A Swiss army knife, notebook, pen and money or access to money, as well as passport, of course. Anything else you can buy along the way.","Journalist David Eimer's new book chronicles many of China's 55 official ethnic groups .

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker won re-election Tuesday, according to a CNN projection, positioning the conservative hero for a potential shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Walker held off a challenge from Democratic businesswoman and Madison school board member Mary Burke, keeping hold of the governor's office in a state that typically votes for Democratic presidential candidates. The race was largely -- once again -- a referendum on Walker. The Republican governor became a conservative rock star in 2010 when he successfully pushed a ""budget repair"" bill that stripped most state workers of their collective bargaining rights and slashed education spending by more than $1 billion. The cuts -- and the restriction of unions' power -- triggered weeks of protests in Wisconsin's Statehouse, followed by a move to recall Walker through a June 2012 special election. Walker survived, offering Republicans a massive confidence boost that their favored policies could be winners even in blue-tinted Great Lakes states like Wisconsin. His victory in the recall election also earned Walker a spot on short lists of 2016 GOP presidential possibilities. He's fallen back to earth since then, though, surviving accusations this summer of illegal campaign coordination but facing a much tougher than expected challenge from Burke, a Wisconsin school board member who is also a former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive and state secretary of commerce. She criticized Walker for signing into law bills that restrict access to abortions and legislation requiring state-issued photo identification to vote. She also pledged to restore state employees' collective bargaining rights. Walker complained in the days before the election that national Republican groups hadn't done enough to shore up the seat. He spent the campaign's closing days traveling the state with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- another possible 2016 presidential contender.","Wisconsin Republican Gov.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's parliament voted on Friday to do away with direct local elections in a move that critics say is a huge step backward for the country's fledgling democracy. Proponents of the law change, to scrap direct elections for mayors and governors, had argued local elections had proven too costly, and were prone to conflict and corruption. The bill was backed by the coalition behind losing presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto. But critics disagreed, and questioned the timing of the bill, first proposed in 2012, just two months after the election of Joko Widodo. Titi Anggraini, director of the Association for Elections and Democracy (Perludem), said that many were upset by the law change. ""I feel so disappointed. It shows how strong the opponents to democracy are. We are facing the biggest enemy of democracy."" The president-elect, universally known as Jokowi, has spoken in favor of direct elections. And his political party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), led the coalition that opposed the bill. But Widodo has yet to take office and his opponents currently retain the majority in parliament. Six of nine political parties supported the law change and most are part of the coalition that backed Subianto. ""Democracy has become too expensive,"" Fadli Zon, vice chairman of Subianto's Gerindra party, recently told a forum of journalists. Zon estimated the government would save about 60 trillion rupiah or $5 billion by eliminating direct regional elections. ""If the regional election is done by the regional house of representatives, it is estimated that the expenditure needed would only be the cost for tea and coffee,"" he argued. Critics say that the move will only benefit entrenched political interests. ""Electing Jokowi was one step forward, what happened in Parliament was five steps backwards for democracy,"" said political analyst Philips Vermonte, of Indonesia's Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""I think it's unseemly,"" said Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, a former minister under former president Suharto, and now senior government affairs adviser at Transformasi, a Jakarta-based think tank. ""It won't change the nature of politics, it won't make politics any cleaner. It will only shift the money politics somewhere else, to the oligarchs, and the victims are the Indonesian people,"" he added. ""Just when they were just enjoying their rights and seeing some good people rise, based on a constituency-based politics, they see the game being taken away from them."" Joko Widodo's rise . Widodo swept into power through the popular vote. He was first elected as mayor of Solo in Central Java in 2005 and then as governor of the nation's capital Jakarta in 2012. ""Direct elections are important because it is the fruit of the 32 years of Indonesia's struggle for democracy,"" student leader Mohamad Ivan Riansa told a small protest in front of the parliament building Wednesday. Under former dictator Suharto's 32-year rule, local leaders were chosen by political parties that won seats in local assemblies. After the fall of his regime in 1998, Indonesia launched a rapid process of political and electoral reform, involving a decentralization of power from the national government. In 2004, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became the first directly-elected president of Indonesia. A year later, voters were given the right to choose their own local leaders for the very first time. The massive democratic undertaking required elections to be staggered over five years throughout the country's 34 provinces and 511 districts or municipalities. Direct elections favored . A recent opinion survey by the Indonesian Survey Circle showed that 81% of Indonesians prefer direct local elections. But choosing local leaders was a relatively new and confusing experience for some Indonesians, taxi driver Nana Suryana told CNN. ""It's better for the local assembly to choose the candidates because they know better than we do. People might choose the wrong one,"" he said. While voter turnout had been declining since 2009, a new wave of politicians, including Widodo, energized a largely apathetic electorate this year, particularly young voters. ""Most of us abstained from voting before the presidential 2014 elections,"" musician Viddy Supit told CNN. ""We're now aware that we have to use our voices to develop our nation. That's why we're here to support direct regional elections.""","NEW: Indonesia's parliament votes to strip the right to directly elect local leaders .

"Billings, Montana (CNN) -- Fighting back tears, Auliea Hanlon sat on the witness stand in a Montana courtroom, just feet away from the man who pleaded guilty to raping her 14-year-old daughter -- and initially received a sentence that required him to serve just 31 days in prison. ""Here we are -- six, seven years later, still waiting for justice,"" she said, according to video of the sentencing from CNN affiliate KTVQ. ""He knew what he was doing. He knew what was going to happen to her."" ""And he didn't care."" Stacey Dean Rambold was accused of raping Cherice Moralez, a freshman in his business class at Billings Senior High, in 2007. Moralez committed suicide in 2010, before the case went to trial and before she reached her 17th birthday. The 55-year-old teacher pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent; last year Judge G. Todd Baugh handed Rambold a 15-year sentence with all but 31 days suspended. On Friday, Judge Randal Spaulding resentenced Rambold, this time to 15 years in prison, with five years of that suspended, according to a prosecutor in the case. Rambold was then handcuffed in court and taken to Montana State Prison. Rambold will get credit for the month he served behind bars earlier in the case, according to Yellowstone County prosecutor Scott Twito. Montana teen loved pit bulls, poetry before rape and suicide . The first sentence . Rambold was first charged in 2008, after Moralez confided in a church group leader. After the initial ruling, Baugh drew intense criticism for both the brief duration of his initial sentence and comments he made, which some said placed blame on the victim. Baugh said the victim looked older than her years and was ""probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant,"" according to the Montana attorney general's office. Montana's Supreme Court ruled that Baugh used an inapplicable statute to impose the original sentence and that a new judge would have to resentence Rambold. State Supreme Court Justice Michael E. Wheat wrote in ruling in April that Baugh's comments reflected an improper bias and ""cast serious doubt on the appearance of justice."" Baugh apologized for the comments but defended his initial sentence. Writing to a judicial review board, he said: ""I am sorry I made those remarks. They focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant."" Baugh told KTVQ in January that he would retire at the end of the year.

"Washington (CNN) -- Top White House and congressional negotiators failed to reach agreement Tuesday on a spending plan for the rest of the current fiscal year, bringing the federal government closer to a shutdown at the end of the week. Key Democrats rejected a Republican proposal to keep the government running for one more week at the cost of an additional $12 billion in cuts. Republicans, meanwhile, dismissed Democrats' insistence that there had been an agreement to cut $33 billion for the rest of the fiscal year. If there is no deal by midnight Friday, when the current spending authorization measure expires, parts of the government will close down. Later Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner met privately to discuss the matter. Statements issued by each of their offices described the talks as ""productive"" and said they agreed to continue working to find a solution. The budget brinksmanship showed the political stakes of the situation, with both parties trying to depict the other as unwilling to do what's right for the country. Republicans, under pressure from the conservative Tea Party movement for deep cuts that will reduce the size of government, blame Democrats for failing to pass a fiscal year 2011 budget last year when they controlled both congressional chambers and say that President Barack Obama and his party are ignoring the peril of the rising federal deficits and national debt. Democrats contend that spending cuts sought by House Republicans in response to the Tea Party movement pressure will harm economic recovery and slash education and innovation programs essential for continued growth. Obama and Reid, D-Nevada, both insisted Tuesday that Democrats are agreeing to more than 50% of the spending cuts sought by Republicans, which they said should be sufficient for a compromise on an issue that has little overall effect on the deficit and debt issues. Obama discussed the growing budget crisis behind closed doors at the White House with key House and Senate leaders. The president met with two Republicans, Boehner and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers of Kentucky, and two Democrats, Reid and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. The president then made an unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room to tell reporters that Boehner and Reid would meet on their own later in the day. Obama said that if the two men failed to make progress on their own, he expected them to return to the White House on Wednesday. And ""if that doesn't work, we'll invite them again the day after that,"" the president promised.  ""There's no reason why we should not get this done."" The administration will put in ""whatever resources are required in terms of time and energy"" to reach an agreement, Obama said. But what ""we can't do is have a 'my way or the highway' approach to this problem,"" he added. ""If we start applying that approach ... we're not going to get anything done."" Obama also said he could support one more short-term funding extension to avert a partial shutdown, but only if a deal is reached on spending for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. He and Reid rejected the GOP proposal for a seven-day extension that would include $12 billion in spending cuts while providing the military with funding for the rest of the fiscal year, but Reid added he would consider amending the measure if it reached the Senate in time for action before the current spending resolution expires. Reid also said House Republicans should start doing ""what the country needs, not what the Tea Party wants,"" noting the Democratic-controlled Senate rejected a House spending bill favored by conservatives that would cut $61 billion in discretionary spending this fiscal year. Democrats consider that bill draconian, complaining that, among other things, it would cut key programs for continued economic recovery while eliminating funding for others opposed by conservatives, such as Planned Parenthood and National Public Radio. Boehner, meanwhile, insisted House Republicans wouldn't let Senate Democrats and the White House put them ""in a box"" by forcing them to choose between a government shutdown or continued government funding with insufficient spending cuts. ""We want the largest spending cuts that are possible,"" said Boehner, R-Ohio. ""We're going to continue to fight for those."" Boehner also said he would not drop the GOP's insistence on including provisions relating to hot-button social issues such as abortion, calling them important to his conservative caucus. Democrats oppose the so-called ""policy riders"" in the spending bill. The speaker cast aside assertions by Obama and Reid that they had already given the GOP over half of what it initially wanted in terms of cuts, saying the Democrats were using ""smoke and mirrors to get there."" ""Our goal is to keep the government open,"" Boehner insisted.  ""We have no interest in the government shutting down, but we are interested in cutting spending."" As the potential for a shutdown grew, an aide to Boehner said the lawmaker also told House Administration Committee Chairman Dan Lungren, R-California, to issue guidance to all members on how the House would operate in the event of a government shutdown. Meanwhile, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management posted information about how a shutdown would affect federal employees on its website Tuesday. The posting said that most federal workers paid with funds appropriated by Congress will go on temporary furlough in the event of a shutdown. It would be up to Congress to decide if furloughed workers get paid for the work time missed when the shutdown ends, the posting said. Health benefits continue if the shutdown lasts for less than a year, it said. A senior Democratic source with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations said the biggest obstacle to a deal involves whether reductions in mandatory spending programs, known in appropriations parlance as ""Changes in Mandatory Spending"" or CHIMPS, should be part of spending cuts. Examples of mandatory spending programs include Pell grants, the Children's Health Insurance Program and some types of highway funding. Such programs are funded for multiple years at a time, with the spending set for the time period covered, exempt from congressional authorization each year. According to the senior Democratic source, the chiefs of staff to Inouye and Rogers negotiated throughout the weekend, and the gap between them is about $8 billion to $10 billion. Democratic sources said they want about half the overall cuts in this spending bill to come from mandatory spending programs, and that they have proposed the necessary reductions in programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department and Pell Grants. Republicans, who want any spending cuts to reflect a reduction in the size of government, note that reducing the spending in a mandatory program for one year doesn't prevent the amount from returning to its original level the following year.

"(CNN) -- Certain people exude such a powerful presence that they can absolutely captivate you within the very first moment of meeting them. When I was introduced to Bill Thomas at a conference, he was that kind of mesmerizing. A fortysomething, Harvard-trained doctor casually dressed in jeans and Birkenstocks, he took the stage and spoke passionately -- with an actor's eloquence -- about aging. He laid out a vast and ambitious plan for how America could transform the experience of growing older, of what it means to be well, and of how we care for people in their seventies, eighties, and nineties. He argued that the medical system, the elder-care system, and the nursing home system have to evolve: ""Aging should be conceived of as an era of continual growth and renewal, rather than a period of decline,"" he said. He had absolute clarity in every part of his argument, and his energy was both motivating and mobilizing. When I talked to him after his session, I asked, ""Bill, how do you describe your purpose in life?"" He answered, spontaneously and effortlessly, ""To bring respect back to elderhood in America."" In eight words, he captured his entire life's work. Bill reminded me that the first step in living your purpose is to distill it. This very act sets an accurate compass heading. It shapes your choices, tells you what is important, and helps you separate the merely interesting from the truly crucial. How to find your company's purpose . So how might you go about finding your purpose in a way that's as compelling as Bill's? How do you find a due north course for yourself, or your tribe, or your entire company -- a course that you may sometimes veer from, but that always draws you back to center? Over the years, I've worked with leaders from Apple, IBM, Nike, Facebook, and numerous other companies on making this journey. As we begin to imagine -- or reimagine -- the company's purpose, the process typically begins with looking at the intersection of several key truths: . - What does the world hunger for? What does it desire? What does it need or suffer from a lack of? - What are the unique talents of the organization? - Who has the company timelessly been? - And who must it fearlessly become? A company's purpose lies at the center of these four forces. To discover it, we incite debate, storytelling, self-examination, study sessions in the historical archives, musings about the future. We help leaders in these companies find what they truly care about. That work of introspection and getting to clarity is rarely easy. But it is almost always rewarding. Once defined, purpose informs a company's every move. It adds meaning and mindfulness to day-to-day operations and motivation that goes far beyond. How to find your personal purpose . What's interesting is that this method, which works so well for finding a compass heading for a company, also works for individuals. To define your personal purpose, start with these questions: . - How will the world be better off, thanks to you having been on this earth? - What are your unique gifts and superpowers? - Who have you been when you've been at your best? - Who must you fearlessly become? At the intersection of these four questions lies your personal purpose. The questions are deceptively simple, and you might be tempted to rush through them. To really do the task justice -- and to do yourself justice -- you have to peel away the layers of your self-conception. You have to get beyond that image you've made for yourself that you so strongly defend. And you have to get at what is actually true. The tension among your answers reveals as much as the commonalities. Lean into it. This process may take days. It may obsess your thinking for weeks. For some, it takes years to unfold. There is no magical timeline. Move at your own pace. The same process holds true whether you're a leader doing the hard work of articulating a purpose for your organization or you're an individual ready to live a more directed life. So let me return to my story about Bill Thomas. At the end of our conversation, he said to me, ""What would you say your purpose is, Keith?"" I thought about it a bit, then started to talk: ""I work with companies as they go through deep, formative periods of transformation. I work with CEOs to help mobilize people during those times of change. Along the way, I help them see things from new vantage points, and then help those institutions rise to the challenge ... "" I kept talking, but Bill politely interrupted. ""Keith, way too much! It doesn't sound like you're very clear about what your personal purpose is."" I was stumped. His reaction made me reflect. I consider myself a fairly self-aware and mindful person (don't we all?), and I thought I was pretty clear about why I've been put on this earth. But Bill pointed out something powerful. The work of introspection is put into action only once you've succinctly put your purpose into words. After leaving the conference, I spent a few weeks crafting what I believe my purpose is. ""To help people aspire, then be, great."" And then, coincidentally -- or perhaps there are no true coincidences -- 99U asked me to write this essay. Putting purpose into action . Once you've vocalized your unique purpose, how exactly does it play out? How do you put it into action? I like the way Richard Leider, one of the world's foremost experts on purpose, describes how to approach the next step. He defines purpose as being in the right place with the people who matter to you, doing your life's work. So the endeavor becomes, in Richard's words, to ""pack"" and ""repack"" one's life -- discarding ideas, thoughts, duties, old baggage about relationships, in favor of packing the things you truly need to be at your best in life. I am constantly humbled at how purpose drives the people and companies I admire: . Casey Sheahan served as the CEO of outdoor clothing pioneer Patagonia for a decade. In his post, he was responsible not only for the financial health of the company but also for charting its positive impact in the world. His personal purpose is about helping people live a mindful existence -- that is, to bring thoughtfulness and intentionality to their work and play. Meanwhile, Patagonia's purpose is to ""build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis."" With both his personal and business purposes aligned, Casey created a company culture that continues to make Patagonia the proof of concept for a different kind of compassionate business. Ask: How can your personal purpose align with your organization's purpose to create the conditions to do good in the world? Bill McDonough -- the sui generis thinker behind the cradle-to-cradle design approach -- demonstrates a commitment to his personal purpose of creating a sustainable planet in how feverishly he lives it out. He crisscrosses the globe. He's in China one day helping to build sustainable cities, and speaking to young architects about how to rethink energy efficiency on the next. One day he's with the CEO of Ford Motor Company discussing different kinds of transportation, and the next he's researching the chemical composition of building materials to create ones that are healthy for the planet. Ask: Can you live your purpose in a more all-encompassing way? Artist, architect, and activist Maya Lin's purpose shows up not only in what she makes but also in what she chooses not to make. She spends her time focused solely on the projects and causes that allow her to grow and contribute. She says ""no"" to the rest. Restraint and discipline come to those who are clear about their purpose in life. Ask: What does your purpose reveal about what you should stop doing? In the start-up realm of Silicon Valley, companies live or die by how quickly they move and act. But for Dave Morin -- one of Facebook's most impactful early employees and today the founder of mobile social network Path -- smart is more important than fast. In order to help his company live up to its purpose of creating technologies that bring us closer to the people we love, he has started a ""slow product movement"" -- a mindful practice that is not about speed of product development but the quality of the things he develops. Ask: What does your purpose imply you must be patient about? Purpose drives impact, impact rewards purpose . Purpose compels you to act. It brings into focus the things that matter most. I asked Bill Thomas how he's made so many strides in advancing his cause over the years. His response: ""I entertain the conversations, meetings, relationships that are most in line with my purpose over any other activity. Frankly, life is simply too short to fritter away your time chasing things that don't matter to you. Or to the world."" And here is the most interesting bit: The impact you have in the world also affirms your purpose. Impact justifies purpose. It fuels purpose. It empowers you to live your purpose more boldly every day. This is how everyday people can achieve extraordinary things. We listen to that purpose. We achieve things because of our purpose. And that in turn makes each of us hungry to live by our purpose even more. In our own humble way, this is how people become great. Will you take the next step? Will you invest the time to find your personal purpose? Will you gather your colleagues to define the purpose of your organization? In that move, greatness emerges.

"(CNN) -- When we last saw actress Amanda Peet during primetime, it was on NBC's drama, ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip."" Although that show was canceled after one season, Peet has kept busy in films mostly, booking parts in ""2012"" and ""Gulliver's Travels."" But she's also done a few one-offs in niche comedy shows like David Wains' web series ""Wainy Days,"" comedian Demetri Martin's sketch comedy show, ""Important Things With Demetri Martin,"" and a guest spot on ""How I Met Your Mother."" This week Peet returns to primetime with ""Bent,"" a half-hour romantic comedy from ""Scrubs"" vet Tad Quill. In it she plays Alex Meyers, a recently divorced lawyer whose wet-blanket approach to life is challenged by her active, surfer carpenter, Pete Riggins (played by David Walton). Rounding out the cast is Jeffrey Tambor (""Arrested Development""), JB Smoove (""Curb Your Enthusiasm"") and Jesse Plemons (""Friday Night Lights). CNN spoke with Peet from her home in Los Angeles about the ""Studio 60"" days, finding her footing as a comedic actress and the things that keep her up at night. CNN: ""Bent"" marks a proper return to network TV for you. Has the TV landscape changed, in your opinion? Amanda Peet: It seems like it's contracting, fewer and fewer jobs. It's hard to discern what's what, since I'm now a 40-year-old woman. Am I over the hill at the same time there's a recession? It's hard to decide what's what. There aren't many roles that are interesting if you're a 40-year-old woman, unless you're Julia Roberts or Cate Blanchett. CNN: Looking back, what was the issue with ""Studio 60""? Peet: I think it was too expensive and there was too much anticipation. I guess all together we seemed like this arrogant monolith, but individually, none of us felt very arrogant. So it's kind of curious. Including Aaron [Sorkin]. The backlash, the vitriol. If it had been some 30- or 35-year-old new discovery instead of Aaron Sorkin, things might have been different. CNN: In ""Bent"" you play an uptight, divorced lawyer. The crux of the humor rests on her being uptight. Do you think uptight people are funny? Peet: I do. Someone says comedy is rigidity. In a romantic comedy it's usually a good idea to have people who can't stand the fact that they are attracted to each other. CNN: Are you yourself uptight? Peet: Yes. Probably. My husband would say yes. I try to be really hippie about things. I'm uptight in all the ways that are really important, but the things my husband and family can benefit from my uptightness, I'm completely lacking. I don't clean, I don't make the bed. I spend my salary. I worry a lot. I just don't worry about socks on the floor. Plane flights, my children's well being, my sanity. There's this woman who walks on Wilshire Boulevard, in the same outfit. Tiny shorts, knee socks and this visor and a full face of makeup. She waves to invisible people. When I look at her, I slow down the car, I feel for her and I feel like I'm one little breathe away from that. CNN: Do audiences think of you as a comedic actress? Peet: I don't know. I certainly hope so. Hopefully they think that I don't blow. CNN: Recently, you've done these one off's with niche comedy shows like David Wains' ""Wainy Days,"" ""Important Things With Demetri Martin,"" as well as ""How I Met Your Mother."" What's your strongest suit in comedy? Peet: One needs good writings and there are many comedians that I'm friends with that aren't apart of the comedy scene; it's very hard to break in and be taken serious as a comedic actress. It just takes one good role and some eye traffic and that's hard to come by. Oftentimes you're just the setup for the joke. Like in volleyball -- set and spike. That involves some comedic skill, but it's also frustrating. On ""Bent,"" I really feel like Tad [Quill, creator] threw me the ball. If we get a chance to go, it would get funnier and funnier. If you take ""Cheers"" and ""Seinfeld"" and watch the early shows, they're kind of awkward. It took a while for the writers and everything to gel. ""Bent"" premieres Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.","Peet's last full-time TV gig was the acclaimed, short-lived ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip""

"(CNN) -- Sam Lamott, the baby star of best-selling author Anne Lamott's classic memoir, ""Operating Instructions,"" was finally grown up and safely ensconced at art school in San Francisco. Before Sam was born and during his childhood, Anne Lamott had developed a community of family and friends who had known and loved them during the lean years. She had written several notable novels and works of nonfiction. Now that Sam had moved out, Anne Lamott had the rest of her life to live. Surrounded by the love of her community, she had a wonderful home in Northern California with room for guests and dogs and an interesting professional and personal life. One day before Lamott's Thanksgiving dinner for 25, she got the call. Sam, only 19, told her that his girlfriend was pregnant. Or was it his ex-girlfriend? Sam and Amy had broken up a couple months earlier but clearly had continued to spend time together. They were keeping the baby. Jax Jesse Lamott was born on July 20, 2009. Lamott, who turns 58 on Tuesday, had famously recounted her first year with Sam in a memoir that validated all the joy and agony and terror foisted upon her during her child's first year, made more challenging by the absence of the would-be father. In a new memoir, ""Some Assembly Required: A Journal of My Son's First Son,"" Lamott (with Sam's help) recounts her surprise and acceptance at becoming a grandmother earlier than expected, her fears related to Sam and Amy becoming parents at such a young age and her daily celebration of her grandson's life. The book will debut Sunday on The New York Times best-sellers list. ""I was happy all the time at the thought of Sam's being a father, and my getting to be a grandmother, except when I was sick with fears about their future, enraged that they had gotten themselves pregnant so young or in a swivet of trying to control their every move, not to mention every aspect of their futures,"" she wrote. In a conversation with CNN.com, Lamott described her ongoing challenge -- a classic dilemma of the grandparent -- to contain her overwhelming need to advise Sam and Amy on every aspect of her grandson's young life. CNN: What was your fantasy of life as a grandmother? Anne Lamott: It would be 10 years later. Sam would be 29 and be the right age, young enough to have energy but old enough to have a fully formed cortex. He would only work four days per week because he would be so successful. I'd be really close to his wife. They'd come over, and we'd hang out. Or it would be horrible. They'd live 1,000 miles away, and I'd fly there all the time. I'd be 65. Everybody would be settled and successful. CNN: What were your fears given how young Sam and Amy are? Lamott: I was very calm when Sam first told me, but I'm one of those religious people who are afraid of everything. I'm instantly worried about everything that could go wrong. I thought, ""It's all over, it's hopeless. He's going to drop out of school, work as a janitor and live with me."" I feared Amy would move, that the financial strain would be enormous, that Sam wouldn't stand up and do the right thing and that he would drop out of school. It's the familiar story of young people dropping out of school and getting dead-end jobs. I had every scary thought. No matter what circumstances, it's hard to be a parent and maintain a sense of self and identity in the world. I don't have any romantic views of parenting. Every step of the way it's really hard. It's a dangerous world, physically and psychologically. CNN: How do you stop yourself from trying to control their lives? Lamott: I knew I'm a control freak and that I would want to manage their lives and be the third parent. I had to be very strict with myself and get help for my issues all the time. I could not say this was my kid, too. I would stop and say, ""Wait, why am I talking?"" Another woman, who had a grandkid when her daughter was young, told me, ""It's their dishes and their sink."" It's intrusive for grandparents to think they're in charge. It's manipulative. Also, it's self-destructive, since if the parents have to resist you, you won't get your mitts on the kid as often. Once they don't have to resist you, they want to be around you. I was the one with the credit card and the washer dryer. If I didn't crowd them and show up with my clip board, they'd call or come over and do laundry. CNN: Sometimes you have to speak up! What questions do you ask yourself before interfering? Lamott: Because I'm helping Sam and Jax financially, I'm bearing the bulk of the financial responsibility. I try to ask myself, ""Who says this is my business? Does this have my name on it?"" If something is urgent, my experience says it's probably not God talking. It's usually my self will and low-level hysteria. If there's any way I can postpone saying it, it dampens the urgency. Then I can probably talk to a friend. Left to my own devices, my first inclination is to mess in other people's lives. I secretly believe my whole family, and really the whole world, is my responsibility. But over the years, I've learned I can release people to their own destiny, and do the work that's ahead of me: writing for certain number of hours every day, teaching, church, friendships of 25 years, my dogs, our walks. CNN: What is a grandma's job? Lamott: My job of grandma is to keep the house safe for when Jax comes over. He and Sam usually come over on weekends, and I visit Tuesdays at Sam's apartment. I take up the slack. I'm the outdoorsy one who convinces everyone to take walks with me for owl prowls, not that we have ever seen an owl. I'm the chief librarian. There have been hard days since Jax was born, and it's also been the greatest blessing of my life. CNN: Now that Sam and Amy have split up, how does a grandma handle the breakup? Lamott: It's sort of the same thing. I have excellent ideas about how things should proceed now. I pray to God to keep one hand around my shoulder and one hand on my mouth. If anyone asks my advice, I give it to them. I'm trying not to manage their lives or custody decisions. It's between the two parents, who get to make 100% of the decisions. Sam recommends that if you've got a problem, go work it out in the mirror. I'll ask myself, ""What's going on? What's this really about?"" CNN: When Jax wants to run away from his supremely embarrassing parents, will he run to you? Lamott: All parents are an embarrassment to their kids. Often grandparents are the relief. Kids don't have to resist you. I've had the blessing of being someone that kids really love, so a number of kids have run away to me over the years. I always feed them, make them a cup of tea and take them for a walk. I'll do the same with Jax if the time ever comes. Then I'll sneak to the bathroom and call Amy or Sam on my cell.","Anne Lamott recently published a new memoir, ""Some Assembly Required""

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- A convoy of 280 Russian trucks headed for Ukraine, which Moscow says is carrying relief goods for war-weary civilians, has suddenly changed course, according to a Ukrainian state news agency. With thousands of Russian troops still posted near the Ukrainian border and Ukraine's military putting increasing pressure on pro-Russian fighters around the city of Donetsk, many in Ukraine and elsewhere fear that the so-called humanitarian mission is actually an attempt to smuggle supplies to pro-Russian rebels. ""Russia keeps inventing new excuses for their policy,"" Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, Danylo Lubkivsky, said Tuesday in Kiev. ""In Georgia, it was defending pro-Russian minorities. In Ukraine's Crimea, preventing NATO invasion."" The International Committee of the Red Cross contacted the aid convoy in the Rostov region, the organization said Thursday via Twitter. The group said it would discuss with Ukrainian officials how the operation will be conducted. The convoy was seen earlier in the day 25 miles from the Ukrainian border in the Rostov region, according to video shot and distributed by Reuters. If the trucks cross the border and before they reach the area controlled by separatists, they would have to be examined by Ukrainian border guards, a Ukrainian security official said. At that point, the convoy would be handed over to Red Cross representatives, the official said. The office of the Ukrainian counterterrorism operation said Thursday it could not confirm that the convoy has crossed on the Ukrainian side. The Ukrainian border service denied reports that the convoy had crossed from Russia. ""All responsibility for the safety of this convoy lays with Russia because it is controlling armed mercenaries there,"" Ukrainian national security and defense council spokesman Andeiy Lysenko told reporters in Kiev. The trucks had been expected to arrive at a checkpoint in Kharkiv on Wednesday but bypassed that route, according to the website Ukrinform. It's not clear what route the convoy will now take. ""In Donbas,"" Lubkivsky said, referring to the war-torn eastern region of Ukraine that includes the contested cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, ""they are trying to use the pretext of humanitarian aid and assistance."" Without offering proof, Ukrainian officials have even accused Russia of repainting military vehicles white to disguise their efforts. In Kiev, where many loyalties lie with the Ukrainian government, skepticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin's motive was rampant among residents. ""Normal people do not send guns to kill people and food for them to eat in the same cars,"" said IT specialist Igor Vlasenko. ""I think most Ukrainians want him to leave Ukraine alone. We can help ourselves."" And it's not just the Ukrainians raising concerns about a possible Russian Trojan horse. Red Cross flummoxed . In an interview Monday with Reuters, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen spoke of a ""high probability"" that Russia will invade Ukraine. ""We see the Russians developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation, and we see a military buildup that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in Ukraine,"" he said. Russia has acknowledged sending the convoy. In a conversation Monday with the President of the European Commission, Putin said his country was working with the International Committee of the Red Cross to deliver aid to civilians suffering as a result of savage fighting there. Except the Red Cross said at the time that it didn't know what Putin was talking about. Spokesman Andrew Loersch said the agency doesn't have any agreement with Russia on such a convoy. And Red Cross European operations chief Laurent Corbaz said Tuesday in Geneva that the agency hasn't gotten much clarity from Moscow about its purported role in the operation, including how the aid would be handed over and security guarantees for Red Cross workers. ""We said that we could be on board but that we needed to have some clarification first regarding modalities, practical steps that have to be implemented prior to a launch of such an operation,"" he said. Red Cross officials don't even know what's in the shipment, Corbaz said. According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, the shipment is bound for Luhansk and contains 400 tons of grain, 100 tons of sugar, 62 tons of baby food, 54 tons of medical supplies, sleeping bags and ""electrical power units."" At the opening of a Ukraine Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that ""Ukraine can receive humanitarian aid exclusively through the Red Cross and within international legal framework."" 'False pretense' But after an incident Saturday in which Ukrainian officials claim to have stopped a purported aid convoy accompanied by Russian troops, Ukraine has vowed to stop any ""uncertified"" aid convoy from Russia. In the Saturday incident, Ukraine's Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Valeriy Chaly told a Ukrainian television channel that the convoy was nothing more than a Russian provocation. ""Under a false pretense of agreement with the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ukraine, a humanitarian convoy of 'peacekeepers' was ready to enter the country, apparently in order to provoke a full-scale conflict,"" he said. U.S. officials have warned Russia against using aid as a means of wading deeper into the Ukraine conflict. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Saturday, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said Russia has no business delivering aid in Ukraine when international aid groups are better equipped to do the job. ""Therefore, any further unilateral intervention by Russia into Ukrainian territory -- including one under the guise of providing humanitarian aid -- would be completely unacceptable and deeply alarming,"" she said. ""And it would be viewed as an invasion of Ukraine."" Secretary of State John Kerry made a similar point with his Russian counterpart on Saturday, according to the State Department. While Western leaders have refused any suggestion that Russian acts could draw NATO nations into war over Ukraine, they do say it would lead to even stricter economic sanctions against Russia than those already imposed by the United States and the European Union. So far, Russian officials have shrugged off the sanctions. Rebels on the ropes? Moscow's decision to send the convoy comes as about 50,000 Ukrainian troops press forward with an offensive to rout rebel fighters from Donetsk. They have put increasing pressure on the rebel fighters, and Ukrainian officials say they expect to be able to fully recapture the city by Ukraine's Independence Day on August 24. The ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials that they called ""conservative."" The officials say the death toll has been on the rise in recent days, with reports of at least 41 killed and 143 wounded on Thursday alone. Hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in Ukraine or across the border in Russia, the United Nations says.

"Washington (CNN) -- A pandemic is one of the few things with the power to stop the global economy in its tracks. Dr. Larry Brilliant is confident that doesn't have to happen. After all, he was on the ground in Bangladesh to see the very last case of ""killer"" smallpox in the world. After 2-year-old Rahima Banu recovered following treatment, the World Health Organization declared the wicked disease was over in 1980. ""I'm the luckiest guy in the world,"" said Brilliant. ""There's nothing better than working in a program like that and to know that something that horrible no longer exists."" Speaking Thursday at the annual TEDMED conference in Washington, Brilliant made the case that several key actions will stop pandemics: early detection, early response and better cooperation among governments. Some 2,000 health professionals and thought leaders from all sectors of society are attending TEDMED at the Kennedy Center this week for a series of talks, which are also being televised in more than 80 countries. ""With all of these viruses, we have to isolate them locally and put them in jail. It's the only way to deal with a pandemic,"" said Brilliant, now president of the Skoll Global Threats Fund. ""Early warning systems are essential to protect us from the things that are humanity's worst nightmare."" ""A pandemic would have not just deaths and medical consequences, but also -- social disruption. There would be global recession and depression. Millions would lose their jobs. There would be no Internet and no flights,"" explains Brilliant. ""Would you get on an airplane with 250 people coughing and sneezing, when you knew some of them might carry a disease that could kill you? It would be apocalyptic."" SARS 10 years on: How dogged detective work defeated an epidemic . Early detection is working. ""In 1996, it took almost half a year -- 167 days -- to discover a potential pandemic. By 2009, it took only 23 days,"" says Brilliant. ""The question is, how can we make that better? If we can drive that number down to a few days, to just one incubation period, it may be 100 years before that virus has the same mutation -- maybe never."" Early response and treatment are making a difference too. ""Viruses are much more fragile than you think,"" he said. ""H7N9, now circulating in China, doesn't go person to person -- it has to go from birds or pigs to people. That makes it more complicated to spread. So things have to go just right for a virus to become a pandemic. That's why it's important to contain it in one country."" Just as the ease of international travel and the growth of global food supply chains help spread virulent new viruses, emerging technologies offer solutions to keep them at bay. ""We can find cases earlier with digital detection -- Web self-reporting, SMS, Twitter, social networking, blogging, Internet searches, online news and health reporting,"" said Brilliant, who was previously executive director of Google.org. In that capacity, Brilliant helped develop a search system to try and beat the timeline of the official flu outbreak reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It worked. ""CDC reporting requires a patient to see a doctor, the doctor to gather samples and the samples to be analyzed,"" explains Brilliant. ""It's a lot faster using crowd-sourcing technology -- a cellphone or a computer that simply asks a person, 'Are you healthy or sick?' "" Currently, there are dozens of nonprofit sites that track disease outbreaks in real time, including healthmap.org and instedd.org. ""Now, we really can see the flu coming and quickly know how to protect ourselves,"" said Brilliant. For decades, the WHO accepted information on potential outbreaks only through official channels -- via, for example, a health minister. In 2007, the rules changed. Data now flows in through government and independent reporting. Brilliant notes that some countries are going even farther. Through the recent launch of CORDS, a new entity bringing together regional disease surveillance networks, 28 different countries officially cooperate, sharing information to curb epidemics before they become pandemics. H1N1 death toll may be 15 times higher than previously reported . ""We have to enlist everyone's support,"" Brilliant said. ""We are all in this together. Polio and guinea worm soon will be eradicated -- and I hope to see a photo finish there. ""Eighty countries came together to end smallpox -- the disease that reigned for more than two centuries, killing pharaohs and kings, is completely gone. Today, we are finding diseases faster than anyone ever imagined. Innovations in early detection, early response and global cooperation can put an end to pandemics. We are closer every day.""","Larry Brilliant has been fighting outbreaks for more than 30 years .
He says early detection, early response and better cooperation are keys to ending pandemics .
""We have to isolate them locally and put them in jail,"" he says ."
"Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN) -- Shelling hit areas near two key cities in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, intensifying fears that a ceasefire that took effect less than two days ago may be falling apart. The fledgling truce between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels began Friday evening, and both sides were already accusing each other of violating it by Saturday. Sporadic artillery and machine gun fire rang out in the early hours of Sunday on the outskirts the strategic port city of Mariupol. A gas station was set on fire, and cars carried wounded civilians down the roads. Shelling and explosions were also heard near the airport of the flashpoint city of Donetsk on Sunday morning, the city council said on its website. In both cities, the source of the weapons fire wasn't immediately clear. The Mariupol city government said that pro-Russian rebels had carried out the shelling near the city overnight. It said one woman was killed and three people wounded. The Russian state news agency ITAR-Tass late Saturday quoted rebel officials as saying that Ukrainian forces continued to shell Donetsk and rebel positions near Mariupol. The RIA Novosti news agency reported that four Donetsk residents were killed in the shelling. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that the situation was calmer than before the truce, but that there had been a number of ""provocations"" by rebels. They included 10 instances of shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, he said. In a sign the government was still hoping to stick to the ceasefire deal, Lysenko said a prisoner exchange would begin soon, although he didn't specify a time or date. Does ceasefire in Ukraine have any chance of holding? 'So much confusion' Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels have been locked in vicious fighting in eastern Ukraine since April, leaving more than 2,200 people dead, according to the United Nations. The conflict has triggered a humanitarian crisis in the region, where shelling has destroyed homes and infrastructure. Nationwide, more than a million people have been displaced from their homes by the fighting, most of them in the East. One old man in Mariupol shook his head gloomily when asked if he thought the ceasefire would last. ""There is so much confusion,"" Gennady Andreyavich said. ""We really don't know what will happen, because when people say we must live in a united Ukraine and we see at the same time Ukrainian forces in retreat -- what should we think?"" Ukrainian forces and the rebels have engaged in fierce fighting over the past week in the territory between the Russian border and Mariupol. A previous unilateral ceasefire declared by the Ukrainian government in June broke down after 10 days. Poroshenko and Putin talk . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the signing of the ceasefire deal in the Belarusian city of Minsk, Poroshenko's office said Saturday in a statement. The leaders agreed that the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has been mostly upheld and they discussed further steps to make the truce last, the statement said. Some areas at the heart of the conflict reported that calm was prevailing. Luhansk city council said that Saturday was the first day in over a month with no shooting. The city office has started working on repairs to the power and water supply. Russian warning over sanctions . In spite of the ceasefire agreement, Putin remains under pressure from the West over Russia's actions in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and the West accuse Moscow of supporting the rebels with weapons and fighters -- allegations that Moscow has repeatedly denied. Hours after the truce went into effect, EU leaders meeting in Brussels, Belgium, agreed on a new round of economic sanctions against Russian interests. They are due to be formally adopted on Monday. Earlier last week, Poroshenko hinted at other ways that the West might aid Ukraine. At a news conference during the NATO summit on Thursday, Poroshenko said Western powers assured him that the possibility of lethal aid was on the table, in addition to nonlethal aid. ""As a result of our bilateral consultations, almost every country stated its assistance to Ukraine,"" Poroshenko said. ""First and foremost, this concerns military and technical cooperation, both nonlethal and lethal weapons, including precision guidance weapons."" The United States, France and other NATO allies have not independently confirmed whether lethal aid is an option. Russia's Foreign Ministry warned Saturday that if new EU sanctions are imposed, Russia ""certainly will respond,"" ITAR-Tass reported. Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Ukrainian militias and rebels of carrying out war crimes. The human rights group singled out Russia for a buildup of armor and artillery in eastern Ukraine. Putin has voiced sympathy for the rebels, many of whom are ethnic Russians. But he denies that Russia has armed and trained the rebels, or sent its troops over the border.

"Editor's note: This post was created for your reading pleasure as a collaborative effort between the editorial staffs of BuzzFeed and CNN. (CNN/BuzzFeed) -- In some ways, it has been a pretty tough year for America -- and a year for tough Americans. The year started in the shadow of the Sandy Hook school shooting.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- One month after Malaysia Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine, government military forces there said they've made advances Sunday against pro-Russian separatists. Ukrainian forces regained control over the strategic town of Yasynuvata in Donetsk in the southeastern part of the country, according to the official Twitter account of President Petro Poroshenko. They've also made gains in Luhansk in the eastern part of Ukraine, government forces told CNN. The Ukrainian army has entered Donetsk and raised the Ukrainian flag in front of the district's police offices, said National Defense and Security Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko. Yet the site of crash MH17 is still unsafe as fighting near it rages, officials tell CNN. Most investigators left Kiev this week but small teams from several countries remain in Ukraine on standby. For now, the search is officially suspended. All 298 people on the Boeing 777 were killed when it crashed near the Russian border in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian and U.S. officials have alleged that a Russian-made missile system was responsible for shooting the aircraft down. The separatists and Russians deny that. And while hopes diminish for answers about MH17, thousands of people in the region have no access to water, electricity and proper medical aid, humanitarian agencies have said. The Donetsk water supply was turned off temporarily after the city's water treatment facility stopped operating because ongoing fighting downed power lines. The Donetsk City Council announced on its website that the water supply would be cut off starting at 9 p.m. local time on Sunday (2 p.m. ET). Ukrainian officials acknowledged Sunday that a convoy of more than 260 Russian vehicles on the border is, in fact, carrying humanitarian aid, a statement on the Ukrainian Cabinet website said. The convoy initially sparked fears that Russia was trying to use a humanitarian convoy as a cover for sending in more aid and weapons for pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Aid delay likely . But there could be a hold up on the delivery of that aid. Ukraine received an inventory of the supplies Saturday, which was signed by the head of the regional International Committee of the Red Cross delegation to Russia. Pascal Cuttat says there are still ""basic technical details"" that need to be discussed. The convoy's inspection will not happen Sunday, said Victoria Zotikova, a spokeswoman for the ICRC. Zotikova added that the aid agency is missing security guarantees from all sides. Moscow says the trucks contain grain, sugar, baby food, medical supplies and sleeping bags -- a claim that Kiev initially doubted. The Ukrainian-recognized governor of Luhansk, Irina Verigina, said that she doesn't want aid from Russia. Ukraine says it is distributing its own aid through the Red Cross. ""They send us tanks and Grads (rocket-launching vehicles) overnight and offer to send humanitarian aid by day,"" Verigina said. Ukraine: We destroyed most of a Russian convoy . Ukraine claims its artillery destroyed much of a military convoy that crossed from Russia into Ukraine last week, an incursion that two British newspaper journalists say they witnessed. If true, Ukraine's account and the British reports appear to give credence to what Kiev has long alleged -- that Russia has been sending troops and arms into eastern Ukraine. A diplomatic row was brewing Friday over the reports, with the United Kingdom's foreign office summoning Russia's ambassador in London to explain the incident. Russia's Foreign Ministry has denied any such incursion, and its foreign minister will meet in Berlin with his counterparts from Ukraine, Germany and France on Sunday, state-run news agency RIA-Novosti reported. The meeting's agenda wasn't immediately released. Those concerns took on a new light when British media outlets The Guardian and The Telegraph reported that armored personnel carriers, along with other vehicles with Russian military plates, crossed the border near Donetsk. The Guardian reported that it witnessed 23 armored personnel carriers, in addition to other vehicles with Russian military plates, cross into Ukraine through a gap in a barbed wire fence. ""Armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into Ukraine,"" the Guardian report reads. This is the first time foreign media recorded such an incursion, though it illustrates what Kiev has said has been happening for months -- that Russia has been sending troops and equipment to help the rebels, said Lysenko. Poroshenko told British Prime Minister David Cameron that Ukrainian forces destroyed ""the majority"" of the Russian vehicles, Poroshenko's office said. Poroshenko ""expressed concern over the situation on the border, particularly over the fact that the inflow of Russian arms and military machines in Ukraine through the open part of the border continued,"" his office said. Lysenko said he didn't know exactly how many vehicles crossed the border, or how many Ukraine's artillery managed to destroy. Battle rages on . A Ukrainian fighter jet was shot down on Sunday in the Luhansk region, Leonid Matyuhin, the spokesman for Ukraine's counter-terrorist operation, told CNN. The pilot managed to eject and is safe, Ukrainian state media reported. The ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with by political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials. The United States and the European Union have applied steadily increasing sanctions against Russian officials, banks and other interests since March, when Russia annexed the Black Sea Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia's move came a month after Ukraine's parliament ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych left office after violent protests against his government in the capital, Kiev. Those protests were motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. Aid or invasion?
