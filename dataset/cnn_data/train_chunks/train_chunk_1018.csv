"They represent materialism  to the extreme. So fittingly, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spare no expense when it comes to their daughter North. The 16-month-old lives a life of luxury most people - children and adults alike - could only dream of, and new details have emerged of just how extravagant her lifestyle really is. Scroll down for video... Little Princess: New details have emerged of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North's lavish lifestyle, pictured last month in Paris . According to US Weekly, the tot has over 200 pieces of designer clothing that she's never worn. Items in her closet include a $375 silk Oscar de la Renta dress, a $200 leopard viscose frock from Roberto Cavalli, an Alexander Wang leather dress, and Giuseppe Zanotti custom-made shoes. 'Kim and Kanye are grateful when designers send them some pieces,' a source told the magazine. 'North loves clothes and getting ready to go out. It's a lot of fun.' In addition, North is also the owner of some pricey bling, most notably half-carat Lorraine Schwartz studs worth 'well over $50,000,' said the insider. Designer baby: North allegedly owns over 200 items of clothing, including this Alexander Wang leather frock . Proud momma: Kim regularly posts snaps of the luxury items given to North by her famous friends . The couple also ensure North's surroundings are similarly lavish. Although North has lived mostly at the Hidden Hills, California house of her grandmother Kris Jenner (known as 'Lovey' to the little girl), the couple just purchased a $20 million mansion down the road, replete with a walk-in closet just for North. Her current playroom, meanwhile, contains 'tons of dolls,' said the source. 'She loves to push them in strollers.' Only the best: Kim allegedly keeps 'at least' five strollers - including the $940 Orbit Baby G2 Travel System - in key locales around the globe, the couple pictured last month in Paris with their Urbo2 pushchair from Mamas & Papas . Mini style maven: Nori sat front row with her famous parents and grandmother Kris Jenner (aka 'Lovey') at the Givenchy show during Paris Fashion Week last month . Somber note: Kim and Kanye allegedly are only dressing North in black at the moment . North has already clocked up more air miles than most children, and her parents make sure to maintain her luxurious lifestyle wherever they are. According to the publication, Kim keeps 'at least' five strollers - the $940 Orbit Baby G2 Travel System - in key locales around the globe. 'She has one in Paris and New York, and she keeps one at her sisters' houses,' said the source. To take things a step further, Kim and Kanye make sure North's all-white nursery, including her $3,950 crib, 'is replicated wherever they stay.' 'All of North's stuff is always waiting at the location they're traveling to,' said the source. During the family's recent trip to Paris Fashion Week, North and her nanny allegedly had their own penthouse suite at the Le Royal Monceau hotel. North also had her own chef during the stay. 'They use a local caterer to bring in food for North while she is in Paris. Kim likes Nori's food to be all organic.' Bringing up baby: Kim and Kanye make sure North's all-white nursery, including her $3,950 crib, 'is replicated wherever they stay' Fit for a princess: Apparently all of North's things are always waiting at the location the family travels to . But North may soon have to share the spotlight with a sibling, if Kim has her way. 'Kim wants to be pregnant now,' said a source. And apparently Kanye is hoping for a boy the second time around. Said the insider: 'He wants an heir to his throne.' No expense spared: Kim and Kanye treated their little girl to an extravagant 1st birthday party in June modeled on the music festival Coachella .","The 16-month-old has 'at least' five strollers worth nearly $1K each .

"These creepy photographs log how America celebrated Halloween from 1875 to 1955, covering a period of time where the nation rebuilt itself after the Civil War and turned into a global superpower. The macabre images show families celebrating Halloween dressed in a variety of home made customs featuring the devil, ghouls and various creatures from the other world. Popular themes include devils, witches and animals. Scroll down for videos . British artist Ossian Brown has collated the wonderful collection of Halloween photographs from 1875 to 1955 . The images show the great imaginations of children and adults when it came to celebrating the ghoulish event . Even these children dressed as clowns look remarkably sinister with their serious faces . The earliest images come in the years while America was rebuilt following the end of the Civil War in 1865. The pictures were collated by English artist Ossian Brown for his book Haunted Air. He said: 'I find their haunting melancholy completely absorbing; all of these photographs now torn out, disembodied and forgotten - they've now become fully and utterly the masks and phantoms they dragged up as, all those years ago.' Brown was fascinated by the creativity of people who were living in poverty, but still managed to create 'incredible and phantasmagorical apparitions'. David Lynch, who wrote the foreword of the book, said: 'All the clocks had stopped. A void out of time. And here they are – looking out and holding themselves still – holding still at that point where two worlds join – the familiar – and the other.' These children appear to be dressed as some form of rabbit or hare which are not known as October animals . These three girls form the 1956s show the beginning of commercialisation with shop-bought costumes . These two children are clearly dressed as witches with masks in an area with some snow on the ground . This woman is wearing a mask but car enthusiasts might recognise the Ford Model T beside the house . One of these people is wearing a mask while the second is wearing a ghoulish sheet with holes cut for eyes . This teenage girl looks like she could easily audition for the next installment of the SAW slasher franchise . If the zombie apocalypse hits and these four people arrive at your door it might be time to run to the safe room . This family looks like the inspiration for a late-night version of the Muppets . This teenage boy is wearing  a sinister skull mask with small hat but it is his large spike which adds menace . These young children again look like they could quite easily appear as an extra in a horror movie .","The images cover a period from 1875 up to 1955 tracking Halloween trends .

"Last month science illustrator Eleanor Lutz brought us stunning graphics showing how animals fly. And now she’s at it again with amazing illustrations showing how different animals breathe. The fascinating animations show the direction oxygen and carbon dioxide travel in different animals to supply their body with oxygen. A Seattle-based designer has created animations for animals breathing. They show how oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported. The animations reveal how humans have a two-way system for air. But birds have a one-way system (shown), which lets them get 'fresher' oxygen. Credit: Eleanor Lutz . According to the Seattle-based designer the graphics contain ‘actual science’ in showing how animals breathe. ‘I picked three species that I thought were particularly awesome,’ Ms Lutz writes on her website. ‘The topic really lends itself to a short looped GIF so that was an added plus.’ In the animations she revealed that animals have three different ways of breathing. The first example uses the example of human lungs to explain how all mammals breathe. It shows that humans inhale by moving their diaphragm to. This lowers the air pressure in their chest and pulls air into the lungs. The process of breathing draws oxygen into the respiratory system through the mouth and nose. Air sacs in birds allow air to flow in just one direction through their lungs, known as ‘unidirectional’. This means that air coming through the lungs is mostly fresh and has a high oxygen content. In mammals air flow is ‘bidirectional,’ which means it moves back and forth into and out of the lungs. This means air in a mammal’s lungs is mixed with ‘old air’, which has less oxygen. For this reason, birds are able to fly at a higher altitude than mammals as they can get more oxygen from the thin air. Source: Gary Ritchison . Inhaled oxygen passes into the alveoli in the lungs and ultimately diffuses into our blood, which allows cells to produce energy. For carbon dioxide the opposite process occurs, with it being pumped out by our lungs. In birds, the process of attaining oxygen is somewhat different, as illustrated in the graphic below showing a chicken as an example. Rather than using a diaphragm, air is moved in and out using pressure changes in air sacs. These air sacs are used to store and pump air through the stationary lungs. Muscles in the chest changes the pressure in the sacs, allowing them to draw air in and out. But in birds, air only flows in one direction, so they take in oxygen even when exhaling. In simple terms, birds basically breathe in and out at the same time, to make breathing during long flights require minimal effort. This structure also means they can breathe at much higher altitudes than humans. According to the Seattle-based designer the graphics contain 'actual science' in showing how animals breathe. 'I picked three species [shown] that I thought were particularly awesome,' Ms Lutz writes. 'The topic really lends itself to a short looped GIF so that was an added plus'. Credit: Eleanor Lutz . The final animal Ms Lutz looks at is the grasshopper, which transports air around its using tracheal tubes. Here the grasshopper is used as a representation of all insects. They do not have lungs, and instead pump their abdomens to change the volume of their air sacs. However saying insets ‘breathe’ is a bit of a misnomer as without lungs oxygen is not transported around their circulatory system. Instead, they use the tracheal system of tubes to move gas around their body. When air reaches a small tube called the tracheole, the oxygen dissolves into the tracheole liquid. Through diffusion it then enters cells, with carbon dioxide moving the other way. Using muscle contractions, insects can then control their respiration to a limited degree. Air sacs in birds (stock image shown) allow air to flow in just one direction through their lungs, known as ‘unidirectional’. This means that air coming through the lungs is mostly fresh and has a high oxygen content . Last month Ms Lutz created animations to show different flight techniques in animals. Each is composed of 15 frames based on traced body positions of the animals from slow-motion videos. Specific points on the wings were then marked at each of the 15 frames and connected using imaginary curves. This creates the sweeping arcs of colour seen, which track the motion and direction of the wings as they move. They reveal how different animals fly with a different profile, and also how wings cope with animals of different sizes. Ms Lutz explains that she used a programme called Matlab to create the animations, based on previous work she performed with larvae.

"This warm, sunny autumn, you have probably gone far longer than usual without a thick coat or woolly jumper. Good news for most of us – but, it seems, a disaster for high street giants such as Next, which yesterday issued its first profit warning for nearly 20 years. It’s all down to the unseasonably high temperatures, which have hit demand for winter clothing hard, the retailer said. Next has issued its first profit warning in nearly 20 years as unseasonably high temperatures have hit the demand for winter clothing . The admission spells trouble for struggling Marks & Spencer, which is due to release its latest figures on Wednesday next week. Its chief executive Marc Bolland is under intense pressure to show that its new autumn/winter ranges have struck a chord with shoppers. Next said that sales in September and October were far poorer than predicted and cut its expectations for the Christmas trading period. It said profit for the full year could be £25million lower than expected. Chief executive Lord Wolfson said: ‘It is difficult to explain how the same range that was up in August was down two weeks later – no range is ever perfect, there are always things that can be improved, but this would suggest it was the weather. What we have lost, now even with cold weather we won’t pick up.’ Temperatures soared this week, with forecasters saying the Indian summer could make 2014 one of the hottest years on record. The admission by Next also spells trouble for Marks & Spencer, which is due to release its latest figures next week . James McGregor, of consultants Retail Remedy, said last night: ‘Next, like many of its competitors, is feeling the effect of the unseasonably warm weather. Later this week temperatures are set to hit 20C in some areas of the south. It’s hard to sell an autumn or winter range in that kind of weather.’ He added that Next was ‘extremely resilient’, however. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ‘If Next has been mildly discomfited by the amazingly mild October weather, we suspect that the likes of M&S and Debenhams have had bigger problems.’ David Alexander, a consultant at retail analysts Conlumino, said: ‘Retailers often point to the weather as a means of explaining away poor performances. ‘In the case of fashion retailers attempting to convince consumers to invest in the latest cosy pieces from their autumn/winter collections, though, unseasonably warm weather at this time of year can inevitably have a significant impact on demand.’ Freddie George, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ‘Our view is that the current slippage is completely due to the mild weather. The underlying trend for consumption remains positive.’ He added: ‘It does appear, however, that we are seeing more extreme weather patterns.’","High Street giant Next has issued its first profit warning for nearly 20 years .

"Hillsong Church senior pastor Brian Houston accused a child sex abuse victim of tempting his father Frank, a royal comission into institutional paedophilia heard. The hearing was also told evidence would be given about a meeting at McDonald's in Sydney's north between Frank Houston and the victim, known as AHA, where the church leader asked for forgiveness and allegedly offered $10,000 and passed him a napkin to sign. AHA told the commission Frank Houston would stay with his family when he came to Sydney from New Zealand in the 1970s. Scroll down for video . Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston (pictured) said his father Frank Houston had confessed to abusing a seven-year-old boy decades earlier . Hillsong, in Sydney, was created when separate churches run by father and son merged under the leadership of Brian Houston . AHA was seven when Frank Houston would come to his room, lie on him, fondle him and masturbate him, he told the commission. 'I would wake up petrified and I would stay very still,' he said. He said the abuse left him feeling ashamed, and he now suffered depression. AHA said his family was very involved in the church, and when he eventually told his mother in 1978 she told him he did not 'want to be responsible for turning people from the church and sending them to hell'. Frank (pictured) asked for forgiveness from the victim and allegedly offered them $10,000 in a McDonald's restaurant . He said the Houstons 'were considered to be almost like royalty' in the circles in which his parents moved. The witness said when, in 1998, his mother told another church pastor of the abuse, Frank Houston apologised. Houston later offered $10,000 as compensation and AHA was asked to sign a 'food stained' napkin at a meeting they had in a McDonald's restaurant. He was told if there were any problems to contact Frank or Brian Houston. He said after two months he rang Brian and said: 'What is happening with the money I was promised? I agreed to forgive your father.' AHA said Brian Houston said ""'Yes, OK, I'll get the money for you. There's no problem. You know it's your fault all of this happened. You tempted my father"".' AHA said he replied, 'Why, did he molest you also?' He said Brian got very angry after that. 'He slammed the phone down with words to the effect ""You'll be getting money"".' While acknowledging AHA's courage in appearing at the commission, Brian Houston rejected the claims that he accused him of tempting his father. 'I disagree with his perception of the phone call with me and I strongly refute that I - at any time - accused him of tempting my father. I would never say this and I do not believe this,' he said in a statement made outside the commission. 'At no stage did I attempt to hide or cover up the allegations against my father.' Earlier on Tuesday, the hearing was told of a special executive meeting of Pentecostal churches was held at the Qantas Club at Sydney Airport in 1999. The meeting heard Frank Houston had confessed to abusing a seven-year-old boy in Sydney decades earlier. The information was conveyed by Brian Houston, a senior pastor at Hillsong Church and who was at the time president of the Assemblies of God (AoG) - the affiliation of Pentecostal churches which investigated complaints against ministers. Counsel assisting the royal commission Simeon Beckett said the commission would hear 'no allegations of child sexual abuse' against Frank Houston were referred to police and 'no civil proceedings have been commenced in Australia'. Brian Houston was told of the allegation in May 1998, and later told Pastor Barbara Taylor he was in 'shock'. Pastor Taylor would tell the inquiry Brian Houston said his father had admitted to a lesser incident and he would be stood down from preaching, Mr Beckett said. The minutes of the December 1999 executive meeting at the Qantas Club would show AHA did not make a formal complaint, but that Frank Houston had confessed, Mr Beckett said. The minutes also noted Frank Houston was already suspended and it was agreed he be invited to enter the 'AoG restoration program'. Frank Houston was fired by his son from all church roles in 2000. Hillsong, in Sydney, was created when separate churches run by father and son merged under the leadership of Brian Houston. Frank Houston died in 2004 at age 82. Further allegations against him have come to light since his death. The charismatic preacher had been a Salvation Army officer in his native New Zealand before founding his first ministry at Lower Hutt near Wellington in 1960. The commission will also hear of allegations against two other men and will be looking at the response of the ACC to those allegations. In a statement issued when the inquiry was announced Encompass Church pastor John Spinella said the church, based at Bundoora, Victoria, welcomed the inquiry. 'As a church we have recognised these past failures and take the opportunity to apologise for the suffering and pain endured by those who were abused,' he said. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Royal commission hears evidence from AHA, a victim of paedophile pastor Frank Houston .

"The FBI are closing in on American ISIS executioner after a wave of 'substantial leads' following a public appeal for help in identifying him. The unknown man, who has appeared in a propaganda video released by the terror group, is believed to be from the United States because of his pronounced American accent. Today a senior FBI official told ABC News that new leads possibly included a man with a 'North American' accent who appeared in the clip. Scroll down for video . The FBI are closing in on American ISIS executioner after a wave of 'substantial leads' following a public appeal for help in identifying him . 'The FBI tips website that was announced yesterday has received a substantial number of web visits, some of which have generated leads,' another FBI official said earlier today, reports ABC News. 'We continue to call on the public to report suspicious activity of travelers in support of a terrorist organization or information about the subject speaking with a North American accent in the video issued by ISIL on September 19. The Bureau hopes that somebody watching the video may recognize the terrorist. Agents uploaded their own cut of the video, which skips the graphic and violent portions of the 55-minute original, entitled The Flames of War. But it does show the American figure, wearing a black mask and combat fatigues, boasting over captives whom he says are being forced to dig their own graves. ISIS's black flag billows in the background. The scene then cuts to a different scene, where a row of prisoners kneel as the American-voiced figure boasts of the Islamic State's treatment of 'kuffar' - a derogatory term for non-Muslims. Help: The FBI has reportedly received hundred of tips about the 'North American' militant, but none have produced immediate arrests . Graves: In the video, the jihadist claims that the Syrian soldiers behind him digging their graves were 'terrorizing' Muslims and were going to face death . The video fades away as the figure turns, gun in hand, towards the waiting men. A statement from the FBI said: 'In releasing a segment from the video, the FBI hopes someone might recognize the man through his voice and appearance. 'In the segment, the faces of purported prisoners are obscured and their executions are not shown. Michael Steinbach, of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, said: 'We’re hoping that someone might recognize this individual and provide us with key pieces of information. No piece of information is too small.' Discussing the videos, the director of the Bureau, James Comey, said they appeal to 'troubled souls' and give them the push they need to 'emerge from the basement' as full-fledged jihadists. He said: 'These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way. ISIS: In the video, the jihadist pointed to a building, which he claims, was repeatedly fired at by Islamic State militants . Just begun: At the end of the video the jihadist declares that 'the fighting has just begun' 'And so they come across the propaganda and they become radicalized on their own independent study, and they're also able to equip themselves with training again on the Internet, and then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement.' The FBI is also urging people to report anybody they know who has traveled - or might want to travel - to Iraq and Syria to fight. Steinbach said the agency 'need' help from the American public to identify any would-be jihadists - and have set up a phone line and web page for any tip-offs. The U.S. government has estimated that more than 100 Americans have left the country to fight with ISIS, some of whom have now come back. Intelligence officials are said to have confirmed the identities of a dozen Americans on the ground on the side of ISIS. On Saturday the FBI arrested Mohammed Hamzah Khan at O'Hare airport, Chicago, as he tried to fly to Turkey. Dozen: James Comey, FBI director, said that about a dozen Americans are believed to be fighting alongside ISIS . The 19-year-old, from nearby Bolingbrook, Illinois, is accused of attempting to travel overseas to support terrorism - which carries a maximum sentence of 15-years. Khan is also charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He reportedly told FBI agents how he hoped to join ISIS - and investigators who scoured his home found documents outlining his intentions, including a letter asking his parents to join him. Other Americans have made similar attempts. Twenty-year-old Adam 'Fadi Fadi' Dandach was arrested by FBI in Los Angeles in July, and confessed he was headed to Syria to join up with ISIS. The next month investigators took in Donald Ray Morgan, 44, of North Carolina over firearms violations, NBC reports. Suspect: These pictures are believed to be that of Mohammed Hamzah Khan, a 19-year-old from Illinois who was arrested on Saturday allegedly trying to join ISIS . But the agency then discovered pro-ISIS messages on his social media accounts, including an image of him swearing fealty to ISIS's ruler, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. A Colorado woman, Shannon Maureen Conley, has pleaded guilty in court to charges that she tried to fly to Turkey to become involved with ISIS. One man who made it was Douglas McAuthur McCain, 33, of Minnesota. According to the New York Times, he was fighting on the front lines in August when he was killed by a rival Syrian group. FBI sources told the paper that American jihadists tend to be younger than those from elsewhere, often in their teens or early twenties. Americans? Around 100 U.S. citizens are thought to have left the country for Syria - and some have returned . James Comey, FBI director, said that about a dozen Americans are believed to be fighting alongside ISIS, according to AP. But Comey reportedly told CBS' 60 Minutes that he is even more worried about the Americans that aren't currently on his radar. 'I don't know what I don't know,' Comey said. The FBI reports that U.S. citizens traveling overseas to fight alongside terrorist groups is nothing new.

"A Poirot fan who found Agatha Christie's lost jewels inside a mysterious trunk she bought for just £100 has sold them at auction - for a £50,000 profit. Jennifer Grant, 65, from Nutley, East Sussex, bought the container in 2006 at a sale at the legendary crime novelist's former home Greenway, in Devon. Inside the trunk that once belonged to Christie's mother Clara was a box locked and bolted to the base but no key. Jennifer Grant bought the case, with a strongbox inside, in 2006 at a sale at the writer's former home . The travelling trunk was part of a contents sale at the novelist's former estate, Greenway near Brixham, Devon . When Jennifer forced it open with a crowbar in 2010, she found 52 gold coins, a diamond brooch and a three-stone diamond ring. The two pieces of jewellery are mentioned in Christie's biography as prized family heirlooms that were intended to be handed down to her and her sister Madge. Jennifer decided to sell the coins to pay for a bathroom and auction off the brooch and the ring, hoping to raise enough funds to buy a narrowboat - wish she plans on calling The Good Ship Agatha. The brooch was expected to fetch £8,000 but it fetched £27,500 - more than three times its estimate - at Bonhams' Knightsbridge auction house today. A bidding frenzy among Christie fans also ensured the ring, worth an estimated £5,000, went for £21,875 - giving stunned Jennifer a total profit of £49,275.

'Madge was to have the diamond crescent, I was to have the diamond buckle.' Jennifer said of her amazing literary find: 'They matched the description exactly. I was nearly hyperventilating. 'I almost didn't want to open the strongbox because then the mystery would be over. 'When friends came round we would tip the trunk from one side to the other and listen to hear if anything rattled. 'If you were very quiet you could just about hear something light sliding inside. Christie called Greenway 'the most beautiful place in the world' and it was there that she and her husband lived for the rest of their lives. The secluded property features in several of Christie's novels with its secretive walled gardens, tennis court and boat house on the winding River Dart. The house was passed to Agatha's daughter Rosalind who lived there until her death in 2004. The travelling trunk belonged to Agatha Christie's mother. The author is pictured here, at home .

"A man has been handed one of the most bizarre ASBOs ever issued by magistrates  - he is banned from falling over anywhere in England and Wales. Serial attention-seeker Andrew Davies, 51, was given the anti-social behaviour order after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries in order to dupe passing motorists into calling him an ambulance. Incredibly, the order bans Davies from deliberately falling over and lying on the ground anywhere in England or Wales, if he is doing it to for attention. Andrew Davies, 51, was given an ASBO  after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries for attention . A court heard how he began pestering emergency services with prank calls but later went to increasingly bizarre lengths to get his kicks, as neighbours and ambulance crews became familiar with his antics and tried to ignore him. After being persuaded by police to give up his mobile phone, Davies decided to attract attention instead by wandering the streets near his home in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, before pretending to fall over and acting as though he had been injured. When his increasingly fed-up neighbours began ignoring his amateur dramatics, he took to busy main roads nearby and would lie on the ground, pretending he had been hit by a car, until someone stopped to assist him. Davies was handed the two-year ASBO, which also prohibits him from being drunk in a public place and calling the emergency services unless in a genuine emergency, by magistrates in High Wycombe. The bench ruled that the ASBO was necessary to protect the public and emergency services from the consequences of his anti-social behaviour. PC Chris Allman, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Davies came to police attention initially by making time-wasting calls to the emergency services. On most occasions he would be intoxicated. 'When dealt with by a police and council joint team he gave away his telephone to stop the temptation. However he then took to pretending to fall in the street near his home as a way of attracting attention to himself. 'He would lay there feigning an injury until an ambulance attended. Local residents came to know what he was doing and started to ignore him and regard him as a nuisance. Davies then would orchestrate his falls on a nearby main road whereby he would be seen by a larger number of people. High Wycombe Magistrates' Court (pictured) where Davies was given the ASBO. He is banned from deliberately falling over, drinking in public, and contacting the emergency services unless it is a genuine emergency . 'Numerous motorists have done the decent thing and stopped to assist the man laying on the ground. Not realising they were being duped, they invariably would call an ambulance to attend to him. 'The ambulance staff and paramedics would normally recognise Davies and know what he was doing but were duty-bound to deal with him professionally. On a number of occasions he was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury where he was more thoroughly checked over but he was always discharged as having no injuries. 'He has been offered support from numerous agencies and given many opportunities to change his behaviour. Davies' continual lack of engagement has ultimately resulted in this town wide ASBO.'","Serial attention-seeker Andrew Davies, 51, is banned from deliberately falling .

"At the age of 51 Tina Malone shows no signs of settling down into her older age. Last year, at the age of 50, the Shameless actress gave birth to her second child and now she has revealed plans to change her life further by spending £50,000 on cosmetic surgery. The Liverpudlian actress says she has never been a looker despite having been born into an attractive family. Scroll down for video . Tina Malone has revealed plans to spend £50,000 on cosmetic surgery in order to turn back her body clock . Tina is embarking on six months worth of procedures in just a few weeks time. She plans to have her eyes, chin, neck, breasts, underarms and belly nipped and tucked . Tina is not shy of cosmetic surgery and four years ago had a gastric band fitted losing 11st 4lbs and slimming down to a slender size 8 and weighing just 8st. The Shameless actress lost 11st after having a gastric band fitted but has been left with lots of excess skin that she hopes the surgery will rectify . Tina says that she has always struggled with her looks, here she is pictured before her weight loss as Mimi in Channel 4's Shamelss . It was this sudden weight loss that has caused Tina to go in for further surgery to get rid of the excess skin she was left with. 'They reckon I've got around 10lb of skin to get rid of. Then I won't feel like I'm walking around with two bags of sugar in my knickers!' Tina put off further surgery because she wanted to have IVF to fulfill her dream of having a baby daughter, Flame, who is now 10 months old. Tina gained a little extra weight when she was carrying Flame but has since lost the weight and now wants to make sure she looks her very best. 'I had the band loosened to feed the baby and I went up to 13st 7lb when I was pregnant with her,' says Tina. Tina with her second daughter Flame and her husband Paul Chase . At the age of 51 Tina has completely changed her life with both her dramatic weight loss and the birth of her second child, Flame just last year . 'In March I had the band tightened and I am now 9st 11lbs and a size 10. I will be a size 8 again but I want to get rid of the excess skin which, however hard I work out, I am never going to get rid of. 'I won't look like Cheryl Cole but I want to see what I look like without it.' Tina says she is extremely excited about completing her body transformation as she says that she has always battled with her appearance. 'I'm not saying I was smacked with the ugly stick, but I certainly hit a few branches when I fell out of the tree,' she joked. 'I've never been a beauty. I never will be but, for the first time in my life, I want to make the best of myself and I'm really excited about that.' Tina's surgery will be filmed as part of a documentary series she is currently shooting looking at weight and obesity, due to be screened next summer. Tina says that she would love to go on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! The actress wants to lead by example and help others who have struggled with their weight. 'People will say they are fat and happy but I will tell you they're not,' she says. 'I've been the fat bird with the diabetes and the breathlessness, and it's no fun. 'I will be talking to a woman in Australia who was 30st; young girls in Nigeria who are sent to fat camps to put weight on to make them more attractive to tribal chiefs and a 33st lap dancer in Las Vegas. I don't believe she thinks she is attractive, it's a disguise, a mask.' She hasn't ruled out more reality telly, however. With Big Brother, Splash and Who's Doing The Dishes under her belt the actress wants to see how she would do in the Jungle with hopes to appear on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here!

So what if they only got beans and rice for tea, I'd tell them: ""I'm here for the money"".' Right now Tina says she couldn't be happier and says that she has never been more satisfied in her own skin. 'People say I look amazing for 51, and I love being 51. I feel 31. In my head, I'm 21.

"A couple who used the proceeds of a £2.3million fraud to fund a luxury house, expensive holidays and even sci-fi memorabilia have been ordered to pay back just £330,000. Julie Nickerson, 55, and her husband Anthony, 48, are currently serving prison sentences for siphoning the huge sum from her laundry equipment firm employers. The pair were reunited in the dock at Bradford Crown Court for a confiscation hearing. Julie Nickerson (left), 55, and her husband Anthony (right), 48, are currently serving prison sentences for siphoning £2.3million from her laundry equipment firm employers . The couple spent £17,000 on film memorabilia from Christie's auction house including this bronze and gold, remote controlled Dalek . The Nickersons used some of the money to pay for a £500,000 house in Wainstall, Halifax (pictured) set in five acres of land with a hot spring and pool . Judge Robert Bartfield ordered Julie Nickerson, who is now bankrupt, to pay back a total of £209,753.58, and Anthony Nickerson to hand over £120,794.71. The couple, formerly from Shelf, West Yorkshire, stole £2.3million so they could lavish the money on a £500,000 house set in five acres of land with a hot spring and pool, new cars and £200,000 worth of holidays. They also spent £17,000 on film memorabilia from Christie's auction house and £10,000 on motorsport events at Silverstone. After being employed by the Halifax-based firm since 1990, Julie Nickerson stole most of the money while working in the accounts and finance department, while her husband laundered the rest at the newsagents' he owned in nearby Shelf. She was jailed for five years in May after admitting money laundering and fraud in relation to a false representation made to HM Customs and Excise, while Anthony Nickerson received a two-and-a-half year sentence for money laundering. An auction of memorabilia from films and television shows such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who and Thunderbirds was reported to have raised about £25,000. Pictured is a Star Wars Darth Vader helmet included in the sale . Judge Robert Bartfield ordered Julie Nickerson (left), who is now bankrupt, to pay back a total of £209,753.58, and Anthony Nickerson (right) to hand over £120,794.71 . In a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act on Wednesday, it was heard that the available assets include money raised from the auction sale, the sale of Nickerson's newsagents business, the couple's pension funds and money seized by police at the time of the investigation. In June, an auction of memorabilia from films and television shows such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who and Thunderbirds was reported to have raised about £25,000 and cash from the sell-off was included in confiscation orders made against the pair. Rebecca Young, prosecuting, asked for the confiscated cash, which has to be handed over in the next three months, to be paid back to JLA Ltd as compensation. Miss Young also told the judge that Julie Nickerson's benefit figure from criminal conduct had been assessed at just over £1.4million while her husband's benefit amount was put at £925,000. A huge haul of sci-fi memorabilia was seized from Julie Nickerson and was later auctioned off . Pictures taken inside the couple's house show some of the memorabilia they purchased as a result of the £2.3million fraud . Judge Bartfield agreed to make the compensation order and he told Julie Nickerson that she would have to serve a further two years behind bars if the money was not paid back. The judge said Anthony Nickerson would face an extra 15 months in prison if he did not comply with the order in his case. The couple were led from the dock at the end of the hearing to continue serving their prison sentences. Speaking previously, Det Con Ash Nuttall, of West Yorkshire Police's Calderdale Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) team, said: 'The Nickersons thought they were living the high life but they were living on money that had been stolen from others. 'They were constantly having to look over their shoulders waiting for the day justice caught up with them. 'That day has now come and they will have a long time in prison to consider the consequences of their actions.'","Julie Nickerson and husband Anthony are in prison for £2.3million fraud .

"They say you either love it or hate it and it seems after years of hate Denmark is finally ready to love Marmite again after overturning a ban on the spread. David Darlington, 49, owner of a supplier which sells British and American products to supermarkets, had a licence to stock the product approved three years after it was taken off the shelves. The savory spread was first outlawed in 2011 because it contained added vitamins, a practice which is illegal under Dutch law. A ban on Marmite has been overturned in Denmark meaning the yeast spread will be available in supermarkets for the first time in three years . However after paying £900 for a 'risk assessment' test to prove the spread isn't dangerous Mr Darlington has been granted a licence to stock Marmite. Speaking to MailOnline, he said:  'I feel like it’s a victory. The Vikings have been defeated at last in the battle of Marmite. 'I hate Marmite myself, I can't stand the stuff, but I did this on the principle of the matter. I thought, how dare those b******* ban Marmite, it's a British institution. 'Plus I've had people, British, American and some Danish too, hounding me for years over this so I thought 'something's got to be done'. Mr Darlington, who is originally from Birkenhead near Liverpool, added: 'It’s a victory that the British people should have because there are those who can’t live without Marmite. 'Don't get me wrong, I won't became a millionaire from selling the stuff, but it is a travesty that we've been without it for so long.' The divisive vegetable spread was banned in under food laws passed in 2004 governing the sale of products fortified with added vitamins. British shoppers in Copenhagen (pictured) campaigned for the spread to be brought back. The battle was eventually won by David Darlington, who owns a food supplier . Until it was removed from sale in 2011, Marmite had escaped the attention of food chiefs. However it was deemed unsafe because it contained added vitamin B12. Marmite was among other products such as Australian alternative Vegemite, Horlicks, Ovaltine and Farley’s Rusks - all of which were banned. While Mr Darlington does not have any Marmite in stock now, he has promised to have it back on shelves by September 15. He has also successfully overturned a ban on American products such as Poptarts and pancake mix which use enriched flour.","Food regulators in Denmark have overturned a three-year ban on Marmite .

"A bride-to-be drowned in the swimming pool of her family’s holiday home on the morning that she was going to view the church where she was to be married, an inquest heard today.

He had gone for a jog that morning on July 3, having left his 29-year-old fiancée drinking a glass of orange juice at the pool-side. Drowned: Emma Campbell, of Winchfield, Hampshire, was found in the deep end of the pool in Menorca . In a statement read to the Basingstoke inquest, he said: ‘When I came home from a run I found my fiancée face down in the deep end of the pool. I jumped in and immediately pulled Emma to the surface and performed CPR to the best of my ability and screamed for help.’ He said that an ambulance arrived but the paramedics were unable to save her. Mr Mudford added that Miss Campbell had not spoken of her intentions that morning as she was not a ‘morning person’. Miss Campbell’s mother, Sally-Anne Le Clerc, said that the couple had an appointment to view the church that morning. She said: ‘They were looking at venues to be married and they had got an appointment, they had decided to look at the church at that time.’ Abroad: Miss Campbell had been at her family's holiday home on the Spanish island of Menorca (file picture) She added: ‘She was well able to swim, she knew the pool, she had been there from a very early age, she was a good swimmer.’ Ms Le Clerc told the hearing that her daughter had been born with a heart defect, pulmonary atresia, which she explained meant that she had only one pumping chamber. She said that she had undergone operations when she a baby and at three years of age, but had not suffered any long-term effects and was not on any medication for the condition. North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley said that post mortem examinations carried out in Menorca and Basingstoke gave a cause of death consistent with drowning. Recording a verdict of accidental death with a background of Miss Campbell’s heart condition, he said: ‘I have no doubt it’s an accidental death, had she not been under water, the nature of this event would not have happened, it’s that helpless situation.’","Emma Campbell was found in the deep end of pool in Menorca by fiancé .

"Brendan Rodgers’ miserable week ended with a third defeat on the bounce as the Liverpool manager was jeered by his own fans at Anfield yesterday. Rodgers’ team were beaten 2-1 at Anfield by all-conquering Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday, the defeat coming on the back of losses at Newcastle last weekend and Real Madrid in the Champions League in midweek. Liverpool are now 15 points behind Chelsea and seemingly out of the title race already. To make matters worse, sections of the Anfield crowd briefly turned on Rodgers when he took off fans’ favourite Philippe Coutinho midway through the second half. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers discuss the penalty appeal . Gary Cahill appears to use his arm to block Steven Gerrard's effort at goal . Gerrard appeals to referee Anthony Taylor for a penalty after Cahill's apparent block . Brendan Rodgers felt his side should have had a penalty and deserved at least a point from the game . 'I didn’t think we were creating enough so I made the change,' said Rodgers afterwards. 'There wasn’t enough momentum. But the supporters are a big part of this, here. They are frustrated and I understand that. 'They have given us great support and we are going through a difficult period at the moment.' Liverpool led early through a deflected striker from German international midfielder Emre Can. But Chelsea equalised through Gary Cahill soon after as goal-line technology was used to rule that the defender’s close range shot had crossed the line at the Kop end. Jose Mourinho’s team won the game in the second half through Diego Costa but Liverpool were subsequently denied a penalty when referee Anthony Taylor failed to spot that Cahill had handled a shot from Steven Gerrard. Rodgers added: 'The technology has been great. You see the replay for the goal and it was over the line. Emre can celebrates putting Liverpool ahead after nine minutes with a deflected effort . Simon Mingolet stops Cahill's effort but the ball goes over the line to make it 1-1 . Diego Costa smashes home his 10th goal of the season to make it 2-1 to Chelsea . 'But it’s bitterly disappointing that later there was a big decision in a big game and we didn’t get it. 'Our players gave everything and we should have got it. You have to see that. He had a clear look at it. Maybe he needed help from his linesman. 'But this is the situation we are at. We are not getting the rub of the green. It was a clear penalty and we should have got it.' And even John Terry conceded that Liverpool should have been awarded a penalty, saying: 'We have had some not go our way, it evens itself out'. Rodgers was criticised in midweek for leaving out so many first team players for the game in Madrid. They all came back in to the team yesterday but to no avail. 'The changes led to criticism and I can take that,' added Rodgers. 'I have no issue with that. I did think it was unfair on some of the players who played but there we go. I wouldn’t do anything different. We just didn’t get the result.'","Gary Cahill appeared to use his arm to block Steven Gerrard effort .

"For more than 50 years Chicago has transformed its river into a bright emerald green in honor of St Patrick's day. Now an amazing 30-second-long timelapse video shows step-by-step how the incredible transformation takes place. From the aerial footage, a speedboat can be seen whizzing up and down the river over the course of an hour while dumping containers of a green vegetable dye into the water. Scroll down for video .

The transformation is complete: After the boat has completed its fifth trip, the river has turned a bright green, just in time for the city's parade . While the dye starts off as a single green streak in the dark murky water, it quickly spreads, turning the entire river a shocking bright green. The hue typically lasts about six to 12 hours and is prepped right before the city's big St Patrick's Day parade, which was held on Saturday this year. The tradition of turning the river green has its origins in the city's efforts to detect illegal sewage dumping back in 1962. Plumbers would use fluorescein dye along the river, which would turn bright green if toxic sludge was detected.

"The childhood memory still sparks a slight shiver of discomfort even now. My mother and I were in a department store loos when I innocently asked about the ‘special towels’ in the vending machine on the wall. Well, she’d never moved so quickly. Grabbing me by the arm, she dragged me out the door. I was left in no doubt I’d said something very wrong — but I was totally bewildered as to what it was. I must have been about eight. I wouldn’t learn the truth for another four years — and, even then, the information came from school friends. I grew up thinking periods were shameful, dirty even. As did most of my generation — sadly, many girls still do. Carol with her daughter Christie, 19 (left) and daughter Jodie, 14 (right) As a mother of two teenage daughters — Christie, 19, and Jodie, 14 — and a son, Robbie, 16, I’d hate to think my children would ever be made to feel embarrassed about puberty like I was. In many tribal cultures, a first period is considered something to be celebrated: a coming of age, when a girl becomes a woman. Sadly, although we like to think of ourselves as civilised, we couldn’t have a more different approach. Hands up those who wrinkled their noses at the very mention of the p-word? I’m 52 now and, all these years on, menstruation is the final taboo. We will talk freely about porn, boob jobs and even female genital mutilation, but periods are still what I call a ‘silent subject’. Ridiculous when you consider half the population at some point experience them every month. And damaging, too, at a time when the age girls enter puberty continues to fall. Most girls still start their periods when they’re about 12, but nowadays there are those who start as early as eight. So it’s never been more important to talk openly to girls from an early age to make sure they’re prepared. Of course I understand it’s hardly dinner party conversation, but we have a duty to teach our daughters — and sons, come to mention it — that there is nothing to be ashamed or afraid of. And that means not shying away from the matter. Carol looking glams up on Strictly: The subject may not be glamorous, but the 'beautiful people' have periods too . Many will wonder why on earth a television presenter like me is speaking out about such a deeply unglamorous issue. Even friends have frowned: ‘What are you talking about that for?’ But that’s half the point: the ‘beautiful people’ have periods, too. In fact, it was while on holiday with my gorgeous friend, former England women’s tennis No 1 and TV presenter Annabel Croft, that I first realised that it was high time the matter was dragged into the public consciousness. Annabel and I had met on the TV circuit over the years, but it was through holidaying in the same place that we became friends. Annabel’s parents have a place in Portugal near our holiday home. She also has two daughters and a son — Amber, 20, Lily, 16, and Charlie, 18 — who get on brilliantly with my lot. During a holiday in 2011, Annabel and I went off for a day’s shopping without kids and husbands. I remember picking up a multipack of knickers and she asked: ‘What do you want those for?’ ‘Oh, you know, they’re good period pants for the girls,’ I replied. Annabel’s mouth dropped open  in recognition. The little ‘accidents’ associated with menstruation aren’t something women talk about often. But at the mention of it, Annabel confessed to having suffered that kind of thing from the age of  15 — to her  great shame. That’s when she started spending time away from home on the international tennis circuit. Something she dreaded, simply because of her periods. ‘I’d have to stay with host families, strangers,’ she told me, ‘and face the indignity of having to apologise for accidents during the night. When I spoke to my mum about it she gave me what was basically a shower cap with legs. It worked, but I always wondered why there’s nothing out there for that sort of thing.’ She also told me that female tennis players in whites often have to leave the court during a game to go and sort themselves out. I’m aware this will be too much information for some, but why should women feel ashamed of something they  can’t help? Annabel and I came up with an idea: we would launch a pair of knickers that as well as looking feminine, pretty and soft to the touch, would be waterproof as well. Female tennis players like Annabel Croft often have to leave the court because of their periods . It was the research required before we got started that made me realise quite how many women —  and young girls — suffer in silence. We started by talking to  our daughters. Like me, Christie and Jodie have been lucky enough to escape heavy periods, but they were full of stories about friends who’d had to dash out of class, resulting in ridicule from the boys. And seeing as sleepovers are the big thing these days, I recalled one or two of my daughters’ friends who’d scuttled off as quickly as possible the following morning — all because they were too ashamed to mention they’d had an ‘accident’ in the night. My daughters were first taught sex education at 11, but I’m told the curriculum didn’t go into detail until 13 or 14. Meanwhile, aware of my own experience of puberty being shrouded in secrecy, I was always very open — keeping things  age-appropriate of course. They were both 13 when they started their periods — a year older than I was. I had stocked up on products beforehand and told them where they were kept. I explained that if they just wanted to help themselves that was fine, but if they wanted to talk to me that was also fine. I think many of us are in denial about how knowledgeable our children are these days. It usually takes three years for a girl to finish puberty, but anything up to six years is considered normal . Sadly, thanks to the prevalence of mobile phones, they are likely to know far more about things like internet porn than we do — so surely we should be able to broach the subject of something as normal as puberty without awkwardness. Annabel and I devised a survey aimed at secondary school girls and circulated them at three schools — our daughters’ schools and an all-girls’ school round the corner from me. We were amazed at the results: 34 per cent said they had ‘accidents’ every month, but 91 per cent admitted to being so fearful of them that they avoided light clothing, wouldn’t sleep over and refused to do any sport during that time. Of course, that confirmed the need for the kind of pants we intended to launch. But, more importantly, it highlighted the pressing need for more understanding and less squeamishness. As things progressed and we started to talk to more women at school fairs, Ideal Home shows, parenting shows etc, we heard even more startling confessions. A lot of women confessed to wearing two or three pairs of knickers during menstruation, but not only does that not necessarily work, it’s pretty uncomfortable. Some women wear two or three pairs of knickers during their period . One said she had to sit in lengthy meetings with male colleagues all the time and was becoming increasingly mortified by how often she had to leave the room. Another, in her 30s, later posted on Facebook that our pants had literally ‘changed her life’ because as a sufferer of endometriosis (a chronic condition that affects the womb and can cause heavy periods), she hadn’t been able to hold down a job, as the bleeding was so unpredictable. Of course, with waterproof knickers she felt so much more confident. I’m lucky that my husband, Alex, a restaurateur, is very understanding about these things. Since we started the project, he’s admitted: ‘I’ve learned so much!’ He hadn’t realised so many women have problems in that department. Annabel and I launched Diary Doll knickers in October 2012. Since then, I often have to stand up and ‘sell’ the concept to a very mixed audience. Predictably enough, half the men in the room will shift awkwardly in their seats — and the other half would far rather I stick to the business details. But the awkwardness certainly isn’t confined to men. John Lewis started stocking our underwear earlier this year, and the most common question asked by  staff was: ‘How do we sell this without causing offence or embarrassment?’ The fact is that, even in this ‘enlightened age’, many women still giggle about the matter or suggest it’s distasteful — clearly falling in line with society’s constrictions. I don’t expect miracles but I hope that speaking publicly about the ‘monthly misery’ will help reduce the stigma. Why should women feel like social pariahs about periods, the most natural thing in the world? After all, none of us would be here without them.","Sadly many girls still think of periods as dirty or shameful .

"It is known as the 'Death Star' due to a crater making it look like the Star Wars weapon. However, astronomers say they are a step closer to solving a mystery that has baffled them for decades about Saturn's moon Mimas. The moon has an odd wobble - and scientists say its core is is either wonky or awash with water. Scroll down for video . The researchers built a detailed 3D model of Mimas using images taken from various angles, and tracked the movement of hundreds of reference points on its pockmarked surface. Researchers used numerous images of Mimas taken by NASA's Cassini mission to determine how much the moon wobbles as it orbits Saturn. Cassini was sent to Saturn in 1997 to explore the planet and its many moons, which so far number 62 (53 with names). The researchers built a detailed 3D model of Mimas using images taken from various angles, and tracked the movement of hundreds of reference points on its pockmarked surface. It has a tell-tale wobble that is twice as big as expected for a moon with a regular, solid structure. Mimas is mostly made of ice and has a diameter of 396km. The researchers offer two explanations for the wobble: either it has a vast ocean beneath its surface, or a rocky core with a weird shape resembling a rugby ball. The study appears in Science Magazine. Its authors are astronomers in the US, France and Belgium, who based their calculations on high-resolution photos of Mimas snapped by theCassini spacecraft. Researchers used numerous images of Mimas taken by NASA's Cassini mission to determine how much the moon wobbles as it orbits Saturn. Cassini was sent to Saturn in 1997 to explore the planet and its many moons, which so far number 62 (53 with names). The researchers built a detailed 3D model of Mimas using images taken from various angles, and tracked the movement of hundreds of reference points on its pockmarked surface. 'After carefully examining Mimas, we found it librates - that is, it subtly wobbles - around the moon's polar axis,' said lead author Dr Radwan Tajeddine, who works at Cornell University in the US. Apart from these gentle 'librations', Mimas otherwise presents the same face to Saturn throughout its orbit. 'The data suggest that something is not right, so to speak, inside Mimas,' said Tajeddine. 'The amount of wobble we measured is double what was predicted.' Either possiblity for the interior of Mimas would be interesting, according to Tajeddine, as the moon's heavily cratered outward appearance does not suggest anything unusual lies beneath its surface. Cassini was sent to Saturn in 1997 to explore the planet and its many moons, which so far number 62 (53 with names). Because Mimas formed more than four billion years ago, scientists would expect its core to have relaxed into a more or less spherical shape by now. So if Mimas' core is oblong in shape, it likely represents a record of the moon's formation, frozen in time. If Mimas possesses an ocean, it would join an exclusive club of 'ocean worlds' that includes several moons of Jupiter and two other Saturn moons, Enceladus and Titan. A global ocean would be surprising, said Tajeddine, as the surface of Mimas does not display signs of geologic activity. Like a lot of moons in the solar system, including our own, Mimas always shows essentially the same face to its parent planet. This is called a spin-orbit resonance, meaning the moon's rotation, or spin, is in sync with its orbit around Saturn. Like Earth's moon, Mimas takes the same amount of time to spin completely around on its axis as it takes to orbit its planet. 'Observing libration can provide useful insights about what is going on inside a body,' said Tajeddine. 'In this case, it is telling us that this cratered little moon may be more complex than we thought.' Models developed by Tajeddine and co-authors from France and Belgium indicate that, if Mimas is hiding a liquid water ocean, it lies 15 to 20 miles (24 to 31 kilometers) beneath the moon's impact-battered surface. At 246 miles (396 kilometers) wide, Mimas is too small to have retained internal heat from its formation, so some other source of energy would be required to maintain an underground ocean. The researchers note that there is evidence that Mimas' current, elongated orbit could have been even more stretched out in the past, which might have created enough tidal heating to produce an ocean.","Moon has a large crater making it look like the Star Wars weapon .

"The family of bashing victim Joshua Hardy who died outside a Melbourne McDonald's have told of their heartbreak and say they are unable to make sense of what happened to the young student. The aunt and uncle of the 21-year-old appeared outside a Melbourne Court on Friday morning after flying from Darwin to Melbourne for the appearance of Kyle Zandipour, who is accused of murdering their nephew. Shaun Hardy and his sister Kim Hardy said that they and ten of Joshua's university friends would accompany his body on a flight to Darwin this coming Saturday. Zandipour, 28, is accused of bashing Joshua outside a St Kilda Road McDonald's early last Saturday morning, who died an hour later in hospital. The attack is believed to have been unprovoked. Scroll down for video . Joshua Hardy's aunt Kim Hardy and uncle Shaun Hardy flew from Darwin to Melbourne to attend the hearing of Kyle Zandipour who is accused of bashing the 21-year-old to death . 'They are heartbroken, they are devastated, they are broken, as is most of the Darwin community,' said Ms Hardy outside of court . 'We can't make sense of it at the moment but if we ask for anything it would be we say 'no more' to violence,' said Joshua's uncle Shaun Hardy . The investment banker appeared at the court briefly, accompanied by his lawyer George Defteros, indicating that a Supreme Court bail application was being considered. Chief magistrate Peter Lauritsen remanded Zandipour in custody to reappear on March 23. Mr Hardy said that he and his family were still struggling to come to terms with what happened to his nephew. 'What can we, as a society or as individuals, do about this?', he said outside of court. 'We can't make sense of it at the moment but if we ask for anything it would be we say 'no more' to violence.' Ms Hardy said that it was important to their family to be in Melbourne for the hearing of Zandipour. 'Because he's our nephew, our family,' she said, adding that Joshua's parents were distraught. 'They are heartbroken, they are devastated, they are broken, as is most of the Darwin community,' she said. '[Mr Hardy] was grabbed by the arm and violently thrown to the ground head first, and then kicked to the head,’ reported Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon. Joshua's father, David Hardy, said earlier in the week that he was ‘full of forgiveness' for Zandipour. He asked that a candle be lit for his son's alleged killer, because 'he will also be changed forever’. The family of bashing victim Joshua Hardy who died outside a Melbourne McDonald's have told of their heartbreak and say they are unable to make sense of what happened to the young student. 'What can we, as a society or as individuals, do about this?', Shaun Hardy said outside of court. Joshua Hardy (right) was killed on the early hours of Saturday morning hour after celebrating the end of semester with his beloved little sister, Rebecca (left) - pictured on their last night together . The Aboriginal flag is flying at half-mast at Melbourne Grammar School, where Mr Hardy attended high school, as a mark of respect . Hardy’s father, David, has shown mercy and compassion for both Kyle Zandipour and the man who accompanied Zandipour before the attack. The man was identified by CCTV footage and provided a statement for police, but will not face charges. The victim's father is concerned for the men and their families, according to a report from the headmaster of Melbourne Grammar School, Roy Kelley. Josh Hardy, originally from Darwin, completed Year Twelve at Melbourne Grammar School in 2011, where the Aboriginal flag is currently flying at half mast in memoriam. 'Like brother like sister' Rebecca (left) posted humorously on Facebook last month, in a sweet moment with her brother, Joshua (right) who was tragically killed on Saturday morning . The headmaster published a reflection after learning of the former Grammar student’s tragic death, describing a conversation he had with David Hardy. ‘I (had)… the difficult task of returning to my office to telephone the parents of Josh Hardy… who had been tragically killed over the weekend,’ wrote Mr Kelley. ‘His father, David and I shared memories of Josh which resulted in the expected mix of tears and laughter.’ Joshua's family has paid an emotional tribute to their beloved son who was killed suddenly, and are campaigning to raise awareness about the devastating impact of violence . However, Mr Kelley explained that the ‘most remarkable’ part of the conversation came from the ‘incredibly humane reaction’ Mr Hardy had when he asked for special favour. ‘In stating that I was going to leave my office to go to the Chapel of St Peter to light a candle for Josh and his family, he asked for a special favour. ‘He asked me to also light a candle for the two men who were responsible for Josh’s death and for their families, given the fact their lives would also now be affected forever, just as his had been.’ Mr Hardy (right) is remembered by his friends for his good humour and sense of fun . A top bloke: Melbourne University student Joshua Hardy died in hospital after allegedly being kicked in the head outside a McDonald's restaurant early Saturday morning . The headmaster says the father was ‘full of forgiveness’ for the perpetrators of the heinous crime. ‘He could well have been forgiven for venting strong feelings of the need for revenge, yet it was clear… that he was full of forgiveness, despite what had happened to his son.’ The message was shared on the ‘Justice4JoshHardy’ Facebook page, which ‘is designed to share thoughts on how something positive can come from the tragic and senseless act of violence that killed Josh Hardy.’ Messages of support poured in, responding to the sentiments shared by Mr Hardy’s father. Joshua (second from left) has been remembered as a keen sportsman and a leader, inspiring the indigenous students he cared for as an AIME mentor at university . ‘Beautiful words. No wonder Josh was so well respected & loved when he was being guided by such amazing parents (& family) ,’ wrote Kelly McSkimming. ‘In times like these it's usually your friends & family that give you strength, but I feel that the strength and love being shown by David, Milly, Bec and all their families is what is helping us all get through this tragic time.’ Earlier this week, David Hardy implored every person to reach out to their loved ones, saying, ‘ring your family and tell that that you love them.’ “We know that was the last thing we said to Josh before the stupid night,’ he told Nine News. Joshua Hardy's family at his death, lamenting the bright future the eager, driven young man had ahead of him. He had aspirations to become a lawyers and help members of the indigenous community facing injustice . ‘It’s a senseless act of violence that has cut short a very special young man’s life,” he said, according to Herald Sun. Josh Hardy’s devastated loved ones continue to pay tribute to him, and are campaigning to raise awareness about the devastating impact of violence. ‘How do we make sense of this tragic loss, violently kicked and stomped, to death??? ... We can't, at all!!!,’ wrote his uncle. An third-year Arts student and popular football player, Joshua Hardy has been described by friends on social media as 'a truly genuine, spirited and kind-hearted young man' ‘Perhaps, if anything, as men, women, and children, we can condemn all violence, reinforce that every action has consequences, some can be fatal, and tell our children that we love them!’ Just hours before his death Mr Hardy had been celebrating the end of semester with his beloved sister, Rebecca, a precious last moment captured in a photograph of their beaming faces. They siblings shared a close bond, both living away from their hometown of Darwin at the Melbourne University residence, Trinity College. 'Rest easy my precious xx' Ms Hardy wrote on Facebook, alongside the photograph of the pair together on their last night together. Mr Hardy's loved ones desperately want to make changes so the streets are safe and other families do not have to experience the same devastating loss. The Justice for Josh Hardy campaign hopes to raise awareness and educate people, to ensure no one else has to experience the loss of a loved one from a 'random assault'. 'We need to educate our school age sons to use words rather than fists or feet. 'We need our young men to understand that thoughtless actions can have very final and devastating consequences.' Family members of the accused murderer Kyle Zandipour leave the Melbourne Magistrates Court after the ANZ investment banker was charged with the murder of Joshua Robert Hardy in Melbourne on Sunday . Police released these images of two men, one of whom allegedly kicked Mr Hardy in the head at about 1.10am on Saturday outside a McDonald's outlet in Melbourne .

"Ready for battle: Model Sara McKenna is fighting with Olympic skier Bode Miller, who wants joint custody of McKenna's newborn son . Ski champion Bode Miller's ex-lover - who gave birth to his child last month - has made an appeal not to grant custody of the newborn in the latest drama to come out of a months-long custody fight. Model Sara McKenna claimed in a court filing this week that the famed Olympic skier should not have custody of her son because he lives on a yacht and has substance abuse problems. It's a new twist in an ugly saga between Miller, McKenna and Miller's wife, volleyball player Morgan Beck, whom Miller married late last year. TMZ, which first reported news of the . legal documents, reported that McKenna also claimed Miller did not want . the child, and ask her to have an abortion. Miller, 35, launched his fight for . joint legal and physical custody of McKenna's child just days after Beck . suffered a miscarriage in January. Miller did not return a call from TMZ for comment. Last week, McKenna filed a police report against Beck, claiming online attacks and threatening messages on Twitter. McKenna claims that she was sent a series of online posts from Beck under different accounts that threatened her and insulted her with words like 'c***' and 'bitch.' TMZ reported that the NYPD is taking McKenna's filing seriously, and is investigating. At the time of Miller's custody request, McKenna . told TMZ: 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up . my son to somebody who did not want him to begin with.' Loss: Bode Miller, with wife and volleyball star Morgan Beck. The couple had a miscarriage in January . Joy: Sara announced her pregnancy on Facebook and proudly revealed what he planned to call the child . On the slopes: Miller pictured last year - is sitting out this season as he recovers from surgery, but any hopes for a quiet recuperation have been in vain . Shortly after McKenna became pregnant last year, Miller began a romance with Beck - and the two married just months later. Beck announced that she was pregnant and . expecting the couple's first child together around Christmas before . revealing several weeks later that she had lost the child. But already the storm between the two women was brewing. War: Last week, McKenna, pictured, filed a police report against Beck, claiming online attacks and threatening messages on Twitter . Just weeks before the wedding, McKenna posted, ‘Go take your . paternity test already Bode. I’m over the way you have been treating us. You can't hide DNA in court documents.’ On . the same day McKenna posted a message directed at 25-year-old Beck: 'If . you make a fake Twitter to ask me questions about your new ""fiance"" at . least be clever enough not to use your cat’s name #block.'McKenna, . who describes herself as a 'Firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S . Marine, model and Ivy Leaguer,' claims that Miller wanted . nothing to do with the child when she first became pregnant. Now she has made it clear that she has no intention of surrendering any rights to the child’s father. In . a clear show of solidarity with her husband last month, Beck . informed McKenna: 'You are stuck with BOTH of us for the rest of your . life.' Miller has also . filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support . payments for a child by another woman - Chanel Johnson. Johnson, . now married, is the mother of Miller’s four-year-old daughter Neesyn . Dacey. According to Miller, the two are friends and he was involved in . naming the little girl. Miller . has won five Olympic medals – including a gold at the 2010 Vancouver . Games, holds four World Championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an . American men's record. He . recently announced his intention to sit this season out as he is . recovering from knee surgery and determined to compete in the 2014 . Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. But for McKenna and Beck, the dispute has often taken a turn for the vicious, and has had an impact on mutual friendships. In January, McKenna could be found lambasting a friend for a perceived betrayal. Yet . only a few months before, the women were excitedly exchanging details of . the impending birth and telling the world how delighted they were to be . friends. In September @Tehren_Anaiis tweets, 'i . am so honored to know such an amazing strong woman like . @Sarah_A_McKenna can't wait to meet little bode babe!'

"Federal employees working in the Justice Department and in prisons across the country have been caught watching pornography while at work - but have escaped without punishment. An investigation has revealed dozens of staff members misused their government computers by browsing sexually explicit content at their desks. However they are rarely given sanctions while their names are not disclosed to the public because of their right to privacy. An investigation has revealed that dozens of federal employees in the Justice Department and in prisons across the country have been caught viewing pornography - but have escaped punishment . Computer logs revealed that some had looked at websites promoting foreign brides and escorts while an individual was discovered to have bought explicit 'memorabilia' from eBay. According to The Washington Times, an employee at the US Office of the Trustee - a part of the Justice Department who oversee the integrity of the bankruptcy system — spent up to five hours a day  looking at pornography while at work, visiting more than 2,500 adult websites during 2011. A Freedom of Information Act request also revealed that at a prison in Oakdale, Louisiana, 13 correctional officers were found to be scouring porn sites during work hours. Pornography also turned up on work computers at federal prisons in Oregon and Arkansas. A previous investigation found that when employees were asked why they visited the sites, it was because of boredom. Republican Congressman Mark Meadows has put forward a bill to make it a uniform law that federal employees cannot look at adult websites while at work . Yet they are rarely penalised for the abuses of departmental regulations, according to a memo released as part of the request. The only punishments given out are done so 'administratively', however details of what that involves was not released. The request also asked for the names of those who had breached the policy, but their names were redacted. Kevin Evans, a Colorado-based attorney, began legal proceedings to try and have the names of executives embroiled in the Securities and Exchange Commission porn scandal in 2010 disclosed, but a judge ruled against him and said that privacy interests prevailed. 'The courts are not willing to require the disclosure of names, and they assert the privacy exemption in the FOIA law, which I think has become toothless anyway,' he told the paper. 'Requiring disclosure of these cases would certainly put a dent in this kind of activity going forward,' he added. In May it was revealed that an Environmental Protection Agency employee was still receiving a $120,000 salary, even though he had been viewing pornography for between two and six hours every day. When an investigator went to interview him, he was at his desk surfing sexually explicit websites. It prompted Republican Congressman Mark Meadows to introduce a bill to make it a uniform federal  law that employees cannot look at pornography at work. The North Carolina politician said many of the agencies had rules, but they were not enforced.","Individuals in Justice Department and prisons have viewed explicit material .

"A suspected child sex abuse gang has been smashed by police officers as part of a crackdown on exploitation of young girls. Eleven people have been arrested under Operation Heliodor in the south Manchester area, Greater Manchester Police said. The suspected abusers, aged between 19 and 38, have been arrested for alleged offences including sexual activity with a child, attempted indecent assault, inciting child prostitution, abduction and rape. Police in Manchester have arrested 11 men on suspicion of a range of sexual offences. File photo . None of the men have been charged and all have been released on bail until November and December. The arrests come at a time of increased scrutiny over the way police forces, including Greater Manchester, deal with child sexual exploitation allegations in the wake of damning reports and claims widespread abuse  was effectively ignored by officers for years. Detective Inspector Debbie Oakes of the Greater Manchester Police's Protect Team said: 'Tackling child sexual exploitation and those responsible for such heinous crimes is an absolute priority for us. 'We listen to the children and put them at the heart of our investigations and tactics, to ensure their safety and well-being is at the forefront of everything we do. 'Operation Heliodor is ongoing and, with this collaborative approach we will continue to target those involved in child sexual exploitation. I fully anticipate more warrants and arrests as we continue in our investigation.' The arrests come after an MP  criticised Greater Manchester Police for failing to tackle grooming gangs. Labour's Simon Danczuk claimed Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy did not see the issue as a priority and urged him to do more. The arrests, which took place over a month, were all made in the Longsight area of the city. File photo . The arrests come after MP Simon Danczuk criticised Greater Manchester Police for its handling of child sex abuse cases. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy has insisted the force has 'completely changed' since a child sex ring operated in Rochdale . The MP for Rochdale made the comments after an ITV News report said hundreds of child abusers were free to walk Manchester's streets because the force had failed to investigate allegations properly. The force was heavily criticised in 2012 after nine men were jailed for over a long-running child sex ring in Rochdale. Speaking earlier this month, Sir Peter Fahy admitted the force was focused on other types of crime at the time of the Rochdale offences, but insisted it has now 'completely changed'. He told the BBC: 'Unfortunately there was this big emphasis, particularly around big cities, about trying to improve in the league tables. 'But that is no excuse whatsoever for the fact that a mindset had developed, not only in the police but also in social services and in the Crown Prosecution Service, that this issue of children running away from homes could not be solved. 'We now have multi-agency teams in places like Rochdale. It's not only about investigating the matter and prosecuting the offender, but crucially to try and protect the young person from being involved in more abuse.' Commenting on the latest arrests, Lynn Perry, regional director for Barnardo's said: 'We are pleased to be at the heart of an inter-agency partnership in Greater Manchester tackling child sexual exploitation; supporting and enabling young people to speak out and providing child victims of sexual exploitation with appropriate, long term support.'

"Sportswear firm Nike suspended its contract with the athlete yesterday . Visitors to the home of Oscar Pistorius were left in no doubt of his need to feel safe. This picture shows the silver 9mm pistol he kept on the bedside table next to his car keys, designer watch and remote controls. It emerged yesterday as the case against Pistorius descended into farce. The detective leading the inquiry was replaced after it was revealed that he has been accused of attempted murder. On display: A 9mm pistol sits beside car keys, a watch and mobile phone on the beside table at Oscar Pistorius's Pretoria home, pictured during a magazine photoshoot in 2010 . The gun was pictured in 2010 during a magazine photoshoot at the Blade Runner’s Pretoria home, where last week he allegedly murdered girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. It is not known if it is the gun Pistorius used to kill the 29-year-old model, whom he says he mistook for an intruder. Bowed: Oscar Pistorius, pictured in the dock yesterday, has been granted bail . Firearms expert David W Dyson said yesterday that it looked like a semi-automatic 9mm Taurus parabellum, the type recovered from the scene. In his affidavit presented to his bail hearing Pistorius, 26, said: ‘I’ve received death threats. I sleep with my 9mm under my bed.’ The athlete applied for firearms licenses for six more weapons weeks before the shooting. Pistorius, who is accused of premeditated murder, will learn today whether he has won his fight for bail as he awaits trial. Yesterday South Africa’s top detective was put in charge of the case after Detective Hilton Botha, who had led the investigation, was removed. It emerged that Botha and two other officers are accused of opening fire on a minibus full of passengers. Police said charges of attempted murder against Botha had initially been dismissed but were reinstated before he was called to Pistorius’s flat after Miss Steenkamp was shot in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. Botha, who has been accused of bungling the case, will be replaced by Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo. National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega said the Pistorius investigation would now be handled at a national level. Police Brigadier Neville Malila, of the South African Police Service, said he learnt only on Wednesday that the charges against Botha, dating from 2011, were active again. Accusations: The prosecution claim it was a premeditated murder, but his defence advocate has argued there is no evidence to suggest the athlete's account of events is untrue . He said they were reinstated before Miss Steenkamp’s death and could not explain why Botha, who has not been suspended, had been given the lead role in South Africa’s most high-profile murder inquiry. Botha, a police veteran of 24 years, had been embarrassed and ridiculed in the witness box in the packed Pretoria courtroom on Wednesday as he gave confusing and conflicting evidence. He was accused of contaminating the crime scene in Pistorius’s house and had to backtrack on details such as how far away witnesses were when they heard screaming, shouting and gunshots. His discomfort continued yesterday as he denied he had been drunk when he opened fire on the minibus and said the incident happened when he and fellow officers had been chasing suspects. Axed: South Africa's top detective was put in charge of the case after Detective Hilton Botha (pictured), who had led the investigation, was removed when it emerged he and two other officers face attempted murder charges . Questioned by defence lawyer Barry Roux, Botha conceded that Pistorius’s version of events – that he fired into the toilet door in a panic thinking an intruder was lurking behind it – was plausible. He admitted that telephone records from the night of the shooting, including those of Miss Steenkamp, had still not been obtained. It led to magistrate Desmond Nair observing there appeared ‘a lack of urgency’ in the police case. Mr Roux stressed: ‘The poor quality of evidence presented by the chief investigating officer exposed disastrous shortcomings in the state’s case.’ Embarrassment: Botha, a police veteran of 24 years, . had been embarrassed and ridiculed in the witness box in the packed .

Victim: Pistorius is accused of shooting dead his 29-year-old girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his Pretoria home . Mr Nair had earlier asked: ‘Do you think there will be some level of shock if the accused is released?’ Mr Roux responded: ‘I think there will be a level of shock in this country if he is not released.’ Last night the Pistorius family appeared optimistic. The athlete’s uncle, Arnold Pistorius, said the Paralympian, who has spent long periods of the bail hearing sobbing with his head in his hands, was eating again after six days and had spent much of his time in custody reading the Bible. In a clear sign of a change of mood, Pistorius was composed in the dock, with none of the tears of previous days. Sportswear firm Nike suspended its contract with the athlete yesterday. Front row support: Pistorius' family were once again on the front row to support him yesterday .

"Julie Gale was instructed to remove her headscarf in a crowded foyer at the Melbourne Magistrates Court in November last year . A breast cancer survivor who was undergoing chemotherapy treatment was left humiliated after being forced to publicly remove her headscarf at a Melbourne court. Julie Gale, from Brighton East in Victoria, was checking-in her bag and stepping through the metal detector at Melbourne Magistrates' Court in November last year when she was stopped by a security guard. The 51-year-old comedian and women's health advocate told Daily Mail Australia that she had been attending a court case to support her daughter, who had been the victim of an assault at Flinders Street Station. 'It was just another day for me, feeling a little uncomfortable and vulnerable about having to be in the same room as the person who assaulted her and smashed her head open,' Ms Gale said. 'I was just going about my business when the male security guard pointed at his colleague who said 'take that off,' pointing at my headscarf. 'I said, 'What, you want me to take this off? I have a bald head underneath'. 'He said 'yes, you could be hiding something'. I just said, 'you want me to take it off now?' and he said yes. 'I'm normally quite a strong person and would have said 'No. I'm not doing it here in front of everyone in the foyer', but I had just gone through chemo and it's not easy when you're standing there with three males surrounding you. She was at the court to support her daughter who was the victim of an assault and claims she had never been asked to remove her head-wear on previous court visits . 'So I just pulled it off defiantly and said 'are you happy now?' I was just really affronted and I was happy to show my bald head to anyone, but at my own choosing, not when ordered in public.' Ms Gale claims that she was never instructed to remove her head-wear during previous court visits. She later found out from a female security guard that she could have been offered a private room for the screening. The same security guard also told her that the guard who instructed her to remover her scarf 'was new and was probably nervous'. Since sharing her story on social media last week, Ms Gales has been astounded by the number of cancer patients who have experienced similar humiliating incidents . The comments were posted on the cancer support group, Under the Red Dress Project, Facebook page . Furious, Ms Gale, who underwent a double mastectomy and five months of chemotherapy which she described as 'robbing you of your armour', wrote a complaint to the security company about the incident. Although she was not offered an apology, the general manager of the service responded by assuring her the matter had been investigated and that their process were being reviewed to ensure 'there is not repeat of any matter that may cause undue embarrassment'. 'My main message is that all women across all sectors of the community - no matter what their headwear - should be treated with dignity and respect,' Ms Gale said. 'I was not given the choice of a private screening and I want women to know they can request this, if it is not offered. Security is important and necessary - but being forced to remove a headscarf in such an insensitive manner is not acceptable.' Since sharing her story on social media last week, Ms Gale has been astounded by the number of cancer patients who have experienced similar humiliating incidents. Facebook user Jenni Wright, commented with her own experience at Melbourne airport when a security guard ignored his supervisor instructions and she remover he headscarf. 'He kept insisting that I remove it from my head so I did and when I did you could hear the intake of breath from everyone in the area,' Ms Wright wrote. 'The supervisor quickly came over and apologised and then told me to continue on my way... I wasn't embarrassed about my bald head I just didn't think everyone around me needed to see it.' Although she was not offered an apology, the general manager of the court's security service responded to Ms Gale's complaint by assuring her the matter had been investigated and that their process were being reviewed to ensure 'there is not repeat of any matter that may cause undue embarrassment'","Julie Gale was at Melbourne Magistrates court in November 2013 to support her daughter who was the victim of an assault .

"Tim Sherwood has been sacked as Tottenham Hotspur manager after just six months in charge at White Hart Lane. Sherwood took over from Andre Villas-Boas in December on an 18-month deal, but has failed to reach his second season at the club, who have exercised a break clause in the contract. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Sherwood: If I started the season we'd be in the Champions League' Gone: Tim Sherwood has been sacked as Tottenham manager after six months in charge . Out the door: Levy (centre) has decided to trigger a break clause in Sherwood's contract . Speculation over Sherwood's future was . rife last month, and chairman Daniel Levy has finally decided to find a . more suited man to bring the club forward. Sherwood . won 14 games of his 28 in charge, drawing four and losing 10. Spurs . finished in sixth in the table, 10 points off fourth place. The . 45-year-old could be offered an immediate return to management by . Championship club Brighton. Sherwood, who has been installed as . the bookies' favourite for the vacant head coach role at The Amex, told Sky Sports News how upset he was to . have lost his job at White Hart Lane. 'It is obviously a massive wrench to leave a club of the stature of Tottenham Hotspur, a club very close to my heart,' he said. Levy said on the club's website: 'We appointed Tim mid-season as someone who knew both the players and the club. Targets? Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino (left) and Napoli manager Rafael Benitez are being linked with the job . Mediocre: Spurs finished sixth in the Premier League after Sherwood won 14 of his 28 games in charge .

'We agreed an 18-month contract with a break clause at the end of the season and we have now exercised that option. 'Since . appointing Tim as assistant first team coach in 2008 and then as . technical co-ordinator in 2010 and head of football development in 2012, . we have been supportive of him . during football management changes throughout that period. 'On . behalf of the club, I should like to state our thanks for all his . efforts during his years with us. We wish him great success in his . managerial career. 'Moving . forward, now the season is over, we shall embark on the process of . finding a new head coach. We have a talented squad and exciting young . players coming through. 'We . need to build on this season, develop our potential and inspire the . kind of performances that we associate with our great club.' Record: Spurs did enjoy some success under Sherwood, winning 14 of his 28 games in charge . Having never managed at the top level before, Sherwood was initially installed as interim replacement for Villas-Boas, with a Capital One Cup exit to local rivals West Ham his first game in charge. A 5-1 home defeat to eventual champions Manchester City and a 4-0 thrashing at Chelsea saw Sherwood question the commitment of a number of his players. He always claimed the uncertainty over his position was making the job harder and, as the season drew to a close, even his players started suggesting Sherwood's tenure was coming to an end. Midfielder Sandro, who had fallen out of favour under Sherwood, told ESPN Brazil he was expecting a new man to be in charge at the start of the new campaign and now he has been proven correct. High point: Sherwood won his first match in charge, a 3-2 win at Southampton in December . Reports surfaced at the end of April . that Levy had been in contact with Ajax to enquire about the . availability of De Boer, but Southampton boss Pochettino is the . favourite to take charge at White Hart Lane, with initial front-runner . Van Gaal appearing set to be installed as Manchester United's new . manager. Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino . is thought to be on Levy's list to replace Sherwood, while Napoli and . former Chelsea manager Rafa Benitez has also been linked.

"Tim Sherwood made light of the uncertainty surrounding his future as manager of Tottenham by beckoning a fan from the crowd and allowing them to sit in his seat on the bench. Sherwood, who faces the axe despite leading Spurs to a sixth-placed finish and qualifying for the Europa League, also gave the supporter his infamous gilet jacket to wear. Tottenham won 3-0 against Aston Villa at White Hart Lane thanks to first-half goals from Paulinho, Emmanuel Adebayor and an own goal from Nathan Baker. You talking to me: Tim Sherwood calls a Tottenham fan from the crowd during the win against Villa . Come join us: Sherwood cheekily beckons the fan while the game is still going on . But it could be Sherwood's final game in charge of the club with Ajax coach Frank de Boer and Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino heavily linked to the post. In his . final programme notes of the season Levy chose not to acknowledge . Sherwood at all, instead choosing to criticise the club's playing style . even when they have won. He . wrote: 'The new signings in the summer had the effect of raising . expectations and we all started the season with high hopes, yet the . players undoubtedly needed time to adapt to a new league. We were also . forced to make managerial changes, which is far from ideal mid-season. 'Our . sense of falling short, felt by all, including the players, is based on . some poor performances during the season and knowing we have not . performed at the level we know we could have done. 'Even . in games where we gained maximum points, our football was not always . what we have come to expect and associate with our club.' Here you go: Sherwood then presents the startled fan with his Tottenham gilet . On borrowed time: Reports suggest Sherwood could be on his way out of Tottenham this summer . During the . second-half of the win against Villa, with Tottenham cruising to . victory against their out-of-form opponents, Sherwood summoned a . supporter, Danny Grimsdale, from the crowd with a smile before presenting him with his . club-branded gilet jacket which has become a feature of his time on the . club's bench. As . if that wasn't bizarre enough, Sherwood then urged Grimsdale to sit . alongside his assistants Les Ferdinand and Steffen Freund as . open-mouthed players looked on in disbelief. The supporter accepted the invitation before returning to his usual seat close to dugout soon after. In . his post-match press conference Sherwood revealed that Grimsdale is a . regular at White Hart Lane who gives him pointers on where he is going wrong. He . said: 'That guy's an expert, seriously. Every week he tells me what to . do. So I gave him the opportunity to do the job. He bottled it at first . but then he swallowed it. It was just good banter. 'There . were a couple I could have picked. We've got the police looking for him . because he's nicked the gilet. But it's fine, he can have it.' On . whether or not he has the backing of other Tottenham supporters, . Sherwood added: 'Everyone I speak to is quite genuine and gives me a lot . of appreciation, to be honest.' Have a seat: Sherwood offers the fan to sit alongside his assistants Les Ferdinand and Steffen Freund . Lucky day: The fan can't believe his good fortune, while Ferdinand looks amused at the situation . Grimsdale spoke to BBC Radio Five Live after the game to discuss his experience and claim Tottenham's treatment of Sherwood has not been very good. He said: 'It was a great bit of humour and something I won't forget. 'To be fair to him he's not fighting with the fans. He's always happy to chat and have a laugh with us. I called a couple of subs he should make and it just so happened he made them. 'We were 3-0 up at the time and I thought it would be a good chance to bring some youngsters on and he said ""you know what, why don't you come and have a go"". It was just surreal. I didn't know what to make of it, or if I would get in trouble for going over the barrier. 'I'm a lifelong Spurs fan so I'm not going to turn down the chance to sit in the hotseat. As I was walking away he said ""you can keep the jacket"" and he shook my hand and patted me on the back. 'I don't think he has been treated particularly fairly by the club and sections of the fans. No one in his position would have turned the job down and he has done the best he can do. 'Performances have been more exciting than under the previous manager. But he's a bit of a wideboy and maybe he has just rubbed people up the wrong way.' Laughing matter: When asked about the situation afterwards Sherwood claimed it was just banter .

"A man whose dog savaged an 11-month-old girl to death has admitted sending her mother a torrent of vile abuse on Snapchat after she dumped him. Lee Christopher Wright of Blackburn, Lancashire, had been in a relationship with Chloe King, mother of Ava-Jayne Corless, who was mauled to death by the American pitbull terrier while she slept in February. Wright and Miss King were watching television downstairs when the dog brutally savaged Ava-Jayne, and although they tried to rescue her from the jaws of the pet, she suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital. Lee Wright, who appeared at Blackburn Magistrates Court after admitting sending abusive messages to former girlfriend Chloe King, whose daughter Ava-Jayne Corless was mauled to death . Wright owned the American pitbull terrier, which mauled the 11-month-old while she slept. She suffered horrific injuries and later died in hospital . Following the attack by Wright's dog, Miss King ended the relationship. But today Blackburn Magistrates Court heard that Wright then sent abusive messages on Snapchat to his ex-partner telling her it was her fault baby Ava-Jayne was dead - and in one posting threatened to kill her. By the time they reached Ava-Jayne she had suffered catastrophic injuries. Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting, said Miss King ended the relationship after the dog attack and that from February until July, Wright had sent her numerous Snapchat messages. Miss Akhtar said that the messages told Miss King that she was responsible for Ava-Jayne's death. The court heard how Miss King then bumped into the defendant in August and he was very apologetic.

The court heard how Wright sent messages saying Miss King was to blame for her daughter's death . However, when she then started chatting with him again through the internet, he turned nasty. Miss Akhtar explained: 'She tried to reason with him, pleading with him for it to stop but they got worse. 'He then sent Miss King a list of things he was going to do before he killed himself and then made the threat to kill her and have sex with her body.' Paul Huxley, defending, said his client felt 'utter regret' about what his dog did in February. 'Since then he has been the subject of abuse from members of the public', said Mr Huxley. 'Miss King’s mother, Claire King, has called him a murderer in a text message.' Ava-Jayne was 11-months-old when she was brutally savaged by the dog at Wright's home in Blackburn, Lancashire . Ava-Jayne was sleeping while her mother and Wright watched TV downstairs when the dog savaged her . Mr Huxley said it was a terrible situation for everyone involved. He added: 'It wasn’t his fault the child died, that was the last thing he wanted. 'He has let the stress, which he is not sharing with anyone, bubble over. 'It has come out in comments to Chloe who is also going through a terrible time. It has been the worst year of both of their lives to say the least.' Wright pleaded guilty to harassing Miss King and he was remanded in custody for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. He has also pleaded not guilty to possessing a dangerous dog and is awaiting trial at magistrates court on that matter.","Lee Wright was in a relationship with Chloe King, mother of Ava-Jayne Corless .

"She's Burberry's flawless campaign star and never has a hair out of place on the catwalk, but Suki Waterhouse has revealed she had a total style faux pas when she met President Obama. The model was lucky enough to join her boyfriend Bradley Cooper at the White House State Dinner earlier this year but things didn't go quite to plan. Speaking about getting ready for the big event in a rare interview, the 22-year-old told Grazia: 'My hair and make up was organised for me in Washington. So this guy comes over and says he hasn’t worked since the '80s. 'I can’t even describe what happened next. There was blue eye shadow up to my brows, my fringe was backcombed…Seriously I walked out to show my boyfriend and we were on the floor dying. I had to wet my hair and grease it back so I looked like crap to meet the President!'. The night in question: Suki Waterhouse was lucky enough to join boyfriend Bradley Cooper at the White House State Dinner earlier this year but little did we know, she had a huge faux pas before . Suki and Bradley have been enjoying a long-distance romance after the two first met in London a year ago. The British model talked about that fated night at the Elle Style Awards in London in an interview in Rollacoaster magazine recently. Can you tell? Suki explains that when she had her make-up done there was blue eye shadow up to her brows and her fringe was backcombed. ' I had to wet my hair and grease it back so I looked like crap to meet the President!,' she said . Suki proudly shared the story of their first night together, where they ended up in a night club, digging up the dancefloor. 'We were dancing at the after-party, and he asked me if I fancied going to a club. We went to Cirque Le Soir in London - and he’s a ridiculously good dancer, yes. But I’m a serious dancer too, so I don’t know if I was fully concentrating on that. 'We make a pretty good duo, though.”She also discussed why her relationship with Bradley, 39, is rarely brought up in interviews: 'Yes, I never get asked about it, because they all think I’m not going to answer them.‘ . Though at first the couple were rarely seen out together, over the last few months, Suki has been accompanying Bradley to a number of award shows and events - they even double dated with Sienna Miller and Tom Sturridge. As well as dating a Hollywood heartthrob, Suki's career is sky-rocketing. In the last month alone Suki Waterhouse has closed the Burberry show, landed herself a role in a Hollywood blockbuster and designed her own range of sneakers. Clearly not content with her lot (in between dating Bradley and partying with Cara Delevingne), the 22-year-old model is now the star of Burberry's latest beauty campaign. The quintessentially British fashion house, which made its first foray into beauty this year, have called on their fashion family member Suki to showcase their new mascaras, eyeliners and brow definer. Burberry girl: Suki Waterhouse is already Burberry's golden girl - she closed the SS15 show - and now, the fashion house have called on the 22-year-old to front the new Burberry Beauty eye collection . Developed by Burberry Make-up Artistic Consultant Wendy Rowe, who glammed-up the girls for the SS15 show, and under the creative direction of Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Bailey, the new products promise a 'youthful look of naturally sculpted, full brows with defined eyes and enhanced lashes'. Speaking about the new range, Wendy Rowe said: 'The new Burberry make-up products effortlessly create the illusion of a natural, larger eye. 'In order to enhance the lash and make it as natural and full as possible we have developed two new mascaras, each giving a slightly different finish.' Get the look: The new range of mascaras, eyeliners and brow definers promise a 'youthful look of naturally sculpted, full brows with defined eyes and enhanced lashes' Behind the scenes with Suki: The new Burberry make-up products aim to create the illusion of a natural, larger eye, as showcased by Miss Waterhouse . There's also a kohl eyeliner and eyebrow definer, which are no doubt loved by Burberry's other campaign stars, Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss. Suki's life as a model began after being scouted in a pub when she was 16. She quit school to pursue a career in the fashion industry and Suki is now one of Britain's most famous model faces. By the age of 19, she was modelling lingerie for Marks and Spencer and has since worked with Swatch, H&M and Pepe Jeans. After several seasons of modelling for Italian trainers brand Superga, the 22-year-old has now designed her own range of super-cool sneakers. And clearly not content with just fashion, Suki will try her hand at acting as Marlene in the upcoming sequel The Divergent Series: Insurgent, based on the book of the same name.

"With the World Cup countdown under way, there was a moment when Joe Hart squared up to Kevin Nolan after the West Ham midfielder nobbled him with a reckless first-half challenge. These are the final-day fears for any top player, the injury scares that can ruin the best-laid plans of any England manager. On Sunday, as Hart kept his 14th clean sheet of another title-winning season for Manchester City, he came through unscathed. Roy Hodgson can breathe a sigh of relief. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Joe Hart training for England . Champion: Joe Hart holds aloft the Premier League title after Manchester City beat West Ham 2-0 on Sunday . Injury scare: Hart collides with Kevin Nolan (centre) during their end of season match at the Etihad Stadium . At a Vauxhall car plant in Luton on Monday, City’s first-choice keeper will be named in England’s 23-man squad for Brazil. Hart will recall that the wheels came off for him earlier in the season, notably in defeats at Aston Villa and Chelsea. He spent a few weeks in the cooler, taken out of the team after his costly error at Stamford Bridge. By the time City played their next game, in the Capital One Cup at Newcastle, Costel Pantilimon had taken his place in the team. The fightback began there. On Sunday, as Hart wrapped up his second Premier League title-winners’ medal, he appeared back to his commanding best. He was submerged by City fans as they raced on to the pitch to salute their heroes and laud Manuel Pellegrini for his first league title. As inept and lamentable as West Ham were, Hart was safe and secure in goal. Back in August, Hart began the season with a clean sheet as City beat Newcastle  4-0. On Sunday he finished it with another. He is in good nick, enjoying his football again after that early-season wobble. Bad patch: Hart (centre) was dropped from the City team after his error allowed Chelsea win 2-1 in October . Support: Despite his poor form, England boss Roy Hodgson insisted Hart would be his number one choice . This is all good news for Hodgson, who . backed him throughout his difficult period. Even when Hart was unable to . force his way back into the City team, Hodgson picked him to start a . prestige friendly against Germany at Wembley in November. Hodgson always said Hart would be his first choice at the World Cup and he will be in goal when England face Italy in Manaus on June 14. England - and Hart - could do without City’s trip to Abu Dhabi this week to show off the Premier League trophy and a game against Al Ain. Hodgson has been assured Hart and James Milner, another England player in decent nick, will be rested from Thursday’s friendly. They will return at the end of the week before travelling to the Algarve for the start of England’s World Cup preparations.","Joe Hart nearly suffered an injury scare during Man City's victory .

The 35-year-old also said she had difficulty bending and stretching, had to be accompanied when outdoors and used crutches to get about. Scroll down for video . Kelly Hopton claimed her back injury was so bad she needed crutches to walk and had difficulty stretching . But a court heard officials from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) launched an investigation last year after receiving a tip-off. They found a Youtube clip where Hopton revealed her life had been transformed by surgery and bragged 'I never thought I'd walk again but now I'm walking on sunshine.' Hopton appears smiling at the camera in the seven-minute long video - which was posted on June 2011 by spinal surgeon Manoj Krishna. Asked how far she can walk after the surgery, she replied: 'As far as you want me to.' She then goes on to say: 'I went into the hospital in a wheelchair and nine days afterwards I walked out and feel like a new woman.' Investigators also secretly filmed Hopton carrying bags of shopping, bending and stretching while on three trips to supermarkets in Lichfield, Staffordshire. She was unavailable for comment this evening at her £100,000 detached home in Rugeley, Staffs. Burton Magistrates Court heard the DWP did not dispute that she had a medical complaint or had been previously entitled to benefits. But the Government department said her capabilities had been significantly improved by her 'miraculous' March 2011 operation. Investigators secretly filmed Hopton carrying bags of shopping, bending and stretching in the supermarket . Officials from the Department of Work and Pensions launched an investigation last year after receiving a tip-off . Hopton pleaded not guilty to failing to report a change in circumstances in a fraud that involved pocketing £13,866.40 of taxpayers cash between June 2011 and November 2013. The court was shown secret footage of Hopton loading shopping bags into her car and bending down in the aisle at Tesco and Morrisons in Lichfield. JPs were also shown a YouTube interview and an article in a women's magazine where she bragged about her 'miracle' recovery next to a photo captioned 'delighted to be back on my feet'. In the Youtube footage, the smiling teacher says: 'It's a miracle, a definite miracle. I wasn't Kelly before, I am Kelly now. 'After my surgery, within a week Mr Krishna got me off all medication, all the morphine, which was another miracle. 'With Mr Krishna's help, my job is now still mine. He assured the school that by August I'm going to be fit as a fiddle. 'Before the surgery I was in a wheelchair, I couldn't walk. I was bed-ridden, I had to have a catheter in because I couldn't get to the toilet. 'I had no quality of life. I have a young daughter and the guilt of not being able to look after her was immense, just a very very dark time.' Hopton told the court she had lied in the YouTube video, claiming she had been told what to say by other people . The DWP says it does not dispute that she had a medical complaint or had been previously entitled to benefits, but that her capabilities had 'significant improved' by her 'miraculous' March 2011 operation. In the YouTube video, Hopton says at her most medicated time she was on 50 tablets a day and drank from a bottle of liquid morphine to cope with her back pain. In an interview with 'My Weekly' magazine, Hopton described how she first underwent surgery after suffering back pain in 2008. In the interview Hopton explained how specialist Mr Krishna diagnosed her with prolapsed discs in her spinal cord after just 20 minutes. She then had titanium discs and rods inserted into her spine in a six-hour operation in March 2011 and told the magazine that when she woke up 'the pain had gone'. Hopton pleaded not guilty to failing to report a change in circumstances in a fraud that involved pocketing £13,866.40 of taxpayers cash between June 2011 and November 2013 . She said: 'As I got used to walking again, I put 'Walking on Sunshine' on my iPod. The lyrics were so happy and inspiring. 'Jason (my husband) and I often talk about the little things I took for granted that I could no longer do - chasing Olivia (daughter) in the garden, saying goodnight to her in her bed - even brushing my teeth. 'Now, every pain-free moment is sacred. 'I used to think I'd never walk again, Now, I'm walking on sunshine.' Hopton told the court she had lied in the video and magazine article - claiming she had been told what to say by other people. But she maintained that her lies had been told about the miracle recovery and not to continue receiving benefits illegally. Hopton also told JPs she was still in pain and had been entitled to claim the payouts. After the case, a spokesperson for the DWP said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. 'Don't wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.' Magistrates convicted Hopton and fined her £440 with £100 costs and a £75 victim surcharge following a trial on Tuesday. She was  also ordered to pay back exactly £13,866.40p in disability benefits she had dishonestly claimed.","Kelly Hopton claimed back injury was so bad she needed crutches to walk .

"A university student who dreamed of becoming a solicitor has been jailed for slapping a woman in the face with his penis after she fell asleep at a house party. John Luke Dale, 21, stripped down to his boxers and shoved his manhood in the young woman's face before hitting her across her cheek with his penis at the party in Nottingham. The criminology undergraduate's actions only came to light when a friend, who filmed the entire act on his mobile phone, showed the video to his workmates. John Luke Dale, 21, who was studying at Nottingham Trent University (pictured) at the time of the incident, stripped to his boxers and shoved his manhood in the young woman's face before hitting her with his penis . Police were called and Dale, from Monkston, Milton Keynes, who was studying at Nottingham Trent University at the time of the incident, was arrested. He admitted sexual assault and was jailed for nine months at Nottingham Crown Court last month. Details of the incident were revealed this week after lawyers tried to overturn the sentence at the Court of Appeal. However, on Tuesday,  three top judges rejected the case. Refusing the appeal, Judge Alistair McCreath, sitting with Lord Justice McCombe and Mr Justice Spencer, said the offence had caused the woman 'obvious and significant distress'. Judge McCreath said: 'One can see in stark form the distress caused to the victim of this offence and the continuing nature of it. 'The sentence which the judge imposed cannot possibly be wrong in principle. 'She struck a balance between the mitigating and aggravating factors and exercised her judgement in a manner which was open to her.' In a victim impact statement, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said the incident had made her feel violated. She said: 'It makes me think that it could still be out there in someone's possession and that anyone could have it. 'Knowing that it could exist petrifies me.' Dale, from Milton Keynes, was jailed for nine months at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) last month and had an appeal to overturn his sentence rejected by the Court of Appeal this week. He has since left the university . Trevor Burke QC, defending, argued that Dale's sentence was too tough and claimed that the young man had received no sexual gratification from the act. He said: 'It was a stupid drunken incident that lasted a very brief period of time, where he slaps his flaccid penis on the head of a sleeping woman. 'It was extremely unpleasant, but not driven by any sexual motivation on his part.' Mr Burke said the student had done everything he could to make up for the offence, vowing to keep away from the university until his victim had graduated. He had moved back to his family home, where he was being kept under curfew by his parents and working for his dad to earn money to pay the victim compensation. Mr Burke said that potentially losing his studies and hopes of a career as a solicitor were additional punishments which meant a prison sentence could have been avoided.","John Luke Dale stripped to boxers and shoved his manhood in woman's face .

"The Muslim convert who gunned down a Canadian soldier outside Parliament  lived at a homeless shelter in the days before the shooting and told residents the end of the world was coming. Police collected Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's belongings from the Ottawa Mission homeless shelter after the shooting on Wednesday, CBC reported. He stayed there for between one and two weeks, and in that time he had befriended two other men and they had been trying to track down a vehicle, residents told the Ottawa Citizen. Residents often saw him chatting with the two English-speaking men, both in their 20s, about Islam but ever since the shooting, they have not seen them, the residents told the Citizen. Scroll down for video . 'Bizarre': Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who shot dead a Canadian soldier on Wednesday, had stayed at a homeless shelter in the days before the shooting where he told residents 'the world is about to end' One resident said the men had looked 'shifty'. 'There was three of them all the time going around with each other,' he said. 'He was teaching them about Islam and stuff. He had them doing the Islamic prayer.' Resident John Clothier added to CBC: 'I overheard him trying to buy a car. A small car, because his car had a misfire, he said. He wanted to buy a car, desperately, and he was trying to get help from everybody in here to get a car. 'People were trying to help him, but we didn't understand what he was up to.' The 'bizarre' man would tell the residents that they should be praying five times a day 'because the end of the world is coming', Clothier recalled. Other residents told the Citizen that he had said he was anti-Canadian and that his relatives had fought in Libya. Previous reports said his father had fought in Libya in 2011. Shelter: He stayed at the Ottawa Mission, pictured, for around 10 days before the shooting and while there, he met two young English-speaking men in their 20s and taught them about Islam, other residents said . Another resident told the Citizen that Bibeau would tell people he was on a no-fly list and that his mother was 'some mucky-muck in the government'. Bibeau had indeed had his passport seized by the government and was the son of Susan Bibeau, who is on the country's immigration board. 'Nine times out of 10, you pass it off as bulls***,' the resident, Duncan, said. Clothier said that authorities arrived at the shelter on Wednesday evening to collect Bibeau's belongings and spent a lengthy period of time in the shelter's computer room. The Ottawa Mission's executive director, Peter Tilley, could not confirm if the gunman had stayed there because of privacy reasons, but he said the shelter was working closely with police. There are records of him previously staying at other shelters, including a Salvation Army homeless shelter and a rooming house in Vancouver. Attack: On Wednesday, he fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo as he stood guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. Police, bystanders and soldiers are seen helping Cirillo after he was hit . Victim: Cirillo, left in his uniform and right with his six-year-old son and one of his dogs, was a single father . On Wednesday morning, he approached Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, as he stood guard at the National War Memorial and shot him in the abdomen. Cirillo, a single father, died of his injuries. Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, then ran inside the Parliament, where he opened gunfire. He was eventually stopped by Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, who shot him dead. On Thursday, Vickers received a standing ovation from MPs as he returned to the House of Commons and Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the country would not be intimidated by terrorists. After the shooting, it emerged tha the gunman, whose full name was Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau, had recently converted to Islam and had a lengthy history of crime, including arrests and jail time for drugs charges, robbery and assault. He had also recently been designated a 'high-risk traveler' by the Canadian government and had his passport seized. Sadness: The Canadian flag flies at half staff on top of the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa . Showing their respects: Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen lay flowers at the memorial . On Thursday, his mother Susan released a statement saying she had been shocked to learn of the tragic events and, because she had long been estranged from her son, she was unable to shed much light on why he carried out the crime. She said she and her ex-husband felt pain for the victims - not for the loss of their son. 'We are both crying for them,' she told the Associated Press. 'We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time.'","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau stayed at Ottawa Mission for around 10 days before his shooting spree; on Wednesday, police officers collected his belongings .

"UKIP could form a tactical alliance with the Tories or Labour if the party wins a string of seats at the next election. Nigel Farage signalled the possibility of a new ‘confidence and supply’ policy instead of a coalition deal. Under such an agreement, his party would back key measures such as the Budget, but would not hold ministerial posts. Asked yesterday whether he would join a coalition, the Ukip leader said there were ‘other ways’ of doing it. Nigel Farage has signalled that his party could back a 'confidence and supply' arrangement in the event of a hung parliament next year- agreeing to back key policies but voting freely on everything else . ‘I don’t honestly think that has to be done just because the Liberal Democrats did that,’ he added. ‘There are other ways you can support a minority government in motions of confidence or supporting some of the key bills. There are ways of doing it. ‘Do I think we’ve got momentum behind us? Do I think we are picking up support across the board and do I think there’s a possibility that in May we will find ourselves in a position of a hung parliament where we have serious influence on the House of Commons? Well, yes, that’s a possibility’. Mr Farage was given tacit support from Douglas Carswell, who will sit in the Commons as the sole Ukip MP from Monday. Douglas Carswell has distanced himself from Nigel Farage’s (pictured) controversial remarks about foreigners – insisting he has ‘no difficulty with Britain as it is today’. In his victory speech, Mr Carswell declined to endorse some of his leader’s views and revealed he had sought assurances that the party was not racist. Mr Farage told his party’s spring conference this year that parts of Britain were like a foreign land and claimed he felt uncomfortable when he heard only foreign accents on the train. The comments plunged him into his biggest political storm. After holding his Clacton seat by a landslide, Mr Carswell urged his colleagues to show ‘compassion as well as passion’ and to be welcoming to first and second-generation migrants. Mr Carswell, who supports securing Britain’s borders from illegal migrants, but believes that immigration is beneficial, tried to claim Mr Farage had been misunderstood. As to whether he agreed with his view, Mr Carswell said: ‘I have no difficulty with Britain as Britain is today.’ But he admitted Ukip’s views on race were his biggest concern about joining. ‘I would never have joined a racist party’, he said. Mr Carswell’s advice for his new party was: ‘Humility when we win. Modesty when we are proved right. If we speak with passion let it be tempered with compassion.’ He added: ‘Let us be a party for all Britain – and all Britons, first and second generation as much as any other.’ And he insisted he and Mr Farage saw eye to eye on most issues. ‘Sometimes, the things that people say in politics … are misrepresented in a way that doesn’t actually reflect what was meant.’ The newly elected MP for Clacton said he expected to back a Bill to recall errant members – one of his pet projects – when it is presented by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith. Mr Carswell said he may support George Osborne’s Budget next April if it contained sensible measures to build on the economic recovery. But he said he would also back ‘good ideas’ from Labour and the Lib Dems, adding: ‘I can’t afford to be tribal now.’ Mr Farage downplayed remarks he made in a magazine interview claiming he would like to be Minister for Europe in a future coalition, saying ‘I don’t think they would have me.’ But a confidence and supply deal is becoming a real possibility because the polls indicate that neither Labour nor the Conservatives will win a majority next May and the largest party may choose to govern alone. Ukip feels it has little to gain from coalition when it can criticise both parties from the sidelines. Many Conservatives also reject the idea, saying voters would see it as a ‘stitch-up’. Confidence and supply deals are struck when the largest party does not win the 326 seats required for a majority in the House of Commons – or if it loses its majority because of defections or by-elections. The arrangement effectively means backing the bigger party in no-confidence votes (‘confidence’) and allowing it to pass laws to raise money (‘supply’) for their policies. But in reality Ukip would demand concessions – while still allowing their MPs to speak their minds rather than having to support the Government. Such an agreement took place in the ‘Lib-Lab Pact’ of 1977, when James Callaghan’s Labour government took power with a majority of just three seats but then lost MPs to by-elections. He asked David Steel for 13 Liberal MPs to vote with the government in exchange for accepting their proposals. However, the deal lasted just 15 months. Faced with the same situation in 2010, the Lib Dems instead opted for a full Coalition under which MPs hold ministerial posts. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Work and Pensions Secretary, wrote yesterday: ‘[Voters] are clearly tired of the Westminster games played out, the perception that in Westminster politicians make deals to help themselves and not the public. ‘That’s why I don’t believe making an electoral pact with Ukip – as some in my party have called for – is right. ‘Another Westminster stitch-up is not the answer to an electorate that wants to make a choice.’ Peter Bone, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Wellingborough, said yesterday’s by-election results in Essex and the northern seat of Heywood made the need for electoral pacts with Ukip all the more urgent. ‘We need to lock David Cameron and Nigel Farage up in a room together until they come up with a solution’, he said. Newly elected MP Douglas Carswell (pictured with Mr Farage today) has said he may support George Osborne's budget next April, but is open to 'good' suggestions from Labour and the Lib Dems . ‘One way would be Ukip candidates supporting MPs locally who want to leave Europe, whether that is Tories or Labour people, they could endorse them. ‘At the end of the day, if the Tories and Ukip had run together in both Clacton and Heywood on a centre-Right ticket they would have won. ‘And it would be enormously disappointing if Labour get in next year with 33 per cent of the vote because we have split the vote between us.’ He dismissed the idea that the Conservatives and Ukip no longer have similar policies. ‘They are for coming out of Europe, against mass immigration and the folly of wind farms – these are views shared by Conservatives across the country.’ The Tories, who may fall short of a majority but remain the largest party next year, have discussed confidence and supply with the Democratic Unionist Party – which has eight MPs – if it takes the Conservatives over the finishing line. One significant factor in Clacton was a recent savagely anti-Ukip column in The Times by the gay ex-Tory MP Matthew Parris – a brilliant writer who is very much on the liberal wing of the party. Here, we publish an abridged version of an article that was considered so damaging to the Tory cause that Ukip reproduced it in its Clacton campaign literature. Now Nigel Farage’s supporters are offering to fund visits by Mr Parris to the party’s other target seats . . . Don’t buy the too-easy media picture of a rancid or untended town, or of bitter people; but understand that Clacton-on-Sea is going nowhere. Its voters are going nowhere, it’s rather sad, and there’s nothing more to say. This is Britain on crutches. This is tracksuit-and-trainers Britain, tattoo-parlour Britain, all-our-yesterdays Britain. So of course Ukip will do well in the by-election. My aim, though, is not to deny Ukip its likelihood of victory. They make a good fit for Clacton. Somebody has to represent the static caravans and holiday villages, and the people and places that for no fault of their own are not getting where a 21st century Britain needs to be going. Matthew Parris' column was considered so harmful to Tory chances in Clacton that Ukip supporters are now offering to pay for visits by him to other target seats . Nor do I deny that we Conservatives, if we tried hard enough, could get some of these voters back. There are many in a place like this who might be attracted again to the Tories by a noisy display of hostility towards immigration-and-Europe, political correctness and health-and-safety: hostility to a Britain that has forgotten the joys of Ken Dodd, meat pies, smoking in pubs and the Bee Gees. No, my aim is to ask this: is that where the Conservative Party wants to be? Is it where the Tories need to be if they’re to gather momentum in this century, rather than slowly lose it? Or do we need to be with the Britain that has its career prospects ahead and not behind, that can admire immigrants and want them with us, that doesn’t want to spend its days buying scratchcards and its evenings smoking in pubs, that’s amazed at all the fuss about whether gays should marry, that travels in Europe and would hesitate to let those links go? I am not arguing that we should be careless of the needs of struggling people and places such as Clacton. But I am arguing – if I am honest – that we should be careless of their opinions. Some of the Tory Right want to ... invest our political future in the disappointed, the angry, the nostalgic and the fearful. This is not a crazy strategy, because the market in pessimism is easy to capture, and easier to hold on to than the market in optimism; there will always be millions of pessimists. But the truth from which the Right hides is this: You cannot look like a party for the resentful and still appeal to the cheerful. If you want to win Cambridge you may have to let go of Clacton. From the train leaving London for Clacton, you can see Canary Wharf, humming with a sense of the possible. You must turn your back on that if you want to go to Clacton. I don’t, and the Tories shouldn’t.","Ukip could support Labour or Tories from sidelines after 2015 election .

"This is the horrifying moment a shopkeeper is repeatedly stabbed during a raid by ski-mask wearing raiders. Gareth Fawkner, 29, and his younger brother Rocky, 18, wore frightening disguises as they burst into a One Stop in Henley Green, Coventry. The violent raid was captured on CCTV cameras fitted at the store and shows Rocky leaping over the counter and knifing the terrified worker in the back and shoulder. Scroll down for video .

Rocky Fawkner can then be seen stabbing the shopkeeper in the back and arm (bottom right) while his brother (pictured wearing a ski mask disguise) approaches in the background . The onslaught only comes to an end when Gareth Fawkner hauls his younger brother away . Rocky Fawkner (left) and his brother Gareth (right) were both jailed for six years each when they appeared at Warwick Crown Court after they were found guilty of robbery . The vicious onslaught only comes to an end when his brother, who is also shown brandishing a knife, hauls him away. The pair, who were helped by another raider, then stuffed cigarettes and alcohol into a duvet cover and made off on a moped. But they were captured when detectives analysed the digital CCTV footage and spotted defects on the clothes which eventually led to the Fawkner brothers being identified. They were both jailed for six years each when they appeared at Warwick Crown Court after they were found guilty of robbery. The court heard Gareth Fawkner committed the raid while on licence for an armed robbery in 2010. He was jailed for five years and four months in July 2010 when he attacked staff and stole cigarettes and alcohol from a Co-Op store in Walsgrave, Coventry. Both denied the robbery along with another in Arena Park in Coventry eight days earlier. The shopkeeper is understood to have made a full recovery. Gareth Fawkner, 29, and his younger brother Rocky, 18, wore frightening ski-mask disguises as they burst into a One Stop in Coventry . The pair, who were helped by another raider, then stuffed cigarettes and alcohol into a duvet cover and made off on a moped . The court heard they threatened a store manager and security guard with knives when their request to 'test ride' a mountain bike at the Decathlon store was refused. After threatening the staff they made off with a £430 mountain bike. Police managed to track down the brothers after close examination of the footage of the One Stop raid. A jacket worn by Rocky Fawkner had a small tear on the side and when police later raided their family home in Wood End in the West Midlands, a top with the same defect was found in a kitchen cupboard. Meanwhile Gareth Fawkner wore a distinctive blue and white tracksuit which officers discovered he had worn six weeks earlier when he was arrested on suspicion of assault. Officers searched an address linked to him, also in Wood End, and uncovered a blue hoodie from a bin which featured the same white trim captured on the CCTV footage. They were captured when detectives analysed the digital CCTV footage and spotted defects on the clothes which eventually led to the Fawkner brothers being identified . Chilling: The knifemen were both jailed for six years each when they appeared at Warwick Crown Court after they were found guilty of robbery . Police also found a pair of Nike trainers worn during the robbery hidden in a tumble dryer. Body 'mapping' experts also assessed the robbers caught on camera and concluded they matched the size and build of the Fawkners. Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Nick Dale, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This case highlights the futility of many crimes and people risking long spells behind bars for very little gain. 'The Fawkner brothers have rightly been handed significant custodial sentences: they used a disproportionate level of violence, far more than was needed to achieve their aims and yet all they got away with was a mountain bike, cigarettes and bottles of alcohol. 'Wearing a face covering does not mean we can't identify offenders and get them sent to jail. 'They targeted amenities in their own neighbourhood and their actions left local people shocked and disgusted. 'Communities should not have to tolerate this sort of crime; anyone with information about people committing this sort of offence, or who is dealing in stolen goods, should tell us so we can take action.'","Gareth Fawkner and younger brother Rocky wore disguises during robbery .

"Hundreds of high profile media personalities have banded together in bid to save ABC's award winning current affairs show Lateline. Journalists from the government-funded broadcaster are lobbying the ABC board, signing a petition to keep the program which has been on the air for nearly 25 years. The Lateline staff and many of the ABC's top foreign correspondents have been joined by an estimated 350 ABC staff, including radio presenter Mark Colvin, 7.30 host Leigh Sales, newsreader Juanita Phillips and Ian Henderson, and journalist Sarah Ferguson in the campaign to keep the program on air. Co-host of Lateline Tony Jones is considered by many to be the ABC's most senior current affairs nightly interviewer, and would be left with Q&A as the only program he hosts. The petition reads: 'Lateline has a proud 25-year history of breaking stories, hard-hitting, exclusive interviews and setting agendas. It's a program regarded as compulsory viewing by political and business leaders. 'Do not let this important creative team be disbanded at the very time Australia needs strong, independent media, with newspapers declining and critical reporting under challenge!' The program, whose format consists of investigations and robust political interviews, has won many awards and has been involved in groundbreaking investigations such as the Royal Commission into child sexual abuse and exploring poverty and abuse in indigenous communities. Despite a pre-election promise from Prime Minister Tony Abbott that there would be no budget cuts to the ABC, the broadcaster  has come under pressure from the Federal government's funding cutbacks. Emma Alberici, one of Lateline's co-hosts, is understood to have signed the petition to save the program . If the program is axed, it will be the latest cancellation as a result of severe budget cuts faced by the broadcaster. ABC managing director Mark Scott said in a speech last month that the ABC was in the process of reassessing the programs on air. 'We must accept that, in the fierce contest for audiences, where old alliances no longer work and where friends can become rivals, the ABC has to robustly review its programming and services, find new ways to keep the audiences we have and to attract new ones,' he said. 'We will make the investment necessary to deliver quality programming. But it will be prudent and we will need to make careful judgments about the audience return.' Co-host of Lateline Tony Jones is considered by many to be the ABC's most senior current affairs nightly interviewer, and would be left with Q&A as the only program he hosts. A public petition has been reported to be in the works by activist organisation Get Up! to add to the efforts of the internal campaign launched by staff of the ABC. Other programs that are being considered for cancellation include radio current affairs programs such as PM and The World Today.","Top tier ABC journalists have started a petition to save the program, including Leigh Sales, Juanita Phillips and Sarah Ferguson .

The gates at the Cardiff City Stadium, which carry a memorial plaque to Jock Stein, who died at the club’s old ground while managing Scotland 1985, were re-painted on Friday, but the words were still visible. The decision of owner Vincent Tan to rebrand the club from blue to red has incensed Cardiff fans, who have staged regular protests throughout a turbulent season.

"Firefighters have walked out on for a four-day strike ahead of a series of firework displays across the country, leaving the public in a 'vulnerable position'. Members of the Fire Brigades Union in England left their stations at 6pm and will not return until 6pm on Tuesday, the evening before Bonfire Night. People have been warned to be extra vigilant, with London Fire Brigade saying it might not put out small grass fires or help anyone stuck in a lift during the strike. Strike: National Fire Brigade members pose for photographs as they protest outside Luton Fire Station tonight . Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service is the only English brigade not striking, after a letter from the service warned firefighters that it would be able to identify exactly who had been protesting. The West Yorkshire brigade warned that the service and the public will be left in a 'vulnerable position', telling people to take extra care to ensure their own safety. Meanwhile the London brigade said it might not attend rubbish or small grass fires or help anyone shut in a lift during the strike. Police officers will escort fire engines in the capital to and from fires but will not fight flames themselves. Metropolitan Police (MPS) Commander Dave Musker said: 'The MPS is here to protect the public; we do not have the training or capability to deal with fires. 'The police role at the scene of a fire is to facilitate the other emergency services, to enable them to do their job. Police officers are not trained firefighters; however, their primary concern is to save lives, and any officer in this situation will use their judgement to decide whether a rescue attempt can be made without increasing the risk to their own or other people's lives.' Picket lines were mounted outside fire stations today and will continue throughout the next few days. Fire brigades again launched contingency plans, including hiring contract staff to cover for striking firefighters, but the public were warned to be extra vigilant, especially if they attend a firework event. The Government has been accused of showing 'contempt' for public sector workers amid continued deadlock in the long-running dispute in England. The Fire Brigades Union hit back at Government statements that firefighters will continue to receive one of the best pension packages of any worker, even after reforms to their pension scheme. General secretary Matt Wrack said: 'We have a Government of millionaires who are wrecking the pensions of firefighters and other public sector workers while the real scandal is that their own pensions are by far the most generous anywhere in the public sector. 'This is a case of those at the top getting more while everyone else is robbed blind. Firefighters are sickened by the Government's 'snouts in the trough' approach to this issue. 'How can it be remotely fair that the Prime Minister, already a millionaire, enjoys a far greater subsidy from his employer in absolute and proportional terms than a firefighter who is earning less than £30,000 a year? It is sickening hypocrisy.' Picket lines were mounted outside fire stations tonight and will continue throughout the next few days . TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Once again the Government is showing its contempt for public service workers. Evidence warns that raising the normal retirement age for firefighters would lead to older fighters facing no job and no pension after years of good service. 'This same evidence has already led to concessions being made in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland - but the Westminster Government has chosen to walk away from the negotiating table. 'We are very concerned about the risks to firefighters, and those who rely on the fire service, when firefighters are forced to stay in frontline service until they reach the age of 60.' Industrial action in Wales have been averted. A series of strikes have been held over the past 18 months in protest at changes to pensions and the retirement age, which the union claimed could lead to firefighters losing their jobs if they fail fitness tests in their late 50s. Fiona Twycross, Labour's fire spokeswoman on the London Assembly, said: 'It is deeply disappointing that we have got to this position, but it seems clear the Government is set on escalating this dispute.' Fire Minister Penny Mordaunt said: 'All fire and rescue authorities have robust and well-tested plans in place that include back-up support if needed. Public safety is the primary focus and if anyone needs emergency assistance, they should dial 999. 'It is regrettable that the Fire Brigades Union has announced this strike action, which is unnecessary and the aim of which is unclear. 'Pension regulations were laid in Parliament on Tuesday after extensive consultation and amendment. 'The Government recognises the role firefighters play in keeping the public safe and has worked hard to give them one of the most generous pensions in the public sector. We are also consulting on changes to ensure that no firefighter aged 55 or over will face a risk of being left without a job or a good pension. 'Under the new scheme, nearly three-quarters of firefighters will see no change in their pension age in April 2015. 'A firefighter who earns £29,000 will still be able to retire after a full career aged 60 and get a £19,000-a-year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension. An equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much. 'Our thanks are with those who are working to keep the public safe over this period.' Roy Wilsher, the Chief Fire Officers Association's director of operations, said: 'When the emergency services are called to attend unsafe bonfires or avoidable fire vandalism, it means that operational resources may have to be diverted away from life-threatening accidents and emergencies, with potentially tragic consequences. 'Fire, fireworks and alcohol can be a very dangerous combination at garden and street parties. This year we want bonfire night to be one of the safest on record and therefore we are asking members of the public who are thinking of holding their own bonfire or firework display to consider attending an organised display instead. 'These events are generally safer and more spectacular and therefore more enjoyable for friends and families.'","Firefighters start four-day strike ahead of hundreds of firework displays .

"It is doubtful that many visitors to West Sussex – attracted, perhaps, by horse-racing at Glorious Goodwood or polo at Cowdray Park – give West Chiltington a second glance. They probably mark it down as just another quaint, chocolate-box village, full of 17th Century cottages, where nothing more exciting than the WI fete ever disturbs the peace. But they’d be wrong. For this is a place where all is not as it seems. For one thing, every house in one 50-acre patch of the village is an ingenious fake. West Chiltington was also the scene of a Royal intrigue. Scroll down for video . On the market: A six-bedroom '17th Century' cottage in West Chiltington, West Sussex, is on sale for £1.5m . Far from being centuries-old, the 70 archetypal country cottages in the village were all built in the 1920s, the work of Reginald Fairfax Wells, a bohemian potter and eccentric who professed a love of the more simple things in life. While most builders of the period constructed new homes with slate roofs and light interiors, Wells built his with thatched roofs and walls of whitewashed slurry. The rooms were small with tiny windows, water came from outside wells, and he eschewed modern plumbing. Curiously, these cottages sold like hot cakes, snapped up as weekend boltholes by Wells’s chums in London. The locals, meanwhile, thought Wells quite mad. When the thatch on some of his cottages caught fire, they stood around laughing. As for the Royal link, it was in one of these so-called Wells cottages – Meadowbrook – that Princess Margaret carried out a bizarre love affair. By 1967, her marriage to Lord Snowdon was foundering. In February that year, Snowdon went to Japan and Margaret visited Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and nightclub pianist who had previously been married to Sandra Howard. She is now the wife of former Tory leader Michael Howard. Big home: Old Oaks is two separate cottages which is connected through a corridor . Described by The Times as ‘a harmless loon with a slight but well-bred talent to amuse’, Douglas-Home is said to have played the piano to Margaret at Meadowbrook in the nude. Today, the episode is seldom mentioned. However, Wells cottages are a subject on every estate agent’s lips. Once seen as follies, they have now all been lavishly updated and scores of would-be buyers wait patiently for one to come on the market. Old Oaks – the one that Reginald Wells built for himself – is one such property, currently for sale for £1.5 million. Typically, there is a story behind it. ‘What you have here is actually two cottages,’ says owner Anne Duke, 68, a retired head teacher as she shows me around. ‘Wells lived here with his wife, Resca, but they fell out. Rather than split up, he built another cottage for her, which is joined to the main house by a corridor, so they lived together, yet apart.’ When Anne and her partner, Dudley Broster, 75, moved into Old Oaks seven years ago, it was in a rather sorry state. Royal affair: Princess Margaret had a love affair with Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and nightclub pianist who lived in West Chiltington, in 1967 . There was an ancient shag-pile carpet in the hall, where old-fashioned regency striped wallpaper covered every surface, including the cupboards. The kitchen was dark thanks to its low ceiling, and there was a 1970s-style brown suite in the bathroom. The couple undertook a seven-month renovation project costing about £50,000. In the kitchen, the oak units were repainted, granite worktops were installed, and a roof lantern was then added to make the room much lighter. The entrance hall was made bright and cheerful, the beamed drawing room was smartened up, and instead of a labyrinth of small rooms upstairs, the layout was reconfigured to make a logical spread of six bedrooms, four with en suite bathrooms. Both Anne and Dudley have been married before, and the house is big enough for their four children and ten grandchildren when they visit. Indeed, last year, they managed to entertain 25 friends and family on Boxing Day. There is a twinkling swimming pool outside, but Anne’s favourite spot is undoubtedly the terrace overlooking the lawn. ‘This has been carefully sited to get the sun from the east at coffee time in the morning and again when it’s time for evening G&Ts,’ she says with a smile. ‘Reginald Wells was not the fool everyone thought he was.’ Strutt and Parker, 01403 246790 .","Faux 17th Century cottage in West Chiltington, West Sussex on the market .

"A top secret CIA base in Saudi Arabia where lethal drones strikes have been launched from has been exposed on internet search giant Bing, it was claimed today. A blogger has spotted an unmarked facility that has runways, hangars and what appear to be living quarters and offices buried deep in the desert. It follows claims by the New York Times that it had revealed the CIA uses a base in Saudi Arabia to target Al Qaeda operatives in neighbouring Yemen. Scroll down to explore Bing map . The site believed to be a secret Saudi Arabia drone base that was spotted on the Bing search engine . The unmarked facility that has runways, hangars and what appear to be living quarters and offices . It was from this base that the American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in 2011. Noah Shachtman, who runs Wired's Danger Room blog, said: 'The base's hangars bear a remarkable resemblance to similar structures found on other American drone outposts. 'And its remote location — dozens of miles from the nearest highway, and farther still to the nearest town – suggests that this may be more than the average civilian airstrip.' Shachtman also claimed on Wired he has earned tacit confirmation from two former American intelligence officers that the location is correct. 'I believe it's the facility that the U.S. uses to fly drones into Yemen,' one of them told Shachtman. 'It's out in eastern Saudi Arabia, near Yemen and where the bad guys are supposed to hang out. 'It has those clamshell hangars, which we've seen before associated with U.S. drones.' The drone that killed American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011 . was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia . It is located deep in the desert in Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen, which has been the target of U.S. drone strikes . The other officer described the location as 'way, way out in the Rub al Khali, otherwise known as Hell'. The facility's whereabouts had remained . secret at the request of high-ranking officials, although it was known . that one had been built. Earlier this week a human rights organisation has claimed that up to 54 countries may have helped the CIA to hold terrorism suspects in secret prisons, or turn them over to foreign governments. The revelation comes amid a growing outcry against the Obama administration's use of deadly drones and their use to watch American citizens. Congress is now trying to limit the power the U.S. has to kill suspected terrorists, including American citizens, with drones. US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011. It was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia . In response, the government defended its lethal drone programme by citing the laws that were introduced following the September 11 attacks. Democratic Senator Chris Coons said in a recent: 'It has to be in the agenda of this Congress to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the United States around the world because the original authorisation of use of force, I think, is being strained to its limits,' Congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, said: 'It deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out, kill, eliminate, whatever word you want to use, not just American citizens but other citizens as well.' Hoyer added: 'We ought to carefully review our policies as a country.' Democratic Chairman Robert Menendez and . the panel's top Republican, Senator Bob Corker, both have both quietly . expressed concerns about the deadly operation and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is likely to hold hearings on US drone policy, an aide said on Tuesday. One of the most successful drone . strikes was the one in Yemen that killed three American citizens: Anwar . al-Awlaki, his 16-year-old-son and Samir Khan. Al-Awlaki . was linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting . US and Western interests, including the attempt to down a Detroit-bound . airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010. His son was killed in a separate strike on a suspected al-Qaida den. Khan was an al-Qaida propagandist. White . House spokesman Jay Carney called the strikes 'legal, ethical and wise' and said they are covered by a law that Congress approved allowing the . use of military force against al-Qaida. He added: 'It is a matter of fact . that al-Qaida is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders, . operational leaders of al-Qaida are continually plotting to attack the . United States, plotting to kill American citizens as they did most . horrifically on September 11th of 2001.' The U.S. government can legally order the killing of American citizens if they have senior-level ties to al-Qaida . The use of drones has caused tensions in some countries where civilians have died . Three . days after September 11, Congress approved a law authorising the . military to use 'all necessary and appropriate force' against al-Qaida . and other groups believed to be helping or harbouring the global terror . network, including the use of drone strikes. Because . militants have since splintered into a number of affiliates and . sympathisers the current laws could allow military force against . thousands of people across the Middle East and North Africa who have . limited or no ability to strike the US. Both the CIA and the US military are authorised to remotely pilot unmanned, missile-carrying drones against terror suspects. It's . unknown exactly how many strikes have been carried out, but experts say . that drone attacks in Pakistan are conducted by the CIA, while those in . Yemen and Somalia, for example, are by military forces. 'The base's hangars bear a remarkable resemblance to similar structures found on other American drone outposts.' Noah Shachtman . The . drones have strained diplomacy between the U.S. and the nations where . the strikes are carried out, as civilians have been killed alongside the . targeted terrorists, even though most nations have given Washington at . least tacit agreement to carry out the attacks. A Middle Eastern diplomat said that in Yemen, for example, an increase of U.S. drone strikes last month have killed dozens of people and upset the local public, leading some leaders in Sanaa to reconsider how often they should be used. The Pentagon is also considering basing . surveillance drones in Niger to monitor on burgeoning extremist violence . in North Africa, but it's not clear if they will be armed, it has emerged. The campaign against the use of drones to spy on U.S. citizens has also been growing in momentum. Charlottesville, in . Virginia, became the first city in the United States to pass a . resolution against the use of drones for surveillance against American . citizens. It calls on Congress and the General . Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia to bring in laws 'prohibiting . information obtained from the domestic use of drones from being . introduced into a Federal or State court.' The resolution also 'pledges to abstain from similar uses with city-owned, leased or borrowed drones.' Dede Smith, a council member who voted in favour of the bill, told US News that drones are 'pretty clearly a threat to our constitutional right to privacy.' She added: 'If we don't get out ahead . of it to establish some guidelines for how drones are used, they will be . used in a very invasive way and we'll be left to try and pick up the . pieces.' The campaign has been helped by a . Justice Department memo that has recently surfaced, which show drones . can strike against a wider range of threats than previously believed.","Blogger finds unmarked facility with runways, hangars and living quarters .

"What do Americans really think about Britons? If a recent survey is to be believed, Yanks have the impression that British people are proper, friendly, uptight and obsessed with the Royal Family. The poll of 1,000 Americans suggests Britons are also reserved and witty – when visitors can understand what they’re saying. An American tourist poses for a photo outside Buckingham Palace in London . The study commissioned by British Airways found that as many as a third of US residents ‘love Britain and everything about it’ – except for the ‘terrible’ weather – and they can’t understand the Geordie or Scottish accents. According to Americans, Britons spend their spare time enjoying afternoon tea, watching or playing ‘soccer’, and gardening. Yanks also have the impression that Britons love a good bit of gossip with the neighbours, boozing and creating family trees when they’re not moaning, playing board games or tennis or baking cakes. In the eyes of people from the other side of the pond, UK residents ‘speak properly’, sound really clever and are also extremely polite, the study found. Obsessed?

When they’re spending time in the UK, Americans said they love the English accents, the countryside and London, and they’re big fans of the politeness, Royal Family and fish and chips. But there are a few things they don’t like about Britain, including the impression that its people are ‘a bit stand-offish’ and ‘uptight’. Three in ten Americans said the UK is their favourite country and one in seven said they would move to Britain if they had the chance. Tea time: According to Americans, Britons spend much of their spare time enjoying afternoon tea . And it appears Britons have a lot of positives to say about Americans as they consider them to be extremely patriotic and really friendly, according to the study. One in six Britons thinks Americans are friendlier than adults from the UK, and Britons admitted to being big fans of US giants such as Apple, Microsoft, McDonald’s and KFC, and television shows such as Friends, The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory. Caroline Smith, British Airways Holidays’ USA destination manager, said: ‘It’s perhaps not surprising that our friends in America think of tea when they think about Great Britain.' Cheers: Yanks have the impression that Britons love a good bit of gossip with the neighbours and boozing . She added: ‘And the Royal Family are a big part of our country, so again it may not come as a shock to see that they are one of the first things they think about when discussing our country. ‘It’s true that many of us can be overly polite – we form orderly queues and many say sorry when they haven’t done anything wrong which is quite funny. ‘In more ways than one, the US has hit the nail on the head as we do tend to play up to common stereotypes.’","British Airways asked 1,000 Americans what they love about the UK .

Alana and SBW married in August 2013 after a whirlwind romance, rumoured to have started on Facebook . Williams grew up in New Zealand but moved to Sydney 12 years ago when he was offered a contract to play with the Bulldogs in the NRL's junior grades . 'To be honest when it comes to my private life with my family, I always try to keep it private because every other aspect of my life is so out there in the media,' Williams told The Daily Telegraph earlier in the year. 'That's all I'll say. In regards to being married, that's something I'll keep to myself.' Rumours were rife in May that his 21-year-old wife Alana was expecting their first child, sparked by photographs of Ms Raffie with a suspicious bump while shopping in Sydney.

"Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer has pleaded not guilty to charges involving allegations he head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused to have sex with him. He was arrested on September 17 following the altercation at his Phoenix home in July and was charged with a felony and eight misdemeanors including aggravated assault. During a brief appearance at Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona the 25-year-old denied the accusations, which include throwing a shoe at his 17-month-old son and punching his wife the next day. Following his arrest, Dwyer spent a night in jail and was suspended from all the team's activities. The incident involving his wife, flight attendant Kayla Tobin-Dwyer, 27, occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix home, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp.

She is said to have left the state after the incidents, but came forward a week ago after Dwyer apparently sent suicidal text messages including a photo of a knife. Mrs Tobin-Dwyer is believed to have told authorities that the first alleged assault occurred after she learned he had been contacting another woman on his phone. In the first encounter, police say Dwyer attempted to kiss and undress his wife, but she refused. Someone who heard the argument reported the assault to police, who showed up at the apartment but did not make an arrest. Dwyer hid in a bathroom and the wife denied he was in the home because the running back threatened to kill himself in front of her and their child if she told police about the assault, police said. The next day, Dwyer punched his wife with a closed fist on the left side of her face, according to police. He also punched walls and threw a shoe at his 17-month-old son, who was not injured. As Kayla Dwyer tried to call police, Dwyer allegedly grabbed her cellphone and threw it down from the home's second story. Witnesses told police that Dwyer's wife said, ‘I'm calling the police’ as she held her swollen face and clutched her son. During his police interview, Dwyer is said to have acknowledged hiding in the bathroom when police responded to the first argument and sending a photo of a knife with suicidal threats. Dwyer denied committing an assault, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. He also said his son wasn't hurt in the incident. Jonathan Dwyer was released from jail at around 5am the day after he was arrested after posting a $25,000 cash bond. When asked by reporters if he will ever play football again, he simply replied: 'I will,' according to KPHO. Handcuffed: Phoenix police officers escort Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer,  to the 4th Avenue Jail following his arrest on Wednesday . Dwyer was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device and banned from having contact with his wife and so; he also cannot travel outside Arizona or be in possession of weapons, drugs or alcohol. Neighbors heard a fight and called police, who showed up at the residence but left without making an arrest because Dwyer hid in the bathroom and the woman said no one else was at the home, Sgt. Trent Crump told the Associated Press. 'She said she was in an argument on the phone only,' Crump said. Hot temper: Dwyer denied committing an assault or hurting his son, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home . '[Police officers] were convinced that the fight was verbal [and] that it was called in by a third party,' Crump also told AZ Central. '[The 27-year-old woman] convinced them of that while he was hiding in the home.' The Cardinals released a statement following the arrest saying: 'We became aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are cooperating fully. 'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities. 'We will continue to closely monitor this as it develops and evaluate additional information as it becomes available.' The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues ever since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator. Then Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling. Critics have been calling for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case. Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his attack in the casino elevator. This is the second domestic violence case involving a Cardinals player. Inside linebacker Daryl Washington pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Sidelined: The Cardinals deactivated Jonathan Dwyer from all team activities following his arrest . Athlete: Dwyer, 25, signed with the Cardinals earlier this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four years with the Pittsburgh Steelers . Dwyer was led into the jail in handcuffs to be booked on counts that include aggravated assault causing a fracture and involving a minor, criminal damage and preventing the use of a phone in an emergency. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, said Dwyer has refused all media interviews. Dwyer signed with the Cardinals this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He scored a touchdown last week in Arizona's victory over the New York Giants. His best year for Pittsburgh was 2012 when injuries depleted the team's backfield in the middle of the season and Dwyer filled in and had 100-yard-plus games in consecutive weeks. Dwyer, from Marietta, Georgia, was a sixth-round draft pick of the Steelers out of Georgia Tech in 2010.","The player was arrested in September on aggravated assault charges .

"Lethal United States drones are launched from a top secret base in Saudi Arabia, it has emerged. The CIA uses the base to target Al Qaeda operatives in neighbouring Yemen, according to the New York Times. It was from this base that the American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in 2011. It has also emerged that up to 54 countries may have helped the CIA to hold terrorism suspects in secret prisons, or turn them over to foreign governments, a human rights organisation has claimed. The drone that killed American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011 was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia, it has emerged . The revelation comes amid a growing outcry against the Obama administration's use of deadly drones and their use to watch American citizens. It is the first time the location of the secret drone base has been revealed. It's whereabouts had remained secret at the request of high-ranking officials, although it was known that one had been built. Congress is now trying to limit the power the US has to kill suspected terrorists, including American citizens, with drones. The drone programme is expected to be the major talking point when the Senate Intelligence Committee interviews John Brennan, the White Houses's choice for CIA chief on Thursday. Yesterday the government defended its lethal drone programme by citing the laws that were introduced following the September 11 attacks. Many in Congress now believe the scope of the laws may be too broad. Democratic Senator Chris Coons said in a recent: 'It has to be in the agenda of this Congress to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the United States around the world because the original authorisation of use of force, I think, is being strained to its limits,' Congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, said yesterday, that 'it deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out, kill, eliminate, whatever word you want to use, not just American citizens but other citizens as well.' Hoyer added: 'We ought to carefully review our policies as a country.' Democratic Chairman Robert Menendez and . the panel's top Republican, Senator Bob Corker, both have both quietly . expressed concerns about the deadly operation and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is likely to hold hearings on US drone policy, an aide said on Tuesday. The U.S. government can legally order the killing of American citizens if they have senior-level ties to al-Qaida . The memo outlines for the first time the . Obama administration's decision to kill al-Qaida terror suspects . without any evidence that specific and imminent plots are being planned . against the United States. Earlier this week, a group of 11 Democratic and Republican senators urged President Barack Obama to release a classified Justice Department legal opinion justifying when US counter-terror missions, including drone strikes, can be used to kill American citizens abroad. Without those documents, it's impossible for Congress and the public to decide 'whether this authority has been properly defined, and whether the president's power to deliberately kill Americans is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards,' the senators wrote. 'The threat posed by al-Qaida and its associated forces demands a broader concept of imminence in judging when a person continually planning terror attacks presents an imminent threat,' concluded the document. US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011. It was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia . The memo was immediately decried by civil liberties groups as 'flawed' and 'profoundly disturbing' - especially in light of 2011 US drone strikes in Yemen that killed three American citizens: Anwar al-Awlaki, his 16-year-old-son and Samir Khan. Al-Awlaki was linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting US and Western interests, including the attempt to down a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010. His son was killed in a separate strike on a suspected al-Qaida den. Khan was an al-Qaida propagandist. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the strikes 'legal, ethical and wise' and said they are covered by a law that Congress approved allowing the use of military force against al-Qaida. He added: 'It is a matter of fact . that al-Qaida is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders, . operational leaders of al-Qaida are continually plotting to attack the . United States, plotting to kill American citizens as they did most . horrifically on September 11th of 2001.' Three . days after September 11, Congress approved a law authorising the . military to use 'all necessary and appropriate force' against al-Qaida . and other groups believed to be helping or harbouring the global terror . network, including the use of drone strikes. Because militants have since splintered into a number of affiliates and sympathisers the current laws could allow military force against thousands of people across the Middle East and North Africa who have limited or no ability to strike the US. Both the CIA and the US military are authorised to remotely pilot unmanned, missile-carrying drones against terror suspects. It's unknown exactly how many strikes have been carried out, but experts say that drone attacks in Pakistan are conducted by the CIA, while those in Yemen and Somalia, for example, are by military forces. The drones have strained diplomacy between the US and the nations where the strikes are carried out, as civilians have been killed alongside the targeted terrorists, even though most nations have given Washington at least tacit agreement to carry out the attacks. The use of drones has caused tensions in some countries where civilians have died . A Middle Eastern diplomat said that in Yemen, for example, an increase of US drone strikes last month have killed dozens of people and upset the local public, leading some leaders in Sanaa to reconsider how often they should be used. The Pentagon is also considering basing . surveillance drones in Niger to monitor on burgeoning extremist violence . in North Africa, but it's not clear if they will be armed, it has emerged. The campaign against the use of drones to spy on US citizens has also been growing in momentum. On Monday, Charlottesville, in . Virginia, became the first city in the United States to pass a . resolution against the use of drones for surveillance against American . citizens. It calls on Congress and the General . Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia to bring in laws 'prohibiting . information obtained from the domestic use of drones from being . introduced into a Federal or State court.' The resolution also 'pledges to abstain from similar uses with city-owned, leased or borrowed drones.' Dede Smith, a council member who voted in favour of the bill, told US News that drones are 'pretty clearly a threat to our constitutional right to privacy.' She added: 'If we don't get out ahead . of it to establish some guidelines for how drones are used, they will be . used in a very invasive way and we'll be left to try and pick up the . pieces.' The campaign has been helped by a . Justice Department memo that has recently surfaced, which show drones . can strike against a wider range of threats than previously believed.","American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki was killed by a drone in Yemen .

"Ray Rice is not only fighting to get back into the NFL - but he's also demanding his $3.5million salary from the Baltimore Ravens. The team fired Rice last month after a video surfaced showing him punching now-wife Janay Palmer unconscious in an Atlantic City hotel elevator. In a recently filed formal grievance, the former Ravens running back cites at article in the league's collective bargaining agreement which says players can not be punished more than once for a single rule violation. Ray Rice has filed a formal grievance with the Baltimore Ravens, demanding his $3.5million salary after the team fired him last month . The former running back was fired from the team after video was released, showing the moment he punched his then-girlfriend and now-wife Janay Palmer unconscious . Rice doesn't deny that he violated the NFL's domestic violence policy, but says punishment for that rule break is only a two-game suspension without pay. Instead, the team fired Rice on September 9 for the video and it's been six games since he's worn a purple jersey. 'I do think he has a good, solid argument,' said Kraig Long, Tydings & Rosenberg LLP told CBS Baltimore. Exiled Rice has a separate complaint with the league filed through the NFL Players Union,arguing that his indefinite suspension should be lifted due to the same two-game rule. Legal experts say Rice has a good case for winning both grievances, and if he wins either one he's expected to get his $3.5million of his  base salary for the year. If he loses both he will not be paid any more of the contract the five-year contract he signed in 2012 for $35million. The appeal hearing on the reinstatement issue has been set for November 5 and 6, sources told the Baltimore Sun. It was also revealed on Thursday that   NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been told to testify in Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, a person familiar with the case said  Wednesday night. Legal experts believe Rice has a solid case for getting his base salary. Above, Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Biscotti and coach John Harbaugh . Former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones, the neutral arbiter selected to hear the appeal, informed the parties of her decision Wednesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the appeal have not been made public. It was uncertain whether Goodell will actually testify. He said this month he would leave the decision to Judge Jones. 'We will continue to respect Judge Jones' confidentiality order regarding this proceeding,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email. NFL lawyers have argued that Goodell shouldn't have to testify, and instead were offering testimony from Jeff Pash, the NFL's general counsel, and Adolpho Birch, the NFL's vice president for labor policy. Pash and Birch were with Goodell when he met with Rice's side in June to talk about what happened when the former Pro Bowl running back hit his then-fiancee in an elevator. It has also been revealed this week at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell could be forced to speak at an appeal on Rice's indefinite suspension .","The former running back was fired from the Baltimore Ravens last month after a video was released showing him beating his then-girlfriend .

"A police officer whose ballistics evidence forms a key element of the murder case against Shrien Dewani has been exposed as having presented misleading evidence to court. South African forensics officer Sgt. Pieter Engelbrecht was said to have provided Shrien Dewani's murder trial with two contradictory explanations of how his wife was shot. The first explanation - provided in a statement of fact to court called an affidavit - claimed Anni was shot with a bullet from a 38mm calibre, American-made revolver type gun, Dewani's trial heard. A police officer whose  evidence forms a key element of the murder case against Shrien Dewani has been exposed as having presented misleading evidence. Pictured, Shrien Dewani, 30, with murder vicitm Anni . The officer examined the car in which Anni's body was found with a gunshot wound to the neck . The second explanation - provided in another affidavit commissioned by Sgt. Engelbrecht and submitted to the same court - claimed Anni was shot from a 25mm calibre, Chinese-made semi-automatic pistol. While Shrien Dewani's defence team conceded that Anni was shot with the Chinese pistol, they argued that Sgt. Engelbrecht's apparent willingness to provide contradictory stories indicates bias against their client. As defence barrister Pieter Botha explained, 'affidavits' are not only meant to be legally binding statements of unambiguous fact, they should also be unique. Anni Dewani was shot dead on her November 2010 honeymoon to South Africa when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked . But aside from the type of gun, both Engelbrecht's affidavits, the barrister claimed in court, are identical, even down to the positioning of the two documents' signatures. What's more, the digital 'metadata' contained in an electronic version of one of the documents indicates it was created some 19 months after Sgt. Engelbrecht claimed it to have been. 'Is it possible', the lawyer Botha asked the policeman, 'that one is a photocopy of the other? Could I put it to you that one crucial aspect was changed in one document and a copy of it was made? That is what happened here.' Sgt. Engelbrecht said he could not comment on this allegation. The twin affidavits were not the only pieces of questionable evidence Sgt. Engelbrecht struggled to explain on the witness stand. The officer - who said he examined the car in which Anni's body was found - was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of Xolile Mngeni, the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting Anni Dewani. Engelbrecht agreed that while he had earlier told a court that Mngeni was likely to be Anni's killer, he did not have any conclusive data to support this conclusion. 'How could you give your opinion when you were unaware of the necessary facts to say so?' Dewani's lawyer asked. 'Maybe I did not understand', Engelbrecht replied. 'You would agree that your answer could have misled the court?' the lawyer went on. 'Yes.' Engelbrecht replied. Anni Dewani was shot dead on her November 2010 honeymoon to South Africa when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked as it passed through Cape Town's dangerous Gugulethu township. Sgt. Pieter Engelbrecht was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of Xolile Mngeni (pictured), the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting Anni Dewani. So far three local men - including the taxi's driver - have confessed to taking part in the murder plot, but they all claim they did so at Shrien Dewani's behest. Mziwamadoda Qwabe, the only one of these three men present at the moment of Anni's killing claims she was shot by his accomplice Xolile Mngeni from the cab's front left passenger seat. Giving evidence yesterday, Sgt. Engelbrecht initially confirmed that, in his opinion, Qwabe's story holds true and that Anni was likely to have been shot in the front passenger seat. Under cross examination, however, the officer conceded that he based this opinion partly on measurements taken from a different car to the one used in the hijack and one in which the seats were positioned differently to the way they were during the hijack. Shrien Dewani denies any involvement in the murder of his wife. The case will not sit tomorrow in order that both Anni and Shrien Dewanis' families can celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali . 'What on earth did you, an expert, hope to achieve when you took measurements of a vehicle where the distances are nothing to do with the car in this case?', Dewani's apparently incredulous barrister asked the policeman, to an ambiguous response. Later, when Sgt. Engelbrecht refused to acknowledge that one of his own photographs - taken on Tuesday this week and submitted as evidence later the same day - proved him to have taken inaccurate measurements, the lawyer Botha went further. 'You are miles away from being an objective witness', Botha chided the policeman. 'You do not want to concede that which an objective person - even a child - can see to be true.' 'It is patently clear that your previous evidence is false', to which Sgt. Engelbrecht replied: 'It is not a matter that I wanted to mess up the case'. Shrien Dewani denies any involvement in the murder of his wife. The case will not sit tomorrow in order that both Anni and Shrien Dewanis' families can celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali. It is set to resume next Monday.","Sgt. Pieter Engelbrecht was said to have provided Shrien Dewani's murder trial with two contradictory explanations of how his wife was shot .

"Gary Lineker has called on Roy Hodgson to take a World Cup gamble on Everton teenager John Stones. In keeping with Sportsmail’s call for the England manager to give young players a chance in Brazil, Lineker insisted yesterday that one of the most promising talents in the country ought to be on the plane this summer. Stones has impressed since  breaking into Everton’s first team this season, after his £3million move from Barnsley last year. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch John Stones score a cheeky chip against Juventus . Fast track: Roy Hodgson should pick John Stones (C) for his World Cup squad, says Gary Lineker . And with England’s defensive cover looking thin — a situation exacerbated by the shoulder injury  sustained by Manchester United’s Phil Jones on Tuesday — Lineker believes Hodgson should turn to the 19-year-old centre half, who has never previously been called up to the senior squad. ‘The one I might take a chance on, because we are so short in central defence, is Stones,’ said Lineker, a former Everton striker. Teenage kicks: The 19-year-old has been impressive at Everton since his £3million move from Barnsley . Beeb's dream team: (L-R) Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry, Gabby Logan and Alan Hansen . ‘I really like him. He has got a lot about him. Sometimes central defenders need a little bit more experience than other positions because of the extra discipline and the nature of that role. But is he worth a gamble? Well, if Phil Jones doesn’t make it — what else have we got?’ Gary Cahill and Phil  Jagielka are set to be  Hodgson’s first-choice centre back pairing in Brazil.But beyond that pair, Lineker admitted he is concerned by his options,  particularly Steven Caulker, who has not been especially impressive at Cardiff City. Lineker said: ‘We have got Cahill and Jagielka and then Caulker, who struggles a bit on the turn. We are short in that position.’ United’s Jones is clinging to his World Cup dream after X-rays  confirmed that he did not dislocate his shoulder on Tuesday. Plan B? England's central defensive options behind Phil Jagielka (L) and Gary Cahill (C) are limited . The club have turned to one of the country’s top shoulder specialists to oversee Jones’ recovery. FA medical staff have also been kept fully informed about the injury as they wait for the swelling to subside before making a proper diagnosis. Jones has been told he is unlikely to need immediate surgery, which would have ruled him out of the tournament in Brazil next month. The versatile defender has been assured that his shoulder did not  disclocate and didn’t fracture during the clash with Hull defender Maynor Figueroa. Although the swelling points to potential ligament damage, Jones is determined to declare himself fit for selection ahead of Hodgson’s squad announcement in Luton on Monday. That's torn it! Phil Jones' World Cup hopes are hanging after he picked up a shoulder injury against Hull . England have a growing casualty list after Tottenham winger Andros Townsend was ruled out of the squad last week with an ankle injury. Theo Walcott is also out and  Hodgson had other concerns at  centre half after a long-term injury to Jagielka, but he has returned to Everton’s first team in recent weeks. Gary Lineker was speaking at the launch of the BBC’s World Cup coverage.","John Stones should go to the World Cup with England, says Gary Lineker .

"Forget everything you've ever heard about Australia's housing market, because the bubble surrounding the nation's greatest property myths is about to be burst. National real estate analysts  Hotpsotting.com.au have broken down the 20 greatest myths you're ever likely to hear from real estate agents, developers and other property gurus spinning tales about panic in Australia's residential market. From 'the shortage bandwagon' to inflated statistics about increased house prices across the country,  Hotspotting.com.au managing Director Terry Ryder dispels it all. Scroll down for video . Hotpsotting.com.au have broken down the 20 greatest myths you're ever likely to hear . Mr Ryder  draws on research from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to refute suggestions that there is a boom in Australia . Published in  the Spring edition of the Ryder Report, Mr Ryder makes the claim that 'jumping on the shortage bandwagon is the ultimate example of lazy analysis of residential property.' He said research or evidence suggesting the shortage theory has never be proven, but it is nevertheless accepted by most people as accurate. 'The shortage myth has been generated by organisations which represent developers and builders,' he writes. 'They've achieved this by pumping out a stream of press releases over many years, each of them blaming all the problems in the residential market on a shortage of houses.' He draws on research from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to refute suggestions that Australia has had a nationwide increase of 10 per cent over the last year. 'But Australian house prices have not risen 10%.' He said growth of that magnitude has occurred only in one city, Sydney. Sydney house prices have increased 16-17 per cent in the pas 12 months far and away more than other capital city . But despite the boom, Sydney is not in the grip of a housing bubble according to Mr Ryder . Spring is not the best time to buy and sell: This home will go to auction on November 6 in the season most auctions . There is no shortage of land to build: 'There are many dozens of options' Mr Ryder said . Prices on average have increased 16-17 per cent and that has inflated the overall city average. No other city has had double-digit price growth.' 'There is no Australian property boom. There has been, so far, a Sydney property boom.' But does Sydney's high prices constitute a bubble? 'No.' 'This is the first major growth in Sydney prices in 10 years.' He writes despite the growth of the past 18 months, the average annual rise in house prices in most Sydney suburbs has been three per cent to four per cent in the past decade. 'Prices have barely kept pace with inflation. Even with the most vivid imagination, it is impossible to construct a bubble from those facts.' And when it comes to believing the myth that there's an under-supply of land, My Ryder writes there's plenty around but all the 'major land developers are sitting' on them. 'They drip-feed to the market to suit their own agendas.' 'If you want to buy a housing allotment in Brisbane and South-East Queensland, there are many dozens of options.' He quotes no less than five major developers who have big titles of new housing estates going up in south east Queensland alone. 'If you want to buy a housing allotment in Brisbane and South-East Queensland, there are many dozens of options.' 'Developer Devine is currently marketing five estates in the region. Stockland has four estates in the market. Lend Lease has five communities under development. Australand has three. The Peet Group has seven. 'There are many others.' Spring auctions are not always the best time to buy and sell homes, according to Hotspotting.com.au . PIPA chair Ben Kingsley says it’s important for aspiring buyers to keep a cool head and steer clear of property spruikers . There is no shortage of land across Australia, particularly in south east Queensland were there are 'dozens' of options . Property agents have been spruiking Australia's housing bubble despite research suggesting otherwise . Hotspotting also cracks the con that 'Spring is the selling season.' Mr Ryder says It’s lavishly promoted by marketing agents and by media as the best time to sell homes – and also the best time to buy, but it can't be both. 'There’s no evidence that selling in Spring gets better prices and it’s difficult to imagine how it can be the best time to act for both buyers and sellers. It’s a hype-fest, basically.' Property Investment Professionals of Australia  has developed a spring buying checklist to help investors and home-buyers make good decisions. PIPA chair Ben Kingsley says it’s important for aspiring buyers to keep a cool head and steer clear of property spruikers. 'Unscrupulous operators have been quick to eye opportunity in the market.' 'Steer clear of any so-called property investment experts who won’t disclose how they earn their income or push you towards one-size-fits-all property strategies that don’t consider your own circumstances. ' 1 A serious housing shortage - Vested interests like the HIA and UDIA claim a shortage but never produce evidence – because most of the data disproves the claim. 2 The affordability crisis - Affordability is the best it's been in 10 years but the industry keeps stating as a fact that young people can't afford to buy. It's a lie. 3 The 'national property market' - Economists chatter about 'the property market' but there are many thousands of independent local markets all doing their own thing. 4 The national property boom - It's amazing how many 'analysts' look at average growth figures and declare a national boom. Only Sydney has boom conditions. 5 House prices are soaring  - Media reports 'spiralling' prices, when only Sydney has recorded double-digit growth. Most cities have only moderate growth rates. 6 Rising prices are a bad thing - Media tends to portray rising home values as a problem. But for most households, and for the nation, it's a major positive. 7 It's all about interest rates  - Economists think interest rates are the key factor in price trends, but if that were so all of Australia would have booming prices. 8 The Great Australian Dream is dead - First-home buyers are active but many are not being counted in the stats because grants are no longer available for established homes. 9 Faster approvals is the answer  - Developers claim easier approvals will make housing affordable. It won't. It will make developers wealthier. 10 The inner-city grows fastest - The research contradicts the claim that the so-called prime inner-city suburbs show the best capital growth over time. 11 Distant suburbs don't grow - In most capital cities, the best long-term capital growth rates happen in affordable suburbs a long way from the CBD. 12 Master-planned is best - In most cities, suburbs created by master-planned developments show inferior capital growth to older, cheaper suburbs nearby. 13 Houses grow faster than units  - The dominant paradigm in property, that land content drives value, needs to re-visited. More and more are choosing to live in units. 14 Spring best time to sell and buy - The 'spring selling season' is one of real estate's biggest cons. It's marketed as the best time to sell – and buy. It can't be both. 15 Negative gearing is for rich folk Media has created the false notion that negative gearing is a tax break for rich people. 70% of claimants earn less than $80,000. 16 Negative geared investors drive prices - Investors are a minority presence in the market. Prices are driven by home buyers (other than first-timers) who dominate the market. 17 FHB grants drive prices - Some economists claim grants hurt first-timers because they push up prices. They never produce any evidence to support the claim. 18 Foreign investors are to blame - Chinese buyers especially are blamed for pricing out young Aussie buyers, but their price impact in FHB areas is close to zero. 19 Economists know real estate  - Media is obsessed with the real estate views of economists. It's like asking a chess expert to provide expert commentary on football. 20 Economists know anything at all - When their data forecasts are wrong, which is often, economists express shock and amazement, and denounce the official data.","Australian real estate analysts burst the bubble on housing myths .

"Professor Gennadij Raivich, 52, from North London, set up an online 'breeding programme'  to artificially inseminate women desperate to start a family . A neuroscientist who claims to have fathered 58 children while running a 'one-stop shop' sperm donor programme has walked free from court after being convicted of molesting one of his clients. Professor Gennadij Raivich, 52, from North London, set up a 'breeding programme' on the internet to artificially inseminate women who were desperate to start a family. The academic - who has three children of his own - visited the women at home and pretended he was trying to help them. But a court heard how Raivich 'exploited' women who were 'desperate to conceive' from his own 'sexual gratification'. He even told victim Claire Long that her chances of becoming pregnant would be increased if she orgasmed during the insemination process, the court was told. The professor, an expert in maternal and foetal medicine who worked at University College London, was found guilty in July this year of sexually assaulting Ms Long. He was cleared of abusing two other women. But he avoided being jail today after the judge said he had already suffered a loss of reputation and employment. Judge Deva Pillay told him: 'Publicly it is said you were an internationally recognised and respected scientific researcher, however in private you led a more questionable lifestyle. 'Using the pseudonym Frank Qualman you surfed the internet offering your services as a sperm donor to women desperate to conceive. 'These were informal and devoid of the usual regulations and safeguards and the Crown say you exploited your anonymity and your clients' desperation to conceive to obtain sexual gratification.' During the two-week trial, Blackfriars Crown Court, South East London, heard that Raivich advertised his services online and carried out home visits around the country. He also trawled websites including tadpoletown.co.uk and gayfamilyoption.com looking for potential clients. Using the pseudonym Frank Qualman, he coined the phrase 'Artificial Insemination Plus', which promised 'extras' to donors. He carried a 'donation kit' with him containing a DVD player so he could watch pornography, rubber gloves and laboratory equipment. But he was arrested over allegations of sexual assault. Victim Claire Long, who has waived her right to anonymity, was groped during a consultation with Raivich on 27 November 2012 . During the trial, the court heard how Ms Long - whom he first met in September 2012 - travelled from her Cambridgeshire village to his London home and agreed to repeatedly perform oral sex on him to obtain the samples she craved. She couldn’t afford to pay for private fertility treatment and the NHS wouldn’t treat her because she was single. She believed a free sperm donation was her only option. She told the court she went along with the man's request for her to perform a sex act on him - on several occasions - because she had been trying to conceive for a year and was desperate for success. The former nanny, who has waived her right to anonymity, was groped during a consultation with Raivich on 27 November 2012. Not only was she subjected to the unwanted touching, but Ms Long did not conceive as a result of her contact with the professor, the court heard. In a video-recorded police interview played to the jury, she said: 'He laid sofa cushions on the floor and was taking his trousers off and said he wanted AI Plus because it would be quick and he did not have time to provide the sample himself. 'With my baby brain I agreed to AI Plus and he took his underwear off and lay on the floor and I performed AI Plus and the donation was ready in thirty seconds. 'While I was doing AI Plus he asked me to take my clothes off so he could touch me. 'I said I did not mind doing AI Plus, but did not want to do anything else, but he put his hand on my bottom over my jeans then kept trying to put his hands down my waistband and up my top.' Following his arrest, 15 women who had children by him came to his defence, including a police officer, a maths teacher and a lecturer, some of whom had two and in one case three of his children via Artificial Insemination (AI). Raivich is a qualified doctor in Germany, but has never practised medicine and is not registered with the General Medical Council. Raivich's service was informal and did not conform to the guidelines of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. He once gave an interview in which he described being a sperm donor as 'like a hobby or charitable act' and said that he got 'satisfaction by helping'. A jury at Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) found  Raivich guilty of sexually assaulting Ms Long when she met him to receive a donation . He also said that he offered his services as a donor and as a doctor because he 'loved children' and wanted others to enjoy parenthood. Defending, Raivich's lawyer William Clegg QC said: 'The victim was engaging in consensual oral sex with the defendant at the time. She was a lady that had agreed full intercourse with donors in attempts to become pregnant.' He also showed Judge Deva Pillay an article from magazine 'Take a Break' to which the victim sold her story. He said: 'She's abandoned her anonymity and made what capital she can out of her position. 'He's been forced to resign his chair at UCH and is unemployed. He lost a well paid and prestigious job. That indeed is a tragedy in itself. 'He is acknowledged as a world authority on trauma to the brain in children and in lesser respects adults and intends to return to his family in Germany when these proceedings are concluded and re-train in another area. 'She was clearly a very willing participant in oral sex, which reduces, to some extent, the gravity of the offence.' He was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to pay £5,000 costs and to sign the sex offenders' register for ten years. He is also subject to an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from being a sperm donor or carrying a speculum.","Professor Gennadij Raivich appeared to be the embodiment of respectability .

"Despite playing for Real Madrid's greatest rivals, Cristiano Ronaldo has tipped Barcelona forward Neymar to become 'the best player in the world'. The Portuguese currently holds that mantle after collecting a second Ballon d'Or this year, although his chances of retaining the award were hindered after stalled when he was taken off injured during Real Madrid's title slipping 1-1 draw with Valladoid on Wednesday. Neymar has come in for criticism for his performances following a big money move to the Nou Camp in the summer.

Teething problems: Neymar has struggled to adapt in his first season with Barcelona . 'His adaptation at Barcelona was not the best -- he had some problems at the start -- but I have no doubt that he has the potential to be one of the best players, or even the best player, in the world.' High praise indeed from a player who rarely likes the limelight to be shifted from himself, especially if it's in the direction of his nemesis Lionel Messi.

"Guilty: Sydney Youngs, 74, grew drugs to pay off a loan and his funeral, a court heard . A terminally ill pensioner  who farmed £115,000 of cannabis in a Breaking Bad inspired plot to save his family from  debt when he died has avoided jail. Sydney Youngs, 74, was desperate to pay off a £10,000 bank loan hanging over him for more than a decade and wanted loved ones to have enough cash for his funeral, a court heard. Youngs, who has chronic lung disease and a terminal heart condition, started cultivating skunk cannabis in a 'sophisticated' operation at his home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. Hull Crown Court heard the charity shop volunteer had recently attended the funeral of his nephew who was heavily in debt when he died. An unnamed man approached him in a pub  suggested Youngs turned  his home into a cannabis farm to pay off his loan. But his crop  of the drug, worth £115,000 in total, was seized when police raided it on May 19. His decision was similar to the one taken in drama series Breaking Bad where terminally-ill chemistry teacher Walter White turns into a drug baron to ensure his family's financial future. Georgina Coade, defending, said: 'The state of his finances was very much concerning to him and then he attended the funeral of his nephew. 'That young man was in debt, heavily in debt, and the defendant saw the impact of that on his family. 'He saw the upset and distress it had caused to them, and it concerned him, him being in ill health, the level of debt he was leaving to his family.' Youngs suffered his third heart attack on the day he was due to be sentenced for producing cannabis, the court heard. Miss Coade said Youngs had been 'taken advantage of' and was remorseful. Similar: Fictional chemistry teacher Walter White turns into a drug baron to ensure his family's financial future in Breaking Bad . But the court heard that although Youngs had led an unblemished life for the past 13 years, he did have a criminal record. He was jailed for five years in 1962 for wounding with intent, and for four years in 1974 for non-dwelling burglaries and theft. Given his background, Recorder Eric Elliott QC said the suggestion that the pensioner was naive was 'absolute nonsense'. Youngs admitted cannabis production but escaped prison after the judge took pity on him. He was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years and will also be supervised for 12 months. The judge said a prison sentence was called for, but he accepted that Youngs had done his 'level best to lead a decent life' in recent years, and because of his ill health, and other mitigating features, he was able to suspend the sentence. He said: 'To suggest that you were naive, I think, is absolute nonsense. 'This was a sophisticated set-up and you were more than happy to go along with it. 'At the age of 74, it's very sad to see a man who had managed to turn his life around back in court facing a charge like this.'","Drug grower Sydney Youngs, 74, has terminal heart and lung illnesses .

"Concerns: Canterbury headteacher Michael Walters says one pupil claiming to be 15 or 16 turned out to be in his twenties . Adult asylum seekers pretending to be children are being placed in schools alongside pupils as young as 11, headteachers claim. Schools in Kent believe some people as old as 21 have lied about their ages, prompting concern over the safety of children in schools. One headteacher, Michael Walters, fears in some cases asylum seekers are placed in mainstream education 'within days' without the necessary information. He said he and other colleagues in Kent believe people had presented themselves as under 16 'only to find that they were clearly 20 or 21'. The county is considered the frontline of the arrival of immigrants into the UK because so many come through the Port of Dover. Kent County Council currently has 38 unaccompanied asylum seeker children aged between five and 16  in their schools. Asylum seekers may be tempted to reduce their age to secure preferential treatment, especially to get an education or improve their chances of staying in the UK. They may also get better housing with foster carers rather than in shared accommodation with other adults. Michael Walters, headteacher at St Anselm's RC Secondary School in Canterbury, said immigrant children - who arrive without parents - were being placed in schools in a 'random and haphazard' way with few checks on their backgrounds or ages. Mr Walters said: 'While we have great sympathy with those unaccompanied asylum seekers who arrive in England in need of education and support, this does present a difficult position for schools. 'We are being asked to admit pupils to our schools with very little information about him (sic). 'Sometimes there is doubt about where they come from, and what age they are.' Mr Walters said the majority come from or claim to come from war-torn countries in the Middle East such as Syria and Iraq, or from Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Vigilance: The head at St Anselm's RC Secondary School in Canterbury, pictured, said children are being placed in schools in a 'random and haphazard' way . He said: 'While I recognise that there is a very difficult balance to strike here, this lack of information and uncertainty could be seen as a safeguarding issue for schools. 'Quite rightly, schools are held to the very highest standards when it comes to keeping children safe. 'I believe that there have to be serious questions asked in some cases about the wisdom of immediately placing these children into mainstream educational settings.' Meanwhile, Spires Academy secondary school, in Hersden, near Canterbury, has had two unaccompanied asylum seeking children placed in it this term. Headteacher Nicki Martin said: 'While many of these are genuine cases and we will do all that we can to support these young people, a minority are not. 'As a school we have to be increasingly vigilant, given the lack of information that is provided. Safeguarding our pupils is paramount.' Kent County Council, the local education authority,insisted today it assesses unaccompanied asylum seekers 'rigorously' before finding them school places. But admitted 'in very rare cases where asylum seeking children have been found to be older than the age they claimed'. A spokesman  said: 'Asylum seeking children are treated the same as other children in care. 'They are vulnerable young people who have often had a very difficult and traumatic journey to arrive in the UK. 'When they arrive in Kent, they are rigorously assessed by skilled social workers and educational assessors who are experienced in making an informed judgement about their age. 'In many cases, due to the lack of records or disruption in their home country, there is no way to check this information. 'Like any other child in care, schools are allocated on the basis of where they live. 'If the young person cannot speak English, it is the responsibility of the school to provide the appropriate support, as it would with any student. Yonas Admasu Kebede, right, claimed the taxpayer should fund his £10,000 flying lessons after his family abandoned him as a child. But last year the Mail revealed he may have lied about his age to milk the public purse for tens of thousands of pounds. The failed asylum seeker pretended to be 15 years old so that he could be cared for as a destitute child – while in reality he was a grown man of almost 20. He also claimed his mother was missing and his father either dead or in prison, but the Mail’s inquiries reveal that he is still in touch with his family. His lies mean he has wrongly received two years of accommodation, living expenses and schooling paid for by Newcastle City Council. And because he was a so-called ‘looked-after child’, it has meant the authority has been forced to pay for his flying lessons, even though he turned 26. Newcastle City Council was forced to pay £10,000 for Mr Kebede to train as a pilot after it lost a case in the Court of Appeal earlier last year. 'In very rare cases where asylum seeking children have been found to be older than the age they claimed, action has immediately been taken to remove them from school and to inform police and the Home Office. 'In such cases, there is no evidence to suggest other pupils have been placed at risk.' Canterbury Academy headteacher Phil Karnavas urged a cautious approach to the issue of asylum seeking children. He said: 'A very small number of unaccompanied asylum seekers may be older than stated or provide limited background information. 'This will cause difficulty. Staff will follow safeguarding procedures.' Last year 130 unaccompanied children arrived in Kent with most found in the back of lorries. Younger children are placed with foster carers while those judged to be at least 15 or 16 are placed in a converted old people's home in Kent. Alasdair Hogarth, former headteacher of The Archbishop's School in Canterbury, believes it is tempting for asylum seekers to claim they are younger than they are to secure preferential treatment. Mr Hogarth is now chairman of the Canterbury Inclusion Service, a body which meets to ensure that children who find themselves out of school are given places. He said: 'Schools are generally sympathetic, helpful and supportive, and my experience has been that unaccompanied asylum seekers can do very well at school, although some with poorer previous educational experience or language difficulties can require considerable extra help.'","Concerns that asylum seekers are being placed in schools too quickly .

Hughes' parents Greg and Virginia Hughes and sister Megan leave Cricket NSW in Sydney on Thursday . 'Obviously what Sean has gone through is an incredibly traumatic experience, as it has been for everyone present on the field that day.' The young batsman had been excited to return to long-form cricket when he bowled the short delivery which struck Hughes, causing the injury which would claim his life. Others in the cricketing community have spoken about their fear of the 'freak' accident impacting upon Abbott's cricketing career, as well as his emotional well-being. Former test quick Staurt Clark said that Abbott had just been 'doing his job', which was to 'intimidate' the batsman, reported The Herald Sun. 'I’ve heard at different stages that [Abbott] is struggling a little bit with it all,' Clark told Fox Sports News. '[But] he’s out there to get Phil Hughes out. It’s a competitive sport. It’s professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said. Former test quick Staurt Clark said that Abbott had just been 'doing his job', which was to 'intimidate' the batsman . Abbott, 22, was comforted at the hospital by players including Nathan Lyon . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten tweeted that Abbott had 'done nothing wrong', and that he hoped the bowler knew that Australians shared his grief . 'You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don’t want that.' On Wednesday, Abbott returned to the SCG, where the unexpected accident occurred, for a team counselling session and was supported by teammates and team officials who have been concerned. Adam Gilchrist, former Australian wicketkeeper, acknowledged the trauma that Abbott was going through, tweeting 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott lead the public grieving for Hughes, but specifically mentioned the need to support the young bowler in his 'absolute' devastation, and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten tweeted that Abbott had 'done nothing wrong', and that he hoped the bowler knew that Australians shared his grief. Abbott delivered the ball that felled Hughes on Tuesday afternoon . Abbott was warmly embraced by teammates and cricketers at St Vincent's hospital on Thursday afternoon . The young cricketer was seen on Wednesday wearing a pair of sunglasses and was flanked by teammates . The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely . Beyond Blue, an Australian initiative to help combat depression and anxiety, expressed the need for the Australian community to support Abbott through the ordeal. Former England paceman Alan Mullally, who left a batsman with severe head trauma during a club game in Perth, said Abbott would need to be carefully looked after. 'I had sleepless night for months after that,' Mullally recalled to The West Australian. 'I would wake up crying. I was devastated at first because I didn't know if he was going to live and then I was devastated because I did know that I had ended his career and all his cricket hopes and dreams.' All NSW and South Australian players are receiving counselling and psychological support in the wake of the delivery. The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely. It was reported Abbott was struggling as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support. '[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his teammates and also the counselling services,' ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson said. 'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.' On Thursday afternoon Abbott, 22, visited Hughes in hospital and was met warmly by his own teammates, friends of Hughes and cricketing greats such as Steve Waugh. Looking pale and exhausted, Abbott arrived at St Vincent's wearing a black baseball hat at 2.30pm. In the hospital's coffee shop, where some of the cricketers had congregated, Abbott was given some words of advice from Waugh, while spin bowler Nathan Lyons draped a comforting arm around his shoulders. He then sat down and had a coffee with his teammates who were obviously rallying behind the young fast bowler.

Sean Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground, where the horrific incident happened . New South Wales' Sean Abbott (right) bowled the bouncer that hit Phil Hughes on Tuesday . Friends, teammates and Australian cricket figures have rallied around Abbott . Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him. 'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.' Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and said the incident was not his fault. 'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said. 'I hope he's got support... You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.' There is a long history between Abbott and Hughes who came up through the junior ranks of the NSW cricketing system and are close friends. Former Test bowler Brett Lee said Abbott did not deserve any of the blame for the incident. 'You know you're always on edge bowling fast or being out there batting,' Lee told Channel 9. 'When you see something as shocking as this you really feel for Phil. 'I know first-hand that no one goes out there to try and maim a batsman, no one tries to hurt a batsman.' Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen. Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott. 'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes.","Sean Abbott bowled the short delivery which struck Phillip Hughes in the head, causing the injury which claimed his life on Thursday afternoon .

"The Indian government is to dig up a ruined palace after a Hindu seer dreamt that tonnes of gold were buried underneath. The Archaeological Survey of India is now sending a team of archaeologists to the village of Daundia Khera in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. They are due to start digging on Friday said Praveen Kumar Mishra, the head archaeologist in the state. Golden opportunity: The search for treasure has begun near this temple in Daundia Khera village . Yogi Swami Shobhan Sarkar says the gold he dreamt of belonged to a nineteenth-century ruler, Rao Ram Bux Singh. He says he wants it in government hands to help India recover from an economic crisis. 'I . cried the day I realised that India is going to collapse economically,' the seer told the Mail Today newspaper. The dead ruler's spirit has . been roaming the palace and asking for the gold to be dug up, he added. 'It is a hidden treasure for the country.' Not all Hindu leaders are so keen to . put bullion into the Reserve Bank of India's vaults. Temples sitting on . about half as much gold as in Fort Knox are resisting efforts by the . central bank to audit their holdings. Indians . buy as much as 2.3 tonnes of gold, on average, every day - the weight . of a small elephant - and what they don't give to the gods is mostly . hoarded. Investigate: The archaeologists plan to dig two 100-square-metre blocks beside the palace . That is costing the economy dear, since India has few gold mines. Gold imports totalled $54 billion in the year ending on March 31, 2013, a major factor in swelling the current account deficit and undermining the rupee. Swami Sarkar's dream haul of 1,000 tonnes would be enough to replace all of India's imports for a year and would be worth at least $40 billion. The archaeologists plan to dig two 100-square-metre blocks beside the palace. Mishra, however, warned that there was as yet no proof that any treasure lay beneath the soil of Daundia Khera village. 'We are still searching for the exact location and whether there is any treasure. It is all in the future,' he said. 'We often just find pottery and metal antiquities, like agricultural tools or kitchen tools.'","Archaeological Survey of India sent a team to the village of Daundia Khera .

"A magnitude 4.8 earthquake shook the northern stretches of Yellowstone National Park early this morning, rattling observers of one of the world's most dangerous supervolcanoes. The quake struck near the Wyoming-Montana border about 6.30am, in the north-northeast parts of America's most famous park. Although the tremor was the most powerful to hit the area in nearly 30 years, U.S. Geological Survey’s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory spokesman Peter Cervelli said it was not expected to cause the Yellowstone Caldera to erupt. Scroll down for video . Nature's alarm: Residents in Mammoth in Yellowstone National Park woke to several inches of fresh snow and a magnitude 4.8 earthquake this morning . Scene: Several smaller quakes, ranging from 2.5 to 3.1, were also reported in Yellowstone National Park (pictured) Late last year, a study into the super volcano found the underground magma chamber to be 2.5 times larger than previously thought, with the cavern spanning a 90km by 30km area and capable of holding tons of molten rock. If the volcano were ever to erupt, observers say the outflow of lava, ash and smoke would likely devastate the United States and affect the entire world. Cervelli said today's quake, four miles north-northeast of the Norris Geyser . Basin, may have caused only minor damage and that there wouldn't be many people at the park at the moment. The . University of Utah Seismograph Stations reported the quake was felt in the Montana border towns of West Yellowstone and . Gardiner, both about 20 miles from the epicenter. Several smaller quakes, ranging from 2.5 to 3.1, were also reported in the region this morning. Yellowstone sees frequent small earthquakes. Since Thursday, there have been at least 25 recorded in the nation's first national park. Impact: California was hit by a 5.1-magnitude earthquake on Friday, two days before a 4.8-magnitude quake rocked Yellowstone National Park in Montana . Meanwhile . in California, experts say a bigger earthquake along the lesser-known . fault that gave Southern California a moderate shake could do more . damage to the region than the long-dreaded 'Big One' from the more . famous San Andreas Fault. The . Puente Hills thrust fault, which brought Friday night's magnitude-5.1 . quake centered in La Habra and well over 100 aftershocks by today, . stretches from northern Orange County under downtown Los Angeles into . Hollywood - a heavily populated swath of the Los Angeles area. A magnitude-7.5 earthquake along that fault could prove more catastrophic than one along the San Andreas, which runs along the outskirts of metropolitan Southern California, seismologists told the Los Angeles Times. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that such a quake along the Puente Hills fault could kill 3,000 to 18,000 people and cause up to $250 billion in damage. In contrast, a larger magnitude 8 quake along the San Andreas would cause an estimated 1,800 deaths. Rocked: Customers flee Disneyland as the park is shut down following a 5.1 earthquake in L.A. on Friday . Destruction: The force of the quake caused this brick wall in Fullerton, California to collapse on Friday . In 1987, the fault caused the Whittier Narrows earthquake. Still considered moderate at magnitude 5.9, that quake killed eight people and did more than $350 million in damage. Part of the problem with the potential damage is that the fault runs near so many vulnerable older buildings, many made of concrete, in downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. And because the fault, discovered in 1999, is horizontal, heavy reverberations are likely to be felt over a wide area. The shaking from a 7.5 quake in the center of urban Los Angeles could be so intense it would lift heavy objects in the air, like the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake in Northern California, where the shaking was so bad 'we found an upside-down grand piano', USGS seismologist Lucy Jones told the Times. That would 'hit all of downtown,' Jones said. 'And everywhere from La Habra to Hollywood.' Wreckage: Items in shops in parts of California toppled from shelves following Friday's magnitude 5.1 earthquake . Impact: While no injuries were reported in Fullerton, California, people's belongings were smashed in some homes . About 150 aftershocks, including one of magnitude-4.1, were felt since Friday night's quake, which forced several dozen people in the Orange County city of Fullerton out of their homes after firefighters discovered foundation problems that made the buildings unsafe to enter, authorities said. Fire crews red-tagged 20 apartment units after finding a major foundation crack. Structural woes, including broken chimneys and leaning, were uncovered in half a dozen single-family houses, which were also deemed unsafe to occupy until building inspectors clear the structures. Seventy residents remained displaced, down from 83 after the initial quake. Another 14 residential structures around the city suffered lesser damage, including collapsed fireplaces. A water-main break flooded several floors of Brea City Hall, and the shaking knocked down computers and ceiling tiles, Stokes said. It was not immediately clear if City Hall would reopen Monday. An email to the mayor was not immediately returned.

"Amelie Mauresmo believes that Andy Murray can round off their first five months working together by regaining his place in the much-vaunted Big Four by the end of next week. The 27-year-old Scot can make the jump from his current position of number six if he enjoys success at the Barclays ATP World Finals that begins on Sunday, and Mauresmo he is in the form to do it. 'He could aim for the win there. I think for him the important thing is going to be to try to finish the year at No 4. There is a possibility of that,' she said as Murray stepped his preparations at London's Queen's Club. Andy Murray returns the ball to Novak Djokovic during the ATP World Tour Masters quarter-finals in Paris . Stan Wawrinka is 420 points ahead of Murray at four while Kei Nishikori is 150 points above. The long and short is that the British player may have to win at least two matches although one might do, depending on how the Swiss and the Japanese fare. 'Andy has won many matches, beating top 10 players again, which he hadn't been doing for a while, though he did beat Jo (Wifried Tsonga) at the US Open,' she said. 'That was important. That was another step I wanted him to feel. The other step was to win tournaments. I wanted him to feel what it was like to finish the week without losing. 'Obviously he's a little bit tired, but he's also in great confidence. Maybe it balances that tiredness a little bit. But we're looking forward to the end of the tournament here and London, to maybe start 2015 in a better position.' Amelie Mauresmo has backed Murray to make a return to the top four sooner rather than later . Mauresmo is also anticipating the window they will have together in the off-season, and it sounds like developing his undoubted volleying skills and using them more regularly at the net will be on the agenda. 'I think he has the ability to do it probably a little more often than he does. It's not an easy process. I think it's also not a fast one. I think we're both looking towards that. 'You can't do everything at once. He needed some confidence back. He needed many things before getting to this part of the work. Really other priorities were there before this specific area of his game.' 'When you're like Andy and you can do many different things, you have to choose the right shot at the right time. And that's not easy to do. He's trying to have perfect shot selection but it's not easy.' Murray's appointment of a female as coach, first revealed by Sportsmail, has been one of the season's main talking points and the former women's number one is delighted how they have gelled on a personal basis. Murray came up short against Djokovic but will be hoping to go all the way in London next week . 'We're getting on well together. Personally I wouldn't be able to work with a man or a woman player without having a good connection, a good feel for each other. It doesn't happen immediately. I'm not the type of person who opens up that easily, he also. It took a bit of time, but the relationship is good. It's something that is good for both of us, I would say.' She admits that a reluctance to travel was almost a stumbling block to their arrangement, but she is ready to commit to half the year on the road with him. 'The down part for me, as I see it, is definitely the travelling, but I accept it and I'm ready to do it, as long as he wants me to and as long as I also want to do it.' It has also helped that gets on well with his other coach Dani Vallverdu plus the physios and coaches that make up the team. The big test for her relationship with Murray is likely to come next year, but she feels he is in good shape to train on after his recent tear through Asia and Europe that qualified him for London. The Scot will be looking to be back and among the most elite players ranked in the world, like Roger Federer . 'It would be hard not to be pleased with that,' she said. ' After New York he was not in a great position to enter the Tour Finals. It was decided that he was going to go for it, have a few weeks in a row, we were not sure exactly how many and a lot would depend on the results he had in Asia. 'Then it was pretty clear he had to do the six weeks in a row, he did great and all the credit to him fighting like crazy and physically holding up well. 'His body and his back, there was a question mark there, all the work that has been done as recovery part of the plan was great. He should be proud of the last part of the season, he has been winning a lot of matches it gives him quite a lot of confidence.'","Andy Murray is currently ranked No 6 in the world .

"Australians have been warned of an increase in bushfires as a super hot summer is once again predicated across the country. Temperatures are reportedly going to soar above average over summer 2014-15, for the third year in a row and after 2013 marked the hottest year on record. The news comes as Sydney scored its hottest two consecutive days on record on Monday and Tuesday, with temperatures reaching up to 35.5 degrees. Dr David Jones from the Bureau of Meteorology told Daily Mail Australia: 'The next three months are likely to be above average... and the above average temperatures will continue through both day and night.' Dr Jones said the biggest changes will be felt in southern and eastern Australia and all the major capital cities and that the rise in temperatures is a continuation of what we have seen for the past three years. Scroll down for video . Sydneysiders flocked to Bondi Beach on September 29 as the city got an early taste of summer with spring temperatures soaring to 30 degrees and over . Record temperatures were not just felt in Sydney this week. 'Tasmania just had it's second hottest September on record and WA had its hottest day on record... it's not just Sydney that has seen unusual conditions,' Dr Jones said. The rising temperatures this summer are reportedly due to warmer than normal ocean temperatures off the western and southern coastline combined with a developing El Nino - a band of warm ocean water temperatures - in the Pacific Ocean. However, five separate studies this week blamed 2013's heatwave on man-made climate change caused by carbon emissions. Researchers from the University of Melbourne, the Australian National University and the University of NSW published their strong statement on the impact of climate change on Australia's weather patterns in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Dr Jones supports the recent findings and said 'that [climate change] signal in the background is not going away. In the last decade Australia has only seen one relatively cool year.' Heatwaves are set to occur in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth this severe weather season, according to the Sky report. Meanwhile, Australia is predicted to experience an increasing number of bad bushfire weather days in its southern and eastern states. Sydney scored its hottest two consecutive days on record on Monday and Tuesday, with temperatures reaching up to 35.5 degrees . It will be the third year in a row Australia has experienced record temperatures . The high temperatures this week were just a taste of what is to come over summer . Dr Richard Thornton, CEO of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, told Daily Mail Australia: 'An underlying lack of rainfall across much of central and eastern Australia and in the south-west of the continent has increased the potential for bushfires in these areas over the coming season. 'Despite good rainfalls in recent weeks in some areas and large fires last season, many areas are still dry and largely unburnt. If this summer is again very hot and dry the conditions are set for a potentially bad bushfire season.' RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Sydney Morning Herald this season would be worse than the last. 'Without being alarmists in anyway, we are being realistic based on the forecast and the underlying conditions, [that this] season is shaping up to be a difficult one,' he said. The official bushfire seasons began on Wednesday and a bushfire map, published this week by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC, shows the areas that have the potential for a fire to be more severe if it were to occur. An increase in bushfires has been predicted for this summer due to the above average temperatures . The Bushfire Outlook map is used by fire authorities to make strategic decisions on resource planning for the upcoming fire season. The map shows the areas that have the potential for a fire to be more severe . The map, which is used as a tool to help fire agencies prepare for bushfires, shows how fires could break out in many parts of the country. Bushfire potential depends on many factors including weather and climate, fuel abundance and availability, recent fire history and firefighting resources available in an area. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC's September reports says that rainfall since May has been below average across most of Queensland, northern and eastern New South Wales, northern South Australia and much of south west Western Australia. This combination of little rain, above average temperatures and near El Nino conditions in the Pacific means above normal fire seasons are expected in many areas. Firefighters fought bushfires in the Blue Mountains last October when 248 houses and other structures were destroyed across the state . Firefighters evicted residents and were forced to demolish fire-affected buildings . Smoke and ash from wildfires burning across the state of New South Wales was visible above Sydney's CBD . Last year the worst bushfires since the 1960s tore through NSW and devastated the Blue Mountains area in October. At the peak of the fires, on the morning of 18 October, over 100 fires were burning across NSW. The Premier of New South Wales Barry O'Farrell declared a state of emergency on 20 October, which saw firefighters evict residents and demolish fire-affected buildings. As of 19 October 2013, two people were killed while 248 houses and other structures were destroyed across the state because of the fires. Dr Thornton explained that this year large areas of southern Australia, especially along the east and west coasts extending inland, South Australia’s west coast and central Western Australia, face above normal fire potential for the 2014-2015 fire season. He said the key learnings from last year's devastating Blue Mountains bushfires show that most Australians do not have a written bushfire plan. CRC research conducted in partnership with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service after the 2013 October bushfires in the Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands and Port Stephens areas showed that of the 194 people interviewed, 73 per cent indicated they had some form of bushfire plan before the fire, however only seven percent indicated having a written bushfire plan. 'The research also reveals that people delayed their decision to stay or leave until the bushfire actually threatened and they could see signs such as smoke. Significantly, very few people proactively left early on the basis of extreme weather forecasts,' Dr Thornton said. He advised that people who live in a bushfire-prone area, including on the edge of a city or town, should make a bushfire survival plan. 'Write it down, talk about it with your family and practice your plan. It’s also important to have a back up plan, as we know from research after Black Saturday that things can go wrong. What will you do if the pump fails, or the hoses melt? It’s important to know what your triggers for different actions are,' he said.","Temperatures will reportedly rise  above average across Australia from October to April .

"Celebrity chef Pete Evans has posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism. Evans, who is a judge on reality cooking series My Kitchen Rules, took aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) on Wednesday as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet. His fiery rant, which was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Pete Evans has posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism . The My Kitchen Rules judge took aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia . The paleo diet, which Evans (left) is a supporter of, bans all types of dairy and grains, but promotes meat, eggs, vegetables and natural oils . The diet, which Evans is a supporter of, is based around meat, eggs, vegetables and natural oils but bans all types of dairy and grains. 'Why has our rate of autism jumped from 1 in 10000 children in 1974, to 1 in 50 in 2014, where do you think it will be in another 40 years if it is escalating at this rate? This has grown rapidly since the guidelines have been in place!' Evans wrote. World-recognised autism expert, Professor Cheryl Dessanayake, has been researching the disorder for 30 years and quickly dismissed the claims made by Evans. 'There is absolutely no evidence that diet is the cause of autism,' Prof Dissanayake told Women's Weekly. 'Throwaway lines can be damaging because parents will try anything to help their children.' She said while some parents do see improvements in autistic children after changing their diet, it is thought to be related to predisposed stomach problems. 'A number of children with autism do have gastrointestinal issues so diet may improve that and then, because they are no longer in pain, their behaviour may improve,' Prof Dissanayake said. While Evans claimed current autism rates in children was one in 50, autism organisations say the figure for 2014 is one in 100. The chef's fiery rant was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his Facebook page . But his 2,100 post wasn't just limited to autism. He also listed a number of other issues he believes the two nutrition organisations needed to address. 'Isn't it interesting that the people trusted to be delivering health advice for the public have come out not once, not twice, but so many times over the last year or so that I can't keep up with it, with a media campaign to bring down the paleo way of life by saying it is dangerous,' he wrote. 'Why is Australia fast becoming the most obese and unhealthy nations on earth? Is this because we are a nation of self-obsessed, weak-minded people with no self-control? No. Is it because we are a nation that for far too long has been told to steer clear of foods naturally high in fat, which naturally trigger our fullness hormone, and instead told to eat 6 - 8 servings of processed carbohydrate a day, and wonder why we are still hungry after eating 3 cups of rice or 6 slices of bread?' He said the DAA and Heart Foundation had 'ignited a spark that has been inside me, which is now a raging fire in my belly'. The Heart Foundation said they would not be engaging with Evans' Facebook post but continued to urge Australians not to go on any fad diet that eliminates any particular food group. 'The paleo diet, which seems to be very topical at the moment, in general appears to encourage people to avoid carbohydrates and dairy and eat large amounts of meat and saturated fats,' a statement read.","Pete Evans linked the rise in autism to the modern Australian diet in a fiery Facebook post promoting his paleo diet .

"This is the moment an angry sea lion took revenge on fishermen after being caught in their nets and dragged on board their boat. The Russians fishing off Russia's Pacific coast were hauling in their nets when they discovered a huge sea lion thrashing about inside and lowered it to the deck. But after helping the animal to get free one of the fishermen was not quite quick enough and was grabbed on the shoulder in the jaws of the furious creature and flung across the boat like a rag doll. Scroll down for video . Russian fishermen who landed a sea lion by accident cut the animal free - but one of the crew was unfortunate enough to discover the power of the animal after it grabbed him . The animal flings the fisherman across the deck . This image, taken from a video of the dramatic incident, shows that the fishermen was thrown clean off the deck of the boat . The sea lion then moves around the deck looking for a way out before taking on the ship's dog, biting the hound because it too was not quick enough to get out of the way. The sea lion is left looking as if it is about to start tackling the other fishermen as well, but the crew say they eventually managed to drive it back into the water by using a powerful hose normally deployed to clean the deck. Adult male sea lions can weigh over 400kg, while females weigh 85-160kg, and according to experts who studied the Russian video, the animal caught in the nets came from the Steller species of sea lion, a near-threatened species found off northern Pacific coasts from Japan to California.

The Steller sea lion is the largest of all five species found in the world. It hunts fish, squid, octopus and occasionally, smaller seals, and although the males are especially aggressive, particularly when defending harems of up to 25 females in the breeding season, it is believed the sea lion on the Russian ship was a female. Every year many sea lions are accidentally drowned by fishing boats and fishermen are obliged to report deaths. Most of the animals suffocate after being kept underwater in the huge nets.

After being wheeled back into a side exit, the RB10 was returned to the garage on the back of a flat-bed truck. Although . the team had 50 minutes to work on the problem, they were unable to get . Vettel back out on the circuit, leaving him down in 20th place on the . timesheet, with only the Caterhams of Kamui Kobayashi and Marcus . Ericsson behind him. Red Bull later revealed that the issue would force Vettel out of Friday's second session. 'Due to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of Car No 1, Sebastian will not be able to take part in FP2,' Red Bull said 'The team will use the time to fix it to be ready for FP3 tomorrow.' As . the man to beat following three successive victories for the first time . in his Formula One career, Hamilton was comfortably quickest by almost . nine tenths of a second over Button - the surprise name at the top of the . timesheets. The . concern for Hamilton's rivals is there is far more to come from his . Mercedes as he was fastest in all three sectors, albeit at different . stages rather than on one single lap. On track: Lewis Hamilton enjoyed another productive practice session ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix . All smiles: The British driver appeared in relaxed spirits as he waved to the crowd during Friday's practice session . On . the hard tyre, the slower of the two Pirelli compounds being used this . weekend, the combined time of the three sectors was 1min 26.6secs, over . four tenths of a second faster. Button . had warned on Thursday it was unlikely anyone would be in a position to . challenge Mercedes, despite all teams bringing a major upgrade package . to this event, and on first inspection his words appeared to carry . plenty of truth. At . least the 34-year-old's McLaren was the best of the rest, with Button . second, ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, the only other driver to . finish within a second of Hamilton as the Australian was 0.950secs . adrift. With . Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo in the paddock, Fernando Alonso . hauled his car up to fourth, albeit 1.1secs behind Hamilton, with . team-mate Kimi Raikkonen sixth. Improvement: Jenson Button finished second quickest during Friday's opening practice session in Spain . Concern: Nico Rosberg completed only nine laps . Sandwiched . between them was Rosberg, who had declared his hope on Thursday for a . less problematic weekend than occurred at the last race in China where . he encountered numerous issues. Rosberg, however, only managed nine laps in his Mercedes due to a cooling concern with the ERS (energy recovery system). McLaren's . Kevin Magnussen and Pastor Maldonado in his Lotus were seventh and . eighth quickest, followed by Sergio Perez in his Force India. Perez, . though, was forced to kick his heels in the garage for over half an . hour as his team fixed an unusual problem - a loose wing mirror. The . Mexican had to drive one-handed at one point as he tried to stop the . mirror from flapping around inside the cockpit of his car before . returning to the pits for repairs. Sauber . reserve Giedo van der Garde suffered a more serious moment of . consternation when his brakes failed at the end of the pit straight on . the approach to turn one. Fans behind the barriers ducked for cover as Van der Garde speared through the gravel, narrowly avoiding a crash. In . recovering the car and returning to the track, the Dutchman was then . able to tour back to the garage where he remained for the final 28 . minutes.","Lewis Hamilton was over eight tenths of a second clear of Jenson Button .

"Arnis Zalkalns, 41, is the prime suspect in the murder of Alice Gross and police have revealed he served seven years in jail for  murdering his wife . David Cameron has pledged to personally examine how the prime suspect for Alice Gross's murder got into Britain. In a dramatic intervention, the Prime Minister promised to learn lessons from the case and consider whether better ways of sharing information on criminals between European countries could have helped. He said he was 'sickened' by the death of the 14-year-old schoolgirl, who was last seen walking along a canal towpath in West London on August 28. CCTV cameras also picked out Arnis Zalkalns, a builder from Latvia, cycling along the same route 15 minutes later. Alice's body was found on a river bed four days ago. Last month police revealed that Zalkalns, 41, had served a jail term in 1998 for murdering his wife and dumping her body. Despite this, he was able to come to Britain to find work in 2007. He went missing a week after Alice's disappearance and has not been seen since. Police have admitted they have no idea where he is and are continuing an increasingly desperate search of buildings and parks in London for clues to his whereabouts. They believe he might be being harboured by criminal gangs in the capital and the South East. But he may have left the country using a Latvian identity card. The case has triggered calls for the EU to keep a database of criminal convictions so offenders can be easily identified at borders. Under EU freedom of movement rules, it is Britain's responsibility to spot those it deems a threat. But the so-called Warnings Index for UK border staff is mainly used for anti-terror measures and does not contain routine information about criminals from the rest of the EU. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said he was 'sickened' by the death of the 14-year-old schoolgirl, who was last seen walking along a canal towpath in West London on August 28 . The Prime Minister has pledged to personally examine how the prime suspect  got into Britain . Latvian authorities did not alert Britain to Zalkalns' record as he was not considered a 'present danger' after serving seven years for his wife's murder. They only disclosed his background when asked by Interpol after he was reported missing. He has previously been arrested in the UK for the suspected indecent assault of a 14-year-old British girl. Zalkalns was raised in Latvian capital Riga and worked on building sites and dockyards from the age of 16. By adulthood he had developed a penchant for chasing young, impressionable women. Police believe Zalkalns is being harboured by criminal gangs in the capital and the South East . Alice's body was found buried in the River Brent in west London, near her home in Hanwell, on Tuesday night . Speaking in Afghanistan, Mr Cameron said: 'It's a horrific case. Anyone with a daughter will have felt just absolutely sickened by what has happened and what that poor family has had to go through. I'll look at all the circumstances of the case, what lessons there are to learn, whether that's about sharing information or whether it's about the importance of keeping our country safe.' British police failed to secure a European Arrest Warrant – meaning that even if the suspect was found overseas he could not be arrested – because Scotland Yard has so far not gathered enough prima facie evidence. Alice's body was found weighed down by logs in the River Brent, off the Grand Union Canal in Hanwell, west London. A post-mortem examination was inconclusive. Friends and family gathered at the clock tower near Alice's home in Hanwell yesterday to pay tribute to her . Police have announced a case review, focusing on the first few days after Alice was reported missing. Critics asked whether enough consideration was given from day one to the possibility that Alice might have been abducted or murdered. In addition, police were slow to link her with Zalkalns. MPs will question Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders about the case next month. Labour's Home Affairs Committee chairman, Keith Vaz, said: 'It is very concerning … The UK needs an updated warnings index … which would flag up whether a person has a conviction as they are attempting to cross the UK border.' Tory MP Peter Bone said: 'The real problem is the issue of free movement from the EU … We can't have our own visa controls and actually let in people we want to let in.'","Arnis Zalkalns, 41, is the prime suspect in the murder of Alice Gross .

"The price of a long black or latte could soar to $5 a cup down under as the price of the world-renowned Arabica bean reaches new highs. Drought in one of the world's largest producing coffee countries, Brazil, has pushed the price of the bean to  $2.50 for half a kilo  making it the most expensive it has been in two and a half years. It's raised new fears that the price of of coffee will soar to $5 a cup in Australia as local roasters struggle to cope with tight profit margins and rising overheads of running their own business. The price of an average cup of gourmet blend coffee could soar to $5 due to demand for beans . Peter Nikolakopoulos from the Kaffeina group, which sells Illy coffee in Australia, said consumers will be forced to fork out more as businesses struggle to cover with costs of ''labour, rents and electricity.' 'I think it might (reach $5),' he told The Australian. 'But that's a reflection of labour costs, not coffee prices.' 'I'll use the example of Illy, which is an expensive, premium coffee which retails for $50 a kilo. You get 140 cups out of a kilo, so you're talking a 35 cent coffee component. 'It's a long way from there to $5.' Brazil is the world's largest coffee grower but is facing an uphill battle to meet demand . The main reason the world's coffee is costing more is due to a lack of rainfall in world-renowned coffee producer Brazil which harvests more than a third of the world's caffeine content. The South American country is in the grip of a drought, raising fears that next year's crop will be the most underwhelming it has been in years. The last coffee harvest was Brazil’s smallest in three years, after the main growing region experienced its worst drought in decades in the spring. In July, unseasonable rains caused some trees to flower early for the next year’s crop, but dry weather followed, causing some of those trees to drop their flowers and others to not flower at all. The International Coffee Organisation said that the new season, which began on October 1, could be the worst producing crop since 2006.","Droughts in Brazil - the world's largest bean producer - is pushing prices to new highs .

"They are the immortal words that have been etched in Australian political history. With a booming voice, Gough Whitlam stood on the steps of old parliament house in Canberra in 1975 and declared: 'Well may we say 'God save the Queen', because nothing will save the Governor-General.' He had just been informed of the news he was to become the first and only prime minister of Australia to be sacked. Scroll down for video . Gough Whitlam stood on the steps of old parliament house in Canberra in 1975 and declared: 'Well may we say 'God save the Queen', because nothing will save the Governor-General.' But little did he know his comments directed towards Governor-General John Kerr would become as equally as famous as his dismissal. Whitlam, who passed away at the age of 98 on Tuesday, will be remembered for his sweeping changes as a Prime Minister but also his sharp tongue and quick wit in and out of Australia politics. Following his dismissal on November 11, 1975, Whitlam infamously took aim at those he held responsible. 'The proclamation which you have just heard read was counter-signed by Malcolm Fraser who will undoubtedly go down in Australia's history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr's cur... Maintain your rage and enthusiasm through the campaign for the election now to be held,' he said. 'It is the first time the burglar has been appointed as caretaker.' 'Comrades, did I go too far?' Whitlam, who once said 'the fun is where I am!' quipped to his Labor colleagues following his rant. Whitlam, who passed away at the age of 98 on Tuesday, will be remembered for his sweeping changes as a Prime Minister but also his most memorable commentary in and out of Australia politics . Following his dismissal on November 11, 1975, Whitlam infamously took aim at those he held responsible by labelling the Governor-General's actions as 'Kerr's cur' One of his most famous sledges of all time was directed towards High Court Chief Justice Garfield Barwick when he took great care in calling him a 'truculent runt'. Barwick had advised Governor-General Sir John Kerr on the legality of dismissing Whitlam in 1975. So naturally, when Whitlam met West Indian cricketer, Sir Garfield Sobers, he told him: 'You’re the one Sir Garfield I will shake hands with'. On his campaign trail, Whitlam once hit out at a rowdy man who heckled him for his opinion on abortion at a public meeting. 'Let me make quite clear that I am for abortion and, in your case Sir, we should make it retrospective,' he said. He also took aim at Sir Winton Turbull when the rural MP shouted: 'I am a Country member'. Whitlam quickly responded with 'I remember', which earned an applause from both sides of the house. 'He could not understand why, for the first time in all the years he had been speaking in the House, there was instant and loud applause from both sides,' Whitlam later elaborated. One of his most famous sledges during his time in parliament was directed towards Garfield Barwick when he took great care in calling him a 'truculent runt' When Whitlam was asked by a reporter in 1975 what the Labor government would do if Indonesia invaded East Timor, he responded: 'We would do absolutely nothing. Now that's a blunt, truthful answer'. Three days later East Timor was invaded. When thousands of Vietnamese refugees sought refuge in Australia after Saigon was taken over by northern Vietnamese troops in 1975, Whitlam reportedly declared: 'I'm not having hundreds of f***ing Vietnamese Balts coming into this country with their religious and political hatreds against us!' In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people at Wattie Creek in the Northern Territory title deeds to their traditional lands. 'Vincent Lingiari, I solemnly hand to you these deeds as proof, in Australian law, that these lands belong to the Gurindji people and I put into your hands this piece of the earth itself as a sign that we restore them to you and your children forever'. Whitlam abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy during his three year term and later said: 'I was profoundly embarrassed by (the policy) and I did all I could to change it' His comments still circulate today in the political arena with Prime Minister Tony Abbott comparing former Labor PM Kevin Rudd to the late Whitlam . He also abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy during his three year term and later said: 'I was profoundly embarrassed by (The White Australia Policy) and I did all I could to change it.' In a speech at the centenary of the federal ALP caucus in 2001, Whitlam joked about his days as prime minister. 'The Caucus I joined in 1953 had as many Boer War veterans as men who had seen active service in World War II, three from each. The Ministry appointed on 5 December 1972 was composed entirely of ex-servicemen: Lance Barnard and me,' he said. Whitlam spoke of his dismissal regularly in the years to follow that fateful day in 1975 and he also referred to having 'more influence now than when I had the power' 'A conservative government survives essentially by dampening expectations and subduing hopes. Conservatism is basically pessimistic, reformism is basically optimistic,' he once said of the Liberal party. His comments still circulate today in the political arena with Prime Minister Tony Abbott comparing former Labor PM Kevin Rudd to the late Whitlam. 'The punters know that the horse named Morality rarely gets past the post, whereas the nag named Self-interest always runs a good race,' Whitlam said. But his comments following politics have been as equally as memorable. Whitlam spoke of his dismissal regularly in the years to follow that fateful day in 1975. In his 1997 book he said: 'If I begin my book with a review of the coup, it is only to show that my abiding interests for Australia did not end with it. They shall end only with a long and fortunate life.' He also referred to having 'more influence now than when I had the power'.","Gough Whitlam will be remembered for his sweeping changes in Australian politics, but equally so for his most memorable commentary .

"Six of North Korea’s high ranking officials have ‘disappeared’ in the latest blood-thirsty purge of the regime, it has been reported. The officials – including the commanding officer of North Korea’s air force, the minister of posts and telecommunications and a key official in the North’s sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months. An intelligence source told South Korea’s respected JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that ‘six minister-level officials were executed’. If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Scroll down for video . epa04457258 An undated photograph made available by the Rodong Sinmun newspaper of the North Korean ruling Workers' Party on 22 October 2014 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting the newly completed Yonphung Scientists Rest Home, south of Pyongyang, North Korea.  EPA/RODONG SINMUN SOUTH KOREA OUT . The leader’s health and grip on the nation was recently questioned after he disappeared from local media reports for more than 40 days. However, Kim has quelled the rumours of ill-health and unrest by being shown on state media visiting military facilities and construction sites. Now speculation is growing he may have used the time to oversee another brutal purge of the regime. The officials that have disappeared include General Ri Pyong-chol, who has not been seen in public since late August. He was absent on October 19, when Kim provided ‘on-the-spot guidance’ to senior officials of the North Korean air force. Another reported to be missing is Ma Won-chun, a prominent architect and construction official, who was not present when Kim toured construction projects in North Korea recently. Kim Jong Un is accompanied by his wife Ri Sol-Ju (second right) as he meets gold medal winners from the 17th Asian Games and world championships. Kim has quelled the rumours of ill-health and unrest by also being shown on state media visiting military facilities and construction sites . Ri Yong-gil, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean People’s Army, was expected to be present at a ceremony to congratulate athletes who returned from this month’s Asian Games in South Korea, but did not attend. Sim Chol-ho, the posts minster, was reportedly close to Kim Jong-il and failed to attend a meeting with representatives of the Egyptian company that provides North Korea’s mobile phone network. Another official, Chang Ung, is understood to have had close ties with Mr Kim’s influential uncle Jang Song-thaek. Mr Song-theaek was arrested in December 2013 and later executed for 24 abuses of power or contraventions of North Korean law, including ‘gnawing at the unity and cohesion of the party’ and ‘dreaming different dreams’. Many of Jang’s closest allies were also purged at the time. ‘He was known as an associate of Jang Song-thaek and in investigation into him revealed that he had embezzled IOC funds and hidden the money in overseas accounts,’ a defector with knowledge of North Korea’s sporting circles told the JoongAng Ilbo.","Air force chief and ministers among staff gone missing in recent months .

"Four pupils were stabbed to death by a middle-aged man as they walked to elementary school in south China today. The shocking incident is the latest in a string of knife attacks targeting schoolchildren in China over the last decade. Officials said police were searching for a 56-year-old suspect who slashed the children from a motorcycle, but gave no other details. Emergency workers pictured at the scene of today's sickening knife attack which left four schoolchildren dead . The incident took place at about 6:20am as the children made their way to the Gupu primary school in Lingshan County of the southern province of Guanxi. The county government said on its website that three children were killed instantly with one dying later in hospital. China has seen many high-profile slashing attacks targeting schools over the past ten years prompting waves of tightened security but little in the way of lasting policy changes. Some cities including Beijing require ID and registration for the purchase of some kinds of knives. Police are hunting for a 56-year-old suspect who they believe attacked the children from a motorbike . Earlier this month, a man killed three students in a knife attack at a school in Hubei province. And in May 2010, an attacker hacked seven children and one teacher to death and wounded 20 other people in a rampage at a kindergarten in northwest China. At the time, it was the fifth in a string of savage assaults at the country's schools in the space of just three months. The knife attack was carried out on pupils from Gupu Primary School in Lingshan county, Guangxi Zhuang, China . Many of the attacks have been carried out by adults with no connection to the schools, with authorities saying the assailants suffered from mental illness or were lashing out at society because of some personal grievance. Several communities have temporarily stepped up security in response to the latest murders, including the confiscation of knives at the gates of school compounds and in the surrounding community. Many schoolchildren are also now receiving self-defence training.","Children were walking to elementary school in Guanxi province, south China .

"An American teen beaten by Israeli forces while on holiday has called for calm claiming that nobody deserves to die. Tariq Abu Khdeir, 15, from Tampa, Florida, was beaten by Israeli forces while on a trip to the middle east to visit relatives. The youngster, who is of Palestinian / American heritage, was arrested by Israeli authorities on suspicion of being involved in a violent protest surrounding the death of his cousin Mohammed Abu Khdeir. Tariq Abu Khdeir, pictured,  was beaten up by Israeli forces while visiting relatives in the troubled region . Around 50 supporters of Mr Khdeir greeted him upon his return to Florida waving US and Palestinian flags . Mr Khdeir said after his ordeal he would never think of freedom again in the same way as prior to his arrest . Mr Khdeir arrived back in the US yesterday and was greeted by approximately 50 supporters who were waving Palestinian flags. Speaking to reporters after his return to Tampa, Mr Khdeir said: 'I am only 15 but I will never think of freedom the same as I did two months ago . 'No child, whether they are Palestinian or Israeli, deserves to die.' Mr Khdeir's family denied that the teenager was involved in any protest. His cousin was murdered by Israeli extremists in revenge for the murder of three Israeli teenagers by Palestinian terrorists. Mr Khdeir said: 'I got through these past two weeks because I knew you were all thinking of me. Mr Khdeir, pictured, was held under house arrest for nine days after the beating before returning to the US . After his release from custody, Mr Khdeir met Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, right . 'It feels so good to be back in Tampa. Can I even put it in words? I can't wait to go back to play with my friends and go fishing. Hassan Shibly, the teen's attorney and the executive director of the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, had said Monday that Tariq suffered head trauma and had to receive stitches on his face when beaten two weeks ago as he was arrested during a protest. Supporters say Tariq's beating was videotaped. The Israeli justice ministry has said an investigation has been opened into the footage. There were no immediately apparent signs of injuries to Khdeir on his arrival. Israeli authorities released Tariq shortly after his arrest and sentenced him to nine days of house arrest while they investigated what they say was his participation in violent protests over the death of Tariq's cousin, 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir. His family denied that he participated in the protests. Palestinians suspect Mohammed Abu Khdeir was killed by Israeli extremists exacting revenge for the abduction and killings of three Israeli teens in the West Bank last month. His mother, Suha Khdeir, said Wednesday in Tampa that the last two weeks had been a 'nightmare', She wiped tears from her eyes as she spoke and added she was 'grateful' for the support she received at home in the Tampa area. 'I cannot begin to describe to you the pain I felt when I looked at his face for the first time after that beating,' she said. Friends and family have said Mr Khdeir went on a vacation to visit relatives he hadn't seen in about 10 years — not to be part of a conflict. They have described him as a good student who likes basketball, soccer and video games. His arrest happened shortly before Israel attacked Gaza to stop Hamas members from launching rockets into its territory. Earlier Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a five-hour UN brokered 'humanitarian' pause to their 9-day-long battle, offering the most encouraging sign yet that the fierce fighting could come to an end. Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 200 Palestinians, including four boys struck on a beach Wednesday by shells fired from a navy ship. The attorney Shibly said Monday that a complaint has been filed with the Israeli government by the teen's father.","Tariq Abu Khdeir was arrested by Israeli authorities following a protest .

"This was the scenario Brendan Rodgers must have feared as the Liverpool team bus drove away from Selhurst Park on Monday night. Watching Manchester City beat Everton 3-2 at Goodison Park last Saturday, Rodgers detected nerves — some fatigue — in the ranks of his Barclays Premier League rivals. There was, the Liverpool manager thought, something left to play for this season. In south London, though, all that changed. It changed the league table but, more importantly, it changed the context, the whole feel, of this occasion on Wednesday night. One hand on the title: Edin Dzeko (right) celebrates putting City in front ton Wednesday night . Blown it: Steven Gerrard (right) and Luis Suarez react after Liverpool draw with Crystal palace on Monday night . Liverpool’s late capitulation against Crystal Palace afforded City vital breathing space and Rodgers knew it. Here in the rain at the Etihad Stadium, Manuel Pellegrini’s team moved into that space and breathed hard. For a while, they had to. This was an unconvincing effort for long periods from the champions-elect. They scored four goals in the end and it’s a round 100 for the League season now. Some effort, that. Three of those goals came late here, though. They came once the pressure valve had been released by Edin Dzeko’s goal in the 64th minute. Prior to that, City had an awful lot of possession and didn’t do an awful lot with it. As Rodgers sensed, they looked tired and uncertain. In drawing at Palace, however, Liverpool had left the wriggle room they needed. Although City laboured hard for an hour, it never got that tense. The nerves never jangled. They didn’t have to. A draw would have been enough, given City’s goal difference advantage and, on the whole, Aston Villa never looked like scoring. So, in the end, City won the game and they won it well. Now they will win the title and deservedly so. Blown it: Rodgers watches on as his side throw away a 3-0 advantage at Selhurst Park . Any team — no matter how many championships they have won — will feel the pressure when the season nears its end. The simple things become a little less simple, decision-making becomes more complicated and less instinctive. Had Liverpool not erred so spectacularly at Palace on Monday, they may have seen evidence of this in their rivals. They would have witnessed experienced international footballers begin to doubt themselves. As it was, City bumped along the road to victory without conviction, but also without any great fear that things were about to go badly wrong. Pellegrini never took anything for granted. In his programme notes, the Chilean called on his club’s supporters to help out. Against Sunderland here last month, City’s fans had been dreadfully flat and Pellegrini believed his team suffered as a result that night. For a long time here, though, it was hard for the supporters not to betray some misgivings. City began slowly, nervously, and grew steadily worse for  an hour. Not until the last minute of the opening half did we think they had scored, Samir Nasri somehow diverting James  Milner’s cross from the right wide of goal. Sitter: Samir Nasri spurns a glorious opportunity just before half-time . City looked leaden-footed and lacking in pace for long periods. David Silva and the endearing Pablo Zabaleta worked well together but, that apart, inspiration was hard to come by. Some of these players were involved when Roberto Mancini’s City team squeaked home against Queens Park Rangers on the final day two seasons ago. Maybe they felt the chill of the flashback before kick-off. Unfortunately for those who were seeking a little unexpected drama, Villa were a side safe from harm. As such, nothing much was expected of them, certainly not by Rodgers and Liverpool, and Paul Lambert’s men surprised nobody. Until the first goal, Villa were energetic and organised and committed. They offered hardly anything when they had the ball, though. It is problem that has plagued Villa boss Lambert all season and it bothered him again on this occasion. Ton up: Yaya Toure scored City's fourth, and their 100th goal of the Premier League season . Twice in the first half Villa did break with intent. On both occasions, though, they were betrayed by finishing that lacked confidence. As he watched at home,  Rodgers must have suffered. He always knew that City were far from certain to win their final two games. He also knew, however, that neither Villa nor West Ham would beat them, not at this stage of the season. Ultimately, City’s goals came in a rush. The last 20 minutes resembled the start of a title party. Yaya Toure’s last-minute goal was wonderful. Had they really needed those goals, they may not have arrived. Pressure, real pressure, does odd things. What will haunt Rodgers all summer is that he never gave City that problem. Agony: Liverpool could not put City under pressure by picking up the win they needed .","Manchester City beat Aston Villa 4-0 yesterday at the Etihad Stadium .

Acting Senior Director of Communicable Diseases, Dr Alun Richards, said measles was highly contagious among people who were not fully immunised. Scroll down for video . Three people who travelled with Jetstar from Indonesia to Brisbane last week have contracted measles . It is spread through coughing and sneezing, and symptoms can include fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough and sore red eyes which usually last for several days before a red, blotchy rash appears. Complications can include an ear infection and diarrhoea as well as more serious and potentially life threatening conditions such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain. Susceptible passengers who may have been exposed to measles on this flight could expect symptoms to appear any time between October 23 and November 3. Local public health units will be contacting passengers who were seated closest to the infected passengers. QLD Health has called on all passengers who flew on Jetstar Airlines flight JQ46 on October 15 to contact their GP if they feel unwell . Other passengers who develop symptoms should phone ahead when seeking medical attention to ensure they don't share the waiting area with other patients, Dr Richards said. Dr Richards said children should receive two doses of measles vaccine. One at 12 months and one at four years of age. People born during or after 1966 who have not received the two doses of measles vaccine are at highest risk, he said. People born before 1966 are usually immune because they are likely to have been exposed to measles during childhood. This year 59 Queenslanders have suffered measles having caught it overseas or from someone else who caught it overseas, Dr Richards said.","Three people who travelled with Jetstar from Indonesia to Brisbane last week have contracted measles .

"Five seconds in Dallas changed the course of American history, and the men haunted most by the memories of that day are the ones who could have had a hand in preventing the tragedy. The assassination of John F Kennedy more than 50 years ago has become a subject of intense scrutiny, with countless books and more than a dozen films devoted to investigating the shooting and its related conspiracy theories. But agents' testimony and the findings of the Warren Commission point to simple steps that might have averted Kennedy's death, namely having the Secret Service agents better prepared for protecting Kennedy instead of staying out late and drinking the night before. Scroll down for video . Sleep deprived: Four agents riding in a follow car had been out until around 3 a.m. before Kennedy's assassination . With the Secret Service in the midst of several scandals,Vanity Fair has taken another look at the readiness of the agency in 1963 and found the hard partying and lackadaisical attitude that plagues the agency now was a problem even then. Veteran CBS broadcaster Bob Schieffer was just a beat reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in 1963, but he recalled on the night before the assassination being in the company of several Secret Service agents into the early hours. Nine agents had wandered over to the Fort Worth Press Club from the Hotel Texas around midnight, searching for a bite to eat after a long day working the escort detail for the president's trip to Texas. Finding the food already gone, agents made do with some scotch and sodas and a couple cans of beer before seven of the agents followed journalists to the Cellar, a late-night hangout in town. 'The Cellar was an all-night San Francisco–style coffee house down the street and some of the visiting reporters had heard about it and wanted to see it,' Schieffer explains. 'So we all went over there and some of the agents came along. The place didn’t have a liquor license, but they did serve liquor to friends—usually grain alcohol and Kool-Aid.' Reflexes: Agent Clint Hill reacted to the first shot by racing up to the president's car, but reportedly struggled to get a hold on the back and scrambled to reach Jackie Kennedy and the fatally wounded president . As the night turned into early morning, several agents remained at what Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, who headed the Warren Commission investigating the assassination, termed a 'beatnik joint.' Four of the agents admitting to be out until around 3 a.m. would be in the motorcade the next morning as the fatal shots struck President Kennedy. After the assassination, Warren tore into James Rowley, the agents' supervisor at the Secret Service for not punishing agents for drinking, which was a punishable offense in the service. Entourage: Kennedy and his wife were joined by Texas governor John Connally and his wife Nellie, as well as two senior agents whose advanced age and failure to react quickly was questioned after the assassination . 'Don’t you think that if a man went to bed reasonably early, and hadn’t been drinking the night before,' Warren fumed, according to author Philip Shenon, 'he would be more alert than if he stayed up until three or five o’clock in the morning going to beatnik joints and doing some drinking along the way?' Whether the agents had even gotten intoxicated has been a matter of debate. 'If they did have something to drink I never saw it,' Shieffer said. 'They may well have had.' The Cellar's owner, Pat Kirkwood, wrote letters shortly after Kennedy's assassination asserting that the agents did not drink that night, but in 1984, he told the Star-Telegram that in spite of being a 'dry' club, the Cellar plied important people like policemen and politicians with significant portions of liquor. Investigation: The Warren Commission, appointed by newly sworn-in President Lyndon B Johnson, took issue with the readiness of agents after Kennedy's assassination . Commish: Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren (fifth from left) hands the report from the Warren Commission over to President Johnson . 'About 3:30, these Secret Service men were sitting around giggling about how the firemen were guarding the president over at the Hotel Texas,' Kirkwood stated. 'After the agents were there we got a call from the White House,' the Cellar's manager Jimmy Hill said, 'asking us not to say anything about them drinking because their image had suffered enough as it was. We didn’t say anything but those guys were bombed. They were drinking pure Everclear,' grain alcohol sold at 151 and 190 proof. The next morning the security detail working in the president's motorcade would include several agents who had stayed out past two according to their testimony to the Warren Commission. Kennedy reportedly disliked having agents in the crowd's line of sight or blocking him from greeting well-wishers along parade routes, so that day the president rode in a limousine with his wife, Texas governor John Connally and his wife Nellie. Behind Kennedy was a follow car where agent Glen Bennet was seated. On footboards attached to the car stood agent Clint Hill on one side with agents Jack Ready and Paul Landis on the other. All four had stayed up until around 3 a.m., with Landis admitting he stayed out until 5 a.m. Justice Warren noted that some attendees noted seeing the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Texas School Book Depository and questioned why the service members didn't see it. 'Wouldn’t a Secret Service man in this motorcade, who is supposed to observe such things, be more likely to observe something of that kind if he was free from any of the results of liquor or lack of sleep than he would have otherwise?' Video from Abraham Zapruder, then a 58-year-old dress manufacturer shooting on a Bell & Howell film camera, shows the first shot strike Kennedy, who draws his fists up to his face in pain. 'I knew right away it was a gunshot,' says Landis today. But the agents were slow to react. At the wheel of Kennedy's car was 54-year-old agent William Greer, whose advanced age was also questioned after the assassination, and instead of accelerating or swerving he pressed the brakes, according to witnesses. Of the agents in the follow car, only Hill raced towards the president. By the time he reached the car in front of him, another shot, this one fatal, had struck Kennedy in the side of the head. Vanity Fair compares the actions to what happened three cars behind Kennedy, where agent Rufus Youngblood sat with Vice President Lyndon B Johnson. At the sound of the first shot, Youngblood, who had not been at the Press Club or the Cellar, followed his service training and pushed Johnson to the floor and covered him with his body. Though it is difficult to say 50 years out what, if anything, could have saved Kennedy, in the few seconds between the first shot that hit Kennedy and the next, there may have been a window where his life could have been saved. For Clint Hill, one of the agents who had been out the night before, those seconds have weighed heavily for years. 'It was my fault,' he told Mike Wallace in 1975. 'If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. . . . I’ll live with that to my grave.'","The Warren Commission took issue with the conduct of several agents who had been out late the night before and were accused of drinking .

"Ryan Giggs has backed Wayne Rooney and Adnan Januzaj to take the World Cup by storm. Rooney will miss a third successive game for Manchester United on Sunday due to a groin problem, although Giggs is sure the England forward will be fit enough to go to the World Cup. But while Rooney is a household name opposition teams will be well aware of, Januzaj is something of an unknown threat. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney nutmeg Moyes and see Januzaj freestyle with Giggs . Double trouble: Ryan Giggs says Adnan Januzaj (left) and Wayne Rooney will shine in Brazil . The 19-year-old may have had a good season with United, but he is yet to earn an international cap. The midfielder only pledged his allegiance to Belgium - the country of his birth - last month.David Moyes used Januzaj sparingly towards the end of his tenure as United boss as he feared the teenager would break down due to exhaustion. But Giggs has no qualms about Januzaj heading to Brazil with his new international team-mates this summer. 'Adnan is the kind of player who could light up a World Cup, whether that is starting games or off the bench,' said the United interim player-manager, who started Januzaj in the 3-1 win over Hull on Tuesday. Decision made: Januzaj (left) pledged his allegiance to Belgium, the country of his birth, last month . 'I was excited when he got the ball the other night - when I was on the pitch and on the bench. 'He floats with the ball effortlessly. He is just one of those players you love watching.' Belgium are outsiders in the running for World Cup glory, but with the likes of Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku, Januzaj and Simon Mignolet among their ranks, they have the potential to reach at least the quarter-finals. England will hope to reach that stage in the tournament too. And they will rely heavily on Rooney to get there. Rooney is England's most dangerous player. His power, pace and eye for goal will worry Italy, Costa Rica and Uruguay, who make up Group D. Danger man: Rooney will lead England's attack at the World Cup Finals in Brazil this summer . But the fact remains that the 28-year-old has yet to live up to his billing on the global stage.Rooney's previous two World Cup campaigns have been hampered by injury, and hie best international tournament came 10 years ago, when he burst onto the scene at Euro 2004. Giggs is sure Rooney can be a leading star for England this summer though. 'Wayne is at the peak of his powers,' said Giggs, who has played alongside Rooney for 10 years. 'Wayne is a top player. He is at a good age. 'I know for a fact he can't wait for it. 'He has had a fantastic season and he is ready to make an impact.' Team-mates: Giggs (left) has backed fellow United player Rooney to be a leading star for England . Rooney broke a metatarsal in April 2006, limiting his impact at the World Cup in Germany and four years later he suffered an ankle injury just before the tournament in South Africa. The former Everton striker recently had a spell out with a toe injury and he now has a groin complaint. The injury will not stop the striker scoring goals at the World Cup, according to Giggs, who is also confident that Phil Jones will be named in Roy Hodgson's 23 on Monday despite a shoulder injury. 'Wayne will be fine for the World Cup,' Giggs said. 'It was just a little groin strain. He is fine. He has done all the work in the gym. 'He trained yesterday. He will be fine. He is going away next week and working on his fitness as well so it has probably helped him. Dejection: Rooney struggled for England in South Africa in 2010 after suffering an ankle injury . 'The injury has probably done him a favour.' Sunday's trip to Southampton will be Giggs' final game in charge of United. When asked whether his short reign had given him more of an appetite for a career in management, Giggs said: 'Yes. 'Sometimes you probably think I could do without it and other times it gives you so much pleasure. 'It has definitely helped me prepare for what will come after my playing career.' Keen for more: Giggs says his reign as interim manager has given him an appetite for a career in management . Giggs remains undecided on what he will do next year. He would like to be Manchester United manager one day, but he does not hold it against the board for looking to appoint a more experienced candidate this summer, like Louis van Gaal, who could be appointed next week. 'There is no major disappointment,' Giggs said. 'I have plenty of time (to manage).'","The United interim manager says Belgium's Januzaj could light up the World Cup in Brazil this summer .

"Andy Murray and Roger Federer will need little reminding that the clock is ticking relentlessly on their careers. The Wimbledon champion is turning 27 and playing in the third round of the Italian Open, while his predecessor will be back at home with his rapidly expanding family, having lost early at his main preparatory event for the French Open. Murray has no celebratory plans, just the focus of taking on Austrian Jurgen Melzer for a place in the last eight, a match he earned with an impressive 6-2, 7-5 victory yesterday over Spain’s Marcel Granollers. Brit of all right: Andy Murray will face Jurgen Melzer in the third round in Italy after beating Marcel Granollers . Up for the battle: Murray was in good form as he attempts to put together a decent run ahead of Wimbledon . Federer’s . visit to the eternal city turned out to be brief, mounting a third-set . comeback before ceding a late match point to lose 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 to . Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. The . great Swiss’s career is far more advanced than Murray’s and afterwards . he dwelt on how much a defeat can hurt him these days, especially at . such a contented time when his twin boys have just arrived. ‘At . this time I know how much a defeat hurts and how much it doesn’t, when . it’s good when it hurts and when it’s not. This one is totally OK if it . doesn’t hurt,’ he admitted. ‘I . tried everything; you can’t do more than that on the court. Sure, it . wasn’t fun leaving the court, walking through the corridor and thinking . what happened out there, so maybe I was angry and disappointed and . frustrated but then I was like: “OK, let’s just do the press conference . and go home, let’s not waste too much more time.”’ Yellow peril: Marcel Granollers was soundly beaten in Rome by the British No 1 on Wednesday . Heading home: Roger Federer departs after losing in three sets to Frenchman Jeremy Chardy . It . was a particularly painful reverse for Federer, 32, who led 6-5 in the . tiebreak when Chardy pulled out a freakishly good forehand passing shot. Two more points and Federer was off to the airport where a private jet . got him home for bathtime. Murray’s . French Open prospects will start to look a whole lot rosier if he can . beat Melzer, a left-hander against whom he holds a 5-0 record. Having . fallen to a listless defeat in Madrid last week, he cut a totally different figure, calmly handling  atrociously windy conditions and . playing smartly within himself for a creditable win against the world No . 31. Murray . was also unrecognisable from the player who met the same opponent a . year ago in the same round, having to pull out at a set all with back . problems that forced him out of Paris. He has come here without any . specialist physio in his team. Like Federer, he was also reflective . about the passage of time. Relief: Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates as he comes through a tough test against France's Gilles Simon . ‘Birthdays for me are not the same as when you’re 12 years old, really.  I don’t look forward to them,’  he said. ‘No . plans. If I go home for a couple of days (before Paris) I’ll do . something. No girlfriend or family or friends here this year...well, not . that I know of. Maybe they’ll surprise me.’ A win for Murray over Melzer will probably see the Scot go on to face Rafael Nadal in the quarters. The Spaniard laboured again on Wednesday night, but ultimately saw off Frenchman Gilles Simon 7-6, 6-7, 6-2.","British No 1 wins 6-2, 7-5 in his Rome Opener .

"When you’ve done a six-month tour of duty in the badlands of Helmand Province, the prospect of an Aviva Premiership play-off decider isn’t too frightening. Neither, for that matter, is a Test debut. Semesa Rokoduguni is pursuing two careers in tandem; rugby player and soldier. Last weekend, his parallel worlds collided as he made a try-scoring contribution to the Army’s victory over the Navy in front of 80,000 supporters at Twickenham. The 26-year-old Fijian is making waves on the wing for Bath, putting him on course to play for England in the near future. But he has already served his adopted country in battle of the life-and-death variety, with bullets and bombs to contend with, rather than tackles and tries. National service: Bath winger Semesi Rokoduguni whie on tour with the army in Afghanistan . Rising star: Fijian-raised Rokoduguni has impressed in his first full Premiership season for Bath . George Orwell drew comparisons between the field of play and the field of combat, saying that ‘sport is war minus the shooting’, and Rokoduguni agrees there are similarities between the two arenas. ‘Out there in Afghanistan, it is like when you’re playing rugby; you look after each other,’ he said. ‘You depend on the guys around you and they depend on you. We all cover each other’s backs.’ A military life was all but inevitable for Rokoduguni, who was keen to continue a long family tradition of joining the forces. He is a lance corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, and his younger brother is based in Inverness with the Black Watch and is due to go to Afghanistan later this year. His father is currently on a UN peacekeeping mission in Egypt. Front line: Rokoduguni runs in a try for Army in their 30-17 defeat of Navy at Twickenham on May 3 . Having graduated from the Army training centre at Bovington in Dorset, he was deployed as a tank driver, before being sent to Helmand as a foot soldier. Despite the constant dangers, he relished being able to put his combat ability to the test on the front line. No fear: The lance corporal will do battle Harlequins in their shoot-out for a play-off spot on Saturday . ‘When I went to Afghanistan, I was attached to an infantry regiment,’ he said. ‘I was on foot patrols four times a day in the north of the province where most of the action was going on. I spent six to eight months out there, patrolling day-in, day-out. ‘It was scary at times, but it is pretty much like rugby. You can practise all the time, but you can only find out how good you are when you actually do the job. ‘We had trained for a year or two, so it was a chance to use our skills, but you know there’s no room for mistakes. ‘The risks are so much more than in rugby. People can die. Two of my mates were shot, but they just had flesh wounds. A marine died on the week we arrived. He stepped on an IED (improvised explosive device), it blew off both his legs and he was gone. There was a lot of small-arms fire, and the threat of suicide bombers.’ Rokoduguni initially believed he would have to make a choice between a military and sporting career, but soon discovered that the Army would encourage his desire to pursue both. Having grown up in the village of Naselai, near Fiji’s capital, Suva, he set his sights on emulating Apo Satala, who played Test rugby for the Pacific island nation while serving as a soldier. Later, the pair met and the former Gloucester back-rower convinced the younger man to chase his rugby dream. Encouraged: Rather than forcing a choice between rugby and service, the army backs his sporting dream . ‘The dream of all Fijian guys is to play rugby,’ he said. ‘Kids play it everywhere. If they have a ball, they are lucky. If they don’t have a ball, they improvise and use  bottles or a shoe. I played with my mates and boys in the village. There was nothing organised.’ The hobby developed into something far more substantial within the structure of the British Army. His innate talent quickly opened doors. First came Under 23 and sevens selection, for tournaments all around the world, then  Rokoduguni was introduced to the 15-a-side game. His breakthrough came when he played for the Army against  Newcastle in Portugal, catching the eye of Gary Gold and Mike Ford. The coaches brought him to the North East for a trial, then after moving to Bath, they again gave him a chance, which he took. When the call came to say he was being signed up, he didn’t believe it. ‘I thought it was a joke,’ he said. ‘I was back in Germany, where my unit is based, after my trial. Gary called me and said, “Roko, we want to offer you a one-year deal”. I said, “No. Shut up. Who is this?”  He said it was Gary Gold and I said, “No it isn’t” and hung up!’ Hard yards: From the parks of Fiji to The Rec, Rokoduguni was spotted by the now Bath coaches in Germany . Now in his first full season for the West Country club, he has shown sufficient prowess to interest the England management. Fiji made enquiries, but after playing for the Saxons earlier this year, Rokoduguni has set his sights on wearing the Red Rose in a Test match. His chance may come as soon as next month, on the tour of New Zealand. He added: ‘My boss in the Army said, “You’ve been playing really well, soon England or Fiji will come knocking at your door”. Fiji tried to contact me, but I’d rather wait to see if I can play for England. There are loads of Fijian players at home who are better than me.’ Before Rokoduguni contemplates more national service, there are pressing club matters to focus on. On Saturday, Bath face Harlequins at The Stoop and a place in the play-offs is on the line. For the  soldier in the visitors’ ranks, this is a shoot-out that will hold no fear. For players hoping to earn Test selection, unsure if they will make the cut, the  suspense must be hard to cope with. Well, that won’t be an issue for Wales candidates later this month. Final look: Warren Gatland will name his Wales team for South Africa after a Possibles v Probables match . Billy . Twelvetrees is out for four to six weeks with ankle damage, says . Gloucester boss Nigel Davies, and is likely to miss England’s tour of . New Zealand . The WRU on Thursday confirmed a Probables v Possibles trial match at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea on May 30, with Rob Howley and Robin McBryde taking charge of the respective teams. Many of the 46 players will be pretty certain of their selection for the South Africa tour already, but others on the fringes won’t have a long wait to find out. Warren Gatland will name his tour party at the post-match press conference, so some contenders will be given good news while they’re still getting changed. Sebastien Chabal is retiring, taking the game’s most iconic, caveman beard with him. In his pomp, ‘Sea-bass’ was a force of nature - giving his best years to Sale as a No 8 whose swashbuckling ball-carrying feats illuminated the English game. Philippe Saint-Andre, his coach at the . time, once delivered this assessment of his qualities: ‘We use science . to build rugby machines and he just smashes them.’ Hero: France flanker Sebastien Chabal retires after an eventful career, finished by helping Lyon to promotion . Best years: France legend Chabal gave some of his greatest performances to Sale in the England Premiership . At the 2007 World Cup, he became the darling of France, even when not in the starting team. The sight of him staring down the Haka before the quarter-final victory over the All Blacks in Cardiff will live in the memory, as will the surprising image of Chabal driving to and from training in a Smart car. Occasionally prone to drifting out of games, he could be a moody character, but on his day he was majestic; a truly French hero. It certainly wasn’t dull, was it? Last weekend’s round of six Aviva Premiership matches yielded 45 tries as the elite clubs made hay in the sun. It was further proof that the notion of summer rugby - as frequently championed by this column - makes sense. The weather and the glorious attacking fare draw crowds and generate excitement. Try feast: Wasps' Charlie Hayter scores in their win over Newcastle, one of 45 Premiership tries in the round . Free-flowing: The impressive sunshine scorelines advocate top level rugby in England being played in summer . Those against a calendar shift argue that it would rob the sport of variety, always producing fast-and-loose games and no attritional, forward-dominated contests. Nonsense. There is nothing to stop teams with an advantage up front from driving in scrums and mauls under blue skies. In fact, dry surfaces aid that facet of the game. Studs can grip better when turf doesn’t give way. Playing when the conditions are better merely promotes strategic choice and the use of essential skills. Those who hanker for mud and gloom are losing their footing in this perennial debate.","Rokoduguni, 26, will line up for Bath in their play-off decider at Harlequins .

"Alan Johnson giving a statement on the Ireland bailout in 2010 during his time as shadow chancellor . Despite fewer and fewer people reading them, publishers keep churning out politicians’ memoirs. Out of duty I try to read most of them – but usually stop in a state of nausea after a few chapters, as the fantasy and the titanic self-regard, not to mention the shocking standard of writing, become too much. But last year, for the first time in decades, I found myself gripped by a politician’s autobiography. It revealed an honesty, humanity, realism and decency that were sincere, beautifully expressed, and which left me in awe. The book was This Boy, Alan Johnson’s account of growing up in the 1950s in what was then down-at-heel West London, in a home that was exceptionally deprived. His father had deserted the family, and his mother – whose values of decency are a constant point of reference for him – died when he was 12. Mr Johnson, who went on to be a Labour Home Secretary, tells how he was raised in a council flat by his devoted sister (barely more than a child herself, and the heroine of the book), married at 17 and became a postman. It is a book about the unconquerability of the human spirit, a philosophical idea one encounters all too rarely in modern politicians. He was always a person of high intelligence and talent. He passed his 11-plus and went to grammar school, but had to leave at 15 to support his family, which he did by stocking shelves in a supermarket. Many politicians would kill for such a back-story, and would have manipulated this tale for sympathy or support. That Mr Johnson did not is a mark of the man – a man utterly straight and, despite (or perhaps because of) the hardships of that upbringing, of strong character and entirely devoid of self-pity. Scroll down for video . It is now reported that a cabal of senior Labour figures is airing the possibility of launching a coup against the increasingly hopeless Ed Miliband and trying to parachute Mr Johnson into the Labour leadership, thereby rescuing the party from its present rudderless, strategy-free state. I don’t blame them for panicking, and I certainly don’t blame them for identifying Mr Johnson as the man who might – just might – win the public round to Labour again. The byzantine means by which Labour elects its leaders, and prevents their removal, almost certainly ensures that Mr Miliband is safe in his post for as long as he wishes to occupy it. Yet it is suggested that friends of Mr Johnson hope he may be persuaded to challenge for the job. If true, from Labour’s point of view that is good news, because anyone looking in from outside can see that his qualities as a regular bloke – albeit one who had held three senior cabinet posts at Education, Health and the Home Office – would make him an enormous hit with voters in an election campaign. Mr Johnson pictured on the Andrew Marr Show in 2010, attacking the Government's public sector cuts . I have never voted Labour in my life. But as I read his book – the highly-acclaimed sequel to which, Please Mr Postman, has just been published – I could not help thinking that if Mr Johnson were to lead Labour and cast it in his own image, I would not be the only person in Britain who would consider breaking the habit of a lifetime and voting for him. I’ve long been an admirer of Mr Johnson, who I thought navigated through the collapse of the Brown government with a common sense and dignity that many of his colleagues would have done well to follow. When they were grandstanding, intriguing and point-scoring, he was usually just getting on with it. Shortly after Labour’s 2010 defeat and Gordon Brown’s resignation as party leader, I appeared on BBC1’s Question Time with Mr Johnson, and asked him why he had not put his hat in the ring. He replied that family considerations – notably wanting to devote time to his young son, giving him a family life he himself had not enjoyed – precluded it. Following Ed Miliband’s election, Mr Johnson was appointed shadow chancellor, not least because the new Labour leader wanted a reason not to give the job to Ed Balls, who was deeply unpopular after Labour’s defeat. Sadly, Mr Johnson’s second marriage broke down shortly afterwards, and he left the shadow cabinet for personal reasons. Mr Balls replaced him. As well as losing a man who would have been a successful shadow chancellor and would have given their economic policy more coherence, Labour lost someone whose wisdom and level-headedness would have added enormous gravity to an otherwise feeble opposition. Mr Johnson began as a Marxist and even when he joined Labour more than 40 years ago he considered himself a communist. He has been, and perhaps to an extent still is, a visceral socialist. He refused to buy the council house in which he lived with his first wife, believing the housing stock should be preserved for others in the future. Mr Johnson (right) has been identified as a possible successor to incumbent Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) When health secretary in 2007 he criticised a breast cancer patient for buying a drug not available on the NHS, saying that to mix treatment between the private and public sectors would undermine the ‘founding principles’ of the NHS. However, there is another side to him. Many years earlier, when still leader of the Communication Workers’ Union, he was the only boss of a significant trade union to back the repeal of Clause Four of Labour’s constitution, which required the party to support public ownership of the means of production. He also recalls in his latest memoir the ‘shame’ he later felt at having ‘colluded’ in breaking the spirit of a postman colleague who refused to join the others on strike. Mr Johnson says he believes that politics is not about Right and Left, but about right and wrong. For many – and I am one – the fact Mr Johnson started at the bottom, had a real job, and worked his way up to become one of the more moderate and respected trade union leaders would be his greatest qualification to run his party, and possibly the country. The fact is that the country is crying out for an end to the stranglehold that callow young men with degrees in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford, and early careers as special advisers to cabinet ministers, have on our government. There is a growing sense that we are living in an age where there is widespread public disrespect for pygmy politicians. This is because too many of those who claim to represent us do nothing of the sort, because they have no idea how life is for millions of people. A rarefied education is compounded by the fact that they have usually done no more with that privilege than use it to worm their way up the greasy pole of Westminster. How very different to Alan Johnson. Not only does he have no university education, no trust fund or link to the old boy network, but he spent years before becoming a union official pounding pavements and, as he says in his latest book, feeding people’s cats when they went away as part of the normal, decent, human interaction a postman would have with his customers. He had to struggle to provide for a family while doing a job that was unglamorous and poorly paid. Its rewards, however, were a vital understanding of people – something that too many of today’s politicians could never dream of having. We’ll soon find out how serious Labour is about winning next May’s general election from whether they have the courage to get rid of Mr Miliband as their leader. And with Alan Johnson – a genuine, highly articulate and deeply principled working-class hero, respected by Tory voters – available to be persuaded to succeed him, one wonders what on earth they are waiting for.","Alan Johnson identified as possible replacement for leader Ed Miliband .

"The federal government is using a legal process called 'civil forfeiture' to seize massive amounts of money from unsuspecting Americans – without alleging that they've committed any crimes. Laws put on the books to help the government track drug trafficking proceeds and terrorists' cash reserves are regularly contorted, according to a civil rights group, by prosecutors who see easy access to piles of cash that ultimately pays their salaries. The financial seizures leave some honest small businessmen and women out of luck when their life savings disappear and their family trades teeter on the edge of insolvency. In one case, the IRS took $446,000 from a mostly cash-only small business that distributes candy, snacks and cigarettes to convenience stores. Brothers Jeffrey, Richard and Mitch Hirsch lost that money two years ago when the federal government raided their bank account. In another, the government grabbed $33,000 from Iowa restaurateur Carole Hinders, who deals only in cash. No criminal charges have been brought in either case. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Carole Hinders runs a cash-only Mexican restaurant in Iowa; federal agents knocked on her door in 2013 to say they had seized her bank account, and she has never been charged with any crime . Jeffrey, Richard and Mitch Hirsch operate a candy and snack distributorship and customarily deal in large amounts of cash – reason enough for the IRS to seize $446,000 from their accounts and sit on it for two years . 'I did not do anything wrong, but they took my money,' Hinders said Monday. 'I was unable to pay my bills for the first time in my life. I had to borrow money, use my credit cards and beg vendors to extend me credit. This nightmare has left me broke, frightened and exhausted.' The Institute for Justice, a nonprofit legal organization, is representing Hinders and the Hirsch family. The New York Times interviewed David Smith, a former federal prosecutor who is now a forfeiture expert. 'They're going after people who are really not criminals,' Smith said. 'They're middle-class citizens who have never had any trouble with the law.' Institute for Justice attorney Larry Salzman told MailOnline that 'civil forfeiture is a nationwide scandal. ... It's one of the most significant threats to private property in the country.' 'The bottom line is that these harsh civil forfeiture laws were aimed at serious criminals. Nobody expected them to be used against people for depositing their own money in their own bank accounts.' Equally troubling, he said, is that the laundry list of federal agencies that take Americans' property on a regular basis can keep it – pocketing cash and selling other assets – in order to pay salaries and grow their budgets for the next round of seizures. While they ultimately refer criminal cases to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution, forfeited assets stay with the investigating agencies. Salzman wouldn't comment on the personalities involved, but said the conflict of interest made his job harder. 'Prying this power away from government agencies is always met with resistance,' he said. 'They are benefiting directly financially from these forfeitures and that's a major part of the problem.' After the Times inquired with the IRS, the agency said it would soon pare back its efforts at targeting money belonging to law-abiding citizens. Its investigators will instead focus on funds they believe were ill-gotten or fall into unspecified 'exceptional circumstances.' But past seizures will not be resolved any differently. IRS Criminal Investigations chief Richard Weber said in a statement to the Times that the 'policy update' will help his unit 'focus our limited investigative resources on identifying and investigating violations within our jurisdiction that closely align with C.I.'s mission and key priorities.' 'I did not do anything wrong, but they took my money,' Hinders said. 'This nightmare has left me broke, frightened and exhausted' Court papers: Hinders had the rare courtesy of a court order for her cash, but she hasn't been granted a hearing and won't see a judge until June 2015 – two years after her money was snatched . Bi-County Distributors, the Hirsches' 27-year-old business, regularly makes large cash bank deposits. So does Mrs. Lady's Mexican Food, the lunch spot that Hinders operates. But it's the amounts of those deposits that caught the IRS's attention. Banks are required to report cash transactions of $10,000 or more, so a common practice among drug traffickers and other criminals is to keep deposits in the four-figure range. The feds sometimes flag a repeated pattern of deposits near but less than $10,000 as 'structured' payments – and there's a federal law against it. But no one has accused either business of violating it, or any other law. Neither forfeiture was preceded by a warning of any kind. Weber insists that depositing amounts less than $10,000 in order to evade reporting laws is still a crime, even if the funds were earned legally. Some taxpayers, an IRS official told MailOnline Monday, use series of small cash deposits to avoid income tax reporting. 'The government is not going to lessen its attention on tax evasion,' the official said, 'so scrutinizing cash depositors is always going to be part of our approach.' In the Hirsches' case, the government never formally applied to a court for permission to take their cash. That's a clear violation of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, the Institute for Justice says. Congress passed that law in 2000 to curb abuses by prosecutors under forfeiture laws. 'Prosecutors in some offices spent years trying to undermine those reforms,' said Salzman, the Institute for Justice attorney. 'This case would set an important precedent that greater due process is required in forfeiture cases than many prosecutors seem to believe.' 'Besides, these people have a right to defend themselves. The government shouldn't take property under these laws from people who did nothing wrong and didn't even know that they were potentially breaking some obscure banking law.' Hinders runs Mrs. Lady's Mexican Food in Arnolds Park, Iowa, and accepts only cash and checks . Cash inventory: Jeff Hirsch, one of three brothers who own Bi-County Distributors on Long Island is still out $446,000 as the government sits on the company's cash and won't explain why . Salzman told MailOnline that the government typically drags its feet when challenged – or has to be dragged into court to explain itself. 'Civil forfeiture laws do not provide for any prompt hearing in front of a judge. They violate the basic notion of due process,' he said. 'The government can take this money and just sit on it, and try to force you into a settlement. Which is what they've done in this case and in others.' In the Iowa case, the Times reported Monday that Hinders got a knock on her door last year from two federal agents who told her that her checking account had been seized. 'How can this happen?' she asked the Times. 'Who takes your money before they prove that you've done anything wrong with it?' Hinders won't see a judge until at least May 2015, since she's not entitled to a preliminary hearing where a judge might conclude the IRS had no justification to take her earnings. 'We're just saying the government should have to show it has probable cause to hold that money,' Salzman said. 'Why not give a prompt post-seizure hearing to make sure the government doesn't have the facts wrong?' Is the government trying to use civil forfeiture to take your cash, car or home even though you haven't broken any laws?

"Tony Pulis has offered no guarantees that he will still be in charge at Crystal Palace next season. The Eagles face relegated Fulham on Sunday as they bring the curtain down on a remarkable campaign, in which Pulis has hauled them from the bottom three in November to mid-table. But the Selhurst Park boss will hold talks with chairman Steve Parish next week and wants assurances about the direction of the club before deciding whether the trip to Craven Cottage will be his last game at the helm. Ambitious: Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis could leave the club this summer despite their success . 'Will I be here next season? I hope so,' he said. 'I've got two years left on my contract but there are managers with longer than that who get the sack, so you can never say I'm going to be here 100 percent. 'I think there are certain things that should be done at football clubs to enable them to be successful. 'The club has a window of opportunity, the best opportunity the club has had for a long, long time to actually go forth and improve on and off the pitch. 'I had a smashing meeting with Steve on Thursday. We'll get the game out of the way on Sunday and Steve will have spoken to the other directors about my thoughts about moving the club on, and we will all be having dinner again next week when no doubt those discussions will go on further. 'You can't stop speculation and people saying he's going to do this or that. The two most important people at a club are the chairman and the manager. My relationship with Steve has grown stronger and stronger the longer I have been at the club.' Fans' favourite: Pulis has become popular with Palace supporters after guiding them to Premier League safety . Pulis guided his former club Stoke into the top flight and turned them into Premier League mainstays over the next five years, and clearly he wants to achieve the same with Palace. 'There's so much work to be done but Steve recognises that,' he added. 'Are we at loggerheads? No we aren't, he understands what's needed.' 'Stoke had been outside the top league for 20-odd years and that shouldn't have happened with the support up there. 'I had a chairman who agreed with what we wanted to do. If the two of you pull in the same way and you get results you can move mountains. We did that at Stoke and we can do it at Palace. 'I've been amazed about how passionate the supporters have been and how big the club could be - there are millions of chimney pots around here, and wherever there are chimney pots there are people who will come and watch football.' Pulis will have a fully-fit squad at Fulham after striker Cameron Jerome recovered from the illness which kept him out of the 3-3 draw with Liverpool on Monday.

"The high-priced prostitute accused of killing a Google executive by injecting him with heroin claims she was simply following orders. Alix Tichelman, 26, was on board Forrest Hayes's yacht in Santa Cruz, California, when the 51-year-old father-of-five suffered a lethal overdose and died last November, a court has heard. But denying manslaughter, Tichelman's lawyers insist her customer requested the shot. 'Consensual': Lawyers for Alex Tichelman (pictured) in court on Monday said she and Google executive Forrest Hayes were 'consensual adults involved in mutual drug usage' Following orders? Lawyers for Alex Tichelman (left) claim Forrest Hayes (right) told her to inject heroin into him . 'My client Alix didn't do anything to Mr Hayes that he didn't want to happen to him,' defense attorney Larry Biggam said at a procedural hearing today, according to NBC. 'She did what she was asked. Consensual adults involved in mutual drug usage. It went wrong but it wasn't intended.' Biggam also called on police to release the full surveillance video taken from the boat, which prosecutors are using as evidence for a number of allegations. The footage allegedly shows Tichelman injecting Hayes before watching him die then finishing her glass of wine and stepping over the body. She then spends time researching legal strategies online, police claim, before gathering her belongings to leave, hours before Hayes was found dead. Police have berated Tichelman for appearing to make no effort to call 911 in the video described. Her defense team has only seen 20 minutes of the footage described in court but Biggam insists it shows the overdose was 'accidental'. She now faces eight charges which all carry 15-year jail terms, including manslaughter, prostitution, destroying evidence and several related to administering and possessing heroin. The next hearing is scheduled for December 5. Accusations: Police claim a surveillance video shows Tichelman watching Hayes die before stepping over him . On board: Tichelman's lawyers want police to release a surveillance video taken from the Santa Cruz yacht where Hayes was found which they claim proves it was an accidental, consensual overdose of heroin . Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter. That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said. Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident before eventually uncovering Tichelman's correspondence with the victim. They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested. She was booked into jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, concealing evidence and transportation of narcotics and remains there on a $1.5 million bond. Hayes, who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his obituary. He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google. 'Forrest will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat,' according to a January obituary. 'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.' Tichelman's Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist. She called herself a 'model' in jail records. On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera. Charges: Tichelman is facing up to 15 years for  eight charges including manslaughter and prostitution . Lured: She was arrested after law enforcement officers posed as a client and lured her to a Santa Cruz hotel . In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character. 'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an ""intense child"" and already liked horror movies.' She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her boyfriend. She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the serial killer TV show, 'Dexter'. Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.","Alex Tichelman, 26, 'injected father-of-five Forrest Hayes, 51, with heroin last November but did nothing when he had a reaction to the drug'

"A father of four who was sacked over comments he made on Facebook has been awarded more than £30,000 at an employment tribunal. Alan Blue, 51, worked for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) as a meat hygiene inspector at Wishaw Abattoir in Lanarkshire. But he lost his job on November 5 last year after he ‘liked’ a posting on the social media site that appeared to encourage violent behaviour towards the manager. Scroll down for video . Payout: Alan Blue, who was a meat hygiene inspector for the FSA at Wishaw Abattoir in Lanarkshire, was sacked after making posts on Facebook that his bosses didn't like . Mr Blue said: ‘I was at home watching the telly and went on to Facebook on my phone. ‘I saw one of the guys from the abattoir put on that he was gutted he’d been sacked. ‘I hadn’t heard anything so I replied saying, “Sorry to hear that, hope you find something”. He then said one of the other slaughtermen, Willie, had also been sacked. ‘Then Willie joined in and said something daft that someone had hit one of the managers with his hard hat and I meant to put in “Aye right, u wish” and I hit the “i” button by mistake, so it came up “Aye right, i wish”, which was a genuine typo. ‘I never noticed at the time and the conversation went on and one of the guys said “I should’ve just f****d him over the head with a chair” and I ticked the “like” box.’ Almost two weeks later Mr Blue was approached by his manager who said there’d been a complaint from the abattoir concerning comments on Facebook. Facebook problems: Mr Blue said the comment was ‘just banter’, adding: ‘As far as I was concerned it was a closed conversation.’ The FSA launched a disciplinary investigation, claiming the posts were a ‘breach of trust’ and ‘not professional’. However, Mr Blue said the comment was ‘just banter’, adding: ‘As far as I was concerned it was a closed conversation.’ During the tribunal, the FSA claimed there had been a breakdown in trust and confidence between the agency and Mr Blue. But employment judge Peter Wallington, QC, said: ‘There was no objective reason to believe that his performance would in the future be different simply because of his foolish participation in what he had mistakenly believed to be a private online conversation that had become more public.’ Mr Blue was awarded £32,799.13 for unfair dismissal but he says he has not received any of the money since the June ruling and would rather have his job back. He added: ‘I regret liking the comment because I never meant to harm anyone.’ An FSA spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed with the tribunal’s conclusions but believe that the decisions managers took were the right ones given the circumstances at the time.’","Alan Blue was sacked after he 'liked' a post apparently encouraging violence .

"The Somali woman lives in a stick hut covered by ragged blankets in the dusty Shedder refugee camp in Ethiopia. It was here that her 15-year-old son wanted to travel on a perilous journey as a stowaway on a plane from California. Ubah Mohammed Abdule hasn't seen her boy - who was hospitalized in Hawaii after landing there last week in the wheel well of a jetliner - for eight long years. Clutching her black-and-white head covering, she wept Sunday as she stood before the flimsy shelter holding her meager possessions and spoke about her son, Yahya Abdi. Oceans apart: In this photo taken Sunday, April 27, 2014, Ubah Mohammed Abdule (right), 33, sits with her son Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, eight, and daughter Neshad Yusuf Ahmed, five, center, outside her hut in the Shedder refugee camp in far eastern Ethiopia . Strange land: Yahya Abdi has found it difficult to settle in the U.S. and misses his mother, who is living in a refugee camp in Ethiopia . She was alarmed, she said, by the dangerous journey the teenager undertook. Those who stow away in wheel wells of airplanes have little chance of surviving, and many who attempt it are Africans desperate for a better life in Europe or America. Yahya Abdi had been unhappy in California and desperately missed his mother, according to those who know his family. So on April 20, Abdi hopped a fence at San Jose International Airport and climbed into the wheel well of a jetliner. It was bound for Hawaii, the opposite direction of Ethiopia. Somehow he survived the sub-zero temperatures and lack of oxygen. He has not spoken publicly about the ordeal. 'I knew he was an intelligent boy who has strong affections for me. I also knew he always wanted to see me, but I know his father won't let them contact me at all,' Abdule told an Associated Press reporter in this remote camp in eastern Ethiopia. The boy's father, Abdulahi Yusuf, had lied to their three children, Abdule said, telling them that she was dead. Perilous journey: The Somali mother's home is a small shelter with a frame of sticks covered by ragged blankets but it was to her that her 15-year-old son Yahya Abdi wanted to travel to on an impossible journey as a stowaway on a plane from California . Act of desperation: Abdule's son hasn't spoken publicly about his five-hour flight in the wheel well of a plane in an attempt to reunite with his mother . 'He first took the children away from . me to Sudan. Then he came back to Somalia and demanded my consent for . him to take the children to the U.S. if I wanted a formal divorce. I was . not OK with that and said no,' Abdule said through tears. 'Finally, he . took all three of my children to the U.S. without my knowledge.' Yusuf . said in a statement Sunday issued through a family spokesman in . California that his son was 'struggling adjusting to life' in America. 'Our . situation was aggravated by our displacement in Africa for many years . after fleeing our home country of Somalia because of war conditions. As a . result, my son was not able to receive any formal education before we . immigrated to the United States,' the statement said. Shedder .

She earns a small income selling vegetables . in the camp market. Miracle survival: The 15-year-old boy, seen sitting on a stretcher, who stowed away in the wheel well of a flight from San Jose to Maui is loaded into an ambulance at Kahului Airport in Kahului, Maui, Hawaii .

Ethiopian government's refugee office provided the distraught mother . with psychological support after she heard about her son's story from a . friend who lives in the U.S., said Kibebew Abera, a camp official. 'She was panicked. With the support of our partners, we provided her with advice and consultation,' he said. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she spoke of her son, Abdi. Mother . and son have had no contact since he moved to the U.S. in 2006. Abdele . said she wants to leave the camp and reunite with her children and has . asked the Ethiopian government and the U.N. refugee agency to help her . do so. 'My son was silent but intelligent when he was with me. I know he concealed himself in a plane to see me,' Abdule said. Torn apart: Abdule says her former husband took her three children, including Yahya, to America without her permission and she hasn't seen them in eight years . Grief: Ubah Mohammed Abdule, 33, sheds tears as she talks about her son Yahya Abdi, outside her hut in the Shedder refugee camp . Brothers and sisters: Ubah Mohammed Abdule walks with her daughter Neshad Yusuf Ahmed outside her hut in the Shedder refugee camp near the town of Jigjiga . The . teen's father said he plans to fly to Hawaii soon to reunite with him . and is 'excited to bring him back home to his family in California.' The . family was 'deeply concerned' when the boy went missing and was . relieved to hear he was safe, Yusuf said. Abdule . said she hasn't been able to eat since learning of her son's . misadventure.

Highest finish: 6th (2008, 2009, 2010) Lerner has been searching for a buyer for months, and talks with an associate in the United States stalled, but has now made public his intentions in a bid to attract concrete offers in the region of £200million. Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been tasked with handling the exchange but no timescale has been placed on the purchase, and with such a large amount of money at stake any conclusion is not likely to come quickly. That renders Lambert’s ambitions to move on transfer targets extremely difficult and third parties have been made aware that any potential deals will not be acted upon with budgets unclear. Lambert has repeatedly stressed that significant investment in the playing squad is required to lift the team out of a fifth consecutive season of struggle next year. Lerner’s confirmation places Lambert’s role under greater scrutiny, however, with no assurances given that the 44-year-old Scot would remain in charge if a new owner was found. Last month Lambert said: ‘Listen, if a new guy comes in and doesn’t like you…It’ s not something I’ve ever thought about it. I’ve not been a part of that but as far as I’m concerned, I want to be here.’ The club took also took the . last-minute step of cancelling the end-of-season awards dinner scheduled . for tonight, in light of the statement from Lerner. Tickets . for the bash, described as the biggest event in the club’s calendar, . cost £85 per head and have been sold out for some time, but Villa . decided it was not in good interest to throw a party. Familiar feeling: Gabriel Agbonlahor and Jordan Bowery restart the game during Villa's 3-0 loss at Tottenham . The Shunammite woman was a wealthy and well respected person in the society. This is how the Bible described her. The Shunammite woman's life teaches important lessons about these three essential qualities: contentment, a kind of heart, persistence . Lerner, former Cleveland Browns owner, bought Villa for £62.6m to own in 2006 and invested some £217m in his search for Champions League football under Martin O’Neill. But since 2010 he has reigned in spending and rarely been seen at Villa Park. In the latest accounts for Lerner’s holding company Villa debts to him stood at £179m, but he converted £90m worth into equity last December. It is not clear whether the asking price covers this substantial debt. Merrill Lynch believe there will be no shortage of interested buyers from across the globe – and in promotional material stated the club has ‘almost 1m known supporters’, but it remains to be seen if a bid to match Lerner’s thinking is lodged. ‘I have come to know well that fates are fickle in the business of English football,’ said Lerner. ‘And I feel that I have pushed mine well past the limit. The last several seasons have been week in, week out battles and having now come through this last season unfortunately limping amidst very meaningful injuries and constant sale rumours, I feel further that now is the time for me to look for new ownership and thus new leadership. ‘I have asked the world of Paul Lambert and Paul Faulkner and they have both delivered selflessly. On a personal level it is time for me, like the Shunammite, to dwell among my own and get on with other aspects of my career, following a sale. ‘Above all, the debt I owe Aston Villa whether as owner, Chairman, custodian or simply as a fan is to put the Club first. To make good on that debt, I owe it to Villa to move on, and look for fresh, invigorated leadership, if in my heart I feel I can no longer do the job.’ Not amused: Villa fans, many in fancy dress, chanted 'We want our Villa back' during the defeat to Spurs . Several . weeks back I said that following the end of the season I would clarify . my future role with the club, and address what had become seemingly . constant rumours of a sale. I have come to know well that fates are . fickle in the business of English football. And I feel that I have . pushed mine well past the limit.

To make good on that debt, I . owe it to Villa to move on, and look for fresh, invigorated leadership, . if in my heart I feel I can no longer do the job. During . my time with Villa, I have tried to strengthen and improve the club's . physical infrastructure both at Villa Park and Bodymoor Heath while also . trying to carry on the McGregor tradition of being mindful of the local . community we serve. Above all in this effort is the connection the club . has made with Acorns; the caring, kindness and warmth that players, . staff, managers and supporters have shown to Mr Strudley and Acorns has . wiped away all disappointments and sobered my finest memories. Still, . I can see now that it is time, if possible, to hand these privileges . and responsibilities to the next person or group to take the club . forward. I am appreciative of the support I have received, even in these . last years of comparative struggle when criticism was due, and will . look on with others - with fingers crossed, for stronger future . performance appropriate to our size and heritage. On . a practical level, the club will continue with its normal operations . and plans for the summer. I've no doubt that the core staff at both . Villa Park and BMH, to whom I owe a massive debt of friendship and . loyalty, will continue to guide and protect the club through this period . of transition according to their collective sense of professional pride . and long term service to Villa - the vast majority having preceded my . tenure. Finally, in light of the above, I have engaged Bank of America Merrill Lynch to advise on the sale of Aston Villa.","Randy Lerner has announced the club has been put up for sale .

"Lionel Messi will sign a new contract at Barcelona, making him the best-paid player in the world, before the end of the week. The player’s father met with the club officials Javier Faus and Antoni Rossich last week and effectively closed the deal which will keep the player, who will be 27 in June, at the club until 2018. Messi’s £200m buy-out clause will remain but the player’s wages are expected to rise to £15.5m net which will take him beyond Cristiano Ronaldo who earns £15m a season at Real Madrid.

"Sam Allardyce has survived Tuesday's crucial showdown talks, but is still in serious danger of losing his job next week. Sportsmail revealed last week how Allardyce would lose his job due to supporter unrest over his tactics. His fate was due to be sealed during an end of season review, but Sportsmail understands the club are yet to wield the axe. Waiting game: Sam Allardyce could be set to stay at the club amidst rumours of his sacking . Questions: Allardyce was asked about his future during the LMA Awards night on Monday . However, the intention is still to sack the manager. The hierarchy want to be clear of who is available to replace Allardyce before making the final decision to axe the ex-Bolton boss. The decision to relieve Allardyce of his duties could now arrive next week. The east London club have been under immense pressure from disgruntled supporters to sack under-fire Allardyce. The 59-year-old has successfully steered the club to top-flight security after a difficult start to the season. But a growing contingent of supporters have turned on the former Bolton boss, despite the team's improvement since the start of 2014. Allardyce's tactics have become a major bone of contention among Hammers fans, and the anger towards the manager from supporters has not gone unnoticed within the corridors of power at Upton Park. It was rumoured that those dissenting voices had pushed the club into taking the decision to axe Allardyce. Under pressure: West Ham supporters have turned on the manager and are keen for Allardyce to be sacked . Allardyce has remained bullish about his job prospects in recent weeks despite the unrest; and has continued with his plans for next season. The manager led a strategic planning meeting last Thursday, where various issues including player recruitment and retention were discussed. But behind the scenes, plans were being already made for life without the former Newcastle manager. Defeat: West Ham were beaten on the final day of the season by Man City has the home side won the title . Sections of the Upton Park faithful have been vociferous in their condemnation of Allardyce. A survey of 12,392 Hammers fans taken last month saw 77.95 percent vote in favour of Allardyce leaving the East London club this summer. He was booed by home fans after the final whistle of March's clash against Hull despite winning the match 2-1.","Sam Allardyce avoids being sacked during West Ham showdown talks .

"In a world of instant communication, where you can easily find dates online and share intimate pictures in seconds, barely a day goes by without someone being 'caught out' with an illicit image to the wrong person. Just this week we've seen Kelly Brook's (now ex) man David Mcintosh accused of sending inappropriate messages to an ex and Conservative MP Brooks Newmark was forced to resign from his post as Minister for Civil Society after he sent pictures of himself in paisley pyjamas to a reporter posing as a woman on What's App. Is sexting cheating? Kelly Brook dumped fiancé David McIntosh over his alleged texts to ex-girlfriend . It's hardly the first time a celebrity has been involved in such scandal. In 2010, Vernon Kay hit the headlines after he was accused of sending x-rated texts to glamour model Rhian Sugden, but his wife Tess Daly decided to stand by him. In the same year, the comedian Jason Manford stepped down from his presenting role at The One Show when he was caught out exchanging sexy Twitter messages with a female fan - he and his wife have since split. But what are the guidelines on sexting? Is it cheating if you don't make physical contact? The subject has fired up debate with This Morning's Agony Aunt believing that sending suggestive messages to another person while in a relationship should always be avoided. Speaking on the ITV show today, she said: 'Adultery is not necessarily the end of a relationship, neither is sexting. 'Is it a good idea though? No it is not. 'I am on the end of receiving letters, and I get them in droves, it seems to be a compulsion. Brooks Newmark has resigned as Minister for Civil Society after he sent pictures of himself in pyjamas to an undercover reporter . 'Now you can play out your fantasy on the internet, but it's not just a fantasy. 'Partners feel that something that should be intimate has been shared with someone else. 'I remember talking to a man who had been caught in flagrante on the internet and he said to me in injured tones that he was only mucking about - it's this schoolboy and schoolgirl idea that it is only mucking about, but it isn't.' Jason Manford was caught out exchanging sexy Twitter messages with a female fan in 2010 . However, it's easy to see how both women and men can get confused, because while for many sexting is a clear violation of a relationship, for others it is just a bit of harmless fun. Journalist Sally Windsor who was also speaking on today's This Morning episode believes that people shouldn't be punished for a few suggestive messages if their partner finds out. She said: 'I think there is a threshold here that hasn't been crossed, I don't think it is anywhere near as bad. 'He (Brooks Newmark) shouldn't be punished. 'Had he crossed the line and something had gone on, then yes, he should be punished. 'But we shouldn't put digital cheating on a par with actual cheating. It's not ideal, but is it the end of a relationship? No. 'I think everybody does it or has done it at some point. 'He may have done that, taken a step back and realised he had gone too far. 'What about things like emoticons and writing 'xxx', where do we stop if we call this adultery? If we're saying that this is digital cheating.' Finding some middle ground, Sexpert and MailOnline columnist Tracey Cox believes that all couples need to clearly define where their lines in the sand are before a relationship gets serious. That way both parties know if they are doing something wrong. She said: 'Everyone has their own definition of what constitutes cheating - which is why you need to spell out, specifically, what counts as infidelity for you when you're in a monogamous relationship. In 2010, Vernon Kay sent racy texts to glamour model Rhian Sugden while still married to his wife Tess Daly (left) 'I always tell people, ask yourself this 'What would my partner think, if they could see me right now?', doing whatever it is they're doing. 'If their partner wouldn't like it, consider it cheating. 'Even though there's no physical contact, sexting is still sharing intimate, sexual words or images with someone other than your partner. 'So yes, it is cheating, though I think most of us would prefer it to cheating in person - though neither are ideal!'

"Thirty nine of the 40 jockeys who rode in last month's Grand National at Aintree are to face a charge over their conduct at the start. The riders, including 19-time champion AP McCoy plus senior colleagues Richard Johnson, Barry Geraghty and Tom Scudamore, are accused to attempting to line up before requested to do so by the Official starter. The incident under scrutiny also saw starter’s assistant Simon McNeil being knocked over. Controversy: The field line up for the start of the Grand National but 39 of the 40 jockeys have now been charged . What a performance: Pineau De Re proved a winner for the bookies as he defied 25-1 odds . Big-race pilot: Leighton Aspell punches the air after landing his biggest career win . The start of the most watched race in the British calendar once again showed racing in a poor light with the runners having to be re-called after a false start, although this is not part of the enquiry. However, the BHA will not pursue any action against the jockeys for their subsequent ‘mutiny’ when, with many of the Irish riders needing to leave to reach connections home, they refused to co-operate with a reconvened enquiry. Jamie Stier, Director of Raceday Operations and Regulation for BHA, said: ‘Managing the start of the Grand National and dealing with any incidents that occur during this process presents a unique challenge. 'After reviewing all the available evidence we have taken the decision not to pursue any charges relating to the fact that we were unable to complete the Stewards’ enquiry on the day. ‘This is also a reflection of the scale of the challenge in conducting an enquiry in such circumstances. 'Instead, we would like to put in place a protocol, to be developed in conjunction with the jockeys, for managing such situations where a large numbers of riders are involved. Going nowhere: Race officials wave flags to signal a false start at Aintree . Wet, wet, wet: Quito De La Roque (centre) ridden by Brian O'Connell stumbles badly at the Water Jump . ‘Having reviewed all of the available evidence and footage into the incident prior to the start of the Grand National it is the view of BHA that 39 of the 40 riders in the race attempted to line up or take a position before being instructed to do so, which was before the off time of the race. ‘If the Disciplinary Panel finds that this is the case then this would constitute an offence under the Rules of Racing.“It is also BHA’s view that the riders then moved forward towards the start and in the process knocked down the Assistant Starter, who was positioned in front of the field, advising the riders not to line up. This will also be considered by the Disciplinary Panel. ‘This all occurred after riders in the Grand National had been briefed in advance of the race about conduct at the start, which emphasised the obligation under the Rules for the riders to obey the Starter’s instructions. ‘The Disciplinary Panel will now determine whether any of the riders in question are in breach of the Rules of Racing. ‘We acknowledge the length of time taken to reach these conclusions. By working with the jockeys to develop a protocol for dealing with such cases we would expect to avoid a similar scenario in the future.’ Ouch: Long Run and Sam Waley-Cohen crash out but both horse and rider were unhurt . On the run: The Grand National field race past the packed grandstand . In response, Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, said his members would vigorously defend the charges. He added: ‘We are disappointed that the BHA has decided to lay charges against the jockeys in specific relation to the start.  The decision by the BHA not to progress with charges in relation to subsequent events is entirely unsurprising given the procedural failings that followed the running of the Grand National. ‘Having reviewed the footage, read the transcript and listened to the audio recording of the inquiry and being aware of numerous other facts, we believe that the jockeys have strong grounds to contest the charges. ‘However, with so many jockeys charged we have been unable to take formal instruction at this stage and cannot therefore confirm what their collective or individual positions will be in relation to the charges. In the clear: Pineau De Re was five lengths clear of his rivals as he crossed the line . Birds eye view: Pineau De Re leads the field up the run-in in front of the packed stands . ‘It was and remains our belief that the appropriate course of action would have been a forward-looking, collegiate approach to the wider and ongoing issue of big-field jump starts.  We actively encouraged the BHA to embrace this approach and to grip this matter with more urgency than they have shown but to no avail. ‘We believe the decision to lay any charges is an opportunity lost by the BHA.  If the jockeys decide to contest the charges we trust that the BHA will allow it to be dealt with in a transparent manner and ensure the hearing is open to members of the media, even though this will inevitably lead to their officials and procedural failings being placed under the spotlight.” The only jockey who rode in the Grand National not charged is Brendan Powell jnr, who was on board Battle Group. His antics in refusing to line up added to the confusion of the incident.If found guilty the 39 are likely to face a one-day ban.","Thirty nine of the 40 Grand National jockeys have been charged over their conduct .

"Roy Hodgson gave a nod of admiration. He liked this line of enquiry, which had turned the spotlight nicely onto Vauxhall, England’s sponsors and hosts for the World Cup squad announcement. So Roy, is your England team a family saloon or a sports car? 'Very good question,' he chortled. 'I don’t know if I’m clever enough to answer. All I’ll say is this… I’ll allow you to decide if it’s a family saloon or a sports car. I’m happy to drive it.' Nice reponse, it was agreed and the nod of admiration was duly returned.

A titter of approval rippled around the cramped and airless conference room inside the Vauxhall car plant in Luton chosen by the Football Association for this grand revelation. The England boss may be of mature years but he remains of nimble mind, even if it does not always seem that way when he is on the touchline, scratching his head and dithering over which of his many substitutes to deploy. Clearly, he had not been up all night crunching the final names on his 23-man list or worrying that Ashley Cole might be reaching for the air-gun and plotting his revenge. In fact, Hodgson made it seem like he could have announced this squad weeks ago. He was merely waiting for the troublesome Barclays Premier League season to grind to an end before he pulled on his driving gloves, turned the key and set the Sat Nav. It must be in the blood.

And in with the new: Southampton's exciting teenager left back Luke Shaw has won a seat on the plane . The next time Vauxhall appeared in a question, it was not quite such a complimentary context. Aren’t England just a bit too much like Vauxhall, quite reliable but ordinary? Ouch. The room winced. No sweat for Hodgson though. He is a well-read man of words, in his element when the nation hangs on his every word. After threatening to summon the man from Vauxhall to defend his honour, the England boss rolled into a statistical defence on his two years at the helm. 'We don’t lose often,' he said. 'I’ve had three defeats in 25 games, all in friendly matches, when I’ve made a lot of experiments.' Hodgson was in his groove by this point. His 23 names had not caused a stir. After his decision to omit 107-cap Cole in favour of one-cap teenager Luke Shaw had leaked out the night before, the heat was off. He arrived late – not a great advert for Vauxhall or the massive watch on his left wrist for that matter. The past was yours but the future's mine: Michael Carrick is on stand-by but Ross Barkley is in the squad . Confirmation of the 23-man squad and the seven on stand-by released online by the FA had beaten him into the room by a good 15 minutes and it was to be as had been expected. 'It’s a big day,' said Hodgson when he got around to it. He is an Englishman who is genuinely proud to be driving this particular bus, or family saloon, or…. Anyway. He has taken the Swiss to football’s biggest tournament and here he is about to lead England to Brazil. After the cold calculation of Fabio Capello and Sven Goran Eriksson, it is reassuring to know there is a little national pride behind this World Cup caper. England are going to the World Cup with plans to win it, he explained, but if they come home with nothing more than added experience then so be it. They would be all the better for Euro 2016 in France. Hodgson’s team is evolving fast, and it enjoys a spirit of adventure with 11 from Liverpool, Everton and Southampton – three teams who have been committed to fast and exciting football in the last nine months. Simply by selecting Luke Shaw ahead of Cole, Ross Barkley ahead of Michael Carrick and Raheem Sterling at the expense of Ashley Young, this squad feels a little more fresh and exciting. At this stage, only six of those who started against Italy in the Euro 2012 quarter-finals in Kiev are on the plane. Only seven of the 17 who appeared in Hodgson’s first game, a friendly in Norway nearly two years ago, are on the plane. Or lining up for a go in Roy’s sports car.","Roy Hodgson has announced his 23-man England squad for the World Cup .

"A series of emails have exposed how University of North Carolina teachers would fake the grades of student athletes so they could stay at school. More than 3,100 students - nearly half of them athletes - were allowed to receive top grades in classes they never attended and only had to write one paper for. An email exchange between African and Afro-American Studies administrator, Deborah Crowder, and basketball counselor, Jan Boxill, in September 2008 revealed how teachers would  inflate grades. Scroll down for video . An email exchange between the African and Afro-American Studies administrator and women's basketball counselor Jan Boxill (pictured) at the University of North Carolina revealed  how teachers would inflate grades . Ms Crowder said: 'As long as I am here I will try to accommodate as many favors as possible. Did you say a D will do for [basketball player]?' Ms Boxill replies saying: 'Yes, a D will be fine; that's all she needs. I didn't look at the paper but figured it was a recycled one as well, but I couldn't figure from where! Thanks for whatever you can do.' At the time of these emails Boxill was the director of undergraduate studies for the Department of Philosophy, as well as the director of the UNC Parr Center for Ethics. And Crowder was the administrator of UNC's African and Afro-American Studies department. A report released on Wednesday revealed the extent to which academic and athletic staff members routinely ignored university rules in order to ensure the success of UNC student athletes. More than 3,100 University of North Carolina students, nearly half of whom were athletes, received artificially high grades through a 'shadow curriculum' which operated at the school, according to a report . University Chancellor Carol Folt keeps her head down as she prepares to address members of the media about the academic irregularities on October 22 . Here is the email exchange between the administrator for the UNC's African and Afro-American Studies department,  Deborah Crowder, and the women's basketball academic counselor, Jan Boxill, in September 2008: . Crowder: 'As long as I am here I will try to accommodate as many favors as possible. Did you say a D will do for [basketball player]? I'm only asking that because 1. no sources, 2. it has absolutely nothing to do with the assignments for that class and 3. it seems to me to be a recycled paper. She took AFRI in spring of 2007 and that was likely for that class.' Boxill: 'Yes, a D will be fine; that's all she needs. I didn't look at the paper but figured it was a recycled one as well, but I couldn't figure from where! Thanks for whatever you can do.' Led by former high-ranking U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein, the report found more far-reaching academic fraud than previous investigations by the school and the NCAA. Many at the university hoped Wainstein's investigation would bring some closure to the long-running scandal, which is rooted in an NCAA investigation focused on improper benefits within the football program in 2010. Instead, findings of a systemic problem in the former African and Afro-American Studies department could lead to NCAA sanctions and possible dismissal of additional UNC staff. Evidence: Kenneth Wainstein lead the investigation into claims the staff designed classes to keep certain students, like athletes, from flunking out. Pictured above at a news conference announcing the report on Wednesday . 'I think it's very clear that this is an academic, an athletic and a university problem,' chancellor Carol Folt said. The report outlined courses in the former African and Afro-American Studies department that required only a research paper that was often scanned quickly and given an A or B regardless of the quality of work. The school's board of trustees and the panel that oversees the state's university system reviewed Wainstein's findings during a closed-door meeting earlier Wednesday. A half-dozen officials and UNC Athletics Director Bubba Cunningham declined to say whether anyone would lose their job. The NCAA hit the football program in 2012 with scholarship reductions and a postseason ban, though the academic violations focused mainly on a tutor providing improper help to players on papers. The NCAA said it reopened its investigation in June because new information was available. Wainstein's staff has briefed NCAA investigators at least three times, plans another briefing on the final report and has 'enjoyed a strong cooperative relationship,' according to the report. The report outlined how the fraud ran unchecked for so long, as well as how faculty and administration officials missed or looked past red flags such as unusually high numbers of independent study course enrollments. It said athletics staffers steered athletes to classes that also became popular with fraternities and other everyday students looking for an easy grade. 'By the mid-2000s, these classes had become a primary — if not the primary — way that struggling athletes kept themselves from having eligibility problems,' the report said. UNC President Tom Ross shares a private conversation with Cancellor Folt at a meeting on the investigation Wednesday . The school hired Wainstein in February. Unlike previous inquiries by former Gov. Jim Martin and the school, Wainstein had the cooperation of former department chairman Julius Nyang'oro and retired office administrator Deborah Crowder — the two people blamed for the irregularities. Nyang'oro was indicted in December on a felony fraud charge, though it was dropped after he agreed to cooperate with Wainstein's probe. Crowder was never charged. It was Crowder who started the paper classes as a way to help struggling students with 'watered-down requirements' not long after Nyang'oro became chairman of the curriculum in 1992, according to the report. Though not a faculty member, she managed the courses by registering students, assigning them topics and then handing out high grades regardless of the work. By 1999, in an apparent effort to work around the number of independent studies students could take, Crowder began offering lecture classes that didn't meet and were instead paper classes. After her retirement in 2009, Nyang'oro graded papers 'with an eye to boosting' a student's grade-point average, even asking Crowder's successor to look up GPAs before he'd issue a grade for a course, according to the report. Nyang'oro stepped down in 2011 as chairman after accusations of undetected plagiarism surfaced against a former football player. In all, athletes made up about 47 percent of the enrollments in the 188 lecture-classified paper classes. Of that group, 51 percent were football players. Wainstein's staff reviewed records dating to the 1980s and interviewed 126 people, including men's basketball coach Roy Williams, who said he trusted the school 'to put on legitimate classes,' according to the report. Former basketball player Rashad McCants, who told ESPN in June that tutors wrote research papers for him and that Williams was aware that of no-show classes, didn't respond to numerous requests for interviews, according to the report.","Around 3,100 students received fake grades at University of North Carolina .

"An investigation has been launched after two patients died just days after a hospital's water supply was deemed unsafe. Police are investigating the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham after its water was found to contain 16 times the safe levels of chlorine. Two patients died after receiving dialysis treatment from machines which had used the contaminated water, and the Coroner's office is investigating whether it could have played a role in their deaths. The Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham is the second largest hospital in the country and cost £545 million to build. An investigation has been launched after two patients died just days after the water supply at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham was deemed unsafe . It's a state of the art hospital - the second largest in the country – with 30 operating theatres. But since August 4 there have been three occasions when levels of chlorine in the water system have risen to unsafe levels. Staff and patients were instead given bottled water and warned not to drink from taps. On August 7, an email sent to staff warned the water supply was contaminated. It said: 'Estates have been testing chlorination equipment at the Trust and have corrected the fault that caused higher than acceptable levels of chlorine to enter the drinking water. 'Water across all areas of the Trust has been tested, and it is safe to drink.' On the August 11 and 12, two patients in critical care died. The hospital said the deaths were referred to the Coroner's office because of the 'possibility of a connection' with 'the chlorine occurrence'. The day after the second death, high chlorine levels were detected in water in the radiotherapy department. Two further emails were sent asking nursing staff in one part of the hospital to 'flush all toilets, macerators... and all taps both hot and cold... for at least five minutes each time'. This needed to be done 'each day in the morning and late afternoon, until further notice'. The Coroner's office informed the police, who launched an investigation into the deaths. A spokeswoman for University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust confirmed to MailOnline that an internal investigation had been launched as soon as problems with the water supply came to light . The Coroner's office informed the police, who launched an investigation into the deaths. In a statement, West Midlands Police said that investigations are ongoing. A spokeswoman for University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust confirmed to MailOnline that an internal investigation had been launched as soon as problems with the water supply came to light. She said: 'A review of all chlorine systems has been completed and the implementation of any necessary works is being carried out. 'We have enforced additional safety measures which include 30-minute monitoring, 24 hours a day, with four-hourly reporting back to the trust on chlorine levels across the hospital. 'There are twice weekly meetings between the trust and contractors.' They added 'no patients or staff were adversely affected'. Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham was funded by the controversial Private Finance Initiative (PFI) introduced by the last Labour government. This was a way of drumming up funds for projects like schools and hospitals where private companies were asked to complete and manage public projects. The hospital, which has 6,500 staff and 1,200 beds is run by private firm Balfour Beatty. Officials have voiced concerns that companies managing public services managed under PFI schemes are not incentivised to report problems as it would cost them money.","Police investigating two deaths at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham .

"The door to Aladdin’s Cave may just have opened a crack for Tyson Fury. To find out for sure he must batter Dereck Chisora off his hinges this July, having already pronounced himself willing to fight for a world heavyweight championship soon after that. Opportunity knocked when Bermane Stiverne flattened Chris Arreola in Los Angeles on Saturday night to win the WBC title. Big shot? Tyson Fury (left) could fight for a world title if he beats Dereck Chisora (right) in July . New champion: Bermane Stiverne celebrates after beating Chris Arreola to win the WBC heavyweight title . Since Stiverne is promoted by none other than Don King all manner of possibilities presented themselves at the knock-out moment, including that of a voluntary defence against Fury. The assumption that Saturday night’s winner would automatically meet his mandatory challenger, KO phenomenon Deontay Wilder, in his next fight were brushed aside by King. He of the electrified hair and electrifying rhetoric sees money to be made for Stiverne as well as rejuvenation of his own image while he is back in control of the most cherished of all the heavyweight belts. ‘The official challenger does not automatically get the next fight,’ pronounced King. ‘Under the rules we are entitled to a voluntary match after winning the title.’ Cue T. Fury. The giant traveller his new boxing gym at The Platinum Community Centre in Bolton on Tuesday, in partnership with his uncle and trainer Peter Fury and his younger but only slightly smaller fighting cousin Hughie. Fury, he who would become the first member of the travelling community to wear a heavyweight crown, is hoping that a second victory over Chisora, in this ill-tempered re-match, will deliver his shot against the holder of all the other alpha-belts, Wladimir Klitschko. However, the younger of the Ukrainian brothers declares himself ‘super interested’ in restoring to the family Klitschko the WBC title his sibling Vitali vacated when he committed himself full-time to the political struggle in their homeland. That would make Wladimir the first in heavyweight history to wear all the WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO, IBO and Ring Magazine belts. To strengthen his argument he has also expressed ‘a powerful desire’ to box in America for the first time in six years. Wladimir has also been instructed by the IBF, who have been waiting their turn, to honour their mandatory challenger, Bulgaria’s Kubrat Palev. Hitting the target: Stiverne stopped Arreola in the sixth round of their fight in Los Angeles last weekend . Game over: Stiverne beat Arreola for the second time to become the heavyweight champion of the world . Calling it a day: Referee Jack Reiss steps in to stop the fight between Stiverne and Arreola . To complicate the picture further, not only Wladimir but also Vitali have written to the WBC requesting a fight with Stiverne. Since Vitali is that organisation’s champion emeritus they are duty bound to consider his claim, which suggests he may be cutting back his involvement in troubled Kiev after withdrawing his candidacy for the presidency of Ukraine in forthcoming elections. King, though, is unlikely to be rushed in any of those directions. The architect of Muhammad Ali’s Rumble in the Jungle with George Foreman and Thrilla’ in Manilla against Joe Frazier – among many historic fights – is relishing his return to the spotlight. He will also want to maximise earnings. Fury could bring the prospect of a big-money fight in England, or offer himself up as a box-office opponent for Stiverne in Canada, where Haitii’s first-ever heavyweight champion is now based, or the US. Back in the big time: Don King (right) wants to maximise his earnings from his new champion Stiverne . Up close and personal: Fury and Chisora came face to face at the weekend when promoting their fight . Calm down: Fury will be looking for his second win over Chisora having outpointed him three years ago . The American people were hoping that Arreola would bring the world heavyweight title home from Eastern Europe for the first time in almost a decade. Instead, they are basking in a little reflected glory as Stiverne restores at least one of the belts to their continent. Wilder, who has blown away all his 31 professional opponents inside four rounds, is their best bet for reclaiming what they long-regarded as the symbol of American machismo. But King may well see the flamboyant, outspoken Fury as not only a marketable opponent but also a softer option than either the Bronze Bomber or the Klitschko brothers. Even so, whoever takes on Stiverne next has been warned by Arreola, who was knocked down twice on his way to sixth round defeat and then said of this 35-year-old late developer: ‘He hits like a bulldozer.’ Deontay Wilder, meanwhile, has been keeping his hand in by beating up an internet troll who called him the N-word on twitter and threatened to tape up his daughter’s mouth. The Bronze Bomber, so-called after his Olympic medal of that colour, protected himself against prosecution for using his fists against a member of the public  by obliging a rather unpleasant individual by the name of Charlie Zelenoff to sign a waiver and a contract  if he wanted to fight him. That done, the irregular sparring session then took place in the Hollywood Gym in Los Angeles late at night on the eve of the Stiverne-Arreola world heavyweight  title fight. Zelenoff, who once provoked Floyd Mayweather’s trainer-father into a similar event, was duly knocked down three times – even though the 6ft 7in Wilder said: ‘I held back despite my original plan being to hurt this dude real bad. He threatened to murder me and called me the N-word. ‘But what really got to me was when he said he was going to duck-tape my daughter’s mouth. Talk like that about my kids and that’s when you see the other side of the humble, funny Deontay Wilder. The part that will come and get you.’ That message comes with a health warning to Messrs Klitschko, Stiverne, Fury and anyone else fancying their chances:  Don’t sledge Mr Wilder. Man on a mission: Deontay Wilder (left) has knocked out every one of his 31 professional opponents . Closing in: Wilder is the mandatory challenger to Stiverne and wants his shot at the WBC world champion . Mikkel Kessler’s unexpected comeback raises a multitude of enticing possibilities, starting with Froch-Kessler III if Carl the Nottingham Cobra wins his re-match with George Groves, or a fight with Saint George if not. Kessler stands at one win apiece with Froch, who outpointed the Viking Warrior a thriller at London’s O2 arena a year ago. At 35, he is a five-time super-middleweight champion and his only other defeats came against Joe Calzaghe and Andre Ward. Kessler, as he became a father, seemed about to call time on his 16-year career but says now: ‘I don’t want to go out a loser, after that second fight with Carl. So Froch again? Why not?’ He is also eyeing a rematch with Ward and a world-title challenge to Gennady Golovkin and adds: ‘Froch, Groves, Ward, Golovkin... whoever it is I’ll be ready in October.’ Not done yet: Mikkel Kessler (left) has announced his intention to carry on boxing . Last time out: Kessler has not fought since losing his rematch to Carl Froch last May . So, we have Bernard Hopkins a world champion at 49, Wladimir Klitschko at 38 vowing to reign as heavyweight champion for another ten years, Floyd Mayweather, Froch and Kessler still going strong in their mid-30s…..to name but a few. Whoever was it who said they never come back? RIP Jimmy Ellis. The former world heavyweight champion who died last week, aged 74, was laid to rest this very Monday in Louisville, the home-town of himself and his peer Muhammad Ali, who said: ‘In the world of heavyweights Jimmy was one of the best. He had exceptional hand speed and a strong chin but his greatest qualities were his gentle manner and the compassion in his heart. I had a kinship with Jimmy. We were of the same cloth.’ Ali stopped Ellis in the 12th of 15 rounds in their only fight but says of him: ‘Great competitors who happen to be great friends are rare. Jimmy was that to me and I will miss him.’ Back in the day: Muhammad Ali (right) stopped Jimmy Ellis in the 12th round of their heavyweight clash . Remembered: Ellis, who gave Ali  a tough fight, passed away aged 74 after a battle with dementia . As The Greatest misses so many of the great men with whom he shared a ring but who, incredibly while he is engaged in his long battle with Parkinson’s, he has survived. Men like Joe Frazier, Henry Cooper, Sonny Liston, Ken Norton, Floyd Patterson, Archie Moore, Cleveland Williams, Ron Lyle, Trevor Berbick. All gone... while the Miracle of Muhammad lives on. One of the best: Ali praised Ellis, saying he had excellent hand speed as well as a strong chin . Take that: Joe Frazier connects to the body of Jimmy Ellis who misses with a right during their fight in 1970 .","Bermane Stiverne beat Chris Arreola to win the WBC heavyweight title .

"Legend has it that at the end of every rainbow sits a leprechaun, hammering on a shoe, who will reveal the whereabouts of a crock of gold. But if the prospect of that one pot  isn't quite enough, sometimes Mother Nature offers the chance to pursue two - or even four - as it did in West Sussex today. Residents in Worthing were treated to a stunning sight early this morning as an all-but-complete double rainbow fanned across the sky, providing a perfect frame for the seaside town. Despite heavy rain and dark shadows looming across the sky, the grey ribbons of clouds momentarily parted to allow the semi-circle rainbow to spread across the horizon, revealing both ends of the colourful phenomenon. This was the stunning sight which spread across the sky in Worthing, West Sussex, today, when both ends of a spectacular double rainbow were revealed . Is it usually expected that someone must be at the height of a mountaintop to see a half-circle rainbow, due to the angle and height that the sun is required to be at. Sometimes, the full circle can be seen, perhaps during an activity such as sky-dicing. Due to the mixture of rain and sunshine in the past few days, there have been an array of incredible rainbows pictured around the UK. There was a spectacular sight over Fistral Beach in Newquay yesterday, as a double rainbow appeared to rise out of the sea and arch over the seaside town. And an almost-complete rainbow appeared over  Aberystwyth, west Wales, yesterday, as wet and windy descended on the area. Rainbows are caused when sunlight refracts as it enters a raindrop, splitting it into different wavelengths which are seen by the eye as an arc-shaped spectrum of different colors. Double rainbows occur when the light is reflected as it leaves a raindrop, producing a second, fainter, rainbow nearby, only with the bands of colour reversed. The area between the two rainbows is known as 'Alexander's Band', named after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described its occurrence in 200 AD. The rainbow has a place in the mythologies of many cultures. In Greco-Roman mythology it was considered to be a path made by a messenger between Earth and Heaven. For the Chinese, the rainbow was a slit in the sky sealed by the goddess Nüwa using stones of five different colours. For Australian aborigines the rainbow serpent is the creator and of course for Christians, the rainbow is a pledge from God not to destroy the world with floods. A spectacular rainbow appeared to rise from the sea in Newquay, Cornwall yesterday, arching its way over the seaside town . Another rainbow was seen over Aberystwyth, west Wales, yesterday, as wet and windy weather returned to the town . The rainbows came as Britain braces itself for wet and cold weather over the new few days, with forecasters predicting clear skies but freezing temperatures through to Bonfire Night. Just five days after basking in the warmest Halloween on record, Britain is braced for temperatures to dip below freezing on Bonfire Night. The mercury hit 23.6C (74.5F) in London and Kent on October 31, but could fall as low as -7C (19.4F) in northern Scotland tomorrow. But forecasters said tomorrow’s weather is quite normal for November, and it will only seem so cold to Britons because of the balmy autumn. Temperatures in urban areas could fall to about 0C (32F) on November 5, but dip below freezing to -3C (26.6F) in rural areas, the Met Office said. It's cold... and it's getting colder: Early morning fog and frost today in Temple Newsham Park in Leeds, West Yorkshire . England's green and pleasant land: A man walks his dog in front of misty morning view overlooking Leeds city centre, as sunshine made way for heavy showers and cold temperatures . Hottest Halloween on record: Just five days ago, on October 31, this couple were relaxing in the sunshine at London's Green Park - but temperatures are set to drop for Bonfire Night . The UK low is likely to be close to the -7.8C (18F) seen at the summit of the Cairn Gorm mountain in the Scottish Highlands on Bonfire Night last year. The previous two years saw Bonfire Night lows of -5.3C (22.5F) at Shap, Cumbria, in 2012, and -2.9C (26.8F) at Cromdale in the Highlands in 2011. Last Friday the UK record for the warmest Halloween was smashed, as Kew Gardens in west London and Gravesend in Kent both hit 23.6C (74.5F). This beat the previous high of 20C (68F) set at Dartford in Kent in 1968. Conditions were warmer than those in Rome, Barcelona and San Francisco. So far, 2014 is the warmest year on record, following consistently mild temperatures which have continued into autumn, according to MeteoGroup.","A spectacular almost-complete double rainbow provided the perfect frame for Worthing, West Sussex, earlier today .

"Phil Neville has revealed how the Old Trafford lap of honour after Tuesday’s 3-1 win over Hull City was the emptiest moment of his career. Neville could not hide his pain as he spoke about the traumas of a season that reduced England’s most successful club to an object of fun. ‘It’s been a real difficult season,’ said Neville. ‘A club that should be challenging for league titles to  finish seventh is obviously not good enough. And to see a man who, for the last eight years, has put so much confidence in me — to see him lose his job was probably one of the toughest days I’ve had in football. Difficult: Phil Neville described the lap of honour after beating Hull as the emptiest moment of his career . Gone: Neville was heavily involved in the disastrous campaign under ex-United boss David Moyes . ‘Walking around the pitch after the Hull game was probably the emptiest I’ve ever felt on a football field. I took the job expecting to be walking around the last home game of the season either challenging for a league title or parading a league title. That’s what this club demands and we’ve got to make sure next season we are doing that.’ It has been the fall of Moyes that has particularly stung Neville. ‘He has taken the majority of criticism from outside the club, but if you speak to anyone inside then we’ve all got to take collective responsibility — from players, the staff, the coaching staff, everybody,’ said Neville. ‘It was really disappointing when David lost his job because I class him as a friend. As a player, I’ve never experienced anything like that with a manager — maybe once with Kevin Keegan at England, when he lost his job. ‘The thing we’ve all collectively failed on is definitely that we have lost eight games (in all competitions) at Old Trafford this season. That is not acceptable. Not good enough: Neville, who has been helping interim manager Ryan Giggs, blasted United 'unacceptable' It's a new dawn: James Wilson netted twice for United as they beat Hull City at Old Trafford on Tuesday night . ‘If we played all our games away, then we’d be champions. But we’ve lost games at Old Trafford against teams that we should be beating. That has been the biggest single failing.’ Neville’s future, and that of the rest of the Class of ’92 — Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes — is uncertain pending Van Gaal’s arrival after Sunday’s final game of the season against Southampton but Neville is keen to stay on. ‘I don’t know what’s around the corner for me in terms of my own personal job,’ said Neville. ‘But the season as a whole has just not been good enough. We’ve got to make sure next season, whoever is in charge and whoever is coaching, that we get back challenging for league titles. ‘I want to be part of United’s future, I’m a Manchester United person, I love the club. ‘Results aside, it’s been an incredible learning experience at a club that I love. I want to be here for the rest of my life, being involved with United. So that’s my hope.’","Manchester United coach Phil Neville felt deflated after lap of honour .

"Famously dubbed 'showbusiness for ugly people', the world of politics hasn't always delivered when it comes to looking good. But one MP who certainly does get pulses pounding is Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikström, 29, who has been inundated with romantic messages after a photo posted by a Turkish fan went viral. Nicknamed 'the handsome minister' by his growing legion of fans, Wikström, a Social Democrat who holds the position of Public Health Minister, says he is 'honoured' by all the attention. Popular: Swedish public health minister Gabriel Wikström, 29, has been bombarded with lovelorn messages . Speaking to English language Swedish daily newspaper, The Local, he said: 'I can’t feel anything but honoured and glad. And a little bit surprised, I must admit.' Wikström's route to social media stardom began last Sunday, when a Turkish fan posted a photo with a caption that read: 'The Handsome Minister'. Within days, the photo had gone viral and the politician found himself being bombarded with messages from his growing number of Turkish fans, as well as others from across Europe. Clearly determined to capitalise on his growing fame, Wikström added: 'Hopefully I can be a role model and inspire young people in Turkey to get involved in politics.' Wikström, who is currently attending a health summit in the Danish capital Copenhagen, isn't the only Scandinavian politician to win plaudits for his looks. Looking good: Mr Wikström says he is honoured but 'a little bit surprised' by the response to the photo . Bombarded: Mr Wikström's Twitter account has been inundated with lustful messages in recent days . 'The Handsome Minister': Mr Wikström's route to social media stardom began when a fan posted a photo . Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 47, is famous for her glamorous blonde looks, while her 39-year-old agriculture minister, Dan Jørgensen, has also proved a hit with the ladies. Arguably the most popular of all though, other than Wikström himself, is 35-year-old Hans Linde of Sweden's Left Party, who is as famous for his good looks as he is for his politics. And while Denmark and Sweden have plenty of good-looking ministers to choose from, the UK has more than one of its own. Although Sexy MP, a website dedicated to Parliament's great and good-looking, has now shut down, it regularly put Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, 39, at the top of its looks list while running. MPs snapping at Mr Goldsmith's heels include Labour's shadow education and business secretaries, Tristram Hunt, 40, and Chuka Umunna, 36, . Other politicians to set pulses racing, both past and present, include Barack Obama, French prime minister Manuel Valls and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. Handsome though Gabriel Wikström undoubtedly is, he's by no means the only politician to set pulses racing. From the UK's dapper environmentalist Zac Goldsmith to suave Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto, feast your eyes on the political hotshots winning plaudits for their looks as well as their policies.

"Sam Allardyce questioned West Ham’s ambition as he reacted to Sportsmail’s revelations that he is about to be sacked. Allardyce is set to go after the club’s final Premier League clash against Manchester City, but he hit back by querying whether West Ham were still the club to match his ambition as a manager. The 59-year-old said: ‘I have more ambition than West Ham ever have. I have more ambition than them, or the same ambition as them. VIDEO Scroll down for Allardyce: No indication that my position was under threat . Pointing it out: Sam Allardyce says he has more ambition that West Ham ever have . ‘I want to get into Europe.

I . have seen it all before and you use your experience to try to achieve . that ambition. Can West Ham match my ambition? Eventually, yes. It is . whether everyone is patient enough to wait to get there. That is the . problem today: a lack of patience across the board.’ Allardyce . said he had spoken to joint owner David Sullivan on Thursday about . arranging a meeting to discuss next season’s plans and was given ‘no . indication his position was under threat’. He . defended his record in keeping the club in the top flight for a second . consecutive season and said West Ham played ‘terrific football’. But, . when asked whether he was still the man to lead the Hammers into their . new home at the Olympic Stadium, Allardyce admitted the realistic answer . was ‘no’. Head in hands: Allardyce is on the verge of being sacked by West Ham at the end of the season . He said: ‘As the average life of a manager is 13 months you would have to say “no”, being realistic. ‘We’ve . had more (managerial) changes in the Premier League than ever before . and one never knows when it’s going to happen to you. You have to do the . best with the resources you’ve got. This club was in the Championship . when I came here and I have delivered what I have been asked to deliver.

"Thank goodness it’s Friday? Not if your name is Rory McIlroy. It all went wrong for the Northern Irishman at the Masters in the second round and here was another Friday horror show over the front nine at the Players Championship. After 12 holes on Thursday the 25-year-old was five under par and lying joint second. After seven holes of his second round he was four over and tied 119th. You’d write it off as one of those things except it happens all too often with McIlroy when the shoulders slump and one calamity is duly followed by another. It’s certainly something he needs to start addressing. Rough: It all went wrong for Rory McIlroy during the second round at Sawgrass . At least the real McIlroy showed up . over the back nine. He gave himself a good talking-to during the long . walk from the ninth green to the 10th tee. Three birdies meant he came . to the 18th needing one more to make the halfway cut on the limit. Typical Rory. When he really needs to make a putt he does so, and he did . so again here, with a 20-footer. But . it still means he will start on Saturday morning 12 shots off the lead . held by German Martin Kaymer, who added a 69 to his stunning opening . score of 63. ’I don’t know . what’s happening on Fridays,’ said McIlroy. ‘It’s like I don’t want to . play on that day. But I’m proud of the way I battled back. It’s not . where I want to be but at least I am around for the weekend.’ A . good analogy would be with the football team who are 4-0 down at . half-time and ‘win’ the second half 2-0. McIlroy knows better than . anyone you simply can’t play zombie golf for five holes at this level . and hope to win trophies. When . Kaymer finished his work at lunchtime it appeared for all the world he . would lead by a street. Step forward young American Jordan Spieth, who . hunted him down so artfully in the more difficult afternoon conditions . he will start the third round just one shot adrift. Spieth, who went so . close to winning the Masters on his debut, is also playing in this . tournament for the first time and is the only player in the field who . has not had a bogey. The 20-year-old is an amazing talent, isn’t he? Precarious: Rory McIlroy chips on the 17th green during the second round of the Players Championship . Lee . Westwood shot 71 that was the least he deserved for some quality play . and will start the weekend six behind in tied fourth place, as will US . Open Champion Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia, who also broke par by a . stroke. Graeme McDowell is one shot further back. Kaymer . has fallen to 61st in the world and hasn’t won a full field event since . holing the winning putt at the 2012 Ryder Cup at Medinah. Here he has . returned to form in spectacular style, with 14 birdies in 36 holes. A . true measure of his performance is the next best total from his half of . the draw was posted by American veteran Jim Furyk, who is six behind, . with US-based Londoner Brian Davis a further shot adrift. Tidy: Martin Kaymer hits from a sand trap on the 14th fairway during the second round at Sawgrass . In contention: Lee Westwood chips onto the 14th green during the second round and is in the top six . It’s . not as if Kaymer’s half was full of journeymen either. All four of the . players in with the chance to become world No 1 were in action alongside . Kaymer and all four looked pedestrian by comparison. Best placed is . Henrik Stenson, who needs to finish in the top six and is presently tied . 24th. Australian Adam Scott . did at least show the pride of a world No 1 hopeful to bounce back from . his calamitous opening round of 77 with a score of 67 that left him on . the same mark as McIlroy. He then revealed his status as one of the . sporting world’s most eligible bachelors was at an end, since he got . married in secret in the week after the Masters. England’s . Luke Donald shot 69 and Welshman Jamie Donaldson a 67 to stand on three . under, while the most high profile player to miss the halfway cut was . Open Champion Phil Mickelson, who missed out by one.

"All identical twins have uncanny similarities. However, sisters Skye Turner and Tammin Butt would never have anticipated the striking parallels they have experienced as first-time mothers. The 31-year-old Queensland sisters both gave birth to boys 14 weeks early - when both babies stopped growing in the womb at exactly 22 weeks and three days - after the siblings developed early onset pre-eclampsia. But the string of coincidences don't stop there. The twins were also born premature, and their mother almost died after giving birth, as she suffered from the same condition - which is not known to be genetic. Skye with Taylan (left) and Tammin with Jye (right) -  the identical twins had both babies at 26 weeks . Skye (left) and Tammin (right) both suffered from early onset pre-eclampsia and had their boys 14 weeks early . The close-knit sisters had their baby boys two months apart . The women, who had their babies just two months apart, can't quite believe the same emotional ride they have both been on. Although the twins are identical, and have a very strong bond, they still live independent lives. 'We are not like those weird twins you see on TV who speak at the same time as each other - we are very similar but also quite different as well,' Tammin told Daily Mail Australia. Tammin and her partner Blake Scoringe, from Brisbane, announced they were having a baby late last year - and two months later Skye and Mick Turner, from Bli Bli, shared the same exciting news. Tammin was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia at just 25 weeks pregnant when her baby had stopped growing few weeks earlier, then a couple of days later on March 28, her son Jye was born weighing a tiny 480 grams. Just six weeks after that, Skye was diagnosed with the same condition when her baby also stopped growing and Taylan was delivered a few weeks later on May 30 - weighing just 500 grams. The close-knit sisters admit that this is one journey they wished they had not shared together. Tammin described the numerous similarities as a weird coincidence: 'It's like we are clones.' 'When I told Skye to get tested after I had been diagnosed the doctors thought she was being silly and a bit over-the-top,' she said. 'They were quite surprised when they had to call her in the next day.' The twins were also born premature and their mother almost died after giving birth as she suffered from the same condition - which is not known to be genetic . Jye (left) is now six and a half months old and Taylan (right) is four and a half months old . Tammin said she felt bad for her sister who knew that she was about to endure including steroid and magnesium injections and blood pressure medication. But it was the unknown of whether their babies would survive the birth and the ongoing roller coaster during their long stints in intensive care that has been the hardest for the new mothers. 'The times when they get sick and things look bleak is particularly tough, ' she said. 'It's really hard to watch them in pain.' However, it's not all bad news as the babies are very cognitive and alert, Tammin says. 'It's nice to have light at the end of the tunnel, she said. Both born at 26 weeks, Jye spent almost 100 days in intensive care while his younger cousin Taylan is four-and-a-half months old and remains in intensive care. Finally going home in July, Kye is now six-and-a-half months old and weighs almost 5kg, but is still on oxygen due to complications of the premature birth. Taylan, who weighed in at 4.3kg on Tuesday, will hopefully be home for Christmas, but both babies will continue to need to be assisted with oxygen for an indefinite period of time until their lungs are properly formed. Jye (left) is now at home on oxygen and Taylan (right) hopes to be home for Christmas . Although the identical twins have a close bond -  they still live independent lives . The boys are little troopers enduring one obstacle after another including endless blood transfusions, spinal taps of the brain - not to mention morphine for the constant pain - and worst of all being resuscitated. 'You just have to believe in your little baby and not get caught up in everything that is wrong with them,' Tammin said. 'You have to back your baby and believe they are going to make it.' Tammin is a travel agent and Skye works as an insurance rep but it will be quite some time before they can resume their jobs with such sick babies. Both couples are struggling financially after constant ongoing medical costs - especially Skye who travels everyday from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane to be with her son. 'Skye is in hospital every day and we still spend more time in hospital than at home with ongoing problems from Jye being born so young,' Tammin said. 'It's disappointing to watch your savings go - that's another scary part of this.' 'We are looking down the barrel of not being able to do anything because we are running out of money but I try not to think about it.' If you want to give Tammin and Skye a helping hand donate here . The sisters relationship has strengthened even more so since their identical journeys .

"'Deeply offensive': Olly Grender, who incredibly claimed being in the House of Lords is 'unaffordable' to normal people because peers only get £300 a day . Serving in the House of Lords is ‘unaffordable’ for normal people because peers only get a tax-free allowance of £300 a day, a senior Liberal Democrat said last night. Olly Grender, deputy chairman of Nick Clegg’s General Election team, said the lavish expenses paid to peers were too low to allow people to give up their jobs. Critics last night said her comments would be ‘deeply offensive’ to millions of people earning far less. But Baroness Grender, who was handed a peerage by Mr Clegg last year, complained that the irregular nature of payments from the House of Lords meant it was difficult to even get a mortgage. Asked about the composition of the House of Lords, she told The House magazine: ‘What you don’t get is a hairdresser, what you don’t get is a bus driver. And why don’t you get those people? Because it’s unaffordable for most people to do this kind of thing unless you are relying on a partner. ‘A salary in the Lords alone, a bank won’t accept it as payment for a mortgage. It varies dramatically because you clock on when you sit - because it’s an allowance, rather than a salary.’ Members of the House of Lords are eligible for a tax-free allowance of £300 a day simply by turning up and clocking in. They are not required to speak in debates or vote, and do not have to stay all day. Peers can claim a lower rate of £150 even if they are doing other paid work outside the Lords on the same day. Official figures show that Lady Grender, a former PR executive and media pundit, attended the Lords on 81 days in her first six months and claimed £20,850 in attendance allowances in that time. The allowances are equal to a pre-tax annual salary of just under £60,000 a year – more than two-and-a-half times the average annual salary for a full-time job in the UK. By comparison, the Office for National Statistics’ 2012 salary survey found that the average hairdresser earns just over £10,000 a year, while the average bus driver earns less than £23,000. Labour MP John Mann said Lady Grender’s comments showed she was ‘completely out of touch’. Mr Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, in Nottinghamshire, said: ‘She is talking total, absolute nonsense. I could find plenty of hairdressers round here who would happily turn up to the House of Lords for £300 a day – they would be queuing up to do it. ‘It just shows she is part of an out-of-touch Westminster elite – many people will find her comments deeply offensive.’ Nice little earner: Members of the House of Lords are eligible for a tax-free allowance of £300 a day simply by turning up and clocking in. They are not required to speak in debates or vote, and do not have to stay all day . Andy Silvester, campaign manager for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘A hairdresser or a bus driver would be delighted by a tax-free cheque of £300 a day. 'The House of Lords doesn't sit full-time and there are plenty of peers who do additional jobs to top up their income. 'It's comments like these that only serve to widen the perceived divide between Westminster and ordinary taxpayers.’ The expenses system in the Lords has been mired in controversy. Earlier this year the former Tory peer Lord Hanningfield was suspended from the Lords after he was caught on camera ‘clocking in’ for his £300 allowance and then leaving immediately for his home in Essex. Dangerous place: Lady Grender also revealed she has been the victim of sexual harassment at Westminster . Meanwhile, Lady Grender also became the latest Lib Dem woman to reveal she has been the victim of sexual harassment at Westminster. Asked if she had suffered unwanted sexual advances, she said: ‘Yes, from an MP, who’s now dead. When I first started working in Parliament in my early 20s, I would say that I had no idea I could complain that I was being sexually harassed by somebody who was a Member of Parliament. It just didn’t even occur to me. And I’m really pleased it now occurs to people.’ Lady Grender said the scandal caused by allegations of sexual harassment against former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard had cast a ‘dark cloud’ over the party. She added: ‘I think it’s been damaging and divisive in the party, but I think we are where we are and we all need to just move on.’","Critics last night called Baroness Olly Grender's comments 'deeply offensive'

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game, including the move which led to Nathan Baker's own goal . ‘You're getting sacked in the morning,’ sang the Villa fans after Emmanuel Adebayor had scored Tottenham’s third goal from the penalty spot. ‘That’s a bit harsh,’ quipped Spurs boss Tim Sherwood. ‘We’re 3-0 up.’ The chant was aimed at Villa manager Paul Lambert, but it could have applied to either of the men standing in the dug outs at White Hart Lane. Sherwood is certainly on borrowed time, with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy neglecting to mention his manager by name - let alone thank him - in his end-of-season address. The 45-year-old was seemingly intent on enjoying his final game in charge, celebrating Paulinho’s opening goal with self-conscious aplomb and then giving fan Danny Grimsdale his gilet and inviting him to sit on the bench in the 84th minute. Happy ending: Tottenham booked a place in Europe next season with a comfy win against Aston Villa . Comfortable: Tim Sherwood's future as Tottenham boss is in doubt but he finished the season in style . Close to the edge: After seeing his side well beaten again, Villa boss Paul Lambert could also be axed . Spurs (4-4-2): . Lloris 6.5, Naughton 6, Dawson (c) 6, Chiriches 6, Rose 6; Sigurdsson 6 .

Few others possessed Sherwood’s . enthusiasm, however, as Tottenham cruised to victory through a Paulinho . strike, a Nathan Baker own goal and then Adebayor’s penalty after a . Gabby Agbonlahor handball. But . Sherwood had the last laugh too, guiding Spurs to sixth place and . ensuring his successor will have to oversee Europa League football next . season; an increasingly poisoned chalice for any club hoping to break . into the Premier League’s top four. He . then proceeded to tell Levy to sack him or back him by extending the . remaining year of his contract, and claimed it was ‘ridiculous’ Tottenham could have dreamt about finishing in the top four, let alone . winning the title, this season. It was quite the farewell speech, all . things considered. ‘There . were no tears shed out there,’ added Sherwood. ‘This club means a lot to . me but if I’m not to continue here as a manager I’ll be somewhere else. ‘It . will be interesting to see what I’ve been judged on. If I’m to leave it . can’t be on results. If I had started the season we would have been in . the Champions League.’ Lambert’s . position is also far from secure after a 15th-placed finish. Villa . owner Randy Lerner is expected to announce plans to sell the club on Monday and the fans’ discontent with their manager was obvious. ‘We . want our Villa back,’ they sang, clad in an array of fancy dress . including a post box, traffic cones and Zippy and George from Rainbow. Bungle must have been on the pitch, so hopeless were their team, in the . first half in particular. ‘I’m every bit as disappointed as they are,’ said Lambert. ‘It’s not nice to hear, but I understand everybody’s frustration. ‘The . main thing for me is Aston Villa is a Premier League club. We’ve got . Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City to play next season. ‘I intend to be (at the club’s awards dinner on Tuesday). I don’t want to pay £3 for a bow tie and not turn up.’ Samba star: Paulinho celebrated his call-up to the Brazil World Cup squad with the opening goal . Fans' favourite: The Brazilian then ran to the Spurs faithful to enjoy the moment . No luck: Nathan Baker scored an own goal to put Tottenham two goals in front against Aston Villa . Saltue: Emmanuel Adebayor scored Tottenham's third goal from the penalty spot . Spot on: Adebayor scored from the spot after Gabriel Agbonlahor handled Sandro's shot . Kyle Walker was still not fit enough even to make the Tottenham bench against Aston Villa. The right back has not yet resumed training but was assessed by the England medical team last week and was at White Hart Lane on Sunday for the final game of the season. His . team did not turn up on Sunday though, as Spurs ran riot in the . first 45 minutes and then both sides looked forward to their summer . holidays. Paulinho played a . one-two with Harry Kane and slotted in the rebound after Brad Guzan . saved his initial shot, then Baker diverted a Danny Rose cross into his . own net under pressure from Adebayor. A fine block from Fabian Delph . prevented Kane adding a third before Agbonlahor handled a Sandro shot in . the penalty area. Adebayor slotted away the resulting spot-kick for his . 14th goal of the season. A . Michael Dawson header prompted a fine save from Guzan, but Villa’s . chances were limited to long-range, off-target efforts by Delph and . Ashley Westwood, bringing more ironic cheers from the away supporters. It . has been an underwhelming campaign for both these teams, but it is . still not quite over yet. The chances of either Sherwood or Lambert . being in charge when the Premier League resumes on August 16 are looking . increasingly slim, after all. Kicking out: Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan takes his anger out on a goalpost at White Hart Lane . Changes planned: chairman Daniel Levy made no mention of Sherwood in his programme notes .

"Health unions have threatened more walkouts through the winter if the Government refuses to back down in a row over pay. Hundreds of thousands of nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, ambulance drivers, hospital porters and cooks took part in a four-hour strike yesterday morning. Scans and home visits for expectant mothers were delayed, while dozens of less-urgent 999 calls went unattended by paramedics. Scroll down for video . Drafted in: A soldier helped a paramedic with a stretcher at the Royal Liverpool Hospital yesterday. Union chiefs have warned there could be more strikes this winter in a row over a one per cent pay rise for NHS staff . Desperate measures: An ambulance is driven by a member of the military through central London yesterday . Protest: An NHS staff member outside the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. It was revealed that fewer than half those balloted for the controversial health strike across health unions voted in favour of action . Non-urgent caesarean sections and other elective operations were also cancelled, while Unison claimed many operating theatres sat empty. Soldiers and police officers had to be called in to drive ambulances, coming to the aid of one woman in labour and an elderly woman with breathing difficulties. At one point, paramedics had to be pulled off the picket lines to attend to a woman suffering a ‘diabetic fit’. Unison also claimed two-thirds of outpatient clinics were either cancelled or limited to urgent cases. The controversial industrial action was the first NHS workers’ strike over pay in 32 years and the first ever walkout for members of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). A child brandishing a Unison poster calling for 'Fair pay for NHS staff' stands on the picket line outside the Bradford Royal Infirmary (left), while an NHS worker carries the same placard at the Royal Berkshire Hospital . Unions are understood to be considering whether to stage further strikes together or choose different dates . Fair pay: Members of Unison on the picket line outside London's St Thomas' Hospital in Westminster . Family affair: Laura Mackenzie with her son Gabriel and Biz Rance with her son Finn on the picket line outside London's King's College Hospital. The strike was the first ever by the Royal College of Midwives . Former Tory health minister Edwina Currie told a £39,000-a-year midwife she should be ‘ashamed’ of herself for taking part in the strike yesterday. Frances Walker, 50, told Radio 2 that under-pressure midwives were at the ‘end of their tether’. But Miss Currie, who took part in the on-air debate on the Jeremy Vine show, made a scathing attack on the community midwife, who is also a steward for the Royal College of Midwives. Miss Currie said the basic salary for a midwife who has worked for at least a year was £25,783, which she said was ‘about the national average’. She said: ‘You are going on strike at the expense of the people earning much less than you have.’ Prompted by Mr Vine, Mrs Walker admitted she earned £39,000. Miss Currie, 68, said: ‘There is absolutely no case for a £39,000-a-year member of staff in an important, valued and precious profession to…strike. You should be ashamed of yourself.’ Mrs Walker, who works for the Gloucestershire Hospitals trust, insisted: ‘We made sure we had cover completely for the delivery suite and the birth units and the maternity ward so no harm came to any mother or baby, thank you Edwina.’ Now, some of the seven unions involved have warned there could be more strikes within weeks if the Government does not meet their demand to honour a 1 per cent pay increase. They are understood to be considering whether to stage further strikes together or choose different dates to cause maximum impact. The nationwide walkout yesterday was staged despite fewer than half of those balloted across the health unions voting for action. Unison, which is one of the biggest unions, persuaded just one in ten eligible members to vote in favour. It is not known exactly how many took part yesterday, but the GMB, Unite, Unison, UCATT, Managers in Partnership, the British Association of Occupational Therapists and the RCM have more than 400,000 members in the NHS in England, out of 1.3million staff. The NHS Confederation, which represents trust bosses, cast doubt on the legitimacy of the strike, claiming only around 4 per cent of staff had voted to take part. Yesterday, Rachael Maskell, head of health at the Unite union, said: ‘We are already planning, and will definitely be taking, further industrial action if the Government doesn’t put more money on the table and doesn’t talk to us.’ Jon Skewes of the RCM said: ‘The ballot enables us to carry on industrial action for as long as is necessary.’ But he said that while they will ‘consider mounting further action’, he hoped the Government would instead ‘return to the table’ to continue negotiations. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday warned that 14,000 nursing jobs would have to be axed over the next two years in order to pay the salary increase in full. He said it would be wrong to cut jobs in order to hand a 1 per cent pay rise to tens of thousands of staff who are already receiving pay increments worth an average 3 per cent. Mr Hunt said almost 60 per cent of NHS staff qualify for an annual pay increment. Soldiers help ambulance crews with an emergency admission at St Thomas' Hospital in central London . Nationwide walkout: Staff outside Saint Michael's Hospital in Bristol take part in the action from 7am to 11am . Seven unions taking part in the industrial action are calling for a one per cent pay rise for all NHS staff . ‘Why is it that we are saying we can’t afford to give 1 per cent on top of the 3 per cent rises that around 55 per cent of NHS staff are getting?’ he said. ‘The answer is that we have had very clear analysis that if we did that hospital chief executives would lay off around 4,000 nurses this year and around 10,000 nurses next year. ‘Now, the NHS has just come through a terrible tragedy with Mid Staffs – we discovered the most appalling care happening there and indeed at some other hospitals. ‘We have turned a corner on that by recruiting in our hospitals around 5,000 extra nurses ... we don’t want to turn the clock back.’ Sources said funding a 1 per cent pay increase for NHS staff would cost £450million over two years. Yesterday, up to 130 military drivers helped ambulance staff in London and the North West, the Ministry of Defence said.

"Former Boxing champion Frank Bruno today made an emotional plea for better mental health treatment after revealing he had been sectioned twice in the last 18 months. The ex-heavyweight told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow that he had struggled to cope with mental illness problems after retiring from professional boxing, . In a video played to delegates today, Bruno revealed that he was a Lib Dem supporter because of the party’s backing for mental health. Former heavyweight  boxing champion Frank Bruno said he had been sectioned twice in the past 18 months . Bruno lost his world heavyweight boxing belt to Mike Tyson in 1996. His mental health problems first came to light in 2003 . Bruno, who won his world title in 1995 and lost it to Mike Tyson the following year, first hit the headlines over his mental health problems in 2003, when police escorted him to hospital after he suffered a severe bout of depression. He has also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In today’s film, introducing Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb, Bruno said: ‘My name is Frank Bruno and I’m talking from experience of being sectioned about three times, two times in the last 18 months. ‘I’m just a nobody really, I’m just a human being. Yesterday I used to do boxing and I used to be a celebrity, but I’m talking to you as a human being from experience. Bruno recorded a video to introduce health minister Norman Lamb . ‘I met Norman Lamb and he’s changed a lot of different things for mental health people. 'He’s very concerned ... very, very passionate.’ He said he hoped the Lib-Dems ‘do very, very well’ so Mr Lamb can stay in his job. Mr Lamb hailed Bruno’s bravery in opening up about his mental health problems. He said: ‘He came to talk to me about his experience ... the acute embarrassment and humiliation of three police cars arriving at your house, as if a dreadful crime had been committed. But he was ill.’ In Mr Lamb's speech today he pledged to introduce a new ‘carers’ bonus’ worth £250 a year, and a ‘carers’ passport’ offering help such as free hospital parking or gym and cinema vouchers. He attacked Labour for being ‘resistant to change’ in the NHS and claimed the public should not trust Labour or the Tories with the NHS. Addressing the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, the Health Minister said Labour had made ‘great promises a fortnight ago about saving the NHS’, but attacked their record on the economy which he said would imperil the service. ‘They just do not get it,’ Mr Lamb said. ‘Ed Miliband of course forgot to mention the deficit. In Labour's world it seems unimportant. ‘Yet as our national debt grows year by year as we borrow to keep public services going, so the amount we spend on interest to service that debt grows. £52 billion pounds this year alone in interest on debt. ‘Every pound we spend on interest on debt means a pound not spent to support someone with dementia, to provide therapy for someone with severe mental ill health or to ensure that a cancer patient gets access to drugs that can keep them alive.’ Labour leader Mr Miliband used his party conference speech last month to pledge a £2.5billion 'time to care' fund for the NHS, while David Cameron committed the Conservatives to a five-year ringfencing of the service's budget. Despite the pledge, Mr Lamb also hit out at the Tories, saying the party leadership would be ‘constantly under pressure’ from its right-wing to ‘cut funding to the NHS’ if it won the 2015 election. ‘Liam Fox has already called for an end to protection of the NHS budget in the next parliament,’ he said. ‘But that is tantamount to calling for an end to the NHS as we know it.’","Bruno told the Lib Dem conference he had struggled  with mental illness .

"A new report claims that embattled Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito's bullying wasn't limited to other players, but also includes a member of the team's staff, whom Incognito allegedly mocked about his ethnic background and made crude joke's about the man's wife. According to two sources, 'Incognito would sometimes dress in garb from the staff member’s culture and then make profane jokes about that culture.' Another source says that another player joined Incognito in the bullying. Scroll down for video . Bullying claims: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito, right, has been accused of bullying younger players though he denies the claims . These most recent allegations about Incognito's alleged bullying antics were first reported by National Football Post. In addition to the cultural jabs, . Incognito reportedly made sexual references to the staffer's wife, . telling the man that she'd had sex with several members of the team. According to the report, the . harassment was done in full-view of other staffers and that team . management and front-office staff did nothing to stop it. The NFL currently is investigating . the allegations against Incognito and the Dolphins, as well as the . alleged bullying of Incognito's former teammate Jonathan Martin, who . claims he was relentlessly harassed by Incognito to the point that he . left the team to seek mental health treatment. In one of the disturbing exchanges, . Incognito referred to Martin, 24, as a ‘half-n*****’, while in another . he threatened to defecate in his young teammate's mouth. Incognito also made reference to tracking down members of Martin's family and harming them in other texts, reports CBS Sports. Incognito was indefinitely suspended by the NFL earlier this month while the league investigates the situation involving the rookie Martin. Martin left the team after an incident involving Incognito in the team cafeteria in October. It was later alleged that almost all the veteran Dolphins players have forced newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles . including $30,000 dinners. Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, had taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates . According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald, the alleged bank-rolling is part of the reason for Martin's shocking leave of absence from the team. ESPN . claims Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to . help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter. ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter released a report regarding Incognito on ESPN.com, saying that several sources insisted Incognito was involved. They said the incident was not isolated and extended to 2012, when Martin was a second-round draft pick by the team. One source said any emotional issues Martin is experiencing are directly related to his harassment. Reporter Adam Schefter tweeted on Monday some of Incognito's alleged messages to Martin . After the allegations were made public, Dolphins coach Joe Philbin said, 'This is something we take . very seriously and will not be tolerated'. Incognito has been playing with the . Dolphins since 2010 and has been in the NFL since 2006, originally with . the St. Louis Rams. He was selected to the Pro Bowl just last season as . an offensive guard. Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke. Reporter . Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab . for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around . $400.000.' Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation. 'Everything tastes better when . rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I . just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight.'

'Sources': ESPN TV personality, Adam Schefter, who first broke the story, is being attacked by Incognito on Twitter who says Schefter is 'slandering' his name . The team has labeled the accusations of bullying as 'speculation.' They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being. 'The . Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, . have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his . departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary . concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the . statement read. 'As an . organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been . presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate. 'Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we . appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's . health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.' After ESPN . reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's early stories about the allegations, Incognito . took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing . '@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name. You hide behind ""sources"" who . are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report.' Three minutes later, the player . added: '@AdamSchefter This is the second time you have tried to drag my . name through the mud with lies.'

"Newcastle boss Alan Pardew admits he has been saddened by calls from the club's fans for his head. The 52-year-old was booed whenever he entered his technical area during Saturday 3-0 Barclays Premier League victory over Cardiff at St James' Park, which ended a run of six successive defeats. However, he is refusing to allow the pressure to get to him as he prepares for Sunday's final day trip to Liverpool. Not happy: Alan Pardew is saddened by Newcastle United supporters calling for his head as the club's manager . Sack the board! Newcastle fans have turned up with banners printing their displeasure in recent weeks . Pardew told the Shields Gazette: 'Obviously, I'm a little bit sad about the situation, but my resolve has to be strong to make sure the players are ready for Liverpool. 'We need to go to Anfield and put in a top performance.' Pardew, who signed an eight-year contract in September 2012, is not understood to be in any immediate danger, although he will have to negotiate his end-of-season debrief with owner Mike Ashley, something he managed by the skin of his teeth 12 months ago after a desperate fight against relegation. This time around, the Magpies will finish no lower than 10th, a significant improvement on the last campaign, although one which might have been markedly better but for the decision to sell star midfielder Yohan Cabaye in January and not replace him. Tricky period: Shola Ameobi scored as they beat Cardiff at the weekend but it has been a difficult spell . Should Pardew receive the green light from Ashley, he will hope to embark upon a major rebuilding exercise this summer with strikers Loic Remy and Luuk de Jong only on loan and Shola Ameobi out of contract, while a replacement for Cabaye will be a priority too. Pardew said: 'We need to make sure that we start next season in the same position we started this season. We had a strong team and were challenging for Europe. 'But towards the back end of the season, we have not been that good. We need to accept that, accept the criticism and make the right calls.'","Newcastle United supporters want to see Alan Pardew sacked .

"Western Sydney Wanderers’ captain Nikolai Topor-Stanley has laughed off accusations of match fixing, saying the club thoroughly deserved their historic win in the Asian Champions League. The 29-year-old defender tells Daily Mail Australia that allegations from the losing side, Al-Hilal, do not bother the team, who know to ignore the poor sportsmanship because ‘as sad as it is, (this type of behaviour) is football.’ ‘It’s sad, but it happens everywhere. You have to choose to react or not to react to it and our team does not buy into that stuff,’ said Topor-Stanley. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS .

Wanderers fans welcome home the boys at the airport and are ecstatic after their AFC win . The three-year-old Sydney side won the competition on aggregate after a 0-0 draw with Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, crowned champions due to their 1-0 victory in Sydney the week prior. Ugly scenes ensued, with Al-Hilal striker head butting and later spitting on Wanderers defender Matthew Spiranovic, and goalkeeper Ante Covic having lasers flashing in eyes from the crowd during the match. On Tuesday, Al-Hilal officials released a letter, claiming the club lost unfairly due to poor decision-making from the referee, alleging four incorrect judgements cost their side the game. Topor-Stanley, who returned to Australia with his team on Tuesday, says the team is taking little notice of the poor sportsmanship. ‘We deserve the win and we have the medal to prove it. Nobody can take that away from us,’ Topor-Stanley told Daily Mail Australia. ‘The accusations don’t bother me one bit. Nobody can say we weren’t deserving players.’ Number one!

It will only distract you,’ said Topor-Stanley. ‘We’re a winning club. Our success is built on a winning mentality.' ‘Our team is built on trying to be the best everyday.’ Hard work is deeply ingrained in the captain’s character, with Topor-Stanley spending the afternoon as he flew into Sydney studying for a university exam scheduled for the next day. Understandably, he is feeling a little less-than prepared, but makes no excuses. In fact, the entire club’s celebrations must wait, as they prepare for Friday night’s A-League fixture against Wellington Phoenix in New Zealand.

The final was played in front of a full capacity King Fahd stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Of the 70,000-person crowd, only 14 Wanderers' fans were able to make the journey, meaning Al-Hilal's loss was witnessed by a sea of their blue and white supporters . The memory of the roaring crowd is still fixed in Topor-Stanley’s mind, explaining that the ‘literally deafening, amazing amount of noise’ was like nothing he had ever experienced. The team played in front of a full-capacity, 70,000 person crowd at King Fahd stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Only fourteen of those spectators were Western Sydney Wanderers supporters. Yet playing to a sea of blue and white was far from intimidating. ‘It was energising to see all the Al-Hilal supporters.' ‘It wasn’t scary or daunting, it made us realise that this is the big time and this is where we belong.' ‘We earned the right to play at this level and it didn’t intimate us.’ The team leader says this self-belief and the Wanderers’ strong team culture is the key to their incredible success, just three years since the club’s formation. ‘We want to win and we apply that mentality to every game,’ explains Topor-Stanley .

The square erupted when the Wanderers secured the win, with fans setting off flares, waving flags and 'sobbing' out of happiness . ‘It’s easy to say that, I mean, everybody wants to win. But not everybody is willing to sacrifice consistently.' ‘Our entire team is committed everyday. Every player, the coaches and everyone in the staff is on the same page.' ‘People don’t see that side, they just see the 90 minutes we play. Our club culture brought us to where we are.’ The captain says the team is ecstatic after their win, which is still yet to sink in. ‘I feel complete disbelief. It’s been very emotional,’ said Topor Stanley. ‘I’ve been remembering all the things that my parents sacrificed when I was growing up which gave me the opportunity to play in that game. I’m so grateful.’ Topor-Stanley and the Western Sydney Wanderers were blown away by the heroes’ welcome they received at Sydney airport on Tuesday morning from 2000 of their legion of notoriously passionate fans.

They are as much a part of it as every player and staff member,’ said Topor-Stanley. ‘We couldn’t have done it without them. They are a part of the club.’ The players are well aware that the hard work is far from behind them, with the fifth round of the Hyundai A-League just days away. ‘(The ACL win) is a huge confidence boost, but we’re well aware we have zero points in the league at the moment. ‘We’re not in denial about that, we’re behind the eight-ball and we need to catch up.’ ‘It’s a huge task but we’re not panicking and we’re not going to change anything.

"Nothing is more certain in this season of twists and turns, shocks and surprises than that Manchester City will go all out to beat West Ham on Sunday rather than play for the home draw which would  deliver unto them, for the second time in three years, the Premier League title. Manuel Pellegrini’s effervescent team go into the last day fined a fortune for breaking financial fair play regulations and under fire for occupying the top position in the table for no more than a couple of weekends since August. So the question is: do they deserve the championship of England? Going all the way to the top: Manchester City are destined to end their goal-laden season with the title . Let’s see if those aristocratic neighbours at Old Trafford can give us an honest answer. I suspect they will, if the question is put in its proper context. Being knocked off their perch was always going to be painful for United. That City, again, should profit from that fall from grace makes it torture. But nothing will injure the red faithful more than the manner in which they have lost and City have won the title. The agonising truth is that City that have claimed the crown by playing the thrill-factor football with which Sir Alex Ferguson’s swashbuckling Manchester United teams used to exercise their swaggering domination over our national game. That this should happen at the same time as United were retreating into the cautious, defensive shell constructed by Fergie’s chosen replacement makes it all the more unbearable for them. David Moyes is not the first to be overwhelmed by the romantic expectations at Old Trafford. It wasn’t easy to follow Sir Matt Busby, either. It does not make him a bad manager but he was the bringer of a sad reality. Losing to City is one thing. Being out-thrilled by them is something more chastening altogether and if their hands were not so heavily on heart United’s fans should be applauding their cross-town rivals. Never mind being 20 points behind in a race they won by 11 last May, feel the hurt of the goal difference. City are plus 63, having scored a hundred. United are 42 back, having netted a mere 63 times. Strewth, even while going for goal the Etihad boys are still the better defenders. I am not a believer that statistics tell the whole story but there is no getting round these numbers. Less so when you watch City play. Pellegrini always believe his expensive – in the eyes of UEFA over-expensive – ensemble will outscore the opposition. Moyes, trapped in his pressurised bunker, barely trusted the heirs to the Fergie legacy to cross the half-way. Thrill factor: Yaya Toure's goal against Aston Villa typifies City's effervescence this season . Belief: Manuel Pellegrini (centre) always backs his expensively-assembled side to outscore the opposition . Swashbuckling: Sir Alex Ferguson's teams used to win trophies with style . Not everyone approves of Arab owners pouring their oil wealth into a Manchester suburb. But at a time when United were flagging as the standard bearers, there can be no logical denying that the Premier League needed a team to step up and entertain the masses. It rubs salt into the Old Trafford wound that Liverpool have been the next best to City when it came to meeting that challenge and all credit to Brendan Rodgers for stimulating that revival on the Mersey. But while a Kop championship would have provided the emotional climax to this Hillsborough anniversary year, it is City’s football which has roused the blood of football lovers everywhere. One glance at the mediocrity below the elite clubs serves as a reminder of the importance of City’s contribution to the spectacle. West Bromwich go into this last weekend on a paltry 36 points. Four more clubs just above them – Hull, Aston Villa, Sunderland and Swansea – all have less than the 40 points which used to be the cut line. Wretchedly as United are struggling home in seventh, the rest are at least eight points in arrears of them. City, with some help from Liverpool, have diverted attention from that erosion of standards from the bottom of league, let alone being over-priced, is over-hyped as allegedly the best in the world. Even for United fans, it is time to own up and give City the respect they deserve. Style council: This Robin van Persie volley exemplified the verve with which Ferguson's teams played . Is that it, Mr Dyke? Is this really all the new FA chairman’s master plan for breeding generations of English world beaters? This is the half-baked mish-mash just dished up for the future of our game: . A few B teams from the Premier League giants playing down in a nether-world somewhere between League Two and the Conference, some of whose clubs will make up the numbers. The likes of Liverpool, United, Arsenal and City fostering nursery clubs lower down those divisions. A trimming of imports so that 90 home-grown footballers play half any club’s Premier League games in a season, instead of 66 at present. Some revolution. One in the eye for common sense: Greg Dyke's FA Commission report is hardly revolutionary . How, exactly, is playing in a new League Three against part-timers and fellow reserves going to prepare the finest English youngsters to take on Germany, Brazil et al in Russia 2014? Nor will they be allowed promotion above League One If it is to work, as it does in Spain, the B teams must compete in the Championship – and, by the way, not be forbidden to take part in the FA Cup. Nursery clubs? Most of the big teams already have them, de facto, in the more challenging and educational first divisions on the Continent. An increase of 24 more home boys getting a few more games in the Premier League? Wow. I’m not great at maths but unless I’m mistaken that adds down to all of 1.2 players per each of the 20 clubs. You had to worry about this commission when you saw who the chairman is. Now Dyke has discovered first hand who really runs the national game. It’s not his FA. It’s the big clubs. The waste bin beckons. Of course Louis van Gaal is coming to Manchester United once Holland’s World Cup campaign in Brazil is over. Whether he is the right man for the job remains to be seen. By his own admission he is an iron-fisted tyrant. By our observation his teams play with flair and style when things go well but he can revert to the suffocatingly pragmatic if the going gets tough. But one thing he must not do is allow to fall into rusting neglect the pipe-line through which United have always brought fine young players and continue to do so. The future's bright: James Wilson scores against Hull and United must remember their traditions and nurture him, Tom Lawrence (below left) and Adnan Januzaj (below right) James Wilson, 18, scored twice in this week’s 3-1 win over Hull as he led an attack which included 19-year-old Adnan Januzaj and Tom Lawrence, 20. Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, as stand-in manager and temporary coach respectively, are still at Old Trafford as reminders of how well this youth policy has served the club down the years. Thus have United have helped not only themselves but England, and other nations. That trust is about to be place in Van Gaal’s hands. Let him not betray it. A quiet word in the quivering ears of Messrs Suarez, Terry and Gerrard, among others, before we drown in their tears. Football is supposed to be a man’s game and never forget it is only a game. Not the crying game.","City will go for the win against West Ham on Sunday to clinch the title .

"It was a bad day for the Washington Redskins as the football team was involved in a bus crash before a crowd of 5,000 protesters descended on the stadium rallying against the squad's divisive nickname. The pandemonium appeared to be something of a bad omen as they then lost today's match against the Vikings in Minnesota. Two of the Redskin team buses were driving with a police escort to the stadium at around 8.30am when one bus took a wrong turn and crashed into the back of the other. Scroll down for video . Crash: Washington Redskins wide receiver Pierre Garcon posted this picture to Twitter, showing the damage to one of the team buses after a Sunday morning crash on their way to play the Minnesota Vikings away . The team was reportedly shaken up by the crash but no serious injuries were reported. Moments later, thousands of demonstrators who had been marching through the University of Minnesota campus made their way to TCF Bank Stadium. Native American leaders, local politicians, former sports stars and other speakers voiced their disdain for Redskins owner Dan Snyder and his refusal to change the nickname they've derided as derogatory and racist. With many of the attendees wearing colorful, traditional Native American clothing and more holding signs, the gathering was by far the stiffest resistance for a Redskins road game and the latest push in a nationwide campaign that has cranked up over the last year. Protest: Tribes, Native American organizers and the University of Minnesota protested the name 'Redskins' Anger: The two-hour demonstration featured talks from politicians, former sports stars, and tribe members . Chants: The crowds chanted 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, this racist name has got to go!' on their way to the stadium . Some people wore burgundy T-shirts with gold lettering, mimicking the team's logo with the words 'Rethink' and 'Rename' instead of Redskins. 'We're not mascots!' said former Vikings strong safety Joey Browner, one of 29 speakers who took the microphone on a lawn just steps from the stadium entrances. Browner, who is part Native American, wore a black Vikings cap with a feather sticking up out of it. 'As a former player I feel really sad right now. ... This is still standing in front of us,' said Browner, a six-time Pro Bowl pick, who called the nickname a 'bullying tactic.'

Disappointment: The squad lost 26-29 against the Minnesota Vikings at the end of a bad Sunday for them . Hours later, the squad lost 26-29. The NFL didn't immediately respond for comment on the protest. Commissioner Roger Goodell said earlier this year the nickname has been 'presented in a way that honors Native Americans.' The two-hour series of speeches was a peaceful gathering, including folk music and Native American dancers. As the rally got going, a group paraded along the sidewalk between the stadium and the stage, chanting: 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, this racist name has got to go!'","Squad bus crashed into another shortly before 1pm match on Sunday .

"Luis Suarez climbed off the bench at half time to spark a dramatic comeback against Almeria leaving Barcelona supporters asking why he wasn’t on the pitch from the kick-off. Barca coach Luis Enrique left more than £150million of talent out of his starting line-up against a struggling team without a home win all season and had to change the disastrous team selection at half time to avoid defeat. Suarez and Neymar were both  introduced at the break after a goal from former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma gave Almeria a shock lead.

Suarez dragged Barca back into the game cracking an acrobatic volley on to the cross bar and then setting up Neymar and Jordi Alba for the two goals that won Barcelona the match. It has been a week for strange team selections and Luis Enrique’s starting line-up topped even Brendan Rodgers’ decisions in midweek at theBernabeu. Gerard Pique, Xavi, Dani Alves, Suarez and Neymar were all left on the bench against an Almeria team yet to win at home. Almeria, whose first team is worth around 10 times less than that all-star bench, could not believe their good fortune. They defended comfortably and attacked with purpose throughout the first half. Thievy, who was particularly prominent, put his team ahead on 37 minutes and it was no more than the strugglers deserved. Lionel Messi was dispossessed on the edge of his own area and the reaction from Barcelona said much for their current form. The Argentine failed to respond, dropping his head and beginning his stroll back towards his own half. Those around him also seemed to stand still. Messi had only lost the ball because none of the six players ahead of him had been in a position where they could be passed to. No-one pressurised Fernando Soriano, who swept the ball forward to Thievy. The striker sprinted clear of Javier Mascherano and Marc Bartra and slipped the ball past the advancing Claudio Bravo.

Trailing 1-0 at half-time Barça were 45 minutes from losing three league games on the bounce for the first time since 2003. Luis Enrique’s team selection had back-fired with disastrous consequences. It must have been an uncomfortable visitors’ dressing room as he faced his players having already sent Suarez and Neymar out to warm up. Both came on at the start of the second half. Barça had mustered just one first half chance of note with Ivan Rakitic from the left and Messi looping a header on to the bar. Suarez’s second-half introduction almost brought the equalizer on the hour when he hit the cross-bar with an acrobatic volley after a Rakitic corner had been flicked on. And the former Liverpool man then wriggled clear down the right before centering for Neymar to roll in the equaliser. He could have put Barca ahead from the same right wing channel but his cross shot went just the wrong side of Ruben’s post. The Uruguay star then teed-up Messi but the Argentine headed on to the bar for the second time in the game. As the clock ticked down it looked as if Suarez second half show might bring only a point but with six minutes left he crossed from the right and Alba stroked the ball past Ruben for the winner. arça had their three points but Enrique’s team selection had made hard work of it and he had Suarez's second half performance to thank for the turnaround.

"The National Trust in England charges its members almost 50 per cent more to join compared with its sister body in Scotland – and almost six times the fee payable in some other countries. Yet, in a glaring loophole, members from other heritage bodies from Zimbabwe to Bermuda are still allowed free entrance to historic NT landmarks in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The NT is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds under the reciprocal arrangement – as its own members pay a premium to enjoy unlimited admission to stately homes and castles compared to visiting tourists. Scroll down for video . An estimated 80,000 people who live in England belong to the Scottish trust. But if each one became a full member of the NT in England instead, it would boost the charity’s income by £1.52million a year . Last night it emerged that the NT has been fully aware of the loophole for years, and MPs called for it to be closed. And The Mail on Sunday has discovered that some cunning residents of England and Wales are even taking advantage of the loophole themselves to download the membership forms for foreign organisations and sign up on the cheap. An estimated 80,000 people who live in England belong to the Scottish trust. But if each one became a full member of the NT in England instead, it would boost the charity’s income by £1.52million a year. Coming just weeks after the referendum for Scottish independence, it is another example of how the English pay more than their Scottish neighbours across the border. Adult membership of the NT costs £58 a year in England but people who join the equivalent heritage body over the border pay as little as £39, meaning the English pay a 49 per cent premium for very similar benefits. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he was surprised the loophole had not been closed already. ‘This is quite a serious amount of money we’re talking about and if so many people from England and Wales are joining the Scottish organisation, I’m surprised the National Trust hasn’t done something about this. ‘They do a very good job in general and I would have thought they’d want to keep this money in their coffers and put it to good use, but ultimately it’s a matter for them.’ John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: I’m surprised the National Trust hasn’t done something about this' Even meaner culture-lovers are joining heritage trusts in Bermuda, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, Malta, Jersey and Guernsey where membership costs even less. ‘It’s deeply disappointing. The more people who do this, the less money we have to look after these special places,’ said an NT spokesman. Any UK resident joining the national trust in Bermuda pays less than £14 a year; in Malta the fee is £15.80 . The NT also offers free entrance to members of heritage trusts in Zimbabwe who pay £10 a year, Guernsey £20, Canada £22, Jersey £25, Isle of Man £30, New Zealand £32, Italy £31 and Australia £36. The NT admits there is a problem but believes that only ‘a few thousand’ deliberately exploit the loophole. It says heritage trusts in Zimbabwe, Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man have strict membership rules and would not allow anyone living full-time in Britain to join their organisations to exploit the free entrance perk at NT properties. The Trust added: ‘We have been aware for some time that people in the UK have joined overseas conservation organisations to access Trust sites at a lower cost. ‘But we still get extra income from the money they spend in shops and cafes and they have to pay parking.’","Adult membership of the National Trust costs £58 a year in England .

"More than one-quarter of teens engage in sexting and those who send explicit photos of themselves are more likely to become sexually active a year later, according to a study published on Monday. But the study, reported in the journal Pediatrics, did not find a link between the sending of sexually explicit photos and texts with risky sexual behavior over time. 'I don't think the behavior is new by any means, but the means by which we're doing it is new and scary I think to everyone because it's new, and because it can possibly be shared instantly with billions of people,' said Jeff Temple of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, lead author of the study. Normal behavior: More than one-quarter of teens engage in sexting, according to a study published on Monday. But the study didn't find a link between sexting and risky sexual behavior over time . Dr Temple, an associate professor and psychologist, and his team used anonymous surveys to study nearly 1,000 second- and third-year high school students in Texas. Twenty-eight percent of teens said they engaged in sexting. Adolescents who sent explicit photos of themselves to others during their second year of high school were more likely to say that they had engaged in sexual activity the following year than other adolescents. But only active sexting, which the study defined as sending an explicit photo, was correlated with an increased likelihood of sexual activity. Passive sexting, asking for or receiving a photo, was not. 'It does seem to be a part of this repertoire of sexual behaviors, and really I think that offline behaviors and online behaviors seem to mimic each other,' Dr Temple said. The research is drawn from an ongoing six-year investigation of 974 adolescent students from southeast Texas. The teens periodically complete anonymous surveys detailing their history of sexting, sexual activity and other behaviors. The findings show that sexting can be considered the new 'first base' among teens, since it is often the first step towards real sexual interaction. 'Sexting preceded sexual behaviour in many cases,' Dr Temple told the Washington Post. 'The theory behind that is sexting may act as a gateway or prelude to sexual behaviours or increases the acceptance of going to the next level.' For parents and teachers, sexting among teens is troubling not only for reasons related to personal values surrounding sex, but because the photographs can be easily and widely shared. The posting of nude photos of celebrities such as actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton on the Internet in September by an anonymous hacker, for instance, raised concerns about technology, security and privacy. But Dr Temple said that parents who discover their teens are sexting should not be overly worried because the discovery can serve as a springboard for important discussions about sexual health and related topics. 'The most important thing that I find with this study and my studies on sexting is really that it offers an opportunity for parents or healthcare providers to talk to teens about sex and safe sex, and I think that's what we need to keep our eye on,' he said.","A new study published in the journal Pediatrics found that teens who send explicit photos of themselves are likely to become sexually active a year later .

Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. With lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Source: NHS Choices . 'I see pictures of him and I get upset - I can't believe he's gone.' The couple met on a night out on Broad Street in Birmingham city centre in 2003. Mr Jenkins popped the question four years later and they married in Woolacombe, Devon, on July 5, 2012. Mrs Jenkins, who works at Marks & Spencer, said her husband was first told he had a virus when he fell ill. She said: 'He'd had a cough for several weeks and was going to and from the doctors but they thought it was a virus. 'But when we got back from the wedding his heart rate was found to be high and he was referred to Solihull Hospital. 'He was finally diagnosed with lymphoma.' Around 13, 900 people are diagnosed with lymphoma every year in the UK. It can only be diagnosed by carrying out a biopsy, a minor procedure where a sample of the lymph node tissue is surgically removed and studied in a laboratory. It is usually treated by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. But Mrs Jenkins said it soon became clear that chemotherapy treatment was not working for her husband. She said: 'At first they said it was treatable and they could cure it. But whenever he had chemo it kept coming back. Despite several rounds of chemotherapy, Mr Jenkins passed away the following April, leaving his new bride to raise their children alone. Mr Jenkins died just nine months after getting married, despite receiving last-chance treatment in the U.S. 'He fought it for nine months and was even given a last-chance treatment from America. 'All our hopes were on that, but he was already very poorly.' Mr Jenkins finally succumbed to the disease on April 27 last year. 'The whole family was left heartbroken,' his widow said. 'He always made everyone laugh and would do anything for anyone - he was just that sort of person.' To support Mr Jenkins' family, friend Adrian Court has entered an off-road obstacle race on Weston-super-Mare's beachfront on October 17. 'David was into his motorsport so I can't think of a better way to remember him,' said Adrian, from Shirley. 'I wanted to do something to help his children so all the money raised will go into a trust fund for them when they are 18.  Hopefully he'll be looking down on us and smiling.'

"The new Boots Protect and Perfect serum - an updated version of the sell-out 2007 product . The original triggered such a frenzy that desperate shoppers were forced to join waiting lists and bottles began changing hands on eBay for almost four times the original price. So it’s little surprise that an updated version of the Boots Protect and Perfect serum – containing a handful of new ingredients – is tipped to become an instant best-seller when it launches tomorrow. The cream first caused a stampede at the tills in 2007 after a BBC Horizon documentary revealed the £17 product had been clinically proven to reduce signs of ageing. Boots is now launching an updated – and more expensive – version with several new ingredients, including Matrixyl 3000, which can dramatically increase the amount of collagen in the skin and improve its elasticity. And tests on the ‘advanced’ serum – carried out at the University of Manchester – have shown that the new formula is even more effective than the original. Boots has been testing the serum on more than 2,600 volunteers, many of whom went without mirrors for a month to help them pinpoint the differences. The trial showed that after four weeks, eight out of ten women experienced ‘significant anti-ageing benefits’. Diana Wilkins, 38, was one of the women taking part in the trials. The mother of four said she was normally ‘massively cynical’ about claims made by beauty companies. Scroll down for video . The cream first caused a stampede at the tills in 2007 after a BBC Horizon documentary revealed the £17 product had been clinically proven to reduce signs of ageing (library image) The updated formula includes specialised peptides, which are the building blocks of proteins that help the skin repair itself. New ingredient Matrixyl 3000 has been shown to boost collagen levels in skin, increasing its elasticity. When combined with another peptide – acetyl dipeptide – it becomes even more effective at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The serum also contains a patented cocktail of antioxidants as well as Salicylic acid – which helps exfoliate the skin – and Hyaluronic acid, which is responsible for making the surface of the face appear plumper thanks to its ability to bind water into the skin. But she added: ‘I used this and noticed a difference in the depth of lines and overall smoothness. It takes a lot for me to believe things work but I was taken aback.’ Skin expert Professor Chris Griffiths, from Manchester University, said: ‘Boots carried out robust, clinical trials in line with our understanding of skin repair. The results are impressive.’ And Dr Mike Bell, a skincare adviser at Boots, said: ‘The identification of anti-ageing solutions has to come from an in-depth understanding of the ageing process. ‘This has been the most rigorous and complex product development we have ever undertaken. After four weeks more than 85 per cent of users say their fine lines are reduced and their skin looks younger. Normally it would take at least eight weeks to see this sort of result.’ He also explained that testers continued to notice improvements after the initial month was up, saying: ‘The benefits grow with time. 'After three months there was a significant improvement to crows’ feet around the eyes.’ The Protect and Perfect Advanced serum, which costs £23.95, is designed for people aged between 25 and 35. The Protect and Perfect Advanced Intense serum is aimed at over-35s and costs £24.95.","Boots £17 Protect and Perfect serum first released in 2007 .

"Looking like a cross between a Batmobile and a MP4-12C supercar, it is a car any man would be proud of - even Batman. And legendary British sports-car maker, McLaren, has officially taken the wraps off its X-1, designed exclusively for an anonymous multi-millionaire. The McLaren X-1 is inspired by a series of classic vehicles - including the 200mph MP4-12C - and even a grand piano. Its owner wanted a one-off dream car - and it's like nothing else on the road. He approached Woking-based McLaren with the brief that they should build him something 'timeless' and with 'classical elegance'. And this is what he got. Unveiled with Batmobile wings: It took a three hour discussion with the firm and anonymous multi-millionaire to decide what the car would look like. Pages of notes were gathered and hundreds of images . A view from the front: Inspirational cars included a 1961 Facel Vega, a 1953 Chrysler D'Elegance Ghia, a 1959 Buick Electra, a 1939 Mercedes-Benz 540K and a 1971 Citroën SM . McLaren has refused to reveal the identity of the mysterious buyer and the amount they paid for the one-off car . A car built good enough for Batman? Anonymous car enthusiast wanted a car that reflected his needs and personality . After three-years of discussion, design and construction, McLaren unveiled the X-1 at the Pebble Beach Concours show in Monterey, California. The supercar firm used the platform from its MP4-12C supercar for the X-1 - which means it has a 3.8-litre engine developing more than 600bhp. With an MP4-12C costing in the region of £170,000 and the new exclusive X-1 wrapped in a unique body, which took two-and-a-half years to build - it is estimated the car is worth over a casual £1m. The firm said it is the most ambitious example yet of their expertise. It has a whole new body made of advanced . materials. Everything is bespoke, even down to the lights and wheels. The X-1 had its own development programme because . crucially, it wasn’t to be a concept car that would never see . tarmac. It was to be a usable car, road legal and capable of travelling . at supercar speeds. It used the 12C's engine and doors,but this is where the similarities ended after an incredible overhaul by Korean-born designer Hong Yeo. The result is a car inspired by a 1961 Facel Vega, 1953 Chrysler D'Elegance Ghia, 1959 Buick Electra, 1939 Mercedes-Benz 540K and a 1971 Citroen SM. A whole new body made of advanced materials: It is the most ambitious example yet of the firm's expertise. Everything is bespoke, even down to the lights and wheels . There's nothing quite like it: Car is inspired by a grand piano and a black-and-white photo of Audrey Hepburn . Streamlined: It took three years of discussion, design and construction to finish the masterpiece . McLaren unveiled its X-1 at the Pebble Beach Concours show in Monterey, California . On top of this, the X-1 takes design cues from a Jaeger LeCoultre art deco clock, an Airstream trailer, a Thomas Mann Montblanc pen, a grand piano, an eggplant and a black-and-white photo of Audrey Hepburn. Paul MacKenzie, McLaren Special Operations programme director, said: 'One of our clients who already owned a McLaren F1, a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren and now a 12C, wanted a unique car. 'The conversation began with our executive chairman Ron Dennis almost three years ago - before the 12C was even launched. 'The client wanted a machine that had all the capability of the 12C but wrapped in a unique body that reflected his needs and personality.' Hong Yeo added: 'X-1 embodies the . McLaren value that every part has to have a purpose. No details are . simply visual cues, every one has a purpose. Batmobile: X-1 looks remarkably similar to Batman's own car . 'Although I like to think the wide . body combined with pontoon style rear fenders will ensure the car glides . when it's moving just like a superhero's cape.' McLaren has refused to reveal the identity of the mysterious buyer and the amount they paid for the one-off car. But rumours are circulating on the Internet that it was either Ralph Lauren or Jay Leno who opted for the model. Both Americans are known car collectors with a fondness for McLarens and classic cars. McLaren MP4-12C: The supercar can reach speeds up to 200mph and is worth £168,000 . McLaren Automotive has been producing landmark sports car for the road for 20 years. The McLaren F1 road car, which was launched in 1992, set the world land speed record for a production car, and is regarded as one of the iconic sports cars of the modern age. The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren is the most successful supercar ever in its price bracket, having sold twice as many cars as its nearest carbon-based rival. McLaren X-1 is based structurally on the company’s carbon MonoCell but has a totally unique body. The firm says it has been created for an 'anonymous car enthusiast.' Programme Director Paul Mackenzie and . Design Director Frank Stephenson went to see the anonymous client to . start to explore the sort of car he wanted. Frank Stephenson said: ‘The key qualities the client desired were ""timeless and classical elegance"".  Which was some challenge.’ Actress Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film, Breakfast at Tiffany's, inspired the X-1 car . The meeting with Mr Mackenzie and Mr Stephenson lasted for almost three hours. From the pages of notes that were gathered, the design team brought together hundreds of images from the world of cars, architecture, fashion, design and even film. These were then presented to the customer, and were then narrowed down to a mood book, full of inspiring images from which the design spirit of this unique car would be derived. Inspirational cars included a 1961 Facel Vega, a 1953 Chrysler D’Elegance Ghia, a 1959 Buick Electra, a 1939 Mercedes-Benz 540K and a 1971 Citroën SM. There were various examples of architecture – including the Guggenheim museums in New York and Bilbao – plus a Jaeger LeCoultre art deco clock, an Airstream trailer, a Thomas Mann Montblanc pen, a grand piano – and an eggplant. ‘The client liked the shiny texture of the finish,’ said Mr Stephenson. There was also a black-and-white photo of Audrey Hepburn.","It took almost three years to make the supercar for owner who already had a McLaren F1 and a Mercedes- Benz .

"The mother of the four-year-old boy who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son, a court heard. The 24-year-old woman told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler, who was discovered just days from death. 'I've messed up, I've done the wrong thing. I know I shouldn't have thought about my man before my son,"" she said, Channel 9 reported. 'I didn't associate with my child like I should have, instead I was too busy having sex with (her partner).' Scroll down for video . Police sift through the squalor of the Adelaide home last year . An Adelaide court also hear the mother posted pictures to social media of her meals and dishes she had just cooked as her son starved in his bedroom. While the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies, pictures were posted on Facebook of her first attempt at cooking a roast lamb and a melted chocolate dessert, according to Channel 9. The fact police even learned of the appalling conditions the boy, from Adelaide, was living in was 'completely fortuitous' because his mother only called them when her partner was assaulting her, the prosecution told the court. Doctors said the boy’s dehydration level was at 10 percent and was two days away from reaching a critical level of 15 percent. Prosecutors have called for a lengthy jail sentence after the 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering their son's life. They will be sentenced in December. Images of roast lamb and a chocolate dessert posted by the starving boy's mother as he was locked in his bedroom . The Adelaide house was covered in rotten food and litter. Here, the toilet is surrounded by used toilet paper . Police had to wade through rubbish when they were called to the home last year to deal with a domestic incident . Earlier, the District Court in Adelaide heard the young victim, who is now in foster care, still hides food in his pockets, hates doors being closed and is not yet toilet trained. Since being removed from his parents a year ago, the boy has had a significant number of decayed teeth removed and has limited language skills. He cannot tolerate doors being closed and cannot control his emotions, sometimes punching himself in the head or running into walls. A victim impact statement, compiled by authorities and the boy's foster parents, was read out in the District Court in Adelaide at the sentence hearing for his parents on Tuesday. Cans of energy drink and food wrappers fill the room as investigators wade through the squalor . The victim impact statement said normal family outings were obviously new to the boy, who would not come out of his room for the first six months after his removal. When he woke up, he would lie in his bed waiting for someone to come into his room. In an earlier police interview, the father said the boy was kept in his bedroom for 12 days and fed under the door. 'We actually fed him pretty much every day, in that room, by sliding the plates under there, so far as we could hear, he was happy,' the boy's father said.

"A teenager accused of shooting and stabbing an elderly stranger to death had penned a detailed list of plans including 'select prey' and 'enjoy kill', according to reports. Maxwell Winkler, 17, was found riding his bike through a wooded area near to the murder scene in Fishers, Indiana on Monday, two days after Henry Kim, 73, was found killed in Windermere Park. After they took the high school student into custody, police went to his mother's house and found the notes inside a wallet, according to court documents seen by the Indianapolis Star. 'Prepare site and prepare tools for cleanup,' the notes read. 'Select prey. Wait and act inauspicious (play with phone and wave) till prey passes by to strike or surprise attack using bike near site. 'Sick': High school student Maxwell Winkler, 17, left, has been accused of shooting and stabbing 73-year-old Henry Kim, right, to death as he took a walk through an Indiana park on Saturday evening . 'Enjoy kill. Get back to safe site to clean up. Clean up, pack up. Get the hell out of Dodge.' In a second page of the notes, he wrote about burning all of the items he had used in the killing - apart from a 'trophy' that he intended to keep. The instructions also contain a list of supplies he needed for before, during and after the murder, including 'kill tools', bottled water and trash bags. His arrest came after a series of clues lead police to identify him as their suspect, records show. Over the weekend, after Kim was found dead, schoolmates contacted authorities to say that Winkler had been acting strangely, the Indianapolis Star reported. Haunting: Police allegedly found these sheets of instructions inside Winkler's wallet after they took him into custody. The instructions included things he would need for the killing and his plan of action . Plot: As well as the notes, police allegedly found a gun that matched with the murder weapon inside Winkler's home and bloody towels and gloves in his trash. Friends and teachers also said he was acting stranegly . Police went to his home on Sunday morning and, as they searched through trash outside the house, they came across dark gloves and a blood-stained towel, the documents show. On Monday, a teacher at his school, Hamilton Southeastern High, contacted police investigating the death of Mr Kim to say that boy had shaved and cut his hair over the weekend. A school resource officer also told authorities how, two years earlier, Winkler had written a letter titled 'My Bucket List', which included: 'Killing, mass destruction and weapons of mass destruction.' As police searched the area near the murder scene on Monday evening, they came across a bizarre camp made from sticks and tape that was littered with ammo, records show. While in the woods, Winkler approached them on his bike - which appeared to be the same kind described by witnesses near the crime scene - and police took him into custody. Taken into custody: Winkler is seen with police officers after he was found in a wooded area near the crime scene on Monday night. After they approached him, he said, unprompted: 'I didn't kill anyone' They also found two folding knives on him and one appeared to have dried blood on the edge, according to documents. As the teenager was taken into custody, he said, unprompted: 'I didn't kill anyone,' records show. Police later searched his mother and father's separate homes where they found the notes, ammo and a .22-caliber gun. The parents also handed over medication the boy had been taking. Ammo from a .22 had been found near Kim's body and also near the windows of a car that had been shot out on the night of the murder, police said. Kim's body was found in Windermere Park in Fishers at 7pm on Saturday by a dog walker. He had been shot three times - in the cheek, in the back and in the left upper arm - and also had a deep wound to the front of his neck, the Hamilton County Coroner's Office said, WISHTV reported. Wanted: Before his arrest, authorities had released images of a mountain bike owned by a person of interest in the case. When he was found in a wooded area on Monday, Winkler was on his bike, police said . Clues: The person on the bike, who was wearing a helmet like this one, was seen riding from the scene . His family said he was likely out on his daily walk when he was attacked, the IndyStar reported. A friend told WISHTV that Kim was recently diagnosed with diabetes so went on the walks to improve his health. After the killing, police released images of a Trek mountain bike and a BMX helmet believed to belong to a potential suspect. The man whose van windows had been shot at had called police with the description. The high school student was arrested around 5am on Tuesday and has now been charged with murder and is being held without bond. He will be charged with an adult in the case. Winkler is a student at Hamilton Southeastern High School, and detectives said he lives in the neighborhood near Windermere Park, the IndyChannel reported. Scene: Henry Kim's body was found by a dogwalker at Windermere Park (pictured) in Fishers on Saturday . Investigation: Police Sergeant Tom Weger said the victim and the suspect did not know each other . Kim was a married father who had lived in Fishers for more than 15 years. On Sunday, his son Steve, 43, wrote on Facebook: 'I lost my father last night... Feeling sad. He was found dead shot twice in the face in the park. He had no enemies.' The killing comes just four months after an 18-year-old was stabbed during a party - the first homicide in the area in nearly two decades, police said. Connor Shockley was killed on June 22 during a gathering in the Harrison Green area and an 18-year-old classmate was charged in his death. Winkler is next due in court on January 13 and a trial in scheduled for next April.","Maxwell Winkler has been arrested for the murder of Henry Kim, 73, who was shot three times and cut across the neck in a park on Saturday .

"Former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay has dropped his legal claim against the club after reaching a settlement on his sacking. Mackay was dismissed in December after a difference of opinion with owner Vincent Tan about the direction of the club. Sportsmail understands Mackay hasn't received any compensation and paid own legal fees, in addition to issuing apology. Tan has since criticised Mackay’s efforts in preparing the side for the Premier League, but the Scot issued a conciliatory statement through lawyers in which he apologised 'without reservation' to the Malaysian businessman. And it's over: Malky Mackay has dropped his legal claim against Cardiff City, who sacked him this season . And you're outta here! Vincent Tan wielded the axe and deemed Cardiff deserved better from their boss . Mackay’s statement, released through Slater & Gordon Lawyers, reads: 'Today I have reached a settlement agreement dropping all claims I have made against Cardiff City Football Club. I did not want to be in litigation and believe that it is in the best interests of all parties to have a clean break and move on.' Mackay is understood to be one of the names being considered by Norwich, West Ham and West Bromwich Albion should they change managers soon. The statement continued: 'I have enjoyed my time at Cardiff City and I am most grateful to the board of Cardiff City and Vincent Tan for giving me the opportunity. The club's owner Mr Vincent Tan invested heavily in the club and supported our decisions in our push for promotion to the Premier League. Without him this would not have been possible. 'My thanks to all those at the club and the fans who have supported me during my time in Wales. If I have caused any offence to anyone during this time, especially to Vincent Tan, then I apologise without reservation. 'I wish everyone associated with Cardiff City FC all the best for the future and thank them for their support. 'I will not be commenting further on this matter.' Former head of recruitment Iain Moody has also reached an agreement with the club and also said he wished to make a 'clean break'. In a statement, Moody said: 'I have today reached a final settlement agreement with Cardiff City Football Club and am very pleased that all parties will now be able to make a clean break and move on. Clean break: Iain Moody says he has reached a final settlement with Cardiff following his departure . 'Wherever mistakes were made during my time at the club, I wish to apologise for any part that I played in them, and for any offence I might have caused, particularly to Tan Sri Vincent Tan and all City fans. 'My two and a half years at the club were amongst the most enjoyable and stimulating of my career and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Tan and the club’s board for the support they showed me during that time. 'There is no doubt that Mr Tan’s significant investment in the club was decisive in our success of reaching the Premier League so my personal thanks are particularly directed to him. 'During our time living in Wales, the warmth and appreciation that my family and I received was truly special so I would also thank all City fans for making our memories of the place so fond. 'I wish you all the best for the future. I will be making no further comment.'

"There's nothing like sipping a glass of bubbly on board a flight to an exotic destination. However, while most economy passengers will enjoy a drink cramped in their seats, for those who turned left as they boarded, it's another story altogether. Many of the world's top airline's offer on-board bars, where, for a seat at a price, passengers can sit on comfy chairs at the bar or lazy on luxury sofas while having their favourite tipple delivered. The Emirates A380 Airbus' lounge is exclusive for business class passengers, and is stocked with fine wines and spirits, such as Woodford Reserve American Whiskey. There's even a dedicated bartender on board to whip up your favourite cocktail. Not to be outdone, the Qatar Airways A380 model boasts a spacious lounge and bar on its upper deck. Business and first class passengers can enjoy the fully-stocked bar, leather seating, and fresh flowers, all of which provide 'an escape from the typical airplane environment'. For Etihad's Diamond First Class passengers,  each suite is fully equipped with a personal mini-bar. However, should you prefer to socialise with the other guests, first and business class travellers will have access to The Lobby, an in-flight fully-serviced lounge. Korean Air's Celestial Bar is located at the rear of the plane's all-business class upper deck. Accessible for all business and first class customers, the bar is sponsored by Absolut Vodka and accordingly offers six signature cocktails, such as the Absolut Raspberry Delight and the Absolut Pear Deluxe. Virgin Atlantic offers on-board bars on all of its aircraft, which are exclusively for upper class passengers. The newest is in its A330 - it's fully separate from the cabin and is the longest bar in the sky. Nevertheless, all of its bars offer high-end spirits like Bombay Sapphire Gin and Grey Goose Vodka, as well as an extensive selection of red and white wine, Prosecco and snacks. Virgin Australia's Boeing 777 recently introduced one of the country's most luxurious domestic business class offerings, so it's no surprise that these aircraft also boast a top bar for both domestic and long-haul flights. Face-to-face service is offered for up to four seated guests, though additional lounge seating is located behind the bar. Fancy a drink? These airlines are offering some of the best bar service in the skies. Pictured: The Emirates Airbus A380 in-flight bar and lounge .

"As England slunk home from the 2010 World Cup, Wayne Rooney handed general manager Franco Baldini his No 10 shirt from the tournament. It was a touching gesture, thanking Baldini for his support in South Africa before Rooney’s world fell apart amid allegations about his personal life. This time, Rooney is taking steps to make sure that his World Cup experience in Brazil is considered a success. A week ahead of schedule, he boarded a plane bound for a holiday on the Algarve on Monday night with two Manchester United fitness coaches for company. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gerrard, Rooney and Co model England's World Cup kit . Preparations: Wayne Rooney spent his holidays in Las Vegas ahead of the Euro 2012 finals . Hard working: Rooney has enjoyed a strong season personally for United, despite the club's struggles . Rooney, who missed United’s last three Barclays Premier League fixtures with a groin injury, is paying for the two members of United’s staff to be with him. He means business. It is on the lush training pitches of the Vale do Lobo complex that Rooney’s preparations will begin. Next Monday, the rest of Roy Hodgson’s 23-man squad, plus Jon Flanagan and John Stones, will join Rooney in Portugal for the World Cup training camp. England’s manager said: ‘Wayne is so determined to be up and running when we get there on the 19th. He’s going there with two trainers. I don’t know who exactly but Tony Strudwick (United’s head of fitness) has been in touch wanting to know about the pitch. ‘Wayne’s attitude is that he’s desperate to be up and running on the 19th. I’m not as desperate, I’m thinking more of June 14, but it’s still quite laudable. ‘I’m not trying to dissuade him. If they’ve got houses out there, that’s where they go on their week off. They don’t all go to Dubai and Las Vegas.’ Ah, Vegas. Someone had to mention the gambling capital of the world and it was Hodgson who duly brought up Rooney’s preparations for his previous international tournament. Two years ago Rooney spent time at the craps tables of a prominent Las Vegas casino before he joined up with the England squad to prepare for Euro 2012. In the end, England were the biggest losers. Revealed: England manager Roy Hodgson (centre left) announced his World Cup squad on Monday . Time to shine: Rooney has endured a succession of injury-hit and frustrating tournaments with England . Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, Rooney is showing admirable maturity after missing United’s last three games. Had they been critical fixtures he could have played, but Ryan Giggs, United’s interim  manager, acknowledging the importance of this World Cup, gave him some time off. This is another chance for Rooney to prove he really is one of the best footballers in the world. The England forward  has yet to score at a World Cup — an incredible statistic given his standing in the game. The World Cup, which starts for England on June 14 against Italy in Manaus, could be 28-year-old Rooney’s last chance and he seems determined to take it. Hodgson said: ‘It’s up to Wayne if he wants to go away. I’m more than happy for the players to forget about football for a week and to get mentally prepared for the weeks ahead.’ The tournament may be a long slog for England’s players and Rooney, notoriously, has found it difficult to cope with extended periods away from his family home in Prestbury, Cheshire. The real deal: Wayne Rooney is instrumental to England's World Cup hopes . Fighting fit: Man United's head of fitness Tony Strudwick has been in contact with Hodgson . In 2006 he was sent off in the quarter-final against Portugal and four years later, under Fabio Capello in South Africa, he was in meltdown. After Rooney shouted his criticism of England’s travelling fans into a TV camera following a desperate 0-0 draw against Algeria, the team were taken apart by Germany and were heading for home. At full throttle Rooney is still England’s main threat, a player with immense pedigree after another decent scoring return during qualifying. He has been in good nick for United this season, netting 17 goals during a difficult year under the sacked David Moyes. ‘I hope he will join in with us straight away on the 19th,’ said Hodgson. ‘Let’s hope he can show the form that makes Wayne Rooney what he is.’ Fully fit, you can put your shirt on him. It's time: Rooney needs to perform at a World Cup after some lacklustre performances on the big stage .

"A Washington state high school teacher employed a 'Wheel of Misfortune' game to punish her students - and is going back to work. Kem Patteson instructed her Stevenson High School students to launch Koosh balls toward their peers in two different taped instances, KATU reported. 'I was chewing gum in class,' student Zoey Zapfe told the affiliate station of an incident caught on camera earlier this month. 'She looked over and she told me to spin the wheel and that's like a normal thing.' Scroll down for video . 'It was beyond humiliating': Koosh balls were reportedly thrown at Zoey Zapfe after she chewed gum in class . Punishment: Patteson employed this so-called 'Wheel of Misfortune' Zapfe also revealed how she was punished, when both her teacher and her classmates threw a ball at her in a 'cush firing squad,' KATU reported. 'I clearly said that I didn't want to do this, and after that I found out that you can opt out with a lunch detention and when I said I don't want to do this, she said ""Too bad"" or something and I got pelted,' Zapfe told the affiliate station. 'I'm gonna be honest, I'm hoping she gets fired because it was beyond humiliating,' Zapfe also said. Other students have spoken out and offered different opinions. 'I've gotten ""Kooshed"" a couple times but never in the face or anything,' Hannah Young told KGW. 'I kinda think they're overreacting a little bit. She probably shouldn't have done it, but I don't know if it's cause to fire her.' Marina Levy also told the station 'Everything on ""the wheel"" can be exchanged for a lunch detention so students are never forced to do anything. I don't think this is anything near what it's being made into.' Punishment: A Koosh ball is seen on the floor after the rubber toys were thrown at a student, whose identity has been protected . Teacher: Though chemistry teacher Kem Patteson was on administrative leave, she is not being fired . Though Zapfe's mother Wendy complained and Patteson was on administrative leave, she is not being fired, The Columbian reported. High school principal Sarah Marino and Superintendent Dan Read said in an October 16 letter to parents: 'As you may know, we’ve been working with a third-party investigator to review the details of a video that surfaced on social media last week.' 'The situation called to light an inappropriate classroom management technique used by a Stevenson High School teacher. It involved giving students the choice of spinning a ""Wheel of Misfortune"" for low-level misconduct rather than getting lunch detention.' 'The consequences on the wheel included allowing other students in the classroom to throw a soft rubber ""Koosh"" ball at the student. The videos circulating showed students throwing the ball at a student.' 'This is not a practice authorized or condoned by the District and it has been stopped. When the high school became aware of the details of how the controversial classroom management tool was being used, the prop was removed from the classroom. 'The teacher was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.' The letter also said that 'On Wednesday, October 15th, the results of the investigation were provided to us. After interviews with students, school staff and the teacher, the investigator recommended that the teacher be re-instated to the classroom with appropriate safeguards in place to ensure an appropriate classroom environment. 'The investigator concluded that the use of the wheel was inappropriate, but well-intentioned, and the teacher did not desire to embarrass, intimidate or harm any student.' 'However, poor judgment by any teacher is concerning and we plan to work with the teacher on more positive and productive classroom management skills going forward.'","Stevenson High School teacher Kem Patteson kept a 'Wheel of Misfortune' in the class room with different punishments listed .

"When Peter Hammond started breeding parrots at his home, he didn’t expect a squawk of protest from his neighbours. His rural property was a noisy pig farm until recently, and there are other farms in the area. But his hobby has split the village – with angry neighbours complaining of sleepless nights and stress. Now Mr Hammond’s critics appear to have won the battle to have the birds removed, after the local council ruled he had to rehome all of them within six months. Two exotic blue and yellow macaws which are similar to the parrots being bred at Peter Hammond's home . The 76-year-old insists he only has around 200 parrots, but neighbours have claimed he in fact keeps up to 500. Some villagers are overjoyed by the ruling, while others simply cannot understand what all the fuss is about. Sarah Griffiths, 47, who lives four doors away and has been leading the campaign against the exotic birds, said the decision was an ‘enormous relief’. ‘The parrots, some of them macaws, emit what can only be described as alarming, primeval squawks at random intervals, sometimes for several hours,’ she said. ‘Every member of my family and most of our neighbours have suffered directly because of Mr Hammond’s hobby. We have gone to work exhausted and I have sent my children to school tired.’ Neighbours said the noise sometimes begins as early as 5am. One claimed to have been so stressed by the racket that they took six months off work. But church pastor Graham Steward and his wife Gwen, who live opposite, said they were not bothered at all by the birds. Mr Hammond's home, from where hundreds of parrots will have to be rehomed following a council order . Left, a public notice shows Mr Hammond's application to change the use of his agricultural buildings in order to house the birds, while right, a barn on the property shows where they are kept . ‘When I wake up early in the morning the noise of the pigeons is more of a nuisance,’ said Mr Steward, who is in his 50s. ‘There were pigs in the outbuildings before the farmer who lived there retired. ‘I am quite happy for the parrots to remain. Sometimes when they are being fed they make a bit of a noise but they are certainly not a problem to us.’ Matters came to a head on Wednesday when Mid Suffolk District Council considered retrospective planning permission that Mr Hammond, a widowed former game farmer, was told to submit following complaints. His application to change the use of his agricultural buildings was turned down. Mr Hammond’s daughter, Angela Berry, attended the meeting and said her father had built a 10ft-high, 4ft-deep straw bale wall in 2013 to dampen the noise. But Chris Knock, Battisford Parish Council chairman, said members felt Mr Hammond had not gone through the proper procedures before acquiring so many parrots. He added: ‘It was not just a few birds. There were far more than someone would normally have as pets.'","Fed up residents say parrot breeder's squawking pets keep them awake .

"What is white and bulbous, has no leaves or roots, grows under the ground and blooms mysterious and spectacular pink flowers? It may sound like a riddle, but the answer is quite straight forward; a bizarre and extremely rare orchid that has  only been found at ten locations in New South Wales. The Eastern Underground Orchid – or Rhizanthella slateri- is one of three plants in the country that does not require chlorophyll to survive according to Greg Steenbeeke, a senior threatened species officer at the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. An Eastern Underground Orchid: The rare plant has no roots or leaves and grows underground . 'It differs from most orchids in having no chlorophyll. It can't produce its own sugars and is entirely reliant on a fungus that infects it to bring water and nutrients to it,' Mr Steenbeeke told Daily Mail Australia. 'The plant grows underground and the flower is presented at the surface of the soil amongst the litter.' The orchid is made of only a number of tubers – think tiny potatoes – under the ground, from which a white 15cm-long and 1.5cm-wide stem extends and produces a glistening flower that appears only just above the surface of the ground. 'The flower they produce is in a dense head, a bit like a Warratah but only as big as a 20 cent coin. The flowers themselves are a creamy white colour and translucent with purple spots within the flower,' Mr Steenbeeke said. The flower produced by the orchid is the size of a 20 cent coin and can only be found emerging at the surface of the soil . 'It existence is highly cryptic given that it grows almost completely below the soil surface, and therefore is usually located only when the soil is disturbed.' Samples of the plant, which is classified as 'vulnerable' due to the threat of its extinction in the long term, have been sent to Leiden in the Netherlands for genetic testing where a specialist will determine how it relates to other non-photosynthesising plants. 'This research is important because the orchid's habitat requirements are poorly understood and no particular vegetation type has been clearly associated with the species, although it is known to occur in some NSW forests and flowers September to November,' Mr Steenbeeke said. 'The plants have certainly been driven through their evolutionary history to adopt this method of living as a means of surviving. A plant producing no parts above the ground isn't going to be losing a lot of water because water is lost through leaves, so therefore it can be considered a way of saving water - but it's a pretty drastic way to save water.' Samples of  'vulnerable' classified plant have been sent to Leiden in the Netherlands for genetic testing, where a specialist will determine how it relates to other non-photosynthesising plants . There are currently another three other orchid species in Australia that do not require chlorophyll to grow, two of which are found in West Australia while the other two have only been found in the eastern states. 'They are distinguished either by where they occur or the shape and character of their flowers. This is the first one to be sent to the Netherlands, but one other of its species has had its DNA sampled as well,' Mr Steenbeeke said. While different underground orchid species have been found in other parts of the world, Mr Steenbeeke explained that 'while they are widespread, there are not a great many of them that have this life form'.","Eastern Underground Orchids have been found at only 10 locations in NSW .
They have no roots or leaves and their flowers can only just be seen at the surface of the soil .

"He could almost pass for Santa if he had more real teeth than tattoos, didn't chain-smoke and rode with reindeer instead of on a motor tricycle. To thousands of admirers he was the Kings Cross Santa Claus. And just like Santa's fabled North Pole workshop, this old biker's tiny inner-city home was packed year-round with Christmas gifts. For two decades, Randall 'Animal' Nelson spent part of every day in his sixth-floor public housing unit at Waterloo, in inner-city Sydney sorting, wrapping and packing presents for Sydney's sick and underprivileged until his death last month. One bedroom still sits half filled with carefully labelled boxes the bearded biker will not be able to deliver in person for the first time in 25 years. In the lounge room is his 'office' where Animal sat for hours preparing Christmas packages for hospital patients, local children and anyone who might otherwise go without a gift. Scroll down for video . Randall 'Animal' Nelson, the 'Kings Cross Santa' has died, leaving behind a stockpile of Christmas gifts for the sick and underprivileged. Biker Santa 'Animal' worked year-round in his tiny public housing unit preparing Christmas presents to give to hospital patients and inner-city children. Animal was a common sight riding around Sydney's inner-city on his trademark purple trike. 'He had his own little Santa's workshop here,' said 'Chips', the president of the Kings Cross Bikers Social and Welfare Club, which Animal co-founded in 1989. And from here Animal coordinated the club's annual Christmas gift run for patients and staff at Darlinghurst's St Vincent's Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospice. His death last month means the Kings Cross Santa's beloved biker brothers will have to make their first Christmas run without him on December 21, two days after Animal would have turned 76. Chips, who showed Daily Mail Australia around Animal's unit, said his mentor's Christmas cavern might look a little shabby like its former inhabitant but it was more cluttered than chaotic. 'He was extraordinarily organised,' he said. A place for everything and everything in its place:  Animal's own Santa's workshop was cluttered rather than chaotic. Delta Goodrem is one of many celebrities to appear in photographs with Animal on his lounge room wall. Randall 'Animal' Nelson's portrait reflected in the mirror of his bathroom mirror. Stacks of wrapping paper, bags of ribbons and carefully filed receipts surround Animal's desk. To the Kings Cross Bikers Social Club, with love. Pictures signed by Georgie Parker adorn Animal's lounge room walls. Presents sit waiting to be delivered in the first Kings Cross Bikers Christmas run that Animal will miss. Every gift box was carefully labelled by Animal in his own inner-city Santa's workshop. Donated gifts destined for hospital patients and local children half fill Animal's 'spare room'. On Animal's work bench are rolls of sticky tape, an ashtray and pink-handled scissors. Behind the desk is a printer and all around are neat stacks of wrapping paper, packets of ribbons and pinned-up detailed lists.  Every note he intended sending is signed 'Animal OAM'. And just like that other Santa, Animal received stacks of correspondence, all of which he kept. On every wall are hung letters of thanks, commendations from charities and photographs of Animal with celebrities including singer Delta Goodrem, actor Georgie Parker and newsreader Jessica Rowe. Pictures show the biker with former governor-general Michael Jeffery, parliamentary speaker Bronwyn Bishop and retiring NSW governor Marie Bashir. Former model and actor Kate Fischer was one of many celebrities to pose on the back of Animal's bike. Actor and television presenter Tania Zaetta is pictured with Animal in framed photographs on his wall. Dame Marie presented the former soldier and prison inmate with the Medal of the Order Australia for his community work a decade ago and often visited him in hospital in the months before his death. A spokeswoman for Dame Marie told Daily Mail Australia before her retirement on Wednesday that 'the Governor will be attending Animal's funeral on Saturday'. She will be one of those to speak. At Animal's OAM presentation ceremony at Government House in 2004, he shocked dignitaries by putting his arm around the governor and pecking her on the cheek. 'It's all right, I know her,' he told the other guests. Chips said Dame Marie and Animal subsequently often met at community events. 'Two people from two completely different worlds and they just hit it off,' he said. 'You could see it was a genuine friendship.' Retired governor Dame Marie Bashir presented Animal with a Medal of the Order Australia and regularly visited him in St Vincent's Hospital. Animal had an affinity with everyone he enountered, young and old. Animal's Kings Cross Bikers took flowers to patients at St Vincent's Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital every Valentine's Day . Actor and television presenter Toni Pearen (above) was grateful to Animal for his help raising funds for Sydney Children's Hospital . Singer Delta Goodrem appears in playful pictures on Animal's walls . Reverend Bill Crews, who first met Animal at least 30 years ago, had no idea how many mourners to expect at the Wayside Chapel in inner-city Kings Cross. 'Look, a lot of the people he touched, their lives are quite disparate and all over the place,' he said. 'If they can get their act together, they'll be there.' There will be drunks and junkies, prostitutes and politicians, and every other type of unorthodox misfit. 'It'll be an underclass version of a state funeral,' Rev Crews said. Animal's service at the Wayside Chapel on Saturday is set to be the Kings Cross version of a state funeral . Animal proudly wore his Order of Australia medal on his biker vest along with patches of the Salvation Army and Wayside Chapel . Actor David Wenham was one of countless celebrities to enjoy a ride on Animal's purple trike . Chips, who was with Animal when he died at the Sacred Heart Hospice on September 16, has followed Animal's instructions in organising the service. 'I haven't stopped in the last two weeks,' he said. A coffin painted with the Australian flag and draped with Animal's Kings Cross Bikers vest will arrive on a motorcycle side-car. Suzi Quatro's Devil Gate Drive will play during a slide show, followed by The Carnival Is Over by The Seekers. There will be a bagpiper at the Wayside Chapel and an army bugler at Eastern Suburbs Crematorium. The Kings Cross Bikers Social and Welfare Club was co-founded by Animal and fellow bikers Steptoe and Feral in 1989 . Animal was deeply proud of his National Service and held veterans close to his heart . Proud Australian: Animal requested he be cremated in a coffin painted with the national flag and Southern Cross . The Wayside's pastor Reverend Graham Long, who will conduct the service, said Animal had been as integral to Kings Cross as the suburb's famous El Alamein Fountain or the iconic neon Coca-Cola sign at the top of the red-light district's William Street. ‘Animal was one of the cornerstones of Kings Cross and was as much a part of the Cross as the Fountain,' Rev Long said. 'He could be seen - and heard - cruising around in his trike up and down the main strip. 'He had a knack of being there for people who were lost, elderly, homeless, addicted or down on their luck. ‘Animal could relate well to anyone and everyone. It's a bit like somebody took the Coke sign away. He will be sorely missed.' Randall Nelson, OAM, went nowhere without his Order of Australia Medal and would show it to anyone who asked . Christmas was always the most colourful time the year for Animal and his brothers in the Kings Cross Bikers club . Animal's biker vest will be draped over his coffin at his funeral in the Wayside Chapel on Saturday . The Motorcycle Council of NSW has donated $1000 towards the cost of the funeral. 'It's a tragic loss,' council spokesman Guy Stanford said. 'That guy did an enormous amount for some particularly unglamorous people.' Rev Crews said: 'I just want to go because I loved him'. 'Put it this way, people who have got nothing will give you everything. And he was one of those. He'd give you everything .The world is a poorer place because a bikie like Animal has died. If a wealthy banker died, so what?' The facts of Animal's early life are mysterious, even to his friends like Mr Stanford. 'He was a bit of an enigma in that sense,' he said. 'He gave nothing away. He let people reach their own assumptions by just judging him by what they saw. 'It's the old story that actions speak far louder than any words. And just by his actions alone you can judge him as a good man.' Rev Bill Crews said of Animal: 'You could see his childhood written in his face' Rev Crews believed Animal's early life 'wouldn't have been very good'. 'You could in a sense see his childhood written in his face,' he said. Animal described his childhood as 'shithouse'. It is generally agreed he spent years in state-run homes in Victoria and left school as young as 12 to work as a jackaroo. There might have been a serious horse-riding accident. He appears to ridden a motorcycle into Sydney in 1956. There was a stint in National Service and a couple of stints behind bars. Some media reports claim he has nine children. Close friends say they know of none. In 1989, along with fellow riders 'Steptoe' and 'Feral', he found the Kings Cross Bikers club. 'Our club charter is clear,' Animal once said. 'We look after the elderly, we visit the jails, we counsel the sick and addicted...and we make sure no one gives their family up.' Boxes of Christmas presents, already addressed to interstate recipients, await delivery in Animal's spare room . Artist Franco Totaro painted a portrait of Animal for the 2005 Archibald Prize . The front door of Animal's Waterloo unit shows exactly who is inside . Rev Long learnt not to ask Animal too much about himself. 'There are a lot of things about Animal you don't want to dig too deeply into,' he said. 'You don't know what you might find. 'Everything I've heard about his early life is disastrous. There is no redemption anywhere. There's a couple of things he's told me which I guess will go to my grave. 'You wouldn't expect something so beautiful and heroic to some from somewhere as ugly as that.' Animal's funeral will be held at the Wayside Chapel in Hughes Street, Kings Cross, at 11am on Saturday.","Biker 'Animal' delivered Christmas gifts to Sydney hospitals for 25 years .

"A husband has been jailed for life after strangling his wife in a 'cruel and merciless' attack because he wanted to 'shut her up'. Mark Dyson, 55, killed his wife Carole, who had cared for him for more than 25 years, before walking to a nearby hospital and confessing that 'something terrible' had happened. His constant moaning left both of them at the end of their tether and he eventually snapped when his wife refused to wait for him to get up when the couple were due to go out, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Mark Dyson, 55, killed his wife Carole, 53, because he wanted to 'shut her up'. Mrs Dyson, who had cared for her husband for more than 25 years, was murdered in a 'cruel and merciless' attack, a judge said . Judge Mr Justice Holroyde said the terror, pain and anguish suffered by Mrs Dyson, 53, during the attack was too 'terrible to contemplate' - and that she stood no chance against his 'murderous attack'. After killing his wife, Dyson walked to nearby Chorley Hospital and told staff 'something terrible' had happened. Admitting the murder to police officers, he said he had 'wanted to shut her up'. Mr Justice Holroyde said: 'You did so by cruel and merciless strangulation. 'You are bigger and heavier than her, she stood no chance of defending herself against your murderous attack, which was plainly intended to kill her.' Officers forced their way into the couple's home in Adlington,  Lancashire, on April 29 and found the lifeless body of Mrs Dyson lying on a bed.

The judge said it was estimated that Dyson applied pressure to her throat for 30 to 60 seconds or more. Dyson had suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the death of the couple's 15-year-old daughter, the court was told. He also had a rare condition which caused him to believe he was in constant pain. He said he had been in pain for some time and his wife had been 'nasty' to him. After the sentencing on Wednesday, Det Insp John Roy, of Lancashire Constabulary's Major Investigation Team, said: 'I welcome the fact that Mark Dyson has admitted the murder of his wife, which has at least spared the family the pain of a trial. 'This is a tragic case and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Carole Dyson.' At the time of the murder, neighbours in the quiet residential street where the couple lived expressed their shock at the death of Mrs Dyson. Audra Ashton, 47, who left flowers at their house, said: 'To me, she was a lovely woman, absolutely fantastic. 'She had pride in her house and was always out cleaning the windows and cleaning the door.' Dyson was given a life sentence and will serve at least 14 years before he is eligible to apply for parole.","Mark Dyson strangled his wife, Carole, because he wanted to 'shut her up'

Jonny May scored two tries for Gloucester who finished season in ninth . May and Rob Cook were sin binned for the visitors . Ryan Lamb landed a late penalty as relegated Worcester edged out Gloucester at Sixways to claim a second Premiership win of the season. Lamb weighed in with 18 points in total, claiming one of the Warriors' three tries and landing two conversions and three penalties. Freddie Burns' third and final penalty of the match edged Gloucester, who led 17-15 at the break, ahead but Lamb held his nerve to land the penalty that clinched victory for the home side. Matchwinner: Worcester Warriors' Ryan Lamb scored the winning penalty as they beat Gloucester 28-27 . England wing Jonny May scored two tries for the visitors but he and Rob Cook had spells in the sin bin which ultimately proved costly as Gloucester suffered a defeat that saw them drop to ninth place in the Premiership. Gloucester struck first when May burst clear inside his own 22 and went over for his first try of the afternoon and Shane Monahan quickly added a second try for the visitors to give them an early stranglehold on the match. Burns could not add the extras to either try and Lamb landed his first penalty to get the Warriors on the board at 3-10. Star man: Lamb scored 18 points as the relegated Warriors ended their Aviva Premiership season on a high . Sione Kalamafoni forced his way over for Gloucester's third try to put them firmly in command but Worcester responded quickly with a Semisi Taulava try from a lineout to give the home side renewed hope. May was sent to the sin bin with half-time looming when he played the ball on the ground after halting Alex Grove's break. The Warriors cashed in, Lamb capping off a slick move to cross under the posts before adding the extras. England Sevens wing Josh Drauniniu gathered a cross-field kick after the break to edge the Warriors ahead for the first time, with Lamb converting. Mixed afternoon: Gloucester wing Jonny May scored twice and was also sin binned at Sixways on Saturday . But May, back from the sinbin, finished off a speedy break to leave Burns a straightforward kick that edged Gloucester back in front. Cook was yellow-carded for killing the ball with just over 10 minutes remaining and Lamb landed the penalty to put Warriors one point ahead. Heavy hit: Shane Monahan (second left) also scored a try for the visitors who finish the season in ninth place . Burns responded to give Gloucester the advantage but when Lamb's final penalty chance game he took the chance to give the Warriors an encouraging end to a disappointing season.

"Authorities are preparing for possible race riots if a white police officer who shot dead a black teenager is not indicted on murder charges. A grand jury is expected to decide next month whether to bring criminal charges against police officer Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, 18, on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. Police officers in Missouri are meeting almost daily leading up to that decision to ready themselves for all possible scenarios, while also talking with other major police departments around the country. Scroll down for videos . Civil unrest: Police officers are preparing for riots in Missouri if police officer Darren Wilson (above) is not indicted by a grand jury for shooting and killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown . Tragedy: Brown (above) was unarmed when he was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9 . The FBI said it was also involved in the discussions. In differing accounts, police have said Brown struggled with . Wilson, 28, before the fatal shots were fired, but some witnesses say . Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot . multiple times in the head and chest. If charges are not brought against Wilson, police fear an . outbreak of violence not just in the St. Louis suburb of . Ferguson, but across the greater metropolitan area and even in . other U.S. cities, according to St. Louis County Police Chief . Jon Belmar and others involved in the planning meetings. James Knowles, the Ferguson mayor who has attended the . meetings, said the concern is that 'the unrest is going to be . far beyond the city of Ferguson.' Protesters and civil rights groups say Brown's death is part . of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number . of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers, . an allegation police deny. Nationwide riots: Protests, like the one above in Ferguson on October 4, could turn into riots around the nation and in major cities like L.A. and New York if Wilson is not indicted, officers believe . Missouri law enforcement officials have been in contact with . police chiefs in Los Angeles, New York, Florida  and other jurisdictions as they prepare for the grand jury . decision. Of the 227 people arrested between August 10 and September 9 in . connection with protests over Brown's death, 36 were from . outside Missouri, including seven from New York, 12 from . Illinois and five from California, according to arrest records . provided by the St. Louis county police. One focus of the meetings has been on how to respond in the . event of riots, the police chief said. Police faced a public . backlash when they initially deployed armored carriers and . carried military-style assault rifles after Brown's shooting. Representatives of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, St. Louis County Police, St. Louis city police and Ferguson police . have been attending the meetings, Belmar said. The top FBI . official in St. Louis, Agent William Woods, attended a strategy . meeting last week, said St. Louis FBI spokeswoman Rebecca Wu. It was announced last week . that the St. Louis County Police will take the lead from the . tiny Ferguson force in patrolling the city's streets. The contingency planning comes as black and white residents . of Ferguson brace for the grand jury decision. The nine white and three black jurors have heard evidence . from dozens of witnesses, including Wilson, who has been under . police protection at an undisclosed location since the shooting, . said Bob McCulloch, the chief St. Louis county prosecutor . overseeing the grand jury proceedings. Jail: Protesters can be seen above leaving a Missouri jail, where 227 people were arrested in connection with protesting Brown's death between August 10 and September 9 -  36 of whom were from outside the state . Many African Americans in Ferguson seem to have little faith . in the grand jury process and expect Wilson will not be charged. It is rare for a U.S. police officer to face criminal charges . after shooting a citizen in the line of duty. 'I do believe if Darren Wilson is not indicted you will see . a lot of carnage ... There is a lot of explosive energy,' said . Tef Poe, one of the protest leaders. At a rally held by Black Lawyers for Justice in a Ferguson . church last week, eight members of the New Black Panther Party, . a black political group, provided security. 'We are tired of dead bodies in our community,' Mauricelm-Lei Millere, an advisor to the New Black Panthers, . shouted at the audience. 'We are not going to take it anymore.'","Police fear that riots may break out in Missouri if officer Darren Wilson is not indicted for shooting and killing teenager Michael Brown .

"Former U.S. intelligence analyst Edward Snowden has accused the U.S. National Security Agency of routinely passing private, unedited communications of Americans to Israel, an expert on the intelligence agency said Wednesday. James Bamford, writing in the New York Times, said Snowden told him the intercepts included communications of Arab- and Palestinian-Americans whose relatives in Israel and the Palestinian territories could become targets based on the information. 'It's one of the biggest abuses we’ve seen,' Bamford quoted Snowden as saying. Former U.S. intelligence analyst Edward Snowden has accused the U.S. National Security Agency of routinely passing private, unedited communications of Americans to Israel . Snowden said the material was routinely transferred to Unit 8200, a secretive Israeli intelligence organization. Bamford cited a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart outlining transfers that have occurred since 2009. Leaked by Snowden and first reported by the British newspaper the Guardian, it said the material included 'unevaluated and unminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.' The memorandum indicates the data is routinely sent in raw form, without editing out names or other personally identifiable information, Bamford said. He noted allegations in Israel by veterans of Unit 8200, who in a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week accused the agency of using information it collects to politically persecute innocent Palestinians. Snowden said the material was routinely transferred to Unit 8200, a secretive Israeli intelligence organization . The data gathered by the unit included Palestinians’ sexual orientations, infidelities, money problems, family medical conditions and other private matters that could be used to coerce them into becoming collaborators, they said. Snowden, a former NSA contractor, is wanted by the United States on espionage charges after leaking a mass of secret NSA documents. The 31-year-old fugitive is in asylum in Russia, where he has been granted a three-year residency that allows him to travel abroad. Bamford, author several books on the supersecret NSA, which specializes in electronic espionage and codebreaking, interviewed Snowden over a three-week period in Moscow for Wired magazine.","Claims messages could make relatives of Americans in Israel and Palestine into targets .

"She made the life-changing decision to defect from the BBC to ITV earlier this year, to front new daytime show Good Morning Britain. But as Susanna Reid, 43, made her debut on the fledgling programme on Monday morning, viewers were quick to point out that the presenter's best assets were not being utilised by the show's bosses. Shortly after the programme premiered at 6am, Twitter was awash with comments from critics who complained that Susanna's trim legs were being hidden because she spent the majority of the time sitting behind a desk with her co-hosts. Scroll down for video . 'It's like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage!' Good Morning Britain viewers were quick to complain that Susanna Reid's legs couldn't be seen behind the desk as the show premiered on Monday morning . Complaints: Viewers didn't hold back with their criticism of the format . Do you think Good Morning Britain is better than Daybreak? One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.' In fact, it was reported recently that Susanna is earning a staggering £400,000 for her new role on Good Morning Britain, which sees her host alongside Ben . Shephard, 39, Charlotte Hawkins, 28 and Sean Fletcher, 30. But the overwhelming opinion of viewers seemed to be that the desk was ruining their view, with another writing: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.' New format: Another sticking point for viewers was that the show is largely too Americanised in its format . Line-up: The four presenters kicked off the show from behind the desk, before moving around the studio later in the programme . Spot the difference: The studio and the layout is incredibly similar to that of Good Morning America . Other comments included: 'How to loose viewers from the off put @susannareid100 behind a desk. She was popular for a reason. #GoodMorningBritain.' Another read: 'ITV's . new breakfast show has no chance! Sticking Susanna Reid behind a desk . ruins her appeal to half the viewership, lol! Epic fail ITV!' Later on the show, however, Susanna moved from behind the desk, giving viewers the chance to catch a glimpse of her enviable pins. The big reveal: Susanna later moved and showed off her legs in her knee-length dress . Much better! Susanna later got her legs out as she and Ben interviewed Paul O'Grady . Standing out: Susanna wore an eye-catching dress for her debut on the show . Speaking recently about the now infamous desk, and the new set of the show, Susanna said: 'Our set . is different, fresh and it's not what people have been used to over the . last couple of years in breakfast television. 'It is something new and exciting for us. We all start behind the desk, which hasn't happened for a while.' The lack of legs on show wasn't the only thing viewers complained about, as many argued that the new format was more American in style - similar to Stateside shows such as Good Morning America. Back for more: Old favourites including celebrity correspondent Ross King were back for the new show . One viewer commented: 'Good morning Britain is too formal and newsy and like an American morning show. #GMB.' While another added: 'Well, Good Morning . Britain looks very American so far...suited team behind desks, tickers, . huge pic takes up half screen.' However, not all reactions to the show were negative, as one viewer wrote: 'Totally loving #GMB #GoodMorningBritain.' New faces: Susanna and Ben are the main two hosts of the show . Completing the crew: Charlotte Hawkins, 28 and Sean Fletcher, 30, complete the quartet . And another commented on the amount of . attractive female presenters on the show, tweeting: '#GoodMorningBritain . Susanna Reid, Charlotte Hawkins & Laura Tobin on the same channel! I'm in heaven!' Even Sky News presenter Kay Burley commented on the format, admitting the hectic atmosphere of the show was too much for her to handle. She tweeted: 'Just watching Good Morning Britain ... there's so much going on I need a little lie down.' As it was: Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly on Daybreak, before it was reinvented as Good Morning Britain . Starting out: The set looked vastly different and much more sombre when Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley hosted it . The Radio Times commented . that Susanna had appeared nervous for the first part of the show, . before getting into her stride as the programme progressed. Paul Jones commented: 'In . her central role behind the desk, Susanna initially seems the most . nervous of the foursome – “somebody’s put some extra words in my head… . look at me all discombobulated” – quite possibly because she knows all . eyes are on her as ITV’s marquee signing.' Jones . also commented on the American feel of the programme, with 'the screen . seeming very cluttered with garish idents and info graphics'. It was confirmed over the weekend that after a two-week settling in period, Susanna will only work from Mondays to Thursdays, with ex Daybreak star Ranvir Singh standing in for her on Fridays. Early arrival: Susanna was without make-up as she arrived for her first day on the show clutching her laptop and the day's papers . Kicking things off: Susanna is reportedly being paid a staggering £400,000 for her role on the show .

"A multimillionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur who fatally poisoned her eight-year-old autistic son in their luxury Manhattan hotel room has said her only regret is not taking her own life as well. Gigi Jordan, 53, spoke to Dr. Phil in an exclusive interview from Rikers Island, New York, where she is jailed while on trial for the killing of her son Jude Mirra in 2010. In the interview, which will air in full on Friday, Dr. Phil asked her if she has any regrets and she said simply: 'I would have done a better job of ending my own life.' Jordan stands accused of force-feeding her son a deadly cocktail of pills in February as they stayed the Peninsula on Fifth Avenue. She then made an unsuccessful attempt to take her own life.

She has since claimed that she feared that her ex-husband would kill her after she learned he'd allegedly stolen millions from her. She feared that, if she was murdered, her son would be taken in by his father, whom she accused of molesting the boy. As a result, death seemed to be the only option, she told Dr Phil. 'To run would only make me more vulnerable,' she said. 'I felt completely incapable of protecting him. Whether that was rational or not, I can't say, but I don't think I'm a cold blooded murderer.'

Straight talking: When Dr Phil asked Jordan if she regretted anything, she said not taking her own life . Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn Manhattan hotel room in  2010. Jordan, who had also taken pills, was found on the floor nearby. She claims she tried to revive her son. Prosecutors claim she climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open - so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest - and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe. Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, they said. She also wrote a suicide note.

She claims some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him. Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime. Even though the second grader was unable to speak, Jordan has claimed it was her son who suggested they took their lives - by typing messages on her phone. She claims he  urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully. 'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.' The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, she said. Killed: Jude, right, was found dead inside the ill-strewn room at the Peninsula hotel in Manhattan in 2010 . Tragic: A gurney carrying Jude's body is wheeled to van outside the Peninsula Hotel on February 5, 2010 . Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm. Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days. Jordan faces between five and 25 years in prison if she is found guilty of manslaughter and could get 25 years to life behind bars if she is convicted of murder.","Gigi Jordan, 53, is currently on trial in New York for killing her son, Jude Mirra, in their Manhattan hotel room in February 2010 .

"Manchester United interim boss Ryan Giggs has confirmed that Phil Jones and Wayne Rooney will both be fit for the World Cup. There were fears that Jones would be ruled out of England’s squad for Brazil after he damaged his left shoulder in Tuesday’s win over Hull at Old Trafford and was taken to hospital. The problem has since been diagnosed as heavy bruising and possible ligament damage. Rooney, meanwhile, has missed the last two games with a groin strain and is unlikely to play in Sunday’s final Barclays Premier League game of the season at Southampton. Agony: Phil Jones looks in real pain after landing awkwardly on Tuesday night . High hopes: Jones challenges Hull's Maynor Figueroa before going down injured . Concerns were growing that the injury might be worse than first thought, but Giggs revealed that Rooney returned to training on Thursday. He said: 'Phil’s injury isn’t as bad as I thought on the night. He’s obviously out for Sunday but should be OK for the World Cup. ‘Wayne has just started training over the last couple of days. Sunday probably will be a little be a bit too quick for him but he’ll train and be fine for the World Cup also.’ The trip to St Mary’s will be Giggs’s last game in temporary charge as United prepare to appoint Louis van Gaal next week. Giggs is still undecided over his future at Old Trafford, either as a player or possibly part of Van Gaal’s backroom team, but admits that confirmation of the appointment will allow United to begin a new chapter after a disappointing season. Asked if he was looking forward to it, he replied: ‘Everyone is. It’s been a difficult season for us and when the management situation gets sorted out then we can move on and that will probably be in the next couple of weeks. Crocked: Wayne Rooney is likely to miss the final game of the season but will be fit for the World Cup . ‘There’s huge speculation but nothing has been announced yet and my job is to prepare the team for Southampton so that’s what I’ll do. I’m sure there’ll be an announcement soon and maybe I can comment then but at the moment it’s just speculation so there’s not a lot I can say.’ United need to win at Southampton and rely on Tottenham losing at home to Aston Villa to clinch sixth place and qualification for the Europa League. Giggs admits that his brief spell in charge has whetted the appetite to go into management when he hangs up his boots. ‘There’s not really a lot of pressure on me at the moment,’ he added. ‘It was four games and we couldn’t really win anything. We could only qualify for the Europa League and we’ll carry on trying to do that. ‘You get a little taste of the pressure you’re put under regarding picking teams and wanting to do your best, so you get a little taste of it. Cameo: Ryan Giggs brought himself on as a substitute in the 3-1 win over Hull . ‘Sometimes you probably think, “I can do without it” and other times it gives you so much pleasure. After the game on Saturday (the 1-0 defeat by Sunderland) you’d do without it, but you learn more from defeats and not doing so well, just like when you’re a player. ‘But I’ve enjoyed it. I’ve enjoyed the whole experience and it’s definitely helped me prepare for what will come after my playing career. ‘It’s not a lot different from a player really, the satisfaction you get from winning and the pleasure you get from setting a team up and they go out and do their stuff. ‘When you lose a game you’re gutted, angry and disappointed. But then, just like a player, you can’t wait for the next game to come so you can do something about it. ‘It goes in waves where one minute you’re enjoying it one minute you’re not but ultimately it gives you a lot of satisfaction when it goes right.’ Farewell? Giggs may well have played his last game for Manchester United . Having given senior debuts to James Wilson and Tom Lawrence against Hull in midweek, Giggs has supported plans for a new division for Premier League ‘B’ teams to give young English players more opportunities. ‘I would support it,’ he said. ‘Only speaking from my experience, I remember playing at Old Trafford for the reserves when I was maybe 15 or 16 against Everton at two o’clock on a Saturday afternoon. I was playing against men and it helped me. Physically and mentally it brought me on. ‘That experience that young players will get rather than playing against players of their own age prepares you for what is the fastest quickest, strongest league in the world. I can only speak from my own experience and it definitely helped me.’ Dutch of class: Louis van Gaal is expected to be announced as United's new manager next week .","Phil Jones will be able to play a part for England in Brazil, if selected .

"The man wanted on murder charges over the fatal poisoning of Vladimir Putin foe Alexander Litvinenko in London is seeking to turn American whistleblower Edward Snowden into a Russian TV presenter. Andrey Lugovoy, a former secret services operative who is now a leading Moscow MP, is accused of spiking the emigre dissident's tea with radioactive polonium-210. Putin refused to extradite him and he is now to front a television show about intelligence and spy agencies. Scroll down for video . U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden and his American girlfriend at a Moscow theatre . He has invited former National Security Agency contractor Snowden - who is hiding in Moscow after revealing America's eavesdropping secrets to the world - to co-host the show. 'We have sent an invitation to Snowden,' said Andrei Svintsov, a Lugovoy associate. 'We hope his experience and knowledge will help our audience to learn all nuances in the sphere of secret service and interaction between our security services.' The LDPR TV channel is run by Lugovoy's ultranationalist political party, which backs Putin. Both Snowden and Lugovoy are on international wanted lists and face arrest travelling to any Western country. Andrey Lugovoy, a former secret services operative who is now a leading Moscow MP, wants to turn American whistleblower Edward Snowden into a Russian TV presenter . Snowden fled the United States in June 2013, after leaking information concerning the extensive electronic surveillance programmes conducted by the US government around the globe. These includes spying on American citizens and foreign leaders. The revelations sparked domestic controversy and strained relations between the Washington and its partners worldwide. Snowden - who faces up to 30 years in jail in the US - received temporary asylum in Russia in 2013. Later he was granted a residence permit until 2017. He lives with his US girlfriend under tight security in the Russian capital. Litvinenko died in 2006 after being poisoned. A British demand for Lugovoy's extradition in 2007 was rejected by Moscow. Snowden has not yet reacted to the proposal.","Andrey Lugovoy is accused of poisoning Alexander Litvinenko in London .

"Andy Murray crashed out of the Mutua Madrid Open at the third-round stage on Thursday as he suffered a straight-sets defeat to Colombia's Santiago Giraldo. Murray produced a disappointing display which saw his opponent, ranked 38 places below him at 46th in the world, rarely troubled en route to a 6-3, 6-2 victory and a quarter-final meeting with Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut. The Wimbledon champion's below-par showing comes as a considerable surprise the day after he had made a decent start to his clay-court season by seeing off Nicolas Almagro, another local favourite, in round two. Exit: Andy Murray suffered a straight-sets defeat to Santiago Giraldo in the third round in Madrid . Jumping for joy: Santiago Giraldo celebrates his straight-sets victory over Murray in Madrid . In that contest, Murray, playing his first match in a month, had battled to a 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 triumph over a player known to be particularly dangerous on clay. But there was little fight exhibited by the Scot on Thursday in an encounter Giraldo took control of from the off. In an effort to explain an erratic performance in which he showed little fight, Murray spoke of his split from coach Ivan Lendl and his ‘inconsistent’ play. ‘My coach is missing. That’s a big part of my team,’ said Murray. ‘I didn’t envisage a finish like that. I need to sit down and think about that the next couple of days and see what I need to do.’ Having served to take a 1-0 lead, Giraldo swiftly extended his lead by breaking Murray at the first opportunity and then holding in the third game. Down and out: Murray appeared flat as he suffered defeat to an opponent ranked 38 places below him . Clay-court fan: Giraldo has been in impressive form on the red stuff so far this year . Murray got a game on the board for 3-1 but struggled to exert any real pressure on Giraldo as the rest of the set played out. It did not take long for Giraldo to then break Murray again in the second, doing so in the third game to make it 2-1. And he repeated the trick another time to move 5-2 ahead before serving out the match to continue his impressive run of form on clay this year, having reached the final in Barcelona last month. Murray will be hoping for an improvement in next week's ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in Rome, which will be his last event before the French Open begins on May 25.

"David Cameron has been pictured smiling for the cameras alongside Morris dancers with blacked-up faces. The Prime Minister happily posed for photographers with his daughter Florence at the Banbury Folk Festival. The picture is likely to prove controversial, with the tradition of having blacked-up faces branded racist in the past. David Cameron holds his daughter Florence as he poses for photographs with Morris Dancers . Mr Cameron and his family attended the annual event on Saturday. Martin de Vine, founder and Squire of the Foxs Morris dancers, said it had been a 'wonderful weekend of dancing'. Writing on the Fox Morris Facebook page, he said: 'Lovely dance spots with welcome refreshments provided. And a great concert on Friday. 'Some bloke who lives in Downing Street joined us on Saturday, and Chris Leslie (Fairport Convention) stopped for a few words on Sunday.' Referring to Mr Cameron's appearance at the event, Mr de Vine added: 'His politics are not my politics but happy for Banbury Folk Festival to gain some publicity to ensure its future...although it might have the opposite effect!' Mr Cameron is in Portsmouth today, meeting students at the Ark Charter Academy to promote a new crackdown on education standards . The group insists the tradition is not racist. They stress that it stretches back five centuries and refers to when unemployed farm labourers would cover their faces in soot while begging for money to avoid being recognised. Mr de Vine told the Telegraph: 'It's not racist and offence is never taken. People from other cultural backgrounds don't see it as that at all. We have had an Arab person dancing with us in the past - it's not seen as racist.' The Foxs Morris was started in 1999 and is based at Cookley School in Worcestershire, where Mr De Vine is headteacher. A Downing Street source reiterated the explanation from the group about the origins of the blacking-up tradition. 'The organisation itself says it's nothing to do with racism,' the source added. Earlier this year an ale featuring Morris dancers with blacked-up faces was rejected by a bar in the Houses of Parliament because the pump badge was deemed to be offensive. Tory MP Jake Berry had nominated a beer from the Irwell Works Brewery intended to celebrate the Britannia Coconut Dancers from nearby Bacup, who have been performing since 1857 with blacked faces to celebrate the area's mining heritage. But a spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence.' Heritage: A 'Nutter',  part of the history of the small Pennine town of Bacup . The Foxs Morris group insists the tradition is not racist. They say they are reviving a tradition associated with Border Morris dancing, in which Welsh Morris dancers on the English border used fire-blackened cork to disguise themselves when they went begging in the streets more than five centuries ago. When money was scarce in the winter months they would dance but have to disguise themselves. It was necessary to use a disguise to avoid arrest for begging. Each dancer also makes his or her own tattercoat which is made from rags. This reflects the origins of border morris dancing in poor rural communities who had to make good use of every resource . The Britannia Coconut Dancers, known as the 'Nutters', are part of the history of the small Pennine town of Bacup. Every Easter Saturday the troupe of men - dressed in red and white kilts and clogs, with their faces blackened - take to the streets of the town to dance their way from one side to the other. They perform folk dances, which are said to have originated with Moorish pirates. The custom of blackened faces, reflects, according to their website, a 'pagan or medieval background' to 'disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits'. It is also thought to link to the town's mining heritage. In April Will Straw, son of the former Labour Cabinet minister Jack, defended posting a photograph on Twitter celebrating an Easter tradition with Morris dancers with blacked-up faces - claiming his critics were ignorant about history. Mr Straw, who has been selected by Labour to fight one of the party's top target seats at next year's general election, uploaded the tweet after meeting The Britannia Coconutters on Saturday. The 32-year-old responded to the outcry - some have branded the tradition 'racist' - defending the historic performances as a vital piece of local cultural history.","Prime Minister joined group to pose for photographs on Saturday .

Low did a similar thing before the 2010 edition in South Africa when he announced Germany's youngest World Cup squad in 76 years and they went on to finish third in the tournament. He has also included Real Madrid midfielder Khedira, now ready to return after tearing cruciate knee ligaments last year, but dropped forward Mario Gomez, who missed most of the season at Fiorentina with injury.

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game including the move for Everton's opening goal scored by James McCarthy. The clamour for Ross Barkley's inclusion in England's World Cup squad has been aimed mainly at Roy Hodgson, but it would appear Roberto Martinez has heeded it as well. As a native of Catalonia, the Everton manager could be forgiven if his international loyalties lay with Spain, rather than England. But he showed a commendable regard for his adopted country's prospects in Brazil this summer by omitting Barkley and John Stones from Everton's final Barclays Premier League game of the season to ensure they would be fit for international duty. It could yet be the Under 21 tournament in Toulon, but Barkley, in particular, must have high hopes of a senior call-up when Hodgson names his 23-man squad for the World Cup at 2pm on Monday. Stones, too, could be a surprise selection, given injury concerns over Phil Jones and Kyle Walker. Lashed home: James McCarthy (second left) gave Everton the lead in their 2-0 win at Hull on Sunday .

'These . two boys have played a lot of football recently and needed a rest. It . was in the interests of their health, but it is also the case that, as a . club, we are happy to produce as much English talent as we can. 'That . was one of the reasons we had to look after them. We made sure they . didn't go into the summer with the risk of injury. 'They . are going to be busy, one way or the other. 'I honestly have no idea . whether it will be with the seniors or Under 21s, but, either way, we . will be very proud to see Everton players pulling on the England jersey. 'Any . manager you ask in the Premier League will be biased and say their . players should be in the national team, but I am not going to go down . that route. 'I trust Roy Hodgson's vision, I am a big admirer of his . experience, and whatever he does will be part of a plan.'

'In any loan deal, all you want is for it to be a success, and Romelu has been,' he said. 'I’ve seen him grow as a man and player, and I think he’s developed unique memories with Everton. The fans will always have a great mental picture of Lukaku’s talent. 'I think the parent club will delighted with the progress he has made this season, and we’ve benefitted from having him. It couldn't have gone much better. 'It is a real achievement for Hull to reach the final, and it is in their favour that they go there as underdogs. They found it difficult in the semi-final because they were favourites, but it is the opposite this time. If they can control their emotions and be themselves, they can really embrace what will be a fantastic opportunity to spring a surprise.'","Roberto Martinez's Everton end the Premier League in fifth .

"The owner of a travel agent whose cringeworthy promo video went viral has said she has had to cancel her annual leave due to a huge rise in demand. Shona Thorne, manager of Scottish firm Thorne Travel, which has seen nearly 700,000 people view its cheesy online advert, said she has seen a 110 per cent increase in bookings. Thorne, Kilwinning, North Ayrshire, said demand has been worldwide - including from across the UK and the US - since the video, dubbed 'so bad it's good', was published. Scroll down for video . The video features staff at the travel agent, pictured  turning their customer's dreams into reality . One of the stars of the video says the girls from Scotland are 'like Virgin Airways girls, only a bit more real' The clip features staff strutting along the high street in tight-fitting dresses to a pumping club soundtrack, granting holiday wishes to locals with startling special effects. Ms Thorne said the stars of the video looked 'like the Virgin Airways girls, only a bit bigger, with a bit more attitude, and a bit more real'. After the success of the video, Ms Thorne told Mail Online; 'Bookings have increased by 110 per cent and I am not sure at this early stage if this is due a coincidence or due to the advert. 'We have had customers and people from the town popping in with flowers, cards and gifts saying how amazed they are with all the publicity our little town has got. 'We are so amazed that we are in Australian and New Zealand papers and [we have had] e-mails from people all over the world saying that they love the video; this shows travel agencies have definitely changed and moved with the times. 'I’m meant to be on holiday and I had to come into the shop today because we were so busy.' Bookings are not believed to be constrained to Scottish holidaymakers, with people from London and even the US using the firm. The promotional film shows members of staff strutting confidently down the high street in Kilwinning . In the video, the bevy of travel agents turn heads as they march through town in their pink frocks, hand on hips, twirling in slow-mo and clicking their fingers in a flurry of stardust. Ms Thorne told MailOnline Travel: 'With our pink uniforms, we look a bit like the Virgin Airways girls, only a bit bigger, with a bit more attitude, and a bit more real.' When planning the promotional video, Shona says they didn't want to use 'polished, size-six actresses'. 'It's a bit of a laugh,' she adds. 'It's supposed to be tongue in cheek.' The advert, which features street dancers, amateurish special effects and a cruise ship 'captain' in an ill-fitting uniform went viral online after receiving an endorsement from Fr Ted creator Graham Linehan. Thousands of users watched the video yesterday afternoon after Father Ted and The IT Crowd creator Graham Linehan tweeted the link, saying: 'After a year of Ebola, UKIP, gamergate and worse, WE HAVE FOUND OUR UNICORN CHASER'. One of the highlights of the video is the scene where a couple meet a cruise captain in ill-fitting uniform . Within hours, it had been viewed almost 40,000 times on YouTube, and shared countless times on Facebook and Twitter, with one fan writing: 'All it's missing is Alan Partridge'. The video features staff flouncing down the high street in Kilwinning against a soundtrack by Swedish House Mafia. Various scenes show the travel agent employees transforming black and white scenes into colour. In one toe-curling scene a bearded man appears as a cruise ship captain in a uniform three times too big for him and approaches an elderly couple looking though a brochure. Christina Haywood, 20, assistant manager at the travel agency, said: 'We wanted to show our customers that we're quirky and like to have a laugh. So, we decided to make a video to show what we're all about. Fr Ted creator Graham Linehan is a big fan of the three-minute promotional advertisement . During the three-minute long video, with loud house music backing track, customers are helped by the team . 'We are a travel agency that is different to everyone else. We do everything from bus trips to Blackpool to luxury holidays at the other end of the world. We just wanted to spread the word. 'Filming the video brilliant and a good laugh, but we didn't expect what was going to happen. 'We expected a few people to watch it but it's gone viral. It's been great. 'People have been sharing it across social media and we've even had comments from Australia.' The promotional clip has proven exceptionally popular on social media. This would-be bride was whisked away and shown the options for the honeymoon of her dreams . Fr Ted creator Graham Linehan praised the Thorne Travel team for their efforts in a time of constant bad news . Thorne Travel said their video has been extremely popular with comments coming from as far as Australia .

"Dundee United confirm they rejected Blackpool's approach to talk to McNamara . McNamara insists he is happy managing the Tannadice club . Blackpool are in the search for a new manager after Barry Ferguson rules himself out . Dundee Utd have kicked out an approach from Blackpool for their manager Jackie McNamara. The English Championship strugglers only escaped relegation on the last day of the season after Barry Ferguson’s uninspiring spell in caretaker charge of the club. The former Rangers skipper this week all but ruled himself out of the running to get the job on a permanent basis and yesterday Blackpool turned their sights on the highly-rated McNamara. Making his point: Jackie McNamara expressed his deire to stay at Dundee United despite Blackpool's interest . United moved quickly to reject their advances and a club statement read: ‘Dundee United confirms it has denied Blackpool FC permission to speak to Manager Jackie McNamara. ‘The manager has been kept aware of the situation and declared that he is fully committed to the Club and very happy to remain at Dundee United for the foreseeable future. The Club will make no further comment on this matter.’ Insisting he is happy where he is, McNamara added: ‘While flattered at the interest shown, I am very happy at Dundee United and wish to continue the job and build upon the foundations laid down over the last 18 months or so. ‘I view the approach as a positive endorsement of all the hard work undertaken by everyone at the Club in that period and have no plans to leave. Feeling the strain: Barry Ferguson has all but ruled himself out of the Blackpool job after a poor season . ‘All of my focus is on the forthcoming William Hill Scottish Cup final and preparations for the new season ahead.’ McNamara replaced Peter Houston at Tannadice 18 months ago after leaving Partick Thistle. He is widely credited with developing youngsters such as Ryan Gauld, John Souttar, Stuart Armstrong and Andrew Robertson and is seen as one of the country’s most promising managerial talents. Indeed Tannadice defender Mark Wilson expressed surprise yesterday that McNamara had failed to feature prominently on manager of the year shortlists. Promoting Thursday’s TSB under-18s Senior Shield final at New Douglas Park between St Ambrose High School of Coatbridge and Springburn Academy, Wilson said: ‘I was surprised he wasn’t nominated for Manager of the Year. I think they name it a bit too soon. He has come in to United at a time when it was a real test for him. ‘The wage bill had been cut and he had a lot of players to shift. He gave a lot of young players their chance. Maybe other managers would have put them in for one or two games, then brought them back out, but he had the confidence to stick with them. ‘The football Jackie encourages United to play has been a breath of fresh air for Scottish football. It is fitting for him to be in the cup final this season, especially going back to Celtic Park. He truly deserves it.’ Young gun: McNamara has been credited with developing the talents of Ryan Gauld (left) at Tannadice . Sportsmail has learned that Armstrong and Robertson were watched once again by Everton in Tuesday’s 3-1 defeat to Aberdeen. And Wilson fears the forthcoming final could be a United swansong for some of his young team-mates. ‘Of course it would be good for our young boys to stay at Dundee United. But it can be really difficult for clubs to knock back serious offers,’ he said. ‘As soon as a big offer comes in it’s hard for chairmen to knock it back and say they want to keep their best young players for at least another year. Omission: Mark Wilson (centre) is surprised McNamara wasn't nominated for the Manager of the Year award . ‘From a chairman’s perspective, who’s to say these boys aren’t a flash in the pan, that they go off the boil and they are out of the team the following year? ‘So it’s a touchy subject. ‘It would be good for them to stay for their teams, the leagues and their education. ‘But it’s very difficult when money gets offered and contracts get put in front of young guys that are three or four times their wages. It’s hard to knock back.’","Dundee United confirm they rejected Blackpool's approach to talk to McNamara .

"A Federal Aviation Administration advisory panel is expected this week to recommend a significant rollback of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by airplane passengers during takeoff and landings. 'As the consumer electronics industry has exploded,' the current rules have 'become untenable,' according to a draft version of the new proposals. Under the new recommendations passengers can expect to be allowed to use their devices in 'Airplane Mode' to read e-books, listen to music and watch videos. A relaxing of F.A.A. rules means passengers could soon be allowed to read e-books during takeoffs and landings but the ban on making phone calls will remain . But the current ban will remain in place for things that require a data connection, such as making phone calls, sending and receiving e-mails and texts or using Wi-Fi, reports the New York Times. The panel will recommend its new policy to the F.A.A. by the end of the month and it is expected to come into effect next year. Existing regulations that require a blanket ban on the use of all electronics during takeoff and landings have become increasingly unworkable due to the large numbers of people now carrying such devices. Many passengers either forget to turn off their devices or ignore calls from flight attendants to power down. The current rules regarding the use of electronic devices during takeoffs and landings have 'become untenable' due to the dramatic increase in the number of people using them . Regulators have never been able to establish conclusively that electronic devices can cause the malfunction of cockpit instruments and any evidence of a link is largely anecdotal. Many airlines have already expanded their own use of wireless systems on board, offering live television and Wi-Fi once the plane is above 10,000 feet. Some are understood to be considering proposals to stream content – such as movies - directly to passengers’ own devices. The F.A.A. advisory panel was supposed to report back in July, but requested an extension until the end of September due to the complexities involved. They want to present a single policy from ‘gate to gate’ that would apply to all airlines, and all types of airplanes. ‘We have to make sure the planes can handle this,’ Douglas Kidd, the head of the National Association of Airline Passengers and a member of the advisory committee told the New York Times. A change in F.A.A. regulations means passengers can expect to be allowed to read e-books, listen to podcasts and watch videos during takeoffs and landings from next year . ‘There’s a lot of pressure on the F.A.A. because passengers are very attached to their devices.’ The review does not included mobile voice communications, which are prohibited by the telecommunications regulators at the Federal Communications Commission because they interfere with transmissions between cell towers on the ground. More than two billion portable electronic devices will be sold this year, according to the research firm Gartner. Air travelers own a disproportionately large share of these devices, particularly smartphones and tablets, whose use is growing at the fastest rate. Shipments are expected to more than double by next year compared with 2012, to 276 million units.","Advisory panel meets this week to determine what changes to make to existing regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on planes .

"Hundreds of Australian troops could be on the ground in Iraq as soon as Tuesday as the Federal Government moves to snuff the growing threat of terror group Islamic State. It comes after a fleet of six super hornet fighter jets made their way to the Middle East for non-combat reconnaissance and intelligence operations. A source within the Department of Defence said there could be as many as 200 soldiers on the ground within days,The Daily Telegraph reported. Approval for personnel to start training the local army to defend themselves against Islamic State is expected to be given by the end of the week. Defence Minister David Johnston (left, pictured with Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin and Prime Minister Tony Abbott ) has warned a long campaign lay ahead for Australian troops in Iraq . Authorities have warned a 'long campaign' lies ahead for forces in Iraq, with the recently deployed Air Task Group of F/A 18 jets thought to be the largest since the Vietnam War. They joined aircraft and tanker transportation already operating in the Middle East. Defence Minister David Johnston said the government was 'optimistic' that they could quell the threat of Islamic State quickly. But he added: 'We must say months and more because we want to under-promise and over-deliver here. 'I'm quietly confident... but the fact is, we haven't even begun to deal with the threat to the civilian population in Iraq.' Mr Johnston also said there was a chance Australian troops could be the focus of insider attack, which were seen during the Afghanistan War. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has claimed that the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq. It comes after Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop claimed the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq. Ms Bishop labelled the 'murderous terrorist organisation' as a threat not only to the Middle East but to Australia and the rest of the world, during the the United Nations Security Council in early September. 'The international community cannot with any conscience turn away,' she said. On Saturday, the foreign affairs minister said sending Australian armed forces overseas 'is one of the most significant and serious decisions that any government can make,' 'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' Ms Bishop told The Sunday Times. 'ISIS and similar organisations are not only threatening the people of Iraq and beyond, but Australia,' she said. 'There have been a number of videos where Australia has specifically been mentioned as a terrorist target.' 'I believe the Australian people understand the threat, and support the Australian Government doing all it can to keep them safe.' 'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' said Ms Bishop . The super hornet jets have returned to base in Dubai, and air strikes are anticipated to begin as early as Sunday evening . A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State . A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State. A further three-quarters of voters also believed the threat of a terrorism attack on Australian soil was real. Ms Bishop reinforced the findings of the poll as she addressed security concerns on Saturday. Security and intelligence agencies were 'concerned that a terrorist attack could take place' within Australia, Ms Bishop said. 'They are not saying that one is imminent but they are saying Australia is a target,' she said. 'ISIS and similar organisations are opposed to open, tolerant and free societies. 'Australia represents what they oppose and they try to eliminate any opposition to their crazy and murderous ideology.' Ms Bishop encouraged Australians to continue their lives and to be 'pragmatic'.","As many as 200 troops could be on Middle Eastern soil by Tuesday .

"On his office door at West Ham’s rather modest training ground, Sam Allardyce’s coaching staff have placed a small photocopied sign. It reads: Ufficio del Direttore. It’s Italian for ‘Manager’s Office’ and is a play on Allardyce’s quip that foreign coaches get a little more respect in the Barclays Premier League than those born in the UK. What is more important now, though, is that the sign was only stuck on with Blu-Tack. As the summer approaches, Allardyce and West Ham are about to part company. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Sam Allardyce's best bits at West Ham . Given the boot: Sam Allardyce will be sacked by West Ham after a disappointing season at Upton Park . Not a good fit: Relative success has only been giving Allardyce time, as the fans haven't taken to his style . Nobody who has followed West Ham’s season will be surprised. The East London club and their boss from the Black Country have looked like an uncomfortable fit for some time. West Ham will end the season as a Premier League club, having beaten Tottenham home and away in the league and also in the Capital One Cup. They should move to the Olympic Stadium as an established top-flight club, having been in the Championship when Allardyce took over three years ago. It could be argued that every season has been a success — one promotion and two steady years in the top flight. That has proved insufficient at West Ham, a club where supporters have taken to booing when their team win. At Upton Park, they don’t like Allardyce’s football. He arrived in the summer of  2011 vowing  to play the game in the club’s traditions, and for large periods has not been able to do it sufficiently. His football is built on clean sheets. When West Ham won four out of five in the league to land Allardyce February’s Manager of the Month award, his team conceded just one goal. At West Ham, that will get you grudging respect and buy you time. It won’t make you admired, and certainly won’t get you any thanks. After all, who wants 1-0 when 4-3 is an option? Respite: Allardyce won the Premier League Manager of the Month award for February this year . Stat attack: Allardyce's win record is only second to Alan Pardew at West Ham in the last 20 years . Office problems: Sam Allardyce's office is a Portakabin... yet Hammers fans expect big continental managers . It’s strange thinking but it’s the way it is. West Ham are a modest club who think they’re a big club. The manager’s office at Chadwell Heath is a Portakabin with temporary heating. The club’s fans think they should be able to open the door and find Pep Guardiola sitting there. One day, if they remain in the Premier League through the teething years of the new stadium, West Ham’s punters may get their wish. The club have a loyal, enthusiastic and knowledgeable support that can help West Ham grow if they can build a team capable of winning things and gaining European football. If and when that happens, they should remember the part Allardyce played. Some fans believe his decision to field weak teams in cup games against Manchester City and Nottingham Forest was unforgivable. They felt the sacrifice of cup chances at the altar of the Premier League took pragmatism a step too far and it felt like a tipping point in the relationship. The fact Allardyce’s team  conceded 14 goals in those three cup games embarrassed him.Nevertheless, West Ham, more than most, are a club who simply cannot get relegated, not now, not with a stadium move on the horizon. A return to the Championship would have been more catastrophic than a romantic Wembley final. Blame the kids? Jamie Paterson and Nottingham Forest ran riot as the youngsters lost 5-0 in the FA Cup . Disappointing: Many fans were unhappy with Allardyce for not naming his strongest squad at the City Ground . Repeat: Just days later, West Ham were thrashed by Manchester City in the Capital One Cup semi-finals . Embarrassing: Joe Cole looks dejected as he walks off the pitch at full time . Says it all: The scoreboard at the end of the game, giving West Ham no chance in the second leg . Allardyce’s squad was holed with injuries in January, and in sacrificing those cup games, he gave his senior players the chance to begin February’s league run that has kept the club in the top division. Some may call it good management. Others suggest it’s too cautious. Last season, his team finished on 46 points; they have 40 ahead of Sunday’s visit to City. That’s a stick he can be beaten with and there have been days at Upton Park this season when entertainment has been thin. Injuries left Allardyce without two key attacking weapons — Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll — and an inability to tame Ravel Morrison saw him join QPR on loan. Aimless football towards Carroll didn’t lend West Ham a progressive air, and recently Allardyce has looked like a man who knew he was never going to satisfy those who pay their money every week. Raw: Despite showing potential, Allardyce has struggled to tame Ravel Morrison and he was loaned to QPR . Target man: Andy Carroll shows his frustration against West Brom - Allardyce builds his play around the No 9 . His departure will sadden him but not surprise him. He loved the job, had bought into it by relocating to East London, and when I saw him a few days after a win at Spurs in October, he seemed as invigorated as ever. Experience tells you when things aren’t right, though, and Allardyce perhaps always knew his shelf life at a club who still like to close their eyes and pretend it is 1966 was going to be relatively short.Still 59, he would appear to have at least one more prominent job in him. West Ham feel they will be better served without him in the Ufficio del Direttore. Time will tell.","Sam Allardyce is set to be sacked by West Ham .

After that we meet and address these cases. I always do it because it’s the way I like to do things. I always do written reports from the manager to the board. ‘I do that during the season and with a final report at the end of the season where I try to have my point of view, my analysis on every aspect of the season, and every aspect of the club relating to the first-team. ‘I’m the manager. I have an opinion. I inform the club about my opinion; not just a simple comment made in a corridor, in a proper way, to be committed with my opinions, and I do that in writing, always.

"Arsene Wenger has told Arsenal fans not to expect a rush of new signings early this summer. The manager, who saw his side sit at the top of the Premier League for more than 100 days this season, insists that getting bodies through the door in a World Cup year is a difficult process. It has been a campaign of missed opportunities for the Gunners, although they can end their trophy drought with an FA Cup win against Hull City later this month.

The . belief is that they need to sign a couple of top players this summer, . but the manager doesn't hold hope for deals to be done early. 'In my experience, in a World Cup year, the transfer business does not get done early,' he said. 'Everybody is focused on the World Cup. At the moment you can do nothing because the season is not over. 'Do you realise it is one month from the start of the World Cup? It is unbelievable. The Champions League final is on the 24th May and basically two weeks later it is the start of the World Cup. 'There is no time between the end of the season and the start of the World Cup. Nobody will do anything before the World Cup starts.' There appears to have been a slight change in policy at the Emirates Stadium over the last year. Mesut Ozil was signed for a club record £42.5million from Real Madrid in September, while there was an ongoing saga with Liverpool and Luis Suarez which threatened to completely engulf the summer transfer window. Wenger confirmed Laurent Koscielny is close to agreeing a new contract, but he needs a number of new faces in if they are to challenge for in Europe and the league. He has been criticised for a perceived stubbornness in the past, but the Frenchman is in no mood to be dictated to by others as the search for added quality goes on. Splash the cash!

"A 26-year-old aid worker who was kidnapped from Syria last year has been confirmed as the third hostage held captive by the Islamic State (aka ISIS). The terror-group has demanded a $6.6million ransom for the woman, as well as the release of imprisoned neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, ABC News reports. The hostage's family has asked for her name not to be released for fear of her safety.  She is the third of at least four hostages held by ISIS, including executed photojournalist James Foley. Scroll down for video . Demands: ISIS has demanded a $6.6million ransom for a female American aid worker held hostage. The group shocked the world last week when they posted a graphic video (screen grab above) showing the beheading of captive James Foley, an American photojournalist . In exchange: ISIS is also demanding the release of neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui. The ransom was confirmed by a spokesman for Siddiqui's family, who are trying to distance themselves from the group . Another hostage: The group has threatened to kill American journalist Steven Sotloff next . News of the ransom comes just a week after the group beheaded Foley in a savage propaganda video posted online. At the end of the video, the group threatened to kill another hostage, journalist Steven Sotloff, next. The ransom was revealed Monday, at a press conference held on behalf of Siddiqui's family, who are trying to distance themselves from ISIS. It was also confirmed through a close friend of the unidentified hostage's family. The group previously asked for the released of Siddiqui when they sent Foley's family a $132million ransom request before his execution. Siddiqui, an MIT-trained neuroscientist, was convicted in 2010 of trying to kill U.S. officials. Authorities believe she may have also been planning to construction dirty bombs to be used in terrorist attacks. Her family has released a statement saying they have no connections to ISIS and that 'associating Aafia's name with acts of violence is against everything we are struggling for'. 'While we deeply appreciate the sincere feelings of those who, like us, wish to see the freedom of our beloved Aafia, we cannot agree with a ""by any means necessary"" approach to Aafia’s freedom. 'Nor can we accept that someone else’s daughter or sister suffer like Aafia is suffering,' the letter says. Foley's ransom was not paid because the U.S. and Britain do not negotiate with terrorists . ISIS has taken hostage several other Western Europeans, some of which were able to secure release when their respective countries paid the ransoms. Collecting ransoms is the main way terrorist organizations fund their activities, and a New York Times report revealed that Al Qaeda (which has distanced themselves from ISIS) collected an estimated $125million in ransoms from European governments in the last five years.","The terror-group has demanded a ransom for an American aid worker kidnapped from Syria last year .

"Barcelona are ready to blow Arsenal out of the water in the battle to sign Javi Martinez with a £30million-plus bid for the unsettled Bayern Munich defender at the end of the season. With Lars Bender insisting he will remain with Bayer Leverkusen next season, Arsenal have been alerted to Martinez's possible availability and are believed to have enquired about him.

"Midfielder Sandro believes the arrival of a new manager in the summer could reignite his Tottenham career. The 25-year-old has struggled to re-establish himself in Spurs' midfield in the second half of the season after suffering a calf injury in December, and was labelled 'not up to it at the moment ahead of other people' by boss Tim Sherwood after being overlooked for the April 19 game against Fulham. Sherwood has opted to use Paulinho as his main defensive option in the middle of the park - leaving Sandro out of the first-team picture - but the Brazil international hopes the seemingly likely departure of Sherwood at the end of the campaign could rejuvenate his prospects in north London. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sherwood talk about Sandro and hear his musical talents . Chance to reignite: Sandro is relishing a new manager to replace Tim Sherwood at Totteham Hotspur . And he's off! Sherwood is widely expected to leave White Hart Lane at the end of the season . 'He (Sherwood) will leave at the end of the season,' Sandro told ESPN Brazil. 'Then, new coach, new everything.' Sherwood was handed an 18-month contract when he succeeded Andre Villas-Boas in December, but that has not prevented reports he will be shown the door at the end of the term, with the likes of Frank de Boer and Mauricio Pochettino touted for the role. Sandro, who has been linked with a transfer to Sao Paulo, is unsure what his own future holds, but says a switch back to his homeland would be difficult given Tottenham's valuation of him. 'I do not know anything yet (about my future), but I'm happy to have my name talked about with a club the size of Sao Paulo,' he said. '(But) it would be very difficult to leave on loan. If I leave, I would have to be sold, and it is not close. Other teams have come, but with little money.' On the radar: Spurs are keen on Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino to take over . Sherwood has played down talk of bad blood between the pair, stemming from the player tweeting to tell fans he was not injured on the morning of the Fulham game. 'He's not injured, and he's fit to play, but he's not selected because he's not up to it at the moment ahead of other people,' the 45-year-old said after the 3-1 triumph.

"The accused Pennsylvania cop-killer  continues to elude more than 200 officers after being sighted near his old high school with a rifle Friday night. An eastern Pennsylvania woman told authorities that she saw a man wearing all black, with his face covered in mud and a rifle in his hands in a wooded area near Pocono Mountain East High School, according to Lehigh Valley Live. The sighting is 'highly credible' and is believed to have been Eric Matthew Frein, 31, the man police have been hunted for more than a month after the Sept. 12 murder of a Pennsylvania state trooper and wounding of another. Frein attended the high school, according to Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Eric Frein, 31, has been the target of an intense manhunt for more than a month after killing a Pennsylvania trooper and wounding another . Skilled: Frein is described as a survivalist and 'gun enthusiast' with a grudge against law enforcement officials . 'We're not going to rest,' Gov. Tom Corbett said at a news conference Saturday. 'Nobody's going to stop until we find this individual and he's apprehended.' ABC News reports that the woman allegedly saw Frein and was able to describe him with great detail from less than 20 feet away. Authorities say that along with the woman's reports, another person reported possibly seeing Frein, and two more people reported finding what may have been blood on their porches, according to ABC News. The blood is being tested and authorities have not determined if it belongs to Frein. Bivens said at the conference that the search for Frein may become easier as the weather changes in the fall and winter months. 'I think we've kept a tremendous amount of pressure on him,' he said. Manhunt: More than 200 officers have been a part of the intense manhunt costing nearly $1.1 million a week . Troopers: Frein is accused of murdering Pennsylvania State Police Cpl.

Due to the reports, authorities announced Saturday that they will expand the search area to find the killer.

"A greyhound owned by champion jockey AP McCoy has tested positive for the same steroid used by shamed sprinter Ben Johnson. A sample taken from Kereight King after he trialled at Wimbledon last month tested positive for Stanozolol, the drug used by disgraced Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni. Distancing himself from the the news, McCoy said: 'I have no input as I was given a share in it and I have never actually seen it run.' Champion: racing legend AP McCoy is part of a syndicate with a share in Kereight King . Straight from the horse's mouth: McCoy has distanced himself from reports of the failed test . Kereight King, trained in Ireland by Pat Curtin, was 12-1 second favourite for the William Hill Greyhound Derby after the trial which almost smashed the track record. No date has been set for the hearing into the positive test but a fine of £5,000 could be slapped on the Kereight King team. A spokesman for the Greyhound Board of Great Britain said: ‘The GBGB can confirm that a urine sample was taken from the greyhound Kereight King on April 12 after it trialled at Wimbledon Stadium when in the care of trainer Mr Pat Curtin from Ireland and has been analysed by LGC Health Sciences and found to contain the substance 6a-hydroxystanozolol, a metabolite of Stanozolol.

"Thumbs up: Arturo Vidal (left) with Barcelona star and Chile team-mate Alexis Sanchez (right) in hospital after his operation . Arturo Vidal appeared confident of recovering in time for the World Cup after the Chile midfielder underwent right knee surgery on Wednesday - five weeks before his country's first match in Brazil. 'The surgery went very well,' Vidal . tweeted after the procedure. 'Now, I'll give it my best to join my . team-mates in Brazil! Go Chile!' The operation in Barcelona was led by specialist surgeon Ramon Cugat, and was accompanied by Chile and Juventus team doctors. The club, who won the Serie A title on . Sunday, said Vidal needed arthroscopic surgery on the lateral meniscus . of his right knee. 'We . don't dare to say a recovery time because there's a World Cup in the . making,' Cugat after the surgery. 'There are many factors at play here: . He has to be in good form, in a good mood, and his knee has to respond . well. But he's a very courageous player with a strong character, and . he's always positive. He's a winner.' Victorious: Vidal (left) celebrates with team-mates in a Turin hotel after Juventus won Serie A . Vidal has been instrumental in helping Juventus to three successive Serie A titles since arriving from Bayer Leverkusen in 2011. He was struggling with problems in his right knee for more than a month, but continued to play for Juventus until his injury worsened during the second leg of the Europa League semifinal against Benfica last Thursday. 'The treatment that has been carried out is correct,' Cugat said, fending off growing criticism in Europe and Chile about how Juventus managed his injury. 'I can say that I have many players, at the international level, who have continued to play with a tear to the lateral meniscus.' Since joining Juventus, Vidal has transformed impressively from being a stopper to making himself into a versatile player who recovers lost passes, sets up goals and often scores himself. He has eight goals in 46 appearances for Chile, and is among the team's best hopes for the World Cup. Chile have a strong team, but face huge challenges in Brazil. Chile are in Group B with world and European champion Spain, Holland and Australia. Even if they advance as the group's second qualifier, they would likely have to play against hosts and five-time champions Brazil. But fans remain confident that Vidal will recover in time, and Chile will continue their solid record: they lost only two out of 15 games last year, including a draw with Spain and win over England in friendlies. Challenge: Vidal tackles Andre Gomes of Benfica during the Europa League semi-final . In a statement, Juventus said Vidal will be released from the hospital on Thursday and will return to Turin to continue his recovery. Chilean football association president Sergio Jadue said on Wednesday that he has asked Juventus to let Vidal return to Chile on May 15. Back home in Chile, President Michelle Bachelet echoed the feelings of the millions of fans who are pinning their hopes on his recovery in time for the World Cup. 'We all want Vidal to play,' Bachelet said on Wednesday. 'Our wish is for his prompt recovery. But he must do the necessary rehabilitation so he can continue to play in the same huge role. If it's not for the first game, we're hoping he can play in the second match.' After their opening against Australia, Chile face Spain in their second game.","Arturo Vidal underwent surgery on his right knee in Barcelona .

"Robbie Williams documented his wife Ayda Field's labour in a number of YouTube videos so it's not surprising the couple chose to announce their son's name in the same way. But now the singer is facing a backlash because some fans claim he has used the birth of Charlton to promote his upcoming European tour, which kicks off in March 2015 and was announced yesterday. The Candy hitmaker posted a humorous video to his official account, showing Ayda pushing him and their son in a wheelchair out of hospital and captioned it, 'Charlton Valentine Williams has left the building.' However, Robbie also uploaded yet another video which he used to reveal that he would be embarking on a world tour titled, Let Me Entertain You. Scroll down for video . Surprise: Robbie Williams has used the interest generated by the birth of his son, Charton Valentine, to announce his plans to go on a new tour . Meet Charlton Valentine Williams: Robbie Williams posted this humorous video of his wife Ayda Field pushing him and their newborn son out of hospital after she gave birth . Twitter user Jennifer 0693 said: 'How disgustingly tacky to use your wife's labour to promote a world tour. Bore off.' Rob Shepherd added: 'If that is where ""celebrity"" has reached bring back punitive pop taxes.' The couple already have daughter Theodora 'Teddy' Rose Williams, two, together and welcomed Charlton on Monday, with the tot weighing eight pounds and two ounces. The video shows Ayda pushing a wheelchair through the hospital, and when she turns the corner, Robbie can be seen sitting in it with Charlton in his lap. Robbie shared clips of Ayda's labour on his official YouTube account and later spoke about his 'astonishing' wife. Doing all the work: After giving birth, Ayda was roped in to push her two boys out of hospital in a wheelchair in this hilarious new video . He said: 'I've never been more in love, and I've never been more proud of my wife. She's been absolutely astonishing.' Robbie added: 'The universe has presented itself to us again and it's been a very emotional, amazing few hours and we're really happy and honoured that you experienced the journey with us.' The 40-year-old singer  married Ayda in 2010. Happy day: Robbie Williams praised his wife after she gave birth to a little boy - their second child on Monday . Crazy! The star has spent the day posting videos and pictures of his wife as she prepared to give birth .

Robbie had been entertaining his fans  with amusing videos from the hospital room, including a video which showed him doing a rendition of Let It Go from the hit movie, Frozen, whilst his wife appeared to be giving birth. One picture showed her on a bed wearing high heels with the words: 'When Ayda goes into labour she comes correct,' the funnyman wrote as he helps his wife get through the experience. He also published videos showing the pair of them dancing in their hospital room and another where he jokingly tells fans: . 'It's quarter past seven, we've been here since ten o'clock last night and I know you're really concerned and worried and thinking about what's going on. I need you to know I'm doing great.' Getting into the spirit of things: Ayda appeared to be having just as much fun as she danced upon her husband's lap . Another video, called A River Runs Through It, appears to show a doctor preparing to break his actress wife's waters. Williams broke the news on Twitter earlier this year that the couple, who live in Los Angeles with daughter Teddy, were expecting another baby. The Stoke-born singer first hit the headlines in Take That but quit the group in 1995 and embarked on a hugely successful solo career. Check out my bump: The lovely lady was most amused by the moves she was making . He told The Sun on Sunday newspaper: 'I'm hooked on anything that takes my mind off me. 'It used to be food, drugs, sex, the internet, smoking or TV. Now it's my daughter.' He said: 'I'm in a content stage of my life. That's because I'm married with a kid. I'm less reckless. I thought it was all about the cars and the clothes, the girls and the house. But none of that is for me. 'With a baby girl there's a point to it other than my own ego.

"Harry Redknapp was a worried man when he drove back down the A1 after QPR lost a pre-season friendly at Peterborough. Many were expecting his team — with a wage bill bigger than Borussia Dortmund’s and with a plethora of Premier League stars — to run away with the Sky Bet Championship and return to the top flight. But after a 1-0 defeat by the League One side, Redknapp feared they would tumble down another tier. ‘It was a concern,’ he  admits. ‘At Peterborough, when I drove down after the game, I thought we’re going to have a difficult season; I didn’t like the look of us. So, when we started well in the league it gave everyone a lift. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Harry Redknapp on the play-offs . Concern: Harry Redknapp admits he was worried about how QPR would fare in the Championship . Tall order: The QPR boss knew he needed around two points per game to beat Burnley to finishing top . ‘But I couldn’t see us running away with it. People always said Burnley would fall away. I didn’t think they would. I thought for us to finish above Burnley we’re going to need 86-87 points — and winning two points a game is never easy.’ Despite Redknapp’s fears, QPR have not been outside the top five all season. They are three games away from winning promotion, starting with the first leg of their play-off at Wigan on Friday. But, including loans, 25 players have left the club since last summer. ‘A lot of them were good, players you’d love to have here,’ he says. ‘We couldn’t keep them all. Their wages were too high. If Loic Remy had stayed, we’d have got promoted. He’d have got you 25 goals. Stephane M’Bia has played for Seville in the Europa League semi-final. He’d’ve been a big player. Adel Taarabt is playing at AC Milan. They’ve not exactly gone to bad clubs.’ Redknapp says he is in the dark about the financial future if QPR don’t win promotion this year. But he is confident they will not lose their star players, with top-flight clubs monitoring Charlie Austin, Joey Barton and Bobby Zamora. Squeaky bum time! QPR reached the Championship play-offs after finishing fourth in the league . Goal getter: Had Loic Remy stayed, QPR would have been automatically promoted, claims Redknapp . Hands off! Redknapp is confident of keeping hold of his star players, including Charlie Austin . The conversation turns to England. The 67-year-old was the man-in-the-street’s favourite for the job, before Roy Hodgson was chosen. Had he been picked, Redknapp would have been preparing for a World Cup in Brazil, instead of a Friday night in Wigan. ‘That seems years ago. It’s way gone,’ he says. ‘I like Roy. I get on well with him. I wish him every success. I don’t live my life like that.’ Even so, he will be watching back home on television. ‘I think we’ll get out of the group,’ he says. ‘I don’t think it’s as hard a group as everyone says. ‘The draw was decent. Uruguay have got Luis Suarez, Edinson Cavani, the boy Diego Godin, but they’re not overloaded. It’s not a great Italian team either. We’ll have a decent run. ‘I wouldn’t say we’ll win it, I think one of the South American teams will; the best European bet is Germany. But we’ll make the quarter-final and maybe even the semi-final.’ It will make more enjoyable viewing for Redknapp if he is plotting a season in the Premier League. What could have been: Redknapp was touted to become England manager before the FA went for Roy Hodgson . There can be only one: Uwe Rosler insists QPR are under more pressure than his Wigan side . Meanwhile, Wigan manager Uwe Rosler has claimed QPR owner Tony Fernandes will be feeling ‘massive pressure’ to see his club seal an instant return to the Barclays Premier League, ahead of tonight’s play-off first leg at the DW Stadium. But after chuckling at Redknapp’s assertion that Wigan were favourites to follow Leicester and Burnley into the Barclays Premier League, Rosler suggested Fernandes could ill afford another season in the Championship after racking up a wage bill that’s ‘three times bigger than ours.’ With a Wembley date against Derby or Brighton at stake, Rosler said: ‘What we have is pressure bingo. You are under pressure, no you are, and so it goes on.’ Sky Bet want to hear your funny superstitions — and give you a chance of winning shirts and balls signed by your favourite players.

"Arsenal striker Park Chu-young is going to his third World Cup for South Korea despite concerns about his lack of game time in the Premier League. Hong Myung-bo picked Park among nine Europe-based players in the 23-man South Korea squad he announced Thursday. The South Korea coach unveiled a youthful and predictable squad - with just one player, Kwak Tae-hwi, older than 30. Rare sighting: Park Chu-young has barely played for Arsenal since signing in the summer of 2011 . Flop: Park has made one appearance this season for the Gunners . The selection of Park has been a point of serious national debate in recent weeks simply because the 28-year-old forward has played so little for Arsenal since his move to London in August 2011. He has made just one substitute appearance for the Gunners this season. A fine goal in his first national team appearance in a year against Greece in March helped him make the cut. 'Among Korean forwards, I couldn't find another attacker to replace Park,' Hong said. 'I have thought long and hard about this selection and decided on the final list just last night.' Other English Premier League players Ki Sung-yeung and Kim Bo-kyung were also selected. Park is likely to be the lone striker in Brazil with German-based Son Heung-min expected to appear on the left side of midfield. There are five survivors from the squad that reached the second round in South Africa 2010, a second ever appearance in the knockout stage in South Korea's eight World Cup appearances to date. Goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryung, Ki, Kim, Park and Bolton Wanderers midfielder Lee Chung-yong are hoping to at least repeat that feat in June. South Korea's best-ever World Cup performance was in 2002, when it cost-hosted the tournament with Japan and reached the semi-finals under with Hong as captain. The 45-year-old Hong also coached South Korea's Under-23 team, containing many of the players in his current squad, to the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics . Revealing all: South Korea boss Hong Myung-Bo announces his squad in Paju, north of Seoul . National symbol: A picture of Park (top right)  adorns the wall at the press conference . 'Brazil is going to be the biggest challenge,' said Hong, who took over as coach last July after Choi Kang-hee guided the team through an unimpressive qualification campaign. 'But we go as one team to give the best performance that we can. We have a team with a lot of international experience and we have the players who can show what they can do at the highest level.' Hong admitted that the position that gave him most problems was at left-back. Park Joo-ho of FC Mainz in Germany returned to South Korea early to try and recover from injury but ran out of time and has been replaced by QPR's Yun Suk-young. As Hong promised, there were few surprises in the squad. Pohang Steelers attacking midfielder Lee Myung-joo, perhaps the standout player of the 2014 K-League season, has been overlooked. Of the 20 outfield players in the squad, just three play in the domestic league. Hong said 'Lee has been excellent for Pohang this season,' but explained that he wanted more cover for defensive midfielders and took Park Jung-woo and Han Kook-young. The captain will be announced after the squad has gathered. After a training camp in Paju, the South Korea squad plays a friendly against Tunisia at home on May 28 before traveling to Miami for a pre-World Cup training camp that includes a warm-up game with Ghana on June 10. South Korea starts its Group H campaign against Russia on June 17 before taking on Algeria and Belgium.

"Cameron cutie: Caroline Dinenage has left her husband and is now dating a fellow Tory MP . A Tory government whip who walked out on his four-month-old daughter is dating a ‘Cameron cutie’ who left her husband. Mark Lancaster and mother-of-two Caroline Dinenage admitted to their  relationship after they started attending party events together. Mr Lancaster, 43, an army major, began seeing Miss Dinenage, 41, after she left her Royal Navy husband. Miss Dinenage, referred to as one of Cameron’s cuties because she was among the many Tory women selected to stand at the last election, said yesterday: ‘Yes, I am seeing Mark Lancaster.’ The Westminster relationship is the latest chapter in Mr Lancaster’s complicated love life. In 2007, he split from his wife Katherine, a lawyer, after 12 years and started dating journalist Amanda Evans.  He and his wife later divorced. Miss Evans became pregnant with a daughter, but they split 18 months into their relationship when the baby was four months old. The MP for Milton Keynes North claimed that the break-up was  amicable and blamed it on ‘incredibly long hours’. But Miss Evans is said to have thought he was ‘not taking an active interest’ in their daughter Lily-Mae. A year after the breakdown of that relationship he began dating Kathryn Buckle, an election agent for Daventry Conservative Association in Northamptonshire, but they split last year. Mr Lancaster and Miss Dinenage, daughter of TV presenter Fred Dinenage, were first seen together when she took him as her guest to a black tie dinner. In the campaign for her Gosport seat in Hampshire, where she replaced Sir Peter Viggers, who retired after claiming for a duck house on parliamentary expenses, Miss Dinenage boasted that she was a ‘navy wife’. But she estimated her Royal Navy . officer husband Carlos Garreta had been away at sea for six or seven of . their ten years of marriage. She said: ‘We managed the childcare through . a combination of professional and family help, but it’s not been easy.’ The businesswoman, who . runs a badge-making company, was last month appointed one of 12 small . business ambassadors by the Prime Minister. She . started her political career as a local councillor in Winchester before . unsuccessfully standing as a candidate in Portsmouth in 2005. The other man: Mark Lancaster, MP for Milton Keynes North East, walked out on his the partner and their four month old daughter last year after an 18-month relationship . She won her seat in Gosport with a majority of 14,413. She recently voted against same sex weddings, arguing that banning gay couples from marrying ‘takes nothing away from their relationship’. Mr Lancaster was made a whip  by Mr Cameron last September. He lives in a £750,000 home in Olney, Buckinghamshire. Before becoming an MP at the 2005 election, Mr Lancaster served as an officer in the Queen’s Gurkha Engineers, based in Hong Kong, and was a director of his family’s company, Kimbolton Fireworks, which is named after their home village in Cambridgeshire. He continues to serve as a major in the Territorial Army and spent the 2006 summer recess on active service alongside British troops  in Afghanistan. When asked whether he was in a relationship with Miss Dinenage, he said: ‘Absolutely.’ Miss Dinenage is the eldest daughter of Fred Dinenage, 71, who presented children’s television show How as well as ITV News Meridian. After filing for divorce in 2011 she was divorced in May 2012 and started dating Mr Lancaster at the end of last year.",MP Caroline Dinenage is dating Tory whip Mark Lancaster .

"Exeter Chiefs run in three tries in straightforward win . Victory for the Chiefs seals an eighth place Aviva Premiership finish for 2013-14 . Defeat for the Newcastle Falcons was their 16th straight league loss in a torrid season . Exeter Chiefs cruised to a comfortable 23-13 win over Newcastle Falcons at Kingston Park to clinch eighth place in the Aviva Premiership. Luke Cowan-Dickie and Ben White grabbed close-range first-half tries to put the Chiefs in charge and ensure the Falcons' run without a Premiership win would be extended to 16 matches. Henry Slade added a conversion and two penalties for the Chiefs to two from Joel Hodgson before a late flurry saw Fetu Vainikolo add Exeter's third try in the 79th minute and Falcons No8 Mark Wilson score in stoppage time with Phil Godman adding the conversion. On the ball: Fetu Vainikolo scored Exeter Chiefs' final try in their 13-23 win at Newcastle Falcons on Saturday . Up for it: Chiefs' victory at Newcastle sees them finish the season eighth in the Aviva Premiership . Newcastle made a bright start with Sinoti Sinoti and Alex Tait making penetrating runs which eventually led to tackles being penalised. Hodgson knocked over both in the third and seventh minutes for a 6-0 lead. But Exeter's well-organised line-out drive made it look easy for hooker Cowan-Dickie to claim the first try for the Chiefs in the 12th minute to make it 6-5, Slade failing to add the conversion. It seemed Dave Lewis must score when he raced away after snapping up the ball in broken play just inside his own half but the scrum half was chased down by Hodgson and caught just 10 metres short. The Falcons were happy to escape when Lewis dived into the scrum to concede a penalty. Exeter looked the more threatening and some heavy-duty pick and drives ended with Oliver Tomaszczyk diving in to concede a penalty which Slade kicked after 28 minutes to ease the Chiefs 8-6 ahead. Newcastle wasted a couple of chances when they failed to win their own ball at a line-out five metres out and then Gonzalo Tiesi was hauled down just short of the corner flag after clever footwork from Sinoti. Consolation: Mark Wilson (bottom) scored a late try for Newcastle who finish the season in 11th position . But Exeter dominated the closing minutes of the half as flanker White crashed through from close range again and Slade's conversion secured a 15-6 interval lead. The Falcons started the second half well with James Fitzpatrick bouncing off a couple of tackles but their inability to hang on to the ball was proving costly and they spent the next 10 minutes defending during which Slade kicked a 57th minute penalty for 18-6. Newcastle did rally briefly with Sinoti barrelling through again and the ball went through several pairs of hands in a brief flurry down the left but Godman's attempted chip was charged down and Exeter broke out of defence to move back into the Falcons half and dominate the last quarter. Miserable season: Despite avoiding relegation, Newcastle's defeat was their 16th consecutive in the league . Slade kept the Falcons pinned in their own 22 and they could even afford a missed penalty from Gareth Steenson with three minutes left because Vainikolo crashed over a minute from time with the home defence shredded. The Falcons did, at least, have the last word when Wilson rumbled through deep into stoppage time and Godman added the extras.","Exeter Chiefs run in three tries in straightforward win .

"It's rare for a referee to become an internet sensation for anything other than a game-changing gaffe or falling over but that can't be said of Fernanda Colombo Uliana.
