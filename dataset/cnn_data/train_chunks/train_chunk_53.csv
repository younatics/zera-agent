"New York (CNN) -- Dear Mr. President: How good of you, sir, to have personally telephoned two New York heroes whose timely diligence prevented a lunatic from causing a catastrophe  in Times Square. We New Yorkers are happy to hear you called Mr. Lance L. Orton Sr. and Mr. Duane Jackson to thank them for their vigilance. But there is a third vendor, Mr. President, whom you forgot to call. His name is Alioune B. Niass, and he is an immigrant from Somalia who said he was the first person to notice the smoking Nissan Pathfinder. ""I thought I should call 911,"" Niass later told a reporter, ""but my English is not very good and I had no credit left on my phone, so I walked over to Lance, who has the T-shirt stall next to mine, and told him. He said we shouldn't call 911. Immediately he alerted a police officer nearby."" Here in New York, Mr. President, we are not particular about which one of these great New Yorkers saw that deadly car first, alerted the police and prevented a disaster. The Big Apple has a big heart, and the magnificent city of New York has room for plenty of heroes. But we are also very fair people. So we would be grateful if you could kindly call Mr. Niass and thank him for us. There is another reason besides fairness. Mr. Niass is a Muslim from Somalia, and some of us Muslim-Americans have a suspicion that your staff might not have brought him to your attention because the idea of a Muslim hero in New York does not quite dovetail with the stereotype. If there is an American of Muslim descent who commits, or tries to commit, a criminal act, as Faisal Shahzad apparently did, we Muslims feel we are all suddenly suspects. We feel we need to explain ourselves. Yet if there is a hero among us whose love for our city does not fit the stereotype, he is ignored. This is not fair, and we believe you, as our president, can do much to alleviate this burden on us and our children. Imagine millions of Muslim children who go to school across America every day, just like your own children. Imagine how proud they would feel if you were to call Mr. Niass. That pride of place, that we and our children deserve, would go a long way to alleviating the pain of the bigotry and racism that is aimed at us. We too would feel at home here and be even more diligent in safeguarding and protecting our cities from criminal atrocities. You recall, Mr. President, during your presidential campaign you were, and still are, repeatedly ""accused"" of being a Muslim -- as if being a Muslim were a crime. We were hoping every time you denied being a Muslim that you would add, ""and if I were a Muslim, there is nothing wrong with it."" Finally, it was former Secretary of State Colin Powell who came out and said so when answering people who claimed you are Muslim: ""He's a Christian; has always been a Christian. But the really right answer is, 'What if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country?'""  We were relieved and grateful. We, too, Mr. President, are America. We have our share of criminals amongst us, as do any other people. But we are not all terrorists, and we are tired of feeling false guilt or shame every time a criminal among us does something insane and stupid. We are ordinary people -- soldiers and scientists, scholars and students, homemakers and teachers, businessmen and lawyers, physicians and engineers, greengrocers and vendors. And you are our president too. We who claim Mr. Niass as one of our own also have a dream. We dream that our children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the faith of their forefathers but by the content of their character. When the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. -- the visionary who said these immortal words I paraphrase -- uttered that phrase for the first time in 1963, scarcely anyone could have imagined that you would be our president today. But now you are and can do your share to change perceptions. It is possible that a Muslim might become president some day. For all we know, that president might be an American kid of Afghan, Pakistani, Arab, Iranian, Somali, or Indonesian parentage who is reporting to school this morning. Imagine how proud she would be if you were to call Mr. Niass today and thank him. His business is located on the corner of 45th and Broadway, two tables down from Lance's. I can give you his phone number. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","Hamid Dabashi lauds president for calling two street vendors who reported Times Square car .

"(CNN) -- A multistate romaine lettuce recall because of fear of contamination with a potentially deadly bacteria has restaurants east of the Mississippi River scrambling to assure customers that their salad is safe. ""We have taken the extra precaution of contacting our lettuce supply chain partners to ensure that our product meets our usual high standard of quality,"" New York-based franchise Just Salad said in an e-mail to its customers. ""We are happy to say that we have confirmed that this recall will have no effect on Just Salad's romaine lettuce,"" the e-mail said. On Thursday, Freshway Foods in Sidney, Ohio, announced a voluntary recall of products containing shredded romaine lettuce with a use-by date of May 12 or earlier because they may be contaminated with E. coli linked to outbreak of illness. Read about recall on CNN's This Just in . Yum! Brands -- the largest restaurant company, and owner of popular fast food chains KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silver's -- said Freshway Foods is a not supplier to any of its brands. The romaine lettuce, sold under the Freshway and Imperial Sysco brands, was recalled in connection with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened at least 19 people in Michigan, Ohio and New York. Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some cause severe illness. Diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses are just some of the consequences of ingesting certain kinds of the bacteria. Blog: What you need to know about E. coli .

"(CNN) -- At least five people were killed in Oklahoma on Monday after a severe storm system spawned multiple tornadoes across the state, the state emergency management department said. Three people died in Cleveland County, just west of Tecumseh, Oklahoma, said Albert Ashwood, director of the state emergency management department, and another was reported dead near Choctaw, east of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The location in Oklahoma of the fifth person who died was unknown late Monday night. Brenda Finkle, director of corporate communications for Norman Regional Health System, said the company's hospital in Norman admitted eight patients Monday night in critical condition with crush injuries and head trauma. At least 25 other people filled the waiting room of Norman Regional Hospital with lacerations and head wounds, Finkle said, adding hospital staff expected more patients to continue to seek treatment. Another 20 people were either getting medical care or awaiting treatment at Moore Medical Center, just north of Norman, according to Finkle. OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, received two patients with broken bones, according to spokesman Allen Poston. The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported seven injuries. Video out of Norman showed overturned cars, snapped utility poles, downed trees and severely damaged homes. Several mobile homes were blown to pieces in one neighborhood where debris littered yards and streets alongside large trees ripped straight from the ground. A truck stop east of Oklahoma City was demolished, taking a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, according to a spokeswoman for Love's Travel Stops and Country Stores. Motorists pulled off Interstate 40 and sought shelter in the truck stop's large coolers and restrooms before the tornado tore the roof off the building, blew out car windows and overturned tractor-trailers, spokeswoman Christina Dukeman said. Video showed people outside the truck stop receiving treatment for minor injuries. Laura O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Services Authority, said seven people were transported from around the immediate area to local hospitals in good and fair condition, ""a miraculously low number ... considering the volume of area the tornado covered."" Love's employee Charlescie Greenway said she and two other women made it to one cooler before the twister tore through the building. ""The three of us were kind of trapped in there, holding the door shut, praying to God that we don't die and that everybody else was safe,"" Greenway told CNN affiliate KWTV, adding, ""it was really scary -- the wind was like trying to pull the door off the latch."" Sammy Ward and his partner rode the twister out in their truck in the parking lot. ""It started hailing and then it quit hailing and then all of a sudden the wind hit and it just went dark and here went everything,"" Ward told KWTV. ""Trucks went to rocking ... and next thing we know the whole roof and everything was gone."" Ward, who said he felt ""very lucky,"" said the event lasted two to three minutes. Ashwood said crews were working to assess the damages in at least 13 counties, adding ""numerous"" homes had been affected. Are you there? Send photos, video . The American Red Cross opened at least two shelters in McCloud, Oklahoma, and Tecumseh, Oklahoma, and continued to assess needs across the state. More than 31,000 homes were without power in the metro Oklahoma City area -- nearly 15,000 in Norman alone, according to Oklahoma Gas & Electric. Ashwood said preliminary reports out of Norman indicate the damages are ""similar to what you would see with an EF3"" tornado, referring to the Enhanced Fujita Scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. An EF3 is capable of producing winds up to 165 mph. CNN iReporter Rebecca Barbato said tornado sirens were going off in her neighborhood in Moore, just north of Norman, when tennis-ball-sized hail began raining down on her roof. Other tornadoes were reported in Yukon, Medford and Shawnee in Oklahoma, and in Wichita, Kansas. The storms struck around 5 p.m. CT (6 p.m. ET). Meteorologists warned throughout the day Monday of the potential for tornadoes. CNN's Devon Sayers and Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","NEW: At least five killed in Oklahoma .

"(CNN) -- Ghana coach Milovan Rajevac has selected captain Michael Essien and defender John Mensah in his preliminary 29-man World Cup squad despite the duo still recovering from injuries. Midfielder Essien has not played for his English club Chelsea since December, when he suffered a hamstring injury before breaking down with a knee problem at the Africa Cup of Nations the following month. Mensah, who also plays in England on loan with Sunderland, has been sidelined with a calf injury arising from a physical complication which has plagued him in recent years. Midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who also plays in England, was named by the Serbian coach on Tuesday despite still waiting for his nationality switch to be approved. Blog: ""Dynamite"" Drogba will explode at World Cup . The Portsmouth player was born in Germany, who he has represented at under-21 level, but has a Ghanaian father and his uncle has played for the Black Stars. Rajevac has recalled Inter Milan midfielder Sulley Muntari, who was dropped for the Africa Cup of Nations in January after deciding not to play in a friendly against Angola. New Ivory Coast manager Sven-Goran Eriksson named a predictably talent-laden 30-man squad, with his side favored to be the continent's best prospect in South Africa. The Elephants, who face Brazil, Portugal and North Korea in Group G, can call upon the English Premier League's top scorer Didier Drogba and his teammate at champions Chelsea, Salomon Kalou. The midfield ranks include Barcelona's Champions League winner Yaya Toure, Hamburg's Guy Demel and Cheick Tiote of Dutch champions FC Twente. Former England and Mexico coach Eriksson, who took over from Vahid Halilhodzic after a disappointing Africa Cup of Nations campaign, also has England-based defenders Emmanuel Eboue, Kolo Toure, Abdoulaye Meite and Steve Gohouri. Cameroon coach Paul Le Guen has given Rigobert Song the chance to appear at his fourth World Cup after naming the 33-year-old defender in his 30-man squad. Veteran midfielder Geremi, who also plays in Turkey, may play at his second tournament while Benoit Assou-Akotto is recalled after missing the Africa Cup of Nations through injury and his fellow Tottenham defender Sebastien Bassong is included too after being omitted for the Angola event by the Frenchman. Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o will continue as captain, having replaced Song when Le Guen took charge last year. South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira named Benni McCarthy in his 29-man squad after the striker was dropped by predecessor Joel Santana and has struggled with injury since moving to English club West Ham in January. The Brazilian picked 10 Europe-based players, including captain Aaron Mokoena and midfielders Kagisho Dikgacoi and Steven Pienaar, but Nasief Morris of Spanish club Racing Santander missed out. Nigeria coach Lars Lagerback has given Nwankwo Kanu the chance to earn his third World Cup appearance despite the 33-year-old striker's limited opportunities with English club Portsmouth this season. Kanu's clubmate John Utaka has been recalled in the 30-man squad after being dropped by the Swede's sacked predecessor Amodu Shaibu, while midfielder Jon Obi Mikel is included despite missing the end of Chelsea's season due to minor knee surgery. Goalkeeper Bassey Akpan and Peter Suswan were the only Nigeria-based players selected. Algeria coach Rabah Saadane had yet to name his squad.","Ghana captain Michael Essien included in 30-man provisional World Cup squad despite injury .

"(CNN)  -- Tiger Woods was forced to pull out of the final round of the Players Championship at Sawgrass on Sunday with a neck injury. Woods lasted until the seventh hole before calling it a day. He was two-over for the round and two-under for the prestigious tournament, but trailing the leaders, when he quit. South African Tim Clark eventually won the 'fifth major' with a superb five-under-par 67 to close on 16-under 272. ""I've been playing with a bad neck for a while,"" Woods told gathered reporters. ""I might have a bulging disk. They want me to get a picture on it next week. ""I've been playing through it. I can't play through it any more,"" he said. ""I know playing doesn't help it,"" he added. Woods revealed he had been troubled by the pain before last month's Masters, where he finished tied for fourth. It was his first tournament of the year after a self-imposed exile following his revelations of marital infidelities. The world number one was in action again at the Quail Hollow tournament in North Carolina last week where he easily missed the cut after two sorry rounds. ""I'm having a hard time with the pain,"" Woods said. ""There's tingling down my fingers, just the right side. Setting up over the ball is fine but once I start making the motion, it's downhill from there."" Woods is under pressure for his world number one spot from Phil Mickelson, who won the Masters and has been in tremendous form on the PGA Tour. The 34-year-old last pulled out of a tournament in 2006 at the Nissan Open in Los Angeles when he had flu. If the injury proves long-standing it could affect his build to the second major of the season, the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in mid-June. Mickelson could have leapfrogged Woods if he had won the Players, but he shot a closing 74 to tie for 17th. England's Lee Westwood led going into the back nine on the final day, but a series of lapses, including a double bogey on the notorious short 17th, ended his hopes. Clark, who was winning for the first time on the PGA Tour, charged through the field to set the clubhouse target, with Australian Robert Allenby finishing second, one shot behind, after failing with birdie attempts on the final two holes.","Tiger Woods pulls out of Players Championship at Sawgrass with neck injury .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a decade ago, a group of Saudis and other men from the Middle East came to the United States to carry out the worst terrorist attack on the U.S. Not a single one had American citizenship. Almost nine years after the September 11 attacks, the threat of another major terror strike is still a concern, but where the threat is coming from has changed. A growing number of American citizens and longtime residents of the United States are becoming radicalized enough by al Qaeda's extremist ideology to kill their fellow Americans, counterterrorism officials say. A growing number are also learning the bomb-making skills necessary to become potentially dangerous terrorists, the officials say. They are training in the mountains of Waziristan in northwestern Pakistan, where al Qaeda still enjoys significant safety. That's where, according to the U.S. government, alleged Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad was trained by the Pakistani Taliban, a group with close ties to al Qaeda. Shahzad's case has strong similarities to that of another American who plotted with terrorist groups in Pakistan to attack the United States. His name is Bryant Neal Vinas, a Catholic convert to Islam from Long Island, New York, who became radicalized, traveled to Pakistan to join up with al Qaeda and helped Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization plot a bomb attack on New York City. When news of Vinas' arrest broke last summer, family members, friends and terrorism experts where dumbfounded by how a studious, middle-class, baseball-loving, all-American kid and onetime U.S. Army recruit could end up plotting to kill in the name of al Qaeda. CNN's investigation into Vinas has resulted in an intimate portrait of a homegrown terrorist, charting the disturbing story of a young American's obsessive quest to join al Qaeda. Watch a preview of 'American al Qaeda' Vinas' case sheds significant light on why Shahzad and an increasing number of other young Americans have become seduced by al Qaeda's ideology. Both Vinas and Shahzad were well-integrated into American life before becoming radicalized. Both traveled to the heart of al Qaeda's operational command in Pakistan's tribal region along the border with Afghanistan. And both allegedly met with the most senior leaders of the Pakistani Taliban in the weeks before allegedly plotting against the United States. ""Bryant Neal Vinas is almost a poster child for the process, the unremarkable nature of the people who might go through this process and, frankly, the potential to link up to al Qaeda and the danger that presents,"" according to Mitch Silber, the director of intelligence analysis for the New York City Police Department. Several top U.S. counterterrorism officials had the same message: Americans radicalized at home and trained in Pakistan represent a new and disturbing threat to the American homeland. The changing face of terrorism . ""In the 9/11 world and in the immediate aftermath, the theory was and the reality was that a terrorist attack, if it were to occur again on U.S. soil, would be someone coming from abroad and coming in to the United States,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. ""That paradigm has changed, and there are now individuals in the United States, some who have grown up here and are American citizens. ... They haven't done anything to violate the law, but yet they have become radicalized to the point of violent extremism and to the point of ... considering coming back to the homeland and conducting an attack of some sort."" In the last year, there have been 16 cases of Americans or American residents implicated in Islamist terrorism, a surge in such cases. The Times Square plot is case No. 17. These cases include the plot last September by Denver taxi driver Najibullah Zazi to conduct multiple suicide bombings on subway cars in New York City, an al Qaeda plot described by U.S. officials as the most serious on U.S. soil since 9/11. Like Vinas and alleged Times Square bomber Shahzad, Zazi and two associates allegedly received terrorist training in the tribal areas of Pakistan. ""Radicalization is definitely on the rise in the United States,"" said Silber of the NYPD, adding that there's ""a new wrinkle"" to that radicalization: ""For years, many of these people almost exclusively sought to fight overseas, [but] now, we're seeing individuals looking to target the United States itself."" Counterterrorism officials believe that interactive online social media sites and a new generation of charismatic English-speaking preachers have helped al Qaeda and other terrorist groups spread their ideology into the United States like never before. But not only radical online preaching has caused increasing concerns. CNN investigations have revealed that radical preachers are attempting to spread al Qaeda's message on the streets of American cities, including even on Times Square in New York. Two New York City-based groups -- The Islamic Thinkers Society and Revolution Muslim -- have come under particular scrutiny because of their attempts to spread al Qaeda's ideology in the United States. CNN investigations have revealed that Vinas hung out in Islamic Thinkers Society circles in New York before leaving to fight jihad in Afghanistan. U.S. counterterrorism officials tell CNN they believe he was radicalized by spending time with the group. While the Islamic Thinkers Society and Revolution Muslim have few full-time members and their public rallies are sometimes sparsely attended, they have thousands of followers online, many of them American. And counterterrorism officials believe they often organize meetings in private. ""In a sense, they are almost bug lights for aspiring jihadists,"" Silber said. ""They've got an anti-Western, anti-democratic, anti-U.S., pro-al Qaeda message."" One of the followers of Revolution Muslim's website was ""Jihad Jane,"" the avatar of Colleen LaRose, a Pennsylvanian woman charged in March for allegedly plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist. The Islamic Thinkers Society, like Revolution Muslim, is still active. Last month, outside the Israeli Consulate in New York, it protested U.S. support for Israel. After the rally, Islamic Thinkers Society spokesman Abu Mujaddid said the group planned to step up its activities in New York and was successfully recruiting new followers. Mujaddid, who said he believed the United States was at war with Islam, refused to give his real name. Breeding ground . While it is still unclear whether Shahzad had radical associates in the United States, U.S. counterterrorism officials are concerned that others like him may be being radicalized through personal contact with proselytizers. Most serious plots directed at the West in the last six years saw plotters either trained or directed by established jihadist groups in Pakistan, according to a recent study conducted for the New American Foundation. In recent months, videos have emerged purporting to show two Americans fighting with militants along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. One of the alleged Americans, going by the name Sayfullah Amriki, was featured with his face blurred in a video produced by the propaganda arm of the Islamic Jihad Union, an al Qaeda-affiliated Uzbek group. In the video, Amriki said he was not the only American who had joined up with militants in the area. He also made a plea in English for new recruits to fight American forces in Afghanistan. ""We must rush to the lands to jihad. It is an obligation on us,"" he said. ""How can we lose when we wish for death?"" But it's what happens when fighters like Amriki come home that most worries U.S. counterterrorism officials.","More Americans are turning to radical Islam, U.S. counterterrorism officials say .

"(CNN) -- England coach Fabio Capello has been forced to go back on his previously iron-clad rules in selecting his preliminary squad for the World Cup in South Africa. The Italian has always said he would not pick players who are injured or out of form, but has brought Liverpool's Jamie Carragher out of international retirement to bolster his defensive options as cover with injury-prone captain Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King also in the 30-man line-up. Neither Carragher nor versatile Tottenham star King have yet played for Capello, who retained his midfield mainstay Gareth Barry despite the Manchester City player being in doubt for the June 12 opener against the United States due to injury. Carragher made himself unavailable in 2007 after not being often used by previous managers Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren despite being regularly named in squads. Blog: Will ""the Force"" be with Capello at World Cup? Capello also asked Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes to become available again following his own international retirement in 2004, but the 35-year-old turned down the opportunity. ""He said no, he preferred to stay with the family. But I tried,"" Capello told the UK Press Association. Liverpool fullback Glen Johnson was named despite being sidelined with injury, while striker Emile Heskey retained his place although he has not been a first-choice selection for his club Aston Villa. Key forward Wayne Rooney was named despite his niggling groin problem, with Tottenham's Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch taking the other striking spots along with Sunderland's 25-goal Darren Bent. Winger Aaron Lennon was included after only recently returning with Tottenham after a long-term absence, as was fellow right-sided player Shaun Wright-Phillips despite his failure to win a regular place at Manchester City, who also have 22-year-old Adam Johnson in the squad. Midfielder Joe Cole also got the nod, having last played for England in 2008, after a strong end to a season that saw him on the fringe of league champions Chelsea's first team. Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi has stuck with the players who qualified for South Africa in his 30-man squad, resisting suggestions that he should bring in-form Roma striker Francesco Totti out of international retirement. Totti's on-loan teammate Luca Toni also missed out along with veteran Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Villarreal's Giuseppe Rossi one of seven strikers named. Inter Milan's controversial Italy under-21 forward Mario Balotelli missed out as Fabio Quagliarella (Napoli), Vincenzo Iaquinta (Juventus), Antonio Di Natale (Udinese), Marco Borriello (Milan), Alberto Gilardino (Fiorentina) and Giampaolo Pazzini (Sampdoria) were picked. Lippi omitted his former Juventus player Nicola Legrottaglie despite the defender being included in a recent 29-man training squad. France coach Raymond Domenech left out young Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema in his 30-man selection, while the omission of veteran midfielder Patrick Vieira means Thierry Henry is the only survivor from the 1998 World Cup-winning squad. Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri also missed out, but four of his clubmates in England -- Gael Clichy, William Gallas, Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna -- were included. However, defender Gallas has been warned by Domenech that he must prove his fitness, having been sidelined since March with a leg injury. Veteran Netherlands striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy has missed out on a place in coach Bert van Marwijk's 30-man, potentially signaling the end of the 33-year-old's international career. Van Nistelrooy left Real Madrid to join German club Hamburg to revive his hopes following a serious knee injury, but Van Marwijk said the player had not returned to a high enough level to be selected. ""I told him that we have followed him closely and admire his commitment and dedication to get to the World Cup,"" Van Marwijk told AD Sportwereld. ""I believe that Ruud is fit, but after his lengthy knee injury he does not have time to get back to his old level."" Dutch champions Twente have only two players in the squad, which features 14 overseas-based names. Feyenoord defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst, 35, has announced he will retire after the month-long tournament. Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz named a 24-man squad due to doubts over a couple of players including Real Madrid defender Pepe, who has only just returned to training after being sidelined since December. Goalkeepers Beto and Daniel Fernandes were named as deputies to Braga's Eduardo despite not playing in any of the qualifiers, but there were no other surprises for the 2006 semifinalists, who will be led by Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is giving injured stars Andreas Iniesta, Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas every chance to be fit, naming the key trio in a 30-man squad including five goalkeepers. Uncapped Barcelona No. 1 Victor Valdes and Atletico Madrid's 19-year-old David De Gea were selected along with Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, Liverpool's Jose Reina and Diego Lopez of Villarreal. Barcelona winger Pedro Rodriguez, Osasuna defender Cesar Azpilicueta and Athletic Bilbao midfielder Javi Martinez were named despite having won only under-21 caps. Barca 19-year-old Bojan Krkic, who missed Spain's Euro 2008 success at his own request due to fatigue, has again been omitted. Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel, Filip Holosko and fellow striker Robert Vittek were named in a 29-man squad by coach Vladimir Weiss despite their recent injury problems. Liverpool's Skrtel has not played for three months since breaking a bone in his foot, while Holosko is struggling to get over a broken leg suffered last year and Vittek -- who is also based in Turkey -- has had a knee problem. Weiss also selected his 20-year-old son and namesake Vladimir of English club Manchester City, who as loaned to Bolton this season. Serbia coach Radomir Antic named just five home-based players in his 30-man squad, with six from English Premier League clubs including key defender Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United. Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek kept faith with the players who helped the small East European nation qualify for the second time when he named his 30-man squad. Denmark coach Morten Olsen picked Thomas Sorensen in his 26-man squad despite the goalkeeper suffered a dislocated elbow on duty with English club Stoke last month. Olsen, who won more than 100 caps as a player and took Denmark to the 2002 World Cup, gave defender Patrick Mtiliga his first call-up since his debut in November 2008. Greece coach Otto Rehhagel has picked Christos Patsatzoglou and Giorgos Seitaridis despite the duo's struggles with injuries this season. The German selected nine overseas-based players including qualifying campaign top scorer Theofanis Gekas of Hertha Berlin, Celtic striker Georgios Samaras and Liverpool defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos. Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld named an experienced 23-man squad for the finals, with seven players in reserve. The German has stuck with the likes of Blaise Nkufo of Dutch champions Twente, fellow striker Alexander Frei and midfielder Hakin Yakin, who are all 30 and above. Defender Philippe Senderos was included despite his lack of action with English club Arsenal, while Sampdoria midfielder Marco Padalino and Kosovo-born Swiss under-21 international Xherdan Shaqiri were also included.","England coach Fabio Capello brings Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher out of retirement .

"(CNN) -- Ash from an Icelandic volcano is continuing to affect European flights on Monday, delaying transatlantic aircraft and threatening flights over parts of Ireland and Portugal. Eurocontrol, the agency that manages European air travel, said: ""During the afternoon, areas of higher ash concentration could move in a north-easterly direction from the Atlantic into the Iberian Peninsula."" Ryanair, the budget airline, canceled 18 flights on Monday as it expected the airspace surrounding Kerry airport in the southwest of Ireland and Faro airport in Portugal to be affected by the ash cloud. Ryanair said in a statement on its Web site: ""Passengers are strongly recommended to check their flight status before they go to the airport."" Eurocontrol said much of the high-concentration ash cloud over continental Europe had dispersed and that despite the delays, all European airports were open on Monday afternoon. The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that transatlantic flights were still rerouting around ash that was lying between 20,000 to 35,000 feet in the atmosphere. A CAA spokesman told CNN: ""The ash cloud is slowly disappearing, it's descending and dispersing, there isn't one big cloud... it's ash in the air over a very large area. Transatlantic flights are rerouting around it, causing delays."" Eurocontrol said it expected approximately 28,500 flights within the European area, which is about 500 below average for a Monday at this time of year. Italian airports in Milan, Pisa and Florence as well as six airports in Scotland were closed over the weekend because of the ash cloud. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. The problems began in mid-April, when the volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in southern Iceland erupted and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere, closing most of Europe's airspace for six days.","Eurocontrol: Ash from Icelandic volcano could affect Irish and Portuguese airspace .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Environment, economy, elections, education. All E words, and all part of this Monday edition of CNN Student News. From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Oil Spill . AZUZ: First up, officials are moving on to plan C to try to stop the oil that's gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. They've tried remote controlled subs. They've tried a giant dome. We're gonna have more on that in a second. What is plan c? A lot of junk! Basically, you stuff the leak with trash and try to clog the thing up. So, what about the containment chamber, the giant dome they were planning to drop over the leak? The thing didn't work. Crystals formed on the dome and made it float. Officials haven't totally given up on the idea, but they're considering other options, including junk. As this oil spill starts to wash ashore, meanwhile, it could have a huge impact on several industries. About 40 percent of the country's seafood harvest comes from the Gulf Coast. Fishermen, dock workers, restaurant owners: All of them could be affected by this, as supplies go down and prices go up. The biggest challenge is how to get all of this oil under control and then to get the oil out of the water. Allan Chernoff shows us how the government gets ready for these kinds of situations. (BEGIN VIDEO) ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK: When trying to clean up a giant oil spill, how does the oil industry know exactly what to do, what techniques are going to work? The research is done right here at OHMSETT, the Oil and Hazardous Materials Simulated Environmental Test Tank. This facility is run by the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, and it is the largest of its kind in the entire world. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fire in the hole! CHERNOFF: Oil sprays into the water, a slick forms and expands, but it's all intentional. Here, the government creates controlled oil spills in a giant tank more than two football fields long. Operators create ocean wave conditions, then they use various techniques to clean it all up. There are three primary plans of attack for cleaning oil spills in the water: burn the oil, apply chemical dispersants to break it down, or manually remove it. All three are at work in the Gulf of Mexico. Today, cleanup experts are practicing manual techniques to remove oil. Taking oil off the surface of the water is kind of like peeling the filling off of an oreo cookie; you're skimming it. And that's what all these various devices do. They skim the oil off the water. Depending upon the grade of oil, how heavy it is, you use a different type of skimmer. At OHMSETT, all different types of oil are sprayed into the tank from a moving bridge. Workers can test skimmers, various dispersants, even burning, all in a safe, enclosed environment that simulates the ocean's salinity and even its wave patterns. We all know oil is lighter than water. That's an advantage when it comes to cleaning up a spill, because the oil sits on top of the water. Using those booms, oil can actually be pushed into that skimmer, and then it's sucked up using this giant vacuum. Cleanup workers from private industry, government and 24 countries around the world have come here to practice and research such techniques, including responders trying to clean the Gulf of Mexico right now. (END VIDEO) Unemployment Numbers . AZUZ: We will continue to keep you updated on that story. Now, to unemployment. Last month, the U.S. unemployment rate went up, from 9.7 percent to 9.9 percent. Some experts are actually saying that's a good sign. What? The unemployment rate includes people who are actively looking for a job. Let's say you're out of work. In March, you're so discouraged that you don't think it's worth it to even look for a job. In that situation, you're not part of the unemployment rate. Then in April, you think there's a better chance of finding a job, so you start looking. Now, you are included in the rate. So, according to some experts, the fact that unemployment rate went up, means that more people are feeling more optimistic about the economy. But the bottom line is, there are still more than 15 million Americans out of work. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Robbins' contemporary issues class at Meadow Heights High School in Patton, Missouri! Who lives at 10 Downing Street in London? Is it: A) Sherlock Holmes, B) Queen of the UK, C) UK Prime Minister or D) U.N. Secretary-General? You've got three seconds -- GO! 10 Downing Street is the UK prime minister's home and office. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! UK Election . AZUZ: The question is, who is going to live at 10 Downing Street? The UK is trying to figure that out after last week's parliamentary elections. None of the parties got a majority of seats. So now, a scramble is on. In the UK, people vote for members of parliament. Whichever party wins a majority of the seats in parliament gets to form the new government, and that party's leader usually becomes prime minister. Gordon Brown has held that job since 2007. He heads up the Labour Party. But they only got 29 percent of the vote in last Thursday's election. The Conservative Party, which is led by David Cameron, got 36 percent. Over the weekend, Brown and Cameron both met with Nick Clegg. He is in charge of the Liberal Democrat Party, which got 23 percent of the vote. Clegg could form a coalition -- basically, sort of team up -- with either the Labour Party or the Conservative Party and then together, form a majority. Volcano Ash . AZUZ: Well, we're staying in Europe. An ash cloud from a volcano is causing problems for airplanes. And if that story sounds familiar, it's because it is! This is the same volcano and the same problem. It's in southern Iceland under a glacier; it's been erupting since last month. The problem is the ash that you are seeing right here. If this ash gets into a jet's engine, it can cause the engine to fail. Back in April, concerns about the ash shut down air travel across most of Europe for nearly a week. This weekend, several hundred more flights were canceled, and some officials closed airports in Italy, Spain and Scotland. Word to the Wise . RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... zero tolerance (noun) a policy of strictly enforcing rules and laws, without making exceptions . Zero Tolerance . AZUZ: The state of Georgia, where we are, has a zero tolerance policy about weapons in school: any kind of weapon -- gun, knife, chain -- strictly forbidden on campus. A 14-year-old student named Eli Mahone was recently affected by this. He couldn't find his backpack one morning. You've probably experienced that yourself. So, Eli grabbed another backpack to use for the day, and he got to school before he found out that the backpack had a knife in it. It was a two-and-a-half inch blade that he uses when he goes fishing. ELI MOHONE, ARRESTED UNDER ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY: I get to school. I mean, it was just like a regular day. I went to reading and, I don't know, one of my friends told me, ""Is that yours?"" And when I looked down, there was a knife on the ground and it was mine. AZUZ: Eli took the knife and turned it in himself to the principal's office. But here's where zero tolerance kicked in, and Eli got in serious trouble: the policy does not allow school administrators to consider the circumstances. So, following that policy, school officials and police treated this as a crime. And a teen who'd never broken the law before was arrested and sent to a youth detention center. Eli was also expelled from the school, and he had to go to an alternative school with students who'd committed serious crimes. AIMEE HENSLER, ELI MAHONE'S MOTHER: It was basically like standing outside your body watching as it was going on. I mean, I never imagined seeing him handcuffed and put in the back of a police car. AZUZ: Eli's mom got in touch with a state senator. He crafted a bill that would relax Georgia's zero tolerance policy. The bill passed the state House and Senate; it's waiting for the governor's signature. As far as zero tolerance policies go, a local judge says they are effective in fighting certain types of crimes, but critics argue they go too far in schools. Blog Promo . AZUZ: What do you argue about zero tolerance policies? It's a new week; we have a new post up on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com. What do you think of zero tolerance policies? If they're effective? Are they worth it? Or do you think they go too far. Tell us on our blog. The address: CNNStudentNews.com. The rule: first names only. Before We Go . AZUZ: We've stuffed a lot in today's show, but hopefully you have room for just a bit more. A lot more. But it's worth it. This might be the world's biggest burger. 590 pounds! A Canadian chef concocted this creation. Of course, he had to use a special grill, one that has a forklift inside to flip the patty. Sure, he's trying to break someone else's record, but it's to raise money for a charity. Goodbye . AZUZ: So if they were to ever meat, the old record holder might grill him for a while, but we doubt he'll have any beef with the new guy. Whoo! All right, we're having fun with this story. You guys have an excellent day. We're looking forward to seeing you tomorrow when CNN Student News returns on HLN, online or on iTunes.

"(CNN) -- Giant rocks came tumbling down a snowy Colorado mountainside early Monday, punching gaping holes in the interstate below, the Colorado Department of Transportation said. The rock slide at Glenwood Canyon halted travel on Interstate 70 between Glenwood Springs and Dotsero, about 18 miles east, according to the department. Glenwood Springs is about 120 miles west of Denver. It is unclear when construction crews will complete enough work to open at least part of the roadway. About 20 boulders struck the interstate shortly after midnight, the transportation department said. They ranged from 3 feet to 10 feet in diameter, with the largest weighing an estimated 66 tons, the department said on its Web site. About eight holes or dips were left on the interstate. Road underwiring was exposed and rock crumbles surrounded the damage, the department said. The largest hole measured 20 feet by 10 feet -- bigger than a full-size SUV. Rocks were scattered over a 100-yard stretch of the road. A steel guard rail and median barrier were also damaged. The damage resembles a major rock slide in the area back in 2004, the department said.","Rock slide at Glenwood Canyon halts travel on I-70 between Glenwood Springs and Dotsero .

"(CNN) -- Move over, Emma. There's a new queen in town. Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names, released Saturday. Jacob, on the other hand, held on as the most popular boy's name for the 11th year in a row. The Social Security Administration started compiling name lists in 1997. And as in years past, the influence of pop culture is reflected in the names picked for newborns. The boy's name that rocketed up the list the fastest is Cullen -- the name of the lead character in the popular ""Twilight"" book series. Cullen's girlfriend in the books is Bella, short for Isabella. On the girls' side, the fastest riser is Maliyah, an altered version of the name of President Obama's daughter Malia -- which also is among the top 10 fast risers. But parents are equally quick to drop celebrity-inspired names once they think the popularity is passe. Among the biggest drops last year were Mylee and Miley, as in singer Miley Cyrus. Also on the outs: Lindsay and Jonas (think actress Lindsay Lohan and the band Jonas Brothers). Meanwhile, Barack continued to move up the list. Sixty-nine Baracks were born in 2009, the agency said. As always, religious names retained their popularity -- even if some were somewhat unconventional. Among the popular names are Nevaeh (heaven spelled backward) for girls, and Messiah for boys. The 10 most popular girls' names, in order, are: Isabella, Emma, Olivia, Sophia, Ava, Emily, Madison, Abigail, Chloe and Mia. The 10 most popular boys' name, also in order, are: Jacob, Ethan, Michael, Alexander, William, Joshua, Daniel, Jayden, Noah and Anthony.","Isabella has replaced Emma as the most popular name for newborn girls in U.S.

"(CNN) -- A voluntary recall has been issued for more than 40 over-the-counter drugs for children, including Tylenol and Motrin, because they don't meet quality standards. ""This recall is not being undertaken on the basis of adverse medical events,"" McNeil Consumer Healthcare said in a statement Friday. ""However, as a precautionary measure, parents and caregivers should not administer these products to their children."" FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg gave a similar recommendation in a statement Saturday, saying, ""we want to be certain that consumers discontinue using these products,"" though she called the chance for serious health problems ""remote."" ""Some products in the recall may have a higher concentration of active ingredient than specified while others may have inactive ingredients that don't meet testing requirements, the company said. The company said it issued the recall after consulting with the Food and Drug Administration. The affected brands include: Tylenol Infants' Drops, Children's Tylenol Suspensions, Children's Tylenol Plus Suspensions, Motrin Infant Drops, Children's Motrin Suspensions, Children's Zyrtec Liquids in Bottles and Children's Benadryl Allergy Liquids in Bottles. The drugs were made in the United States and distributed to Canada, the Dominican Republic, Dubai, Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad & Tobago and Kuwait. ""There are a number of other products on the market, including generic versions of the recalled products, which are intended for use in infants and children and are not affected by the recall,"" the FDA said Saturday in issuing guidance to parents.

"(CNN) -- Security forces have arrested 11 al Qaeda suspects in the Yemeni capital, the nation's official news agency reported Thursday. One man was killed in the operation, according to a security source cited by SABA. Yemeni authorities have threatened punishment for people who harbor suspected terrorists. The warnings are part of a crackdown on alleged al Qaeda hideouts since the attempted bombing of an American airliner in December, according to SABA. The suspect in the failed attack, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, spent time in Yemen and is said to have acquired the explosive device from someone in that country. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has claimed responsibility for the plot. The Obama administration has recognized the risks posed by Yemen becoming a failed state and voiced support in its struggles against terrorism. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also has pressed Yemen to implement key reforms and shore up its faltering economy. ""Yemen's challenges are not going to be solved by military action alone,"" she said at a recent meeting of Western powers and Arab nations. ""Progress against violent extremists and progress toward a better future for the Yemeni people ... will also depend on fortifying development efforts.""","Yemen has threatened punishment for people who harbor terror suspects .

"(CNN) -- A pregnant bartender says she is fighting to keep her job at a gentlemen's club in New York. Jennifer Paviglianiti, of Centereach, N.Y., claims her employer, Café Royale, discriminated against her because of her pregnancy. She filed a claim with the EEOC earlier this month. Paviglianiti says she feared how her boss would react to her pregnancy and wanted to wait a few months to tell him. However, John Doxey found out before she could tell him, and that's when Paviglianiti claims her job became threatened. Up until she became pregnant, the 29-year-old says she had been one of the club's most popular bartenders. Read the complaint . She says she ""bonused 9 times"" since August and it was only toward the end of her pregnancy that she asked for different hours. Due to the tough economy, Paviglianiti says she needed this specific bartending job and feared she'd soon be out of work. To protect herself, she decided to secretly record her boss on tape. On those recordings Doxey can be heard saying, ""Customers don't wanna come in and see a pregnant woman behind the bar!"" These recordings were also submitted in her EEOC discrimination claim. In other recordings, Doxey is heard suggesting that Paviglianiti's appearance is hurting business. ""Maybe they don't go there because the bartender is pregnant and doesn't look sexy."" Workplace attorney Robin Bond said it's within Doxey's right to do this if employees were informed that they had to maintain a specific ""sexy look"" to qualify for the job. In this case, that means Paviglianiti would have had to be hired as a ""model and a bartender"" and get a written agreement to this -- as is done in the casino industry, Bond said on HLN Prime News with Mike Galanos. When asked by Galanos if she signed any paperwork of that sort, Paviglianiti said, ""not at all ... nothing."" Paviglianiti was taken off the bartending schedule for a few weeks, during which she hired an attorney. She later returned to the club as a cashier but claims she made much less than she did as a bartender. However, Doxey's attorney says this proves she was never fired and her job duties were only adjusted to accommodate her pregnancy. ""My client declines to comment on pending legal action except to say it considers that Ms. Paviglianiti allegations are without merit,"" attorney Robert F. Milman said in a statement. ""Ms. Paviglianiti was not terminated from her employment, she presently is on maternity leave and she has the right to return to work upon the conclusion of her leave."" Paviglianiti is due to have a baby girl this week.","Jennifer Paviglianiti says boss reduced hours, put her on cashier because of pregnancy .

"New York (CNN) -- When writer-actor John Leguizamo shows up to do a show in New York, fans outside the theater are surprised to see him ride up on a bicycle. ""People go, 'Hey, John, I thought you'd be in a limo.' ""This is my limo, my green limo. I'm saving the planet for your kids and your grandkids,"" says the performer, who has starred in award-winning one-man shows on Broadway and appeared in dozens of films and TV shows. Biking gets you places faster, reduces your carbon footprint, lowers noise, makes you fit and lowers your stress level -- unless you get impaled on the door of a suddenly opened cab or cut off by a guy from New Jersey. Leguizamo thinks urban biking is a form of transportation that dramatically improves the environment and riders' physical and mental health. New York City's government shares Leguizamo's enthusiasm about biking, having added 200 miles of bike lanes in the past three years. The city says it has seen a 45 percent increase in commuting by bike. Leguizamo took CNN on a tour of his favorite biking spots and shared his thoughts about the best way to get anywhere fast in the nation's biggest city: . CNN: How long have you been biking? Leguizamo: I started biking when I was 7 years old, and I've been biking in Manhattan ever since I got that first bike. I grew up in Queens. Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, Astoria, Corona, I started going to high school in Manhattan when I was 15, and I moved to Manhattan when I started going to NYU. In high school, on the weekends I would bike to Central Park over the 59th Street bridge. Very Paul Simon and Garfunkel. At NYU, my bike was stolen. The pole I locked it to was a fake pole, and I came back and the pole was gone. I thought at first that I had chained my bike on a different block, but then I realized there was a hole in the concrete. CNN: Why should people bike? Leguizamo: There are a lot of great reasons. First of all, we all want to lower our carbon footprint, and this is one of the great ways, reduce pollution, reduce traffic, reduce noise pollution, improve your heart with reduced stress. When you're out there, it makes you friendlier. You get a little bike rage, but that's only when people cross you. I usually get to places with a lot of great energy and a lot more relaxed. I just saw this old good lady, she must have been in her late 60s, and she had like an adult tricycle, and she had her guitar in the back and a loud horn, and she was smiling and biking down Fifth Avenue. It was great. And for a lot of people who can't run, biking is a lot less stress on your knees. CNN: What are the biggest risks of biking in New York City? Leguizamo: Kamikaze cabs, buses, tourists, people from New Jersey. A Jersey plate will always try to cut you off for sure. And you know Miami and Connecticut plates are always going to go way slow, but that's not as dangerous. And then the crazy pedestrian that comes out between two big vans that block the view, that jump out. There's more danger for them than for you, but you don't want to hurt nobody, either. Opening the door on the street side, my God, that's the most dangerous: passengers opening up the street door instead of the curb door. That should be taught in school. That should be part of your SATs. It's amazing too the amount of cursing you hear from drivers, bikers, cabbies. You learn to curse in every language. CNN: How can you get started biking? Leguizamo: Start slowly in parks until you get maximum skill, and then start taking less busy streets. Just go slow. Don't try to race. If you go slow, you will learn all the urban tactics that you need for biking in Manhattan. You will learn that people are going to do the craziest things. People are going to cut you off. Expect the unexpected at every second. You gotta look for potholes, doors swinging, pedestrians. It's a massive amount of focus. But the fact that you survive and you're home, you feel incredible. And it's so great. It relieves so much stress. I always lose weight. It keeps my cardio up, too. Every time I get tested, they say, ""You have the heart of a 20-year old."" They're not talking about my liver. CNN: What about the equipment you need? Leguizamo: Get a recycled bicycle, recycle a bicycle, you know, something old and beat up. If you can't and you're too high-maintenance, get something really fancy and wreck it. Get sandpaper and a screwdriver, and you got to mess it up. Because if it looks shiny and nice, no matter what massive lock you have, somebody's going to cut it. If you recycle a bicycle, you get the cheapest lock, and you don't have to carry that massive chain that will weigh you down. You got to have some rain fenders, some rain guards, or then you can only bike and be messy. You can't bike in your suit as much if it rains. And if you're going to ride at night, you've got to have lights, either on your bike or your helmet. I like it on the helmet because people can really see you. And get a front light and a back light. And you need something for the hem of your pants. Either tuck them in your sock or get one of those little pant grips. When I don't pay attention, my jeans have gotten caught many times on the chain. Wear elbow pads, wrist guards, a Kevlar vest. It's Manhattan. Although we're not the murder capital any more. Is it Philadelphia? Or Arkansas? CNN: What about the tourists who come to New York? Should they try biking at all? Leguizamo: No, not in Manhattan. You have to know what you're doing. You can bike on the West Side Highway. That's good for kids and tourists. In Manhattan, you need to know the terrain. You gotta be alert and know what those signs of danger are. If you're a tourist, you're going to be looking at the Empire State Building. ""Look at how big and beautiful all those Art Deco buildings are."" All of a sudden: Pow. Crash.","John Leguizamo thinks urban biking is a winner all-around .

"(CNN) -- British world champion Amir Khan retained his World Boxing Association (WBA) light-welterweight title on Saturday night with a clinical stopppage victory over challenger Paulie Malignaggi at Madison Square Garden, New York. The 23-year-old Khan, who was making his big-fight debut on American soil, impressed throughtout with his speed and power before eventually stopping his opponent in the 11th round of the 12-round contest. Khan, who was ahead on all three of the judges scorecards when the referee stopped the fight one minute and 25 seconds into the round, improves his record to 23-1, while Malignaggi -- who lost to Khan's compatriot Ricky Hatton in 2008 -- was slumping to the fourth defeat of his career. There had been bad blood between both fighters and their respective camps in the lead-up to the contest, including a scuffle during the weigh-in, but the actual bout passed off without any incidents of that nature. Former Olympic silver medallist Khan told ESPN: ""I'm making 140lb easy, I feel strong. ""I'm not leaving 140lb until I unify the title. Until I'm number one I'm not going to leave this division."" ""We stuck to the game plan, we knew Paulie is a very awkward fighter, he's a great boxer, great at moving. ""We had to break him down slowly, we didn't want to run in there trying to knock him out because we would have got caught with shots. I knew in the last few rounds I was hurting him and all I had to do was put the pressure on him.""","British world champion Amir Khan retains his WBA light-welterweight title .

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma's governor Tuesday declared states of emergency in 56 counties following a string of deadly tornadoes and severe storms that swept through the area the day before. Gov. Brad Henry took an aerial tour of one of the hardest hit areas Tuesday afternoon. ""I lost track of the number of damaged and destroyed homes that we saw,"" Henry said. ""Literally hundreds and I think thousands of homes have received damage in these storms, and many, many of those homes have been destroyed."" Are you there? Send images, video . ""Even though central Oklahoma was the hardest hit, this storm really was a statewide event, and there is damage and destruction throughout the state,"" he said. The governor said that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano assured him ""that FEMA would act very, very quickly on our request for a presidential disaster (declaration) and federal aid."" Meanwhile, a maze of downed power lines and wrecked homes in parts of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, hindered search-and-rescue efforts Tuesday as authorities worked to ensure no more victims of Monday's tornadoes lay in the rubble. The state Department of Emergency Management lowered its death toll from five to two, saying that three children had been erroneously reported dead. The children are in critical condition, the state said. Their mother was one of the two dead. More than 100 people were treated for various injuries, the state said. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said 80 homes and businesses in the city were destroyed by the storm, which he called ""probably the most significant"" to hit during his seven years in office. The storm system that swept through the state on Monday spawned multiple tornadoes and dropped softball-sized hail. More bad weather was on the way Tuesday, and the National Weather Service warned Oklahomans to prepare for severe storms Tuesday afternoon and early evening. Tornado watch in western Oklahoma . Officials said they planned to release more detailed damage estimates Tuesday and decide how to manage cleanup efforts in areas where tornadoes left behind snapped utility poles, downed trees and severely damaged homes. In Norman, Oklahoma, south of Oklahoma City, mobile homes were blown to pieces in one neighborhood, where debris littered yards and streets alongside large trees ripped straight from the ground. Watch iReport video of tornado in Norman, Oklahoma . Norman resident and CNN iReporter Erica Loftis said she spotted the funnel cloud from Interstate 40 while headed to her parents' home and could see it headed toward the home when she arrived. She and her parents took shelter in a small cement room with steel doors, where they could feel their ears popping and hear the storm ripping away parts of the house around them. ""You could feel the pressure - it was scary,"" Loftis said. Outside, the sound of ""screeching metal"" filled the air, she said. Afterward, all the home's windows were broken, its chimney was blown into a neighbor's yard and the garage door was sucked in. In addition, a boat from a nearby marine store ended up in one of their trees, she said. And a truck stop east of Oklahoma City was demolished, taking a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, according to a spokeswoman for Love's Travel Stops and Country Stores. But motorists who pulled off the interstate to take cover were ushered into the truck stop's large coolers and restrooms before the tornado tore the roof off the building, blew out car windows and overturned tractor-trailers, spokeswoman Christina Dukeman said. Love's employee Charlescie Greenway said she and two other women made it to one cooler before the twister hit. ""The three of us were kind of trapped in there, holding the door shut, praying to God that we don't die and that everybody else was safe,"" Greenway told CNN affiliate KWTV, adding, ""it was really scary -- the wind was like trying to pull the door off the latch."" Cornett said quick thinking by the truck stop's employees saved people inside. ""They were all huddled into a cooler and all walked out alive,"" he said. More than 65,000 homes and businesses were without power throughout the state, emergency management officials said. Nearly 15,000 homes were without power in Norman alone, according to Oklahoma Gas & Electric. The Lake Draper Water Treatment Plant, which provides about half of Oklahoma City's water, was also without power, City Manager Jim Couch said. Because of the outage, city officials placed a ban on outside watering for 48 hours, he said. ""It's unknown when that power will be restored,"" he said. ""Major transmission lines in the area have been damaged."" State emergency officials said more than 100 homes were destroyed and another 70 sustained major damage. Additionally, 43 businesses were destroyed. CNN's Tyson Wheatley contributed to this report.","NEW: State officials lower death toll from five to two .

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao is threatening Floyd Mayweather Jr. with legal action following a row over drugs testing which leaves their proposed super-bout next year in doubt. Pacquiao is refusing to agree to a demand by the Mayweather camp to undergo Olympic style blood-screening in the run up to the fight, which is penciled in for the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on March 13. Boxing commentators had suggested that the war of words was a pre-fight tactic by the Mayweather camp and his promoter, Golden Boy Promotions, to unsettle the Filipino, who has hit back with an angry statement on his personal Web site. ""Enough is enough. These people, Mayweather Sr, Jr, and Golden Boy Promotions, think it is a joke and a right to accuse someone wrongly of using steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs,"" it read. ""I have tried to just brush it off as a mere pre-fight ploy but I think they have gone overboard "" Pacquiao, who became a five-weight world champion by beating Puerto Rican Miguel Cotto in November, claimed he would now be calling in the lawyers. ""I have instructed my promoter, Bob Arum, head of Top Rank Inc, to help me out in the filing of the case as soon as possible because I have had people coming over to me now asking if I really take performance-enhancing drugs and I have cheated my way into becoming the number one boxer in the world. ""I maintain and assure everyone that I have not used any form or kind of steroids and that my way to the top is a result of hard work, hard work, hard work and a lot of blood spilled from my past battles in the ring, not outside of it. ""I have no idea what steroids look like and my fear in God has kept me safe and victorious through all these years."" The row started earlier this week when Mayweather's promoters Golden Boy Promotions went public with their demands for blood-testing, as mandated by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and making it a condition before the super-fight went ahead. But Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach said this was not necessary under the rules governing fights in Nevada and was mind games by the Mayweather camp. ""We have passed every test ever given to us. We go by the commission rules, since when does the fighter make up the rules?, "" he said. Mayweather himself has largely kept his counsel but told the Golden Boy Promotions Web site that he hoped his possible opponent would change his mind. ""I understand Pacquiao not liking having his blood taken, because frankly I don't know anyone who really does,"" Mayweather said. ""I hope this is either some miscommunication or that Manny will change his mind and step up and allow these tests, which were good enough for all these other great athletes, to be performed by USADA."" But Pacquiao in his message posted on Christmas Day showed little sign of extending the festive spirit to the unbeaten Mayweather. ""To Floyd, despite all these accusations, may your Christmas be merry and I will see you in court, soon,"" he added.","Manny Pacquiao threatens Floyd Mayweather and his camp with legal action over a drug-testing row .

"(CNN)  -- The FBI in Seattle, Washington, is looking into allegations of civil rights violations in the case of a police officer caught on video kicking a Latino detainee, an agent said Wednesday. The preliminary inquiry comes a day after the NAACP sent a letter to the King County prosecuting attorney's office requesting Seattle police Detective Shandy Cobane be charged with malicious harassment, a hate crime. Video captured by a freelance video photographer April 17 shows Cobane using racial slurs against the detainee and kicking him in the head, and another officer stomping on his leg while he is lying face down on the ground without handcuffs. The second officer was identified this week as Mary Lynne Woollum, Seattle police said. The detainee was released after officers determined he was a not a suspect in an armed robbery, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. ""We give officers guns, batons and badges with the hope that they will not violate our public trust, with the hope that they will enforce the law, provide public safety and honor the Constitution,"" James Bible, president of the Seattle chapter of the NAACP, said Tuesday in denouncing the police officers' actions. ""In this specific case ... the Constitution was violated in a most egregious way. ... We have no choice but to request that charges be filed."" FBI Special Agent Fred Gutt told CNN Wednesday that investigators will gather information on the incident and send it to the Civil Rights Section of the U.S. Department of Justice. ""They will then decide if a formal investigation is warranted,"" he said. Cobane issued a tearful apology Friday after the video was shown on local news stations. In the statement, Cobane called his comments ""offensive and unprofessional"" and said they ""do not reflect who I am or what I am as a person nor as a member of the Seattle Police Department."" Cobane, a 15-year veteran, and Woollum, a veteran of more than 10 years, have been placed on administrative reassignment while investigations are under way, according to Seattle police.

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's new Cabinet held its first meeting Thursday and promptly agreed to a five-percent pay cut for all new ministers, Downing Street said. Tackling the country's debt crisis is a top priority for new Prime Minister David Cameron, who took office Wednesday. The decision means all members of the new Cabinet -- including Cameron -- will be paid five-percent less than their predecessors in the government of Gordon Brown, Downing Street said. The reduction in Cabinet minister salaries alone will save taxpayers about £50,000 ($73,800) this year, Downing Street said. The Cabinet also agreed to a ministerial pay freeze for the lifetime of the current Parliament, which is not scheduled to have elections again for another five years. The salary cuts and pay freeze will save approximately £3 million ($4.4 million) over the life of the Parliament, Downing Street said. Every member of Parliament receives a basic annual salary of £65,737 ($97,105). Those who are members of the Cabinet receive an additional salary on top of that, with the amount depending on their position. The additional salary can range from about £69,000 to about £134,500 ($101,500 to $198,000). For Cameron, the pay cut means he will earn £142,500 ($210,000) in his role as prime minister, compared to the £150,000 ($220,000) earned by Brown, his office said. That's on top of the salary he receives as a member of Parliament, representing the constituency of Witney, about 65 miles northwest of London.","Tackling the country's towering budget deficit is a priority for UK's new government .

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao is aiming to deliver a knockout blow to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in the U.S. courts after filing a lawsuit against the American and his connections over claims he used performance-enhancing drugs. The lawsuit, lodged in the Las Vegas district court on Wednesday, names Mayweather, his father Floyd senior, former boxing star Oscar De La Hoya and fellow Golden Boy Promotions executive Richard Schaefer. ""Calling a professional athlete a cheater is the most serious charge one can make,"" the lawsuit says, ""and in today's world, accusing an athlete of using performance-enhancing drugs -- however baseless and lacking in evidence -- is toxic."" The Filipino fighter, who has won world titles at five different weights, was slated to fight Mayweather on March 13 next year in a money-spinning bout in Las Vegas. But he was infuriated by the insistence of Mayweather's camp that he undergo Olympic-style pre-fight blood testing and the alleged implication that he had used illegal drugs. Pacquiao posted a Christmas day message on his personal Web site, saying he would take legal action and has now followed through on the threat. Top lawyer Daniel Petrocelli is representing him and outlined the substance of their case. ""Manny Pacquiao's achievements come from God-given talent and an indefatigable work ethic -- not steroids,"" he told gathered reporters. ""He cannot and will not allow others to deliberately misrepresent his years of hard work and tarnish his reputation."" The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000 dollars and also cites interviews given in various publications that appeared to question the fairness of Pacquiao's pre-fight preparation. Mayweather's connections attempted to diffuse the situation in a statement issued earlier this weak on the Golden Boy Promotions Web site. ""Let it be very clear that nobody from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions is accusing Pacquiao of anything,"" it read. ""But the reality seems to be that for whatever reason Pacquiao does not want to participate in random blood testing, which has already been deemed a harmless procedure that many current athletes are subjected to prior to and during competition,"" it added. Many viewed the war of words between the respective camps as a pre-fight war ploy to boost interest, but the row over dope testing may well have derailed one of the richest fights in boxing history, with huge pay-per-view revenues forecasted. The Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum was pessimistic about a March showdown between the two fighters. ""This is only my opinion, but I don't see the fight happening now,"" he was quoted. Positions are hardening ... Manny's fit to be tied. He's very angry."" Arum was also reported to have opened negotiations with World Boxing Association super welterweight champion Yuri Foreman to fight Pacquiao.","Manny Pacquiao files lawsuit in Las Vegas against Floyd Mayweather Jr. and his connections .

"(Mashable) -- Social media management company Vitrue released a free tool Thursday, the Social Page Evaluator, designed to help marketers get a better understanding of a Facebook page's value. Just submit a Facebook page URL and the app will come up with a valuation based on factors like number of fans, number of posts per day, number of interactions and so forth.ssss . It's a cool -- if not completely scientific -- way to gauge the potential value of your Facebook page to advertisers. The formula used by the Social Page Evaluator is related to the formula that Vitrue released last month to estimate the relative value of Facebook Fans to big brands. The tool, which was built over 63 hours in a Startup Weekend-style project, is adjustable and interactive. For instance, the base rate of Earned Media Value (or CPM in more traditional terms) is $5, but this can be adjusted to a higher or lower value depending on the brand in question. Likewise, there is a ""Fan-tasize"" section that lets you manipulate other features like number of posts per day, engagement level and Fan count to see how that affects the valuation. You can also compare a Facebook Page with up to three other brands at a time and view a Page's value history. In addition to the valuation data, there is also a list of best practices for getting the most out of your Facebook Page. So how accurate is this tool? It's difficult to determine, as it is based on a formula that, while derived from a study of large brands, is obviously not going to be applicable to all companies. Still, it's a fun, easy way to get an idea of the factors that impact a Facebook Page valuation. It's also a good stepping stone for marketers to start thinking about the potential advertising power of a Facebook Page. What do you think of the tool? Let us know! © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- Frustrated Democrats went to the Senate floor Friday to seek Republican approval for a long list of administration nominees currently blocked by controversial secret holds placed by GOP senators. But a Republican senator objected to each of them as they came up. ""Most of the people on the list, we don't know why they're sitting there. We don't even know who's making them sit there,"" complained Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, who is spearheading Democratic efforts to banish secret holds. ""Enter stage left, the anonymous hold. Or as I like to call it, nobody can blame me cause they don't know who I am."" McCaskill said the delay in approving these nominees is particularly agonizing because most of them passed out of committee with little or no opposition. ""If there is a legitimate complaint or grievance against any nominee, I think any senator has a right to be heard and appeal to the body for a vote,"" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the number two Democrat, said Thursday. ""But secret holds, I think, have become a reprehensible part of the process here and need to end."" Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, was the lone Republican on the floor Friday during the nearly two-hour debate on the issue. He objected to Democratic requests to approve the nominees not because he personally opposes them but ""as courtesy to people on my side of the aisle who have problems with some of these nominees."" Coburn said Republicans have a right to a public debate on nominees they oppose and Democrats are trying to get around that by seeking unanimous consent to quickly confirm them. In fact, Coburn won praise from McCaskill because she said he is the only Republican senator who has made his holds public. Democrats are especially upset because they think most Republicans are getting around a Senate rule adopted three years ago that requires senators to make public their holds once they've had them in place for six legislative days. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, called the practice ""hold-laundering,"" which is when senators rotate a secret hold off to one another before hitting the six-day trigger for making their names public and thereby keep a hold in place indefinitely. Republicans don't deny using the method but argue it's allowed by Senate rules which could be changed if Democrats want. ""If they think the rule needs to be tightened up they can offer to change the rule,"" suggested a GOP leadership aide. In fact, Democrats said an effort is under way to offer an amendment to the financial regulations bill currently on the floor to shorten the six-day window to two days. Democrats complain the secret holds keep the Obama administration from being able to effectively govern and point to one nominee, Michael Huerta, to be the No. 2 official at the Federal Aviation Administration, as an example of a key appointee stalled by an anonymous senator. At a news conference on Thursday, Durbin said that Republicans that day had finally lifted a hold and approved the nomination of a top National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official only after feeling pressured because of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. ""If they're going to move this appointee ... because of an oil spill, what does it take to move the deputy administrator of the FAA in charge of air safety,"" Durbin asked. ""Fill in the blanks."" Asked about Democratic concerns over the issue earlier this week, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky acknowledged, ""We've always had a challenging environment in the Senate with regard to the confirmation of executive branch appointments. This administration's been treated about the same as previous administrations in terms of the pace of confirmations."" Democrats disputed that notion and cited figures suggesting Obama's nominees are moving slower than George W. Bush's at this time in his presidency. A top Republican senator accused Democrats also of using rotating holds. ""What I have run into in trying to get a bill or an amendment in the Senate in the past is the same practice,"" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate. ""Where the Democrats would have a hold on it and you try to trace it down and you kind of have an idea of who it might be and you go to them, [they respond] 'No I don't,' and nobody ever knew because it was just rotated around.""","Senate Democrats seek approval of nominees they say GOP is blocking .

"(AOL Autos) -- With car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right, it's important to remember that today's automotive titans started out as tiny startups, not unlike Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. General Motors was almost called International Motors Co. Names like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Porsche call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today. But behind every brand name, there is a flesh-and-blood inventor, entrepreneur or industrialist. Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with. David Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble. Buick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars. Durant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it ""Boo-ick,"" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car. In another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the ""Hupp"" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s. Swiss-born Louis Chevrolet's experience was similar. Durant brought him into a new car-building venture in 1911, hoping to trade on his fame as an absolutely fearless race car driver. Chevrolet left the company in 1913, apparently unable to make the adjustment from racing to building production vehicles. But its name stuck to the new Chevrolet vehicles; Durant reportedly liked its musical lilt. It could also work the other way around. In 1925, Walter P. Chrysler got the naming rights to the Maxwell Motor Co. after he and another industrialist steadily bought up shares in the firm over a two-year period. Things turned out a little differently for Henry Ford. He suffered the ignominy of being booted from an early auto company that bore his own name. But his revenge was sweet. The Henry Ford Company, which traded freely on Ford's early fame as an inventor, fired him in 1902 ""because he was spending all his time developing a race car, not a passenger car,"" according to the Encyclopedia of American Business and Biography. AOL Autos: Ford's 'Wonder Woman' engineers most important new car . After Ford was gone, the company was renamed Cadillac, after Antoine Laumet de la Mothe Cadillac, the French nobleman who founded Detroit in 1703; his heraldry became the model's badge and the company became a part of General Motors in 1909. After his firing, Ford quickly found investors to help him found his own firm, the Ford Motor Co., in 1903. He introduced the company's first new vehicle, the Model and followed it up with other low-cost vehicles, including his greatest achievement, the Model T, in 1908. Its price tag started at $850 and fell steadily as Ford introduced more production innovations. The young firm became phenomenally successful. AOL Autos: 10 classic American rides . In the 1920s, he got the chance to buy the five-year-old Lincoln Motor Co. out of bankruptcy. It was then owned by one of the very people, Henry Leland, who fired him in 1902. Then he used the former aircraft company to launch his own line of luxury cars bearing the Lincoln name. For its part, General Motors almost didn't get the name it bears today. Durant actually incorporated his company under the name ""International Motors Co."", in New Jersey in 1908. But his attorney advised him that it would be easier to raise capital under a new name. ""We might use 'United Motors Company' were it not for the fact that there is already a United Motor Car Company in that state,"" the attorney wrote. ""We suggest the name General Motors Company, as we have ascertained it can be used."" A newly coined French word, auto-mobile, inspired many vehicle names of the early years. Inventor Ransom E. Olds filed a patent for an ""auto-mobile"" during the mid-1890s. Names like Bugmobile, Locomobile, Hupmobile, and of course, the Oldsmobile, could not have come along without it. The origins of some names can be tricky to trace. The first use of Jeep, for instance. is shrouded in mist. Jim Allen, the author of a book called ""Jeep,"" concludes that it's based on early World War II slang for ""a new, unproven recruit or a new unproven vehicle."" It wasn't until 1950 that Toledo-based Willys-Overland, Inc., one of the producers of the early four-wheel-drive vehicle, trademarked the term. Many of the names were not originally associated with the auto industry. The Toyota name came from the Toyoda loom works in Kariya, Japan; When it turned to car production, the Toyoda family changed the 'd' to a 't' to make it simpler and more elegant in Japanese script. AOL Autos: Top 10 best car names . There's little doubt about other brand names. Pontiac was an offshoot of the Pontiac Buggy Co., a horseless carriage manufacturer named after a renowned Indian chief. Mechanic Soichiro Honda started producing motorized bicycles after the devastation of World War II and eventually graduated to cars. AOL Autos: Pontiacs we'll never forget . Volkswagen, a response to Adolf Hitler's call for a car for the common folk, means 'people's car' in German, evidently beating out the prototype's name, 'Strength through Joy,' for the honors. In 1917, the Rapp Engine Works became known as the Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, or Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) as the four-year-old airplane engine firm diversified into motorcycle engines, with a stylized white propeller against a blue sky as its logo, according to some authorities. The first BMW cars were produced 11 years later. The legendary Jaguar name is considered one of the best sports car names of all time. It beat out a long list of lackluster animal names compiled by a British ad agency in 1935. In 1939, Ford struck gold with Mercury, the fleet-footed messenger of the gods. It tapped into Greek and Roman mythology for the name, just as it did for the similarly styled Lincoln Zephyr, the god of the wind, three years earlier. Some other storied automotive brands are based on acronyms. Fiat stands for Fabbrica Italiani Automobili Torino, or Italian Automotive Works Turin. Similarly, Saab stands for Svenska Aeroplanaktiebolaget, or Swedish Aeroplane Ltd., hearkening back to the automaker's origins as an aircraft company. Ford might have done better with an acronym in 1958. The Edsel was conceived as a new, distinct Ford Motor Co. brand, with its own models, badge and division. The mission was to take on GM's Oldsmobile. After considering thousands of suggestions, Ford named the new brand after Edsel Ford, Henry Ford's only child. He had been a major styling influence within the company and was its president at his fathers death in 1943. The name Edsel was an immediate letdown. Ford stock fell 10 points on the day it was announced. One disenchanted executive predicted that the name alone would cost the new vehicle 200,000 units in sales. AOL Autos: Best and worst automotive designs of all time . Its name wasn't the sole reason for its failure. It didn't help that the country was in recession or that the new car seemed based on Ford and Mercury models. But all that didn't stop Edsel from entering the vocabulary as an idea or project fated to failure.","David Buick invented the overhead valve engine, founded Buick Motor Car Co.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The identity and nationality of an alleged al Qaeda operative arrested in Pakistan remained shrouded in mystery and conflicting information Monday, a day after Pakistani officials said one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists was in custody. A Pakistani military official said Monday that the man arrested is a foreign operative linked to al Qaeda. The official did not specifically describe the man as American and gave no further details. On Sunday, a senior Pakistani government official said that Adam Gadahn, a U.S.-born spokesman for al Qaeda, had been arrested. A second senior Pakistani government official later confirmed Gadahn's arrest. But a U.S. intelligence official said there appeared to be no validity to the reports that Gadahn was in custody. Other U.S. officials also said they had no indication Gadahn had been captured. U.S. counterterrorism officials said Monday they had received no indication from Pakistan that any American had been arrested. One official said there was ""no validity"" to reports that Gadahn was arrested. Another called the reports ""bogus."" News reports Monday cited Pakistani officials as saying that a different man, believed to be an American member of al Qaeda, had been arrested. But U.S. counterterrorism officials said the United States has not heard of the person, who was identified in some reports as Abu Yahya Mujahdeen al-Adam, an American born in Pennsylvania. One official said the reports coming out of Pakistan were a ""real head scratcher."" Rick Snelsire, a spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Pakistan, said Monday that the embassy had not received any information about an American being detained by Pakistani security forces. Gadahn, 31, also known as Azzam the American, was indicted on charges of treason and providing material support to terrorists in 2006. The U.S. government has offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his capture. He is the first American charged with treason since 1952. Reports of an arrest Sunday came hours after Islamist Web sites posted video of Gadahn praising a November massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. On the video, Gadahn said the Army major charged with gunning down 13 people ""lit a path"" for other Muslim service members to follow. Authorities have targeted several key Islamist figures in Karachi -- the heavily populated port city and financial capital of Pakistan that, for some time, has functioned as a hideout for Taliban and al Qaeda sympathizers. A city of 13 million -- with some estimates saying there are 100,000 new arrivals a month -- Karachi has seen an influx of Pashtuns from the tribal border region with Afghanistan. Many fled there during fighting and Pakistani military offensives in the Northwest Frontier Province and Waziristan, making Karachi a comfortable place for the Taliban to blend in and count on a network of supporters.

"Kenner, Louisiana (CNN) -- A ""black rain"" of drilling fluid and a roar of escaping gas erupted from the doomed Deepwater Horizon shortly before the explosion that sank the oil rig, the captain of a nearby ship testified Tuesday. Alwin Landry's supply vessel Damon Bankston was alongside Deepwater Horizon at the time of the blast. Landry said the first sign of trouble was when drilling ""mud"" -- a mixture used to pressurize and lubricate the drills -- began falling onto the stern of his ship. ""We essentially closed the wheelhouse doors. I went to the port side, and I looked out up at the derrick. That's when I see the mud coming out of the top of the derrick,"" Landry told investigators Tuesday. When he radioed the rig's bridge, Landry said, its captain told him there were problems with the well and he should move his ship away. Seconds later, he said, he heard ""the percussion and the slight flash of green"" of an explosion. Deepwater Horizon sank April 22, two days after the explosion. The blast left 11 people aboard the rig presumed dead and uncorked a gusher of oil that has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico. Landry's testimony came on the first of two days of hearings by a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department panel. His ship picked up the rig's survivors, and Landry said the rig's captain, Curt Kutcha, told him he had tried to activate a ""kill switch"" that would cut off the well before abandoning the structure. The crew did not know whether it was working when they fled the burning rig, Landry told investigators. The federal Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that oversees offshore oil exploration, inspects drill rigs once a month, MMS inspector Eric Neal told the panel. Test results from the rig's blowout preventer, a massive device meant to cut off the well in an emergency, and drilling mud weights are reviewed as part of that process, he said. Neal inspected the rig April 1 and found no violations, he testified. But he did not inspect the preventer's emergency disconnect system, he said. The companies involved in the drilling process are blaming each other for the disaster. The chairman of well owner BP's American subsidiary, Lamar McKay, told a U.S. Senate committee Tuesday that rig owner/operator Transocean was responsible for the rig's operation and for testing its blowout preventer. But Transocean CEO Steven Newman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that the well's cementing, or the casing that holds the well in place, must have failed. BP, as the well's owner, was responsible for designing the casing, while oilfield services contractor Halliburton performed the cementing. ""Without a failure of one of those elements, the explosion could not have occurred,"" Newman said. And Halliburton's chief safety and environmental officer, Tim Probert, told the committee that responsibility lay with either Transocean or BP. During the cementing of the well, Halliburton simply followed BP's instructions, he said, and the blowout preventer was Transocean's responsibility.","Alwin Landry's supply vessel was alongside Deepwater Horizon at time of blast .

"(CNN) -- A ubiquitous Olive Garden TV commercial shows a picturesque cooking school in Italy as a voice croons words like ""artisanal"" and ""fonduta"" and smiling chefs in starched whites coats taste tomato sauce straight from a simmering pot and kiss their fingertips with glee. TV-watching skeptics turned to social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook to question the popular Italian chain's claim of ""culinary inspiration"" from Tuscany. Is this Culinary Institute of Tuscany, a bona fide bastion of learning? Or is it just an advertising fib? Yes, Virginia, there is an Olive Garden Culinary Institute of Tuscany -- though the ownership is somewhat shared. The Institute opens its doors to approximately 100 of the best-performing chefs and managers of U.S. Olive Garden Restaurants each winter for 11 weeks. It began these authentic Italian cooking lessons in 1999. ""During the rest of the year, the property, named Riserva di Fizzano, is a bed and breakfast, complete with the Rocca delle Macie winery, a guest house, a pool and a restaurant,"" Mark Jaronski, director of media and communications for Darden Restaurants, told CNN. Olive Garden is a member of the Orlando-based Darden family of restaurants alongside Red Lobster, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52. Olive Garden Head Chef Romana Neri runs the school in Italy. ""Chef Neri is an executive chef who lives in Tuscany,"" Jaronski said, adding Neri supports the chain's Executive Chef Paolo Lafata when he's at the Tuscany property. Culinary pilgrimages to learn the cuisine of foreign countries are nothing new for many chefs and restaurateurs: Julia Child went to France, Rick Bayless to Mexico. The skepticism from viewers comes when a chain restaurant asserts authenticity. Specialties inspired by the Culinary Institute of Tuscany are marked on Olive Garden's menu with a special Culinary Institute of Tuscany seal: including the likes of Chianti Braised Short Ribs, Grilled Shrimp Caprese and Smoked Mozzarella Fonduta. Members of the public can also take part in a similar one-week learning experience under the Tuscan sun at the 11th-century, 450-acre property -- if they win the restaurant's sweepstakes. Judith Wilson of Spanish Fork, Utah, 40 minutes away from the closest Olive Garden, was one of the 2009 contest winners. After hearing about the contest, she made daily entries and won. ""The cooking school took us in, and every day gave us lessons on all the different olive oils, cheeses, wines and how to complement your dinner with these choices,"" Wilson said. In the institute's off-season, the Riserva di Fizzano's restaurant, the Relais-Agriturism, serves up traditional Tuscan fare to the public. The Riserva also organizes cooking courses to educate visitors on Tuscan cuisine. Culinary institute skeptics or not, people are still embracing the ""hospitaliano"" -- Darden Restaurants reported in March that their fiscal third quarter U.S. same-restaurant sales increased 1.5 percent at Olive Garden.","The Olive Garden TV commercials are true; restaurant has cooking school in Italy .

Earlier, world number five Andy Roddick's preparations for the second grand slam of the year suffered a setback as he was forced to pull out of his match against Spain's Feliciano Lopez with a nasty stomach bug. ""I got here, and then on Sunday night through Monday evening I was up with a stomach virus. I was up for 24 hours vomiting, sweating, the whole deal, "" Roddick told the official ATP Tour Web site. Roddick has not played since winning the Miami Masters last month and said the illness had come at just the wrong time. ""It's very bad timing. I would've taken this virus any time in the last five weeks instead of now, but I guess that's the way it goes sometimes,"" he said. ""Playing well in Paris isn't totally out of the question, it's just going to be a little tough,"" he added. In the evening session, Britain's Andy Murray, seeded third showed improved form on clay with a 6-3 6-3 win over Juan Ignacio Chela, his fourth straight win over the Argentine. ""I was pleased with the win,"" said Murray. ""I served well and was able to move him around the court."" Meanwhile, Munich Open winner Mikhail Youzhny made an early exit to Latvian Ernest Gulbis 7-6 6-4 and 15th seed Stanislas Wawrinka set up a third-round showdown with world number one and Swiss compatriot Roger Federer after beating Leonardo Mayer, who was down 6-4 4-2 when he retired.","Rafael Nadal reaches third round of the Madrid Masters with straight sets win .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The bitter standoff between government troops and Red Shirt protesters in downtown Bangkok worsened Friday, the day after the wounding of a key protest leader aggravated the already deep tensions permeating the Thai capital. Hospital officials reported 16 people died in confrontations Friday in Bangkok, an urban fortress under siege and beset by gunfire, tear gas and stone-throwing. That followed the death of one person Thursday. The unrest boiled over after Thai authorities set a new deadline to seal off the Bangkok intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month. In addition to the deaths, more than 140 people were wounded in the violence, including four non-Thais -- a Pole, a Canadian, a Liberian and a Myanmarese. A government official said Thai forces were slowly getting control of the downtown area, with video footage showing soldiers shooting rounds toward the area with protesters. Among those wounded on Friday was a journalist from a French television station who was shot in the leg. What are protests about? The government said it was forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to vacate the intersection by Wednesday. Panitan Wattanayagorn, the acting government spokesman, said on Friday security forces who have been the objects of attacks have no choice but to respond. He told reporters that forces have been dutifully following the rules of engagement, which allows them to use live ammunition to protect themselves and their comrades. He assured Bangkok residents and foreigners there that the forces have no intention of harming anyone. The government, he said, is ""very confident"" it will be able to ""stabilize the situation"" and get it ""under control very soon."" Also, he said the prime minister is looking forward to working with others in hammering out reforms. The United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, has been demanding that Abhisit dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup. Tensions ramped up when Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol -- a renegade general better known as Seh Daeng, which means Red Commander -- was shot and wounded by a sniper's bullet on Thursday, an action that left him in critical condition. Seh Daeng was shot in the head while being interviewed by journalists in makeshift barricades set up by protesters. Thomas Fuller of The New York Times told CNN that the opposition leader was looking at him and answering questions when ""the bullet hit him in the forehead, from what I could tell."" Reporter: Bullet 'felt like it grazed my head' ""It looks like the bullet came over my head and struck him. I don't have any way of confirming this beyond what I remember from the scene, but it felt like it grazed my head,"" he said. Fuller, who said bamboo pikes and rubber tire barricades have been formed as a makeshift encampment by the protesters, said the opposition figure was facing out of the barricades and into Bangkok's business district of tall office buildings. ""He was standing in the same location for a while when I was talking to him but he was moving around, he was gesticulating,"" Fuller said. ""He wasn't standing still, he was bobbing his head."" iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . Seh Daeng did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards, but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat, Fuller said. Seh Daeng is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said. Some Thai opposition leaders see him as an impediment to a peaceful resolution to the political stalemate that has gripped Thai politics, the reporter said. ""He's a renegade in sort of all senses,"" Fuller said. ""He's a renegade from the army, a hardliner within the protest movement. He told me today he thought they (other opposition leaders) were being cowardly and he wanted to carry on.""","NEW: Hospitals say 16 people have been killed in Bangkok violence .

"(CNN) -- Admitted killer John Albert Gardner III bowed his head and wept at his sentencing Friday as the parents of his teen victims called him a monster and coward for raping and murdering their daughters. At the end of the hourlong hearing, the convicted sex offender was sentenced by Judge David Danielsen to three consecutive terms of life without parole for murdering Chelsea King and Amber Dubois and attacking a jogger. The case has sparked calls for tougher penalties against sex offenders. Dressed in a green jailhouse jumpsuit, his gaze on the floor, Gardner became emotional as the parents took turns attempting to articulate the agony of their losses before a packed courtroom in San Diego Superior Court. The themes of their statements alternated between celebrations of the teens' lives and expressions of rage directed at Gardner. ""Look at me,"" Kelly King, Chelsea's mother, tearfully demanded of her daughter's killer after taking the podium. She paused and waited as a red-faced Gardner slowly lifted his eyes, casting a quick glance at her before shutting them. ""What I feel is so much deeper than I ever dare to express in a public forum. There are things I'd like to say, but to protect my son and to maintain the dignity of my family, my words will be far too mild to adequately speak the disgusting truth about you,"" she said tearfully, trembling as she spoke. ""Chelsea was a sweet, loving and innocent soul who could not have fathomed the wretched piece of evil that ended her beautiful life on that day."" Gardner, 31, pleaded guilty April 16 to raping and murdering the San Diego-area teens in a deal with prosecutors that spared him the death penalty. He also pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit rape of a jogger who managed to fight him off. CNN does not name survivors of sexual assault. The young woman also addressed Gardner in open court Friday. ""As a runner, I've always gloried in the peace that comes in the utter solitude of a long run,"" said the woman, who was attacked in December 2009. ""In a single instance, this man took from me the safety and solitude of my own mind."" She said it was important for her to appear in court to represent the slain teens, despite the ""pain and guilt"" she feels as a survivor. ""I came here to stand today as a witness for Chelsea and Amber. I came to watch as justice is served for the horrifying acts he has committed,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""I come here today for all the women who have ever been victims of violence, to ask with Chelsea and Amber's voices to remove this man from our world, to make us a little safer by locking him up permanently. King was also running on a trail near the Rancho Bernardo Community Park on February 28 when Gardner attacked her and dragged her to a remote area, according to court documents. He raped and stabbed the 17-year-old and buried her body in a shallow grave. He was arrested three days later, after his DNA was matched to semen found on her clothes. During the emotional hearing, Gardner was called an animal, monster and sociopath. King's father, Brent, said the most appropriate name for the registered sex offender was ""coward."" ""As I thought about what I would say to you today, I realized that names like 'monster and 'animal' in a perverse way let you off the hook. You knew what you were doing when you chose to wait for and corner Chelsea,"" King said. ""The most fitting name for you is 'coward.' You are not a man. You are just a weak, pathetic coward who preys on unsuspecting young girls half your size. You are evil not because of some sickness or disease, so don't blame anything or anyone for your crimes. You intentionally chose evil and now you have to live with that evil festering inside you and eating you up as you rot in a prison cell for the rest of your life."" Dubois, 14,  was last seen alive walking to Escondido High School on February 13, 2009. She was considered a missing person for more than a year, until Gardner led authorities to her remains in March -- after his arrest in King's death -- in exchange for assurances that it would not be used against him in court. Gardner admitted to raping and stabbing Dubois and burying her in a shallow grave in a remote area near Pala, according to court documents. Without the plea deal, San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis said last month, her office did not have enough evidence to charge Gardner in the death of Dubois. After 15 months of wondering about her daughter, Dubois' mother said knowing her fate brought little closure. To understand her grief, Carrie McGonigle said, you had to know Dubois for the loving and gentle-hearted person known to friends and family -- a bookish animal lover who chose Barnes and Noble over the mall. ""The day she was abducted her backpack was filled with valentines for her friends and joy in her heart because she was carrying a check to adopt a baby lamb for a school project. To appreciate the profound kindness and love that has been stolen from my life, you only need to understand how truly excited she was about the opportunity to nurture another living thing."" In addition to the victim impact statements, the King family also submitted a video of their daughter's friends describing the vivacious teen's gift for bringing intense passion to music, athletics and personal relationships. ""The thing I love most about Chelsea was the conviction and passion for everything she did and everyone she loved,"" one male friend said. Not long after Gardner's arrest, King's parents vowed to push for tougher sentencing guidelines for violent sex offenders and more intensive monitoring of parolees. California's ""Chelsea's Law"" calls for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for any forcible sex crime against minors that includes one or more aggravating factors, including the victim's age or whether the victim was tied, bound or drugged. The bill also would institute more intensive monitoring of parolees and lifelong GPS tracking in some cases. Gardner's history with the state parole board also led Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to order a review of the system. He was paroled on September 26, 2005, after serving five years for two counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14 and one count of false imprisonment for attacking a 13-year-old neighbor. In September 2007, he incurred a parole violation when his parole agent found that the college he was living near had a day care center and he was asked to move. When it was determined that he had found compliant housing, he was discharged from parole and removed from GPS monitoring on September 26, 2008. Speaking to the court, Dubois' father lamented that the justice system did not heed the warning of a doctor who recommended that Gardner receive as much prison time as possible before his incarceration in 2000. "" 'The defendant does not suffer from a psychotic disorder. He is simply a bad guy who is inordinately interested in young girls,' "" Dubois said, quoting a report from psychiatrist Matthew Carroll, who evaluated Gardner. ""Again, I cannot help to ask on behalf of my family, who is at fault here? Is it this cold, heartless monster, is it the failures in the law enforcement systems or perhaps it is even us who have not forced and held accountable the people and the organizations who are supposed to protect us from these predators?"" Echoing statements he made at Gardner's plea hearing, Brent King said his family would have preferred the death penalty, but knew it was an ""empty promise"" in California. The father also laid blame on the killer's mother for not ensuring that he was registered at her address, a condition of his parole, or notifying police of his residency when the girls went missing. ""Your mother, Cathy Osborne, knew what you were capable of and did nothing to protect us from you. She knew who you were after you violently beat and tried to rape that poor 13-year-old girl a decade ago,"" he said. ""She harbored you, indulged you and put every child in our community at risk. ... Ms. Osborne, you have Chelsea's rape and murder and our pain on your soul."" Mary Duval, chief executive officer for the Sex Offender Solutions and Education Network, an advocacy group for registered sex offenders, said anger-induced legislation is not the answer. ""If the current reform efforts focus on punishing and restricting all former sex offenders instead of those who are the most dangerous, the goal of protecting children will once again be foiled due to anger, fear and misinformation ruling the day,"" she said. ""The facts of the Chelsea King and Amber DuBois cases should be enough to persuade politicians and the families to look for better answers.""","John Albert Gardner gets three consecutive terms of life without parole, waives appeals .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP will try again within the next day to cap a well that has gushed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the energy company said Friday. The latest attempt will involve inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe, collecting oil and sending it to a vessel on the surface, said Mark Proegler, a BP spokesman. The insertion tube was on the sea floor, and engineers planned to move it into place later in the day, Proegler said. The company has lowered a smaller containment dome for use if the insertion tube does not stem the flow of oil into the water, Proegler said. But Adm. Thad Allen, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, said twice Friday that the containment dome, referred to as a ""top hat,"" was the first choice, followed by the insertion tube. Officials could not explain the discrepancy. Neither procedure would be a permanent solution, Allen said Friday in Mississippi. The procedures, he said, ""will reduce the leakage, not stop the leakage."" The ultimate solution, Allen said, will be achieved by relief wells that are being drilled near the leak site. Those will take weeks, if not months, to complete, BP has said. After much discussion over whether the use of subsea dispersants could cause ecological damage, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said Friday that officials have concluded that it ""is an option we can consider and will move ahead with."" The decision was made after the results of three tests were analyzed, she said. ""This is not a decision that was made lightly, but it is a series of tradeoffs. You're really trying to minimize the impact on the environment as best as possible."" Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, said the company has spent more than $450 million responding to the spill and that more than 14,000 people are involved in the effort. To date, more than 1.2 million feet of boom have been deployed and another 400,000 feet of boom have been staged for deployment, he said. In all, the company is trying to accumulate 3.5 million feet of boom. The forecast this weekend and early next week ""looks very favorable to use all tools,"" he said, citing burning, skimming operations and use of surface and subsurface dispersants. Suttles said the spill has had ""limited impact"" on shore, with oil being found in four locations in Louisiana, two in Alabama and one in Mississippi. In Washington, President Barack Obama criticized executives from BP and two other companies for blaming each other for the catastrophe. ""It is absolutely essential that, going forward, we put in place every necessary safeguard and protection so that a tragedy like this oil spill does not happen again,"" Obama said after meeting Friday with Cabinet members to discuss the spill. Read about oil spill responses . ""This is a responsibility that all of us share,"" Obama said. ""The oil companies share it. The manufacturers of this equipment share it. The agencies in the federal government in charge of oversight share that responsibility. I will not tolerate more finger-pointing or irresponsibility."" BP's efforts to plug the leak come amid growing concern that the company has been low-balling how much oil has poured out of the well. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, sent BP a letter Friday asking for details from federal agencies about the methods they are using to analyze the oil leak. Markey, who chairs a congressional subcommittee on energy and the environment, said he would launch a formal inquiry after learning of independent estimates that are significantly higher than the amount BP officials have provided. ""The public needs to know the answers to very basic questions: how much oil is leaking into the Gulf and how much oil can be expected to end up on our shores and our ocean environment?"" Markey said in a letter to BP. ""I am concerned that an underestimation of the flow may be impeding the ability to solve the leak and handle management of the disaster."" Track the oil spill . BP has said since the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drill rig that about 5,000 barrels -- or 210,000 gallons -- have been pouring out of the well a day. The company says it reached that number using data, satellite images and consultation with the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""I think that's a good range,"" Suttles said Friday. But a researcher at Purdue University said BP's estimate is low. Associate Professor Steve Wereley said that about 70,000 barrels of oil are leaking each day, based on an analysis of video of the spill. ""You can't say with precision, but you can see there's definitely more coming out of that pipe than people thought,"" he said. ""It's definitely not 5,000 barrels a day."" A BP executive rejected that assertion Friday. ""Well, that's not what our experts, multiple experts, not only from BP, and the industry say,"" said Bob Dudley, BP managing director for the Americas and Asia. ""This crude is what's called a light-sweet crude. It has lots of gas and when it comes out, it expands very rapidly, a little bit like bubbles in a soda pop. So it's very difficult to look at it and say that the volume will be much higher. We certainly don't see that at the surface."" The dispute over the size of the leak caps a week in which congressional committees grilled executives from BP and two other companies: drilling contractor Transocean Ltd., which owned the rig, and oilfield services contractor Halliburton, which was responsible for cementing the well shut once drilled. The companies blamed each other. BP pointed to Transocean, which said BP was responsible for the wellhead's design and Halliburton was responsible for the cement finishing work. Halliburton, in turn, said its workers were just following BP's orders, but that Transocean was responsible for maintaining the rig's blowout preventer. iReport: Send your photos, videos . Obama took exception Friday. ""I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter,"" the president said. ""You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."" Obama said the federal government also was taking responsibility for its role. ""For too long, for a decade or more, there's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill,"" Obama said. ""It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies. ""That cannot and will not happen anymore. To borrow an old phrase, we will trust, but we will verify."" As a result, Obama said, the Mineral Management Service will be restructured, with the part of the agency that permits oil and gas drilling and collects royalties separated from the part of the agency in charge of inspecting the safety of oil rigs and platforms and enforcing the law. ""That way, there's no conflict of interest, real or perceived,"" Obama said. In addition, Obama said, the administration has ordered immediate inspections of all deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico, and no drilling permits will be issued until a 30-day safety-and-environmental review is completed. Obama also announced a new examination of the environmental procedures for oil and gas exploration and development. Learn more about efforts to stop the leak . BP, the Coast Guard and state and local authorities have scrambled to keep the oil from reaching shore or the ecologically delicate coastal wetlands off Louisiana. They have burned off patches of the slick, deployed more than 280 miles of protective booms, skimmed as much as 4 million gallons of oily water off the surface of the Gulf and pumped more than 400,000 gallons of chemical dispersants onto the oil. On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed off to fishing another part of the Gulf of Mexico over which the federal government has jurisdiction. NOAA has now closed 19,377 square miles (50,187 square kilometers), which is 8 percent of the Gulf area within 200 miles of the coast, called an exclusive economic zone. The closed area a week earlier had been 4.5 percent. Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the April 20 explosion at the rig, which sank two days later. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead. CNN's Eric Fiegel, Brian Todd and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: Subsea dispersants 'an option we ... will move ahead with'

"(CNN) -- Much of the Central Plains and Midwest braced for another day of potentially severe weather as residents of Oklahoma cleaned up from a deadly outbreak of tornadoes this week. The National Weather Service said severe thunderstorms were possible Wednesday across large sections of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, as well as parts of Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, forecast an outbreak of powerful thunderstorms in the late afternoon and into the evening -- some with large hail. The deadly storm system that swept through Oklahoma on Monday spawned multiple tornadoes and dropped softball-sized hail. Two people died and more than 100 people were treated for various injuries, the state Department of Emergency Management reported. Gov.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A mechanical problem prevented BP from inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe that would help siphon off oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, BP official Doug Suttles said Saturday. Suttles said the device was hoisted back to the surface Friday for readjustments and the company expects to have it working by Saturday night. The plan is for the mile-long tube to collect the oil and send it to a surface vessel. Millions of gallons of crude have gushed into the Gulf since the fiery explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig more than three weeks ago. Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, cautioned that the method is designed to contain  the flow, not stop it. The tactic was dealt a setback Friday night when the frame holding the insertion tube shifted and prevented the surface vessel from connecting to it, Suttles said. Meanwhile, Suttles said the application of underwater dispersants -- a tactic approved for use Friday -- ""appears"" to be working. ""The oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations,"" he said after flying over the area Saturday. He did not provide further details. What are oil dispersants? The Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the decision to use subsea dispersants is an ""important step"" at reducing potential damage from the spill, because dispersant can be more effective underwater than on the ocean's surface. Oil dispersants are chemicals that can break the oil down into small drops and prevent it from reaching the surface or the shore. Dispersants are generally less harmful than the oil itself, which is highly toxic, and they biodegrade more quickly, the Coast Guard said. The underwater gusher began after an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. The explosion and subsequent fire caused the Deepwater Horizon to sink two days later, prompting oil to begin spilling from the well. BP was leasing the rig from Transocean. On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security released a letter from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar addressed to BPchief executive Anthony Hayward, calling on the company to state its ""true intentions"" for compensating those affected by the spill. ""The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill may prove to be one of the most devastating environmental disasters this nation has ever faced,"" said the letter, which was dated Friday. ""As one of the responsible parties for this event, BP is accountable to the American public for the full clean-up of this spill and all the economic loss caused by the spill and related events."" What can BP do to combat growing oil spill? The letter also asks BP to confirm it will not ""seek reimbursement from the American taxpayers, the United States government or the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for any amount.""

"(CNN)  -- Utah prosecutors announced Friday that they expect to file murder charges against the mother and stepfather of a 4-year-old boy whose disfigured body was found this week in a canyon near Salt Lake City, Utah. Local police said Ethan Sloop's body was buried in a shallow grave after he had been severely beaten, according to CNN affiliate KUTV. Nathan Sloop, 31, and Stephanie Sloop, 27, are being held without bail at a Davis County, Utah, jail. Davis County prosecutor Troy Rawlings said local authorities expect to charge the couple with aggravated murder, child abuse, obstruction of justice and the desecration of a dead body. If convicted, they could both face the death penalty. Authorities delayed an expected filing of charges on Friday, Rawlings said, because ""we don't want to make any mistake in our charging decision."" But ""make no mistake: We intend to file formal charges with the court once the evidence we need to substantiate the crimes ... is obtained and submitted and processed."" Rawlings said he anticipated that charges would be filed in the ""not too distant future."" Ethan's father, Joe Stacy, was required by a divorce settlement to send him to spend the summer with his mother, KUTV reported. Joe Stacy and Stephanie Sloop were officially divorced April 28.

"(CNN) -- The economy of Thailand -- whose growth this year so far has belied its political ails -- is now seeing more of a direct impact as protests grow increasingly violent. Thai Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told CNN the protests have taken between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent off the nation's gross domestic product so far this year and have had an ""incalculable impact on investor confidence."" The protests could shave as much 2 percent of GDP if it continues through the rest of the year. ""The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of violence breaking out -- which has proven to be the case,"" said Korn. ""Once violence breaks out, the potential impact on the economy is all the more greater."" One person died from clashes Friday and two were in critical condition, a local hospital director said. All three were shot. A rebel red shirt leader who was shot Thursday while being interviewed by Western journalists was also in critical condition. On Friday afternoon, government troops were tightening around a protester encampment as shots rang out around the area. The typically bustling downtown area of Bangkok has shuttered its businesses as Red Shirt protesters occupied a 3-kilometer wide area near the business district. The 1,700 shops and 10 hotels in the area are losing an estimated $6 million a day. One in six of Thailand's 61 million citizens live in the Bangkok area. Tourism, which makes up about 6 percent of the Thai economy and employs more than one million people, has been hardest hit by the protests that began in March. Banyan Tree Holdings, which owns several resorts in Thailand, projects that bookings and residential sales will take a hit this year. ""Unless there is a resolution to the Thai political situation soon, there is no clear visibility on the Group's performance for the rest of the year,"" Chairman Ho KownPing said Thursday in a statement. ""Clearly the impact on the economy has been the impact on tourism,"" Korn said. ""Obviously pictures that are appearing on TV screens across the world has obviously spooked potential tourists. Several governments have issued travel warnings for Thailand as a whole and we've seen bookings disappear at least for the months of June and July."" The government still predicts the Thai economy will grow at least 4.5 percent this year. The World Bank had earlier predicted that Thailand -- the second largest economy in Southeast Asia -- will grow 7 percent this year. Foreign investors had been bullish on the Thai economy. But in recent weeks, the investment tide has turned. Overseas investors shed $130 million in the month of April, according to the Thai Stock Exchange. That sell-off has escalated in the past week as foreign investors sold off $584 million in Thai shares the past six sessions, Reuters reported. Korn said there was little disruption to business outside the immediate vicinity of the protests. ""Those who invested in Thailand generally invested in areas outside of Bangkok, and they have been in no way undermined by the ongoing protests ... so from that perspective it's been pretty much business as usual,"" Korn said. ""That's why the economy has kept humming along for that reason,"" Korn said. ""But the protests definitely have an impact on confidence and will definitely have an impact on the decision-making process for investors.""

"(CNN) -- Progressive Catholic groups vented outrage Friday over the decision of a Roman Catholic school in Massachusetts to rescind the admission of an 8-year-old student because his parents are lesbians. ""The idea that a child might be punished because he does not live with his two biologic parents is antithetical to notions of Christian charity and Catholic social justice,"" said Patrick Whelan, president of Catholic Democrats, in a statement Friday. Other liberal Catholic and gay groups issued similar statements Friday, responding to news reports this week that a child accepted to St. Paul Elementary School in Hingham, Massachusetts, for the fall was told he couldn't enroll after the school learned that his parents are gay. In addition to pressuring the Massachusetts school to reverse its decision and accept the student, progressive Catholic activists are attempting to do something much more dramatic: get the Archdiocese of Boston, which includes the Hingham school, to set a precedent for how the American church treats students with gay parents. In March, the Archdiocese of Denver, Colorado, supported a decision by a Catholic school in Boulder to block two students with gay parents from re-enrolling. While the Denver archbishop who backed that decision, Charles J. Chaput, may be the most outspokenly conservative bishop in the nation, progressive Catholics think they can get more moderate Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley to speak against Catholic schools rejecting students over their parents' sexual orientation. ""I'm very disappointed in Chaput's actions, but he has a history of politicizing issues,"" said Chris Korzen, executive director of the progressive Catholics United, which has asked O'Malley to intervene in the Hingham case and to allow the child to attend St. Paul. ""Cardinal O'Malley understands that there's a place to assert church teachings but that it doesn't make sense to discriminate against a child because of his parents' background,"" Korzen said. Korzen and other left-leaning Catholics said they were concerned that the Hingham school was following the example of the Denver Archdiocese in the Boulder case. ""While the relationship between the events in Boulder and Hingham [is] not known, Catholic Democrats is concerned that a narrative will develop that legitimizes the exclusion of children of same sex parents from Catholic schools,"" the group Catholic Democrats, which is based in Boston, said Friday. Conservative Catholic groups, meanwhile, have been mostly silent on the matter. ""I don't really have a strong opinion on this one,"" said Deal Hudson, a prominent conservative Catholic activist, in an e-mail on Friday. ""It's a matter of the individual bishop's discretion."" O'Malley has not publicly weighed in on the case, but the Boston Archdiocese said Thursday that the Hingham school was not acting in compliance with archdiocesan policy. ""The archdiocese does not prohibit children of same-sex parents from attending Catholic schools,"" said Mary Grassa O'Neill, the archdiocese's secretary for education and superintendent of Catholic schools. ""We will work in the coming weeks to develop a policy to eliminate any misunderstandings in the future."" O'Neill said that the Boston Archdiocese met with one of the child's parents on Thursday and that it has offered to help enroll him in another Catholic school in the archdiocese. The parents of the St. Paul student have insisted on anonymity for them and their son in press reports of the situation. The Catholic Schools Foundation, a Boston-based group whose board is chaired by O'Malley, said Thursday that it would not support schools that discriminated against students based on their parents' sexual orientation.` ""[N]o school that promotes an exclusionary admissions policy or practice will be considered for support,"" said the foundation's executive director, Michael Reardon, in a Thursday letter to school administrators. ""We believe a policy or practice that denies admissions to students in such a manner as occurred at St. Paul's is at odds with our values as a foundation, the intentions of our donors, and ultimately with Gospel teaching."" Calls to St. Paul Elementary School and church on Friday night were not returned.","Massachusetts school rescinds admission of student because parents are lesbians .

"(CNN) -- Food fanatics may recognize John Besh from his stints on TV shows like ""The Next Iron Chef"" and ""Top Chef Masters,"" but New Orleans residents know the Louisiana-raised chef and ex-Marine as an evangelist for local food culture. After Hurricane Katrina devastated his city in 2005, Besh rallied the teams at his flagship restaurant August to feed the Police Department, National Guard troops, evacuees, refugees and medical personnel. He also set up field kitchens for rural parish residents after hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. Besh's 2009 love letter to his city's distinctive cuisine, a nearly 400-page volume of recipes, photographs, stories and field guides to local ingredients entitled ""My New Orleans"" was recently named best cookbook of the year by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. With his region's foodways again in peril, Besh spoke with CNN about what's at risk from the Gulf Coast oil spill and what U.S. eaters can do to help. CNN: From a food perspective, what's at stake? John Besh: We have a rig that's about 45 miles off the southern tip of Louisiana -- that little bit of land that just happens to be some of the most incredibly rich marshland, which feeds an enormous ecosystem. So, some of the most fragile land on the face of the earth -- at least in North America. Two-thirds of the production of seafood from the lower 48 states comes from this ecosystem. It all begins with the micro-organisms in the marsh grasses at the mouth of the Mississippi River. There are other rivers there, too, but it's the mighty Mississippi that feeds it all. We have to act swiftly, as if we were going to war. We have to protect this coastline. There are not just jobs; there are communities and cultures. Family-owned restaurant fears 'devastating glob' CNN: How will this affect the local economy -- especially the shrimpers? Besh: One thing in particular that's been a real slap in the face to the American shrimper is the rapid importation, unchecked, of foreign shrimp flooding our market. We don't know what waters they come from, we don't know what they were fed. We really know very little about their origin. Yet we accept them with open arms in our country -- a lot of time using slave labor to process these things that we're feeding our children and eating in our massive chain restaurants. These shrimpers, these communities have been through hurricane after hurricane. They really got back on their feet themselves -- very resilient people. And now we're dragging our feet -- this slow, very delayed response to the waters. We're talking about this ecosystem that's a source, that's a $2.9 billion  a year industry just in our region for shrimp and oysters and crab -- along with some fin fish production. This whole industry [is] on the verge of collapse if we do not act swiftly. CNN: What can Americans outside the Gulf Coast do to help? Besh: We need people to really be unified about this. It's more than just about a job. Because it's really about a culture. We need to preserve our environment. [President] Obama was put in office for the very things he claims to have espoused, yet now we're seeing that administration really dragging their feet with this one -- and that's a huge shock to all of us. And that's why we're asking everybody out there -- call your representatives, call your senator, call whoever. Make noise. One thing you can do right now is eat American shrimp. CNN: How can diners make sure it's domestic? Besh: Each state has its own laws, but in many, grocery stores have to label the origin of the shrimp. Demand domestic shrimp. Demand great domestic oysters. Demand, demand, demand, and they will have to supply it in order to pay their bills. CNN: What can chefs do? Besh: Chefs should be very mindful of the origin of their seafood. We still have a lot to work on. We have a lot to clean up. But perhaps we can still salvage that culture and the industry. Not to mention all the environmental effects. CNN: What are you doing at your own restaurants like August, La Provence and Lüke? Besh: We're focused on supporting oyster families -- like P&J Oysters -- and local shrimpers by buying from our shore -- at least stabilizing as best we can the few people who are out there and able to make a living at it. And we have an active feeding arrangement going on. We're taking food down to the mouth of the river when the mitigation stabilizes. Like just when we were rebuilding after Katrina, we'll come and rebuild the restaurants -- we're going to feed you. You want to come save our environment? We're going to feed you. CNN: What does the future hold for Gulf Coast cuisine in light of this disaster? Besh: We have no idea what we're dealing with yet because BP tells us one thing, the government tells us another. Even those reports have been skewed -- it may be up to five times worse than what our government is even saying. Right now, there's just this big question and our question is not to cast blame right now. Let's just deal with it. Let's bring in all of our resources -- the Department of Defense if need be -- because we're an incredible country. We can do so much. I love America and I'm not against oil. But we've got to figure out how to handle crises like this before they become crises. That's my plea to everybody. Get out there and get involved. Make it known that we've got to save the Gulf.","Chef John Besh: We should wage campaign to save Gulf Coast from oil slick .

"(CNN) -- World champions Italy meet France Tuesday at Euro 2008 in a rematch of the 2006 World Cup final and the 2002 European Championship final -- but with very different consequences. Italian players train Monday in Zurich ahead of their showdown with France. With both sides still seeking their first win of the tournament, defeat for either in Zurich would mean certain elimination from Group C and an ignominious return home for the losing squad. Should Romania beat the Netherlands -- who are expected to rest key players having already qualified for the quarterfinals -- in the group's other match in Berne both sides face elimination regardless of the result. French coach Raymond Domenech and Italian counterpart Roberto Donadoni could also find their jobs on the line if their players fail to meet the expectations of two countries steeped in footballing success. Going into the tournament, both the Azzurri and les Bleus -- who also met twice in qualifying -- had been considered among the favorites despite being placed in the toughest group. But shock defeats against the Dutch -- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -- and failure to beat the defensively minded Romanians has left them scrambling for survival. ""Nobody would have thought that Italy-France would be a last-ditch match,"" said Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, whose penalty save against Romania kept his country's slim hopes of making the last eight alive. ""Before the European Championship, this was supposed to be the biggest match of the group."" Either Italy and France could advance if they win and Romania are beaten or held to a draw by the Dutch. Italy could also sneak through with a score draw if Romania lose. Who will win Tuesday's crunch match between France and Italy? Have your say . ""We know what's at stake and we're ready to put our hearts and souls into it. For us, this is already a final,"" said Donadoni, who replaced Italy's World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi following Italy's win on penalties over France two years ago. ""Both sides will be extremely motivated and will try to win. It should be exciting. I can't wait for the game to start."" Admitting that both sides' fate was out of their own hands, Domenech recognized that France's qualification hopes hung by a thread with the Dutch unlikely to chase victory against a Romanian side they failed to beat in qualifying. ""They (the Netherlands) won't play with as much energy as they did against us and Italy,"" said Domenech following his side's defeat by injury. ""It's very difficult to imagine Holland beating Romania now... We have to forget the other game completely. We still have a tiny chance but it will only happen if we win our game."" Domenech is still without veteran midfielder and captain Patrick Vieira of Italian champions Inter Milan, who has failed to feature in the tournament since picking up a thigh injury in training two weeks ago. Lyon striker Karim Benzema was tipped to return to the side after missing the game against the Netherlands. Italy could recall forward Antonio Cassano in place of veteran Alessandro Del Piero while AC Milan midfield pair Gennaro Gattuso and Massimo Ambrosini could also return to the starting lineup. Romanian coach Victor Piturca said he expected a tough match against the Netherlands despite the Dutch having already sealed their place in the last eight and Romania's victory over Marco van Basten's side in Bucharest during qualifying. ""We had some experienced players who knew Dutch football well and that helped us with our tactics against them in the qualifiers,"" said Piturca. ""However, that wasn't a good time for the Netherlands whereas right now, unfortunately for us, they are in extremely good form... We know the different scenarios but by the end of the game I hope we will have qualified because we deserve it."" The runners-up in Group C will face Spain, the winners of Group D, in Saturday's quarterfinal in Vienna. The Dutch's next opponents will be the determined by the result of Wednesday's clash between Russia and Sweden.","France face world champions Italy at Euro 2008 with losers going home .

"(CNN) -- More than a month after the Plastiki set sail from San Francisco, the six-person crew has made it to Christmas Island, nearly marking the halfway point of the ship's journey to cross the Pacific Ocean. Upon their arrival, the crew was greeted at by local residents who performed cultural songs and dances, as well as offered them drinks and chocolate -- traditional treats on the Republic of Kiripbati island. The vessel embarked from San Francisco on March 20. The arrival on Christmas Island is the first time since the ship left California that that the crew -- David de Rothschild, Jo Royle, David Thomson, Olav Heyerdahl, Vern Moen and Max Jourdan -- disembarked from their ship, constructed of more than 12,000 plastic bottles. After participating in the arrival ceremony, the crew members spoke to 1,000 high school students about the importance of recycling, and led a discussion to address the challenges the students face in their own efforts to promote sustainable practices. The crew had the additional opportunity to interact with the local community while the Plastiki was re-stocked and underwent a maintenance check and minor repairs. Also on Christmas Island, filmmaker Moen will leave the Plastiki to return to California, where his wife gave birth to their son last month. In his place, Graham Hill, the founder of environmental website Treehugger, will be joining the crew. The Plastiki has sailed 3,617 nautical miles of it 11,000-mile journey. Its final destination is Sydney, Australia.","The Plastiki crew reaches Christmas Island 39 days after it set sail from San Francisco .

"Washington (CNN) -- Air Force Lt. Col. Ken Bourland hugged his wife, Peggy, goodbye and headed out for his two-day mission. The date was January 12, and the destination was Haiti. Neither knew it would be the last time they'd see one another. Upon his arrival in Port-au-Prince, Ken Bourland sent his wife an e-mail saying he had settled into his hotel room. Ten minutes later, Peggy Bourland and the couple's three sons began watching television back in their suburban Fort Lauderdale, Florida, home. That's when the news broke: Haiti had been struck by a major earthquake. She describes the panic that set in. ""I sent him another e-mail, you know, 'Please tell me you're OK',"" she recounted to CNN. ""And, at that point, I didn't get anything back."" The ensuing minutes and hours turned to days of waiting. ""It was painful not knowing,"" she said. ""But not knowing, you still had hope. You still had hope that he could possibly be under there just surviving, just doing everything he could to survive."" Eventually, Peggy Bourland began to fear the worst. Lt. Col. Ken Bourland worked at the Caribbean desk at the U.S. Southern Command. His job involved helping the Haitian military with security issues concerning both countries, such as combating illicit drug trafficking, uncovering money laundering and distributing humanitarian aid. Bourland had been to Haiti previously, and this trip was to be a 48-hour mission escorting a new commander to meet his Haitian counterparts. His e-mail to his wife of five years was titled, ""Wow. Haiti."" ""He actually had seen what true poverty was. And it was a life-changing experience for him,"" Peggy Bourland recalled. ""And he said that he wished that my son, Chance, and I could have been there to see it. I could tell from his e-mail he was moved, beyond words, at what he'd seen,"" she said. Army Lt. Col. Chris Thomas worked with Ken Bourland at Southern Command. The two traveled to Haiti together and were in their respective rooms at the Hotel Montana when it came crashing down. ""We arrived Tuesday morning, met with the ambassador at the embassy, and got briefings,"" Thomas told CNN in an interview at Southern Command's headquarters in Miami, Florida. ""Ken and myself then went back to the Hotel Montana, and that was the last time I saw him,"" Thomas said. Thomas stayed on the hotel's top story, in a fifth-floor corner room. Ken Bourland's room was on the second floor. Thomas recalled the horrible events of that afternoon. ""I was standing in the middle of the room, and the building just erupted,"" he said. ""The room just shook so violently, and the noise was deafening,"" he said. ""I rushed to the door, and the door and the wall fell on top of me. As the building pancaked, I guess I rode it down."" Thomas suffered a broken arm, a separated shoulder and a torn ligament in his knee. But in the immediate aftermath of the quake, no word from Bourland. After two weeks, Peggy Bourland was emotionally exhausted from waiting and worrying. She took a military plane to Haiti to stand near where her husband was last seen alive. ""I just felt like, if that was going to be where he took his last breath, that I owed it to him and our kids to be there, to see it, to pray for him,"" she said. Once she got back home, she continued to wait for word about her husband's fate. Eventually, ""they called,"" she said, tearfully recalling the moment when she got the definitive word that her husband had died in the earthquake-ravaged Hotel Montana. Immediately following the phone call, she worried, ""Oh my gosh, how am I gonna make it through this? What am I gonna tell my boys? You know, how am I going to explain this to them?"" Bourland served in Iraq in 2004. His safe return there holds a certain irony for his wife. ""To make it home from a real war zone, and be taken like that. It's just ... it's hard,"" she said. ""He was honest, confident,"" she said of her late husband. 'He was very dedicated."" Peggy Bourland is unsure of ""where I go from here. It's still just kind of, every day I get up, take a deep breath and ask, 'How are we gonna get through today? What are we gonna do',"" she wonders. ""Never, never ever would I be prepared for this."" ""It's so vivid in my mind, him giving me a hug, kissing the boys,"" Peggy Bourland said. ""I still see him walking out the door Sunday on his trip. And you know, 'Bye! See you when I get back. Love you! Love you, too!' "" Asked about the necklace she wears, she said, ""This is Ken's wedding band, one of the things they identified him with. I wear it around my neck, to keep him close to my heart, always.""","Air Force Lt. Col. Ken Bourland was among those killed in January's Haiti earthquake.

""We spoke yesterday and she said just one last fight, Mayweather."" ""Pacman"" is rated by Ring magazine as the greatest pound-for-pound fighter on the planet after winning an unprecedented seven world titles at different weight divisions. Mayweather is unbeaten in 41 fights and is a huge draw at the box office, earning the nickname ""Money"" in amassing a fortune on his way to nine world titles in five different weight classes. The two were due to fight earlier this year, but negotiations ended acrimoniously with Pacquiao angered by the insistence of the Mayweather camp for Olympic style pre-fight drugs tests. It appeared to remain a major sticking point, along with Pacquiao's political ambitions and the influence of his mother Dionisia, who reportedly wants her son to retire from the ring. But with leading American promoter Bob Arum pulling the strings, visiting the Philippines to watch Pacquiao campaign for the election, the fight all boxing fans want to see could now be on.

"(CNN) -- Florida prosecutors on Thursday revealed a list of reasons they're seeking the death penalty against Casey Anthony, who is charged with killing her daughter, Caylee. Under Florida, law, prosecutors need to raise only one of 15 possible aggravating factors to support their decision to seek the death penalty. Assistant State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton cited five circumstances, according to a document obtained by CNN affiliate WESH and other Orlando, Florida, media outlets. In death penalty cases, jurors are asked to weigh aggravating circumstances that make a crime especially heinous against mitigating factors that favor mercy, such as a lack of prior offenses. Among the legal reasons cited: Caylee's death occurred during aggravated child abuse, was especially ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel,"" and was committed in a ""cold, calculated and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification,"" according to the document. Caylee was also under 12 years old, and Anthony ""stood in a position of familial or custodial authority over her,"" the document states. Karen Levey, the court public information officer, could not confirm that Judge Belvin Perry Jr. received a copy of the notice. As of Thursday evening, defense attorney Jose Baez said he had not been served with the notice. In a hearing this week, Perry ordered the State Attorney's Office to disclose the aggravating factors they intend to cite in a penalty phase if Anthony is convicted of premeditated murder. Anthony, 24, is accused of killing 2-year-old Caylee, who disappeared in June 2008. Her body was found that December in a vacant lot near her grandparents' home in Orlando. Defense lawyers have said that prosecutors are seeking the death penalty to bankrupt the defense and prevent Anthony from having the attorney of her choice. The defense said that prosecutors had originally said they would not seek death in the case but reversed that position in March 2009 when they learned that Anthony had $205,000 for her defense. The bulk of the money came from ABC News for the licensing of photos and videos, Baez testified during a previous hearing. Anthony's trial is scheduled to begin May 9, 2011.","Prosecutors cite five legal circumstances to support decision to seek death penalty .

"(Mashable) -- For all their buzz and value, location-based social networks haven't really gone mainstream yet. Only 7 percent of Americans are aware of location-based social networks, according to data from Edison Research. Part of the explanation for this is that the majority of mobile users aren't using smartphones. And as a result, just 10 percent of those surveyed use mobile location services at least once a week, according to the Mobile Marketing Association's latest Mobile Consumer Briefing survey. For smartphone users, like those of the iPhone (a popular device among early adopters), that number jumps all the way up to 63 percent. Still, even with smartphones predicted to overtake feature phones sometime next year, there may still be adoption hurdles for location-based social networks. Here's a look at why location-based services haven't yet hit critical mass and what those platforms are doing about it. Privacy concerns remain an issue . Kristine van Dillen, director of industry initiatives and partnerships at the Mobile Marketing Association, said location-based services aren't growing as quickly as they should be. One reason for the lag is concern over privacy and who has access to users' data. Sites like PleaseRobMe.com, which humorously bring awareness to location-based privacy issues, may have scared some social media users from opting in. Furthermore, the use of geo-location data for commercial purposes has also raised concerns, prompting the Congressional subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection to hold hearings on the issue. Concerns about loopholes in Foursquare that give others the ability to announce your check-inshave also been raised. ""There's still a perceived risk in accessing location data,"" van Dillen said. Location-based service providers are addressing these concerns by giving consumers more control. Most current iterations of the popular location-based networks allow users to opt-out of location tagging and notifying users when their location is being shared. Consumer education is also key. Users need to know how their location data will be used, and feel comfortable that the companies that have access to it will behave responsibly, according to van Dillen. She said consumers will become more comfortable sharing information with their friends and trusted applications. Brands will view these services as less risky, and more mainstream, and new types of location-based services will come to the forefront. Where is the value? Because of privacy concerns, it is imperative for location-based services to clearly communicate the value proposition to users. Without a clear picture of what they're getting in return, users may be hesitant to share location data. One of the ultimate promises of location-based check-ins is more accurately targeted advertising. For some users, the privacy concerns of sharing their location might be trumped by the potential utility of receiving highly targeted advertising and promotions. However, even though Gowalla, Foursquare, BrightKite and Yelp allow for check-ins at ""places,"" rather than just map coordinates, which makes the data more valuable for targeted advertising, actual advertiser value hasn't yet totally materialized. Michael Boland, a senior analyst and program director at BIA/Kelsey said check-ins represent the makings of a business model, but they haven't reached their full potential value yet because there isn't a well-defined system to buy and sell advertising. ""I think it does have a lot of staying power. We're only going to see it grow and evolve,"" he said. For early adopters, though, the long-term promise of more value through targeted ads, coupons and deals, along with the game mechanics (i.e., badges and ""mayor"" competitions) instituted by some networks has made location-based services worth the potential privacy headaches. As Twitter and Facebook move into the location tagging space, they might finally take the trend mainstream. During its Chirp developer conference in April, Twitter announced the launch of its annotations feature, which gives users the ability to attach metadata to tweets, including location. Facebook, meanwhile, will also reportedly soon enable members to add location details to their status updates and release an API so other apps can offer location ability to Facebook users. Each network faces the usual hurdles for location adoption. For Twitter, the biggest problem might be convincing users of the value of location-enabled tweets. Twitter has yet to clearly communicate to users what they get in return for adding location to their tweets. On their knowledge base page explaining the feature they write that location will help you ""add context to your updates and help you join the local conversation, wherever you are."" Twitter gives an example of one user tweeting about the weather in one location, while another user tweets about traveling to that very location. Unfortunately for Twitter, compared to sites like Foursquare and Gowalla which clearly indicate the value -- every check-in is part of a game, you can find your friends, get tacit recommendations for places to go, and maybe score a deal or two -- Twitter is only communicating what feels like a very niche and impractical value proposition. Further, because location is off by default for all users, without a more clearly communicated message, the feature may remain off for many people. Facebook, meanwhile, faces the other major problem: Privacy. Because Facebook has had so many different privacy issues over the years, many users are wary of new features. And Facebook hasn't always had the best track record when it comes to rolling out new features in a way that people trust. So how they roll out location to users and how well they do at making users feel that their information is safe may be make or break for location on Facebook. One thing Facebook does have in its favor is a great track record of getting people to eventually use new services en masse -- concerns or not. When Facebook launched its news feed feature in 2006 it faced a very vocal user backlash. A few months and a few tweaks later, the feature was widely used and has become an integral part of the service. The advantage for both Twitter and Facebook is that their users already have a built-in network of followers and friends, so they don't have to sign up for a new service and start adding people to it. The location feature is simply an add-on to their existing account. ""Facebook could really be the looming giant that could wipe all [other location services] away,"" Boland said. ""Facebook has proven to have so many users who are mobile. If they turn on that feature, it's the looming category killer."" What remains to be seen is if the users will go for it. © 2010 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","Sites and apps that let users track their locations get buzz from tech media .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin hit the campaign trail Friday, delivering the keynote address at a Washington  fundraiser for an anti-abortion group supporting socially conservative women running for office in the upcoming midterm elections. ""All across this country, women are standing up and speaking out for common sense solutions,"" Palin said at the Susan B. Anthony List Celebration of Life breakfast. They are forming a ""new conservative feminist movement"" that will help make ""government work again for us,"" she said. The Susan B. Anthony List describes itself on its website as part of the ""nerve center of the pro-life movement and political process."" In 2008, the group founded ""Team Sarah,"" a coalition of women supporting Palin's vice presidential bid. During her speech, Palin ripped abortion rights opponents in the Democratic Party who ""promised to hold firm"" during the health care debate, but ultimately backed ""the most pro-abortion president who ever occupied the White House."" ""We won't forget,"" she promised. ""Elections have consequences."" Palin mentioned, among other things, her daughter Bristol's decision not to have an abortion after becoming pregnant at age 17. ""It was an embarrassing time for her,"" Palin told the audience. But ""choosing life was the right road."" Palin said national media coverage of the pregnancy ""kind of made it rough"" on Bristol and sent a not-too-subtle message to other young women that it's easier to choose to have an abortion. Turning to other policy disputes, Palin also slammed the Obama administration's fiscal program, declaring that ""these policies coming out of D.C. right now"" are putting the country on the road to ""national insolvency.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Just one in 10 Latino high school dropouts earns a high school equivalency degree, compared with two in 10 African-American dropouts and three in 10 white dropouts, the Pew Hispanic Center said Thursday. The equivalency degree, called the General Educational Development (GED) credential, ""is widely regarded as the best 'second chance' pathway to college, vocational training and military service for adults who do not graduate from high school,"" the center said on its website. Latinos also have a much higher high school drop-out rate than blacks or whites. About 41 percent of Latinos 20 and older in the United States do not have a regular high school diploma, compared with 23 percent of black adults and 14 percent of white adults, Pew said. Among Latinos, Pew noted, significant differences exist between those who were born in another country and those born in the United States. About 52 percent of foreign-born Latino adults are high school dropouts, compared with 25 percent of the native born, Pew said. Among Latino dropouts, about 21 percent of those born in the United States have a GED, compared with 5 percent of those born abroad, the research center said. A greater percentage of U.S.-born Latinos obtain GEDs because they are more aware of the opportunities available to them, said Richard Fry, the Pew Hispanic Center researcher who compiled the report. ""For the foreign-born, it takes them a little bit of time to learn about the GED,"" Fry told CNN. ""It takes a little bit of time to figure things out."" Fry said he obtained the information by performing an analysis of newly available educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2008 American Community Survey. That Census Bureau survey was the first to differentiate between those who graduated from high school and those who obtained a GED, Fry said. Previous surveys had lumped both categories together. The Pew analysis also found that in 2008, Latino adults with a GED had a higher unemployment rate than those with a high school diploma -- 9 percent versus 7 percent. However, the report said, Latino full-time, full-year workers with a GED had about the same mean annual earnings ($33,504) as full-time, full-year Latino workers with a high school diploma ($32,972). The Pew Hispanic Center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues. Release of the report comes amid heightened tensions over a recent Arizona law that requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance. Opponents have called for an Arizona tourism boycott and the measure has drawn criticism from Mexico and several Latin American nations. Fry said timing of the report's release was coincidental. ""There's nothing magical about it,"" he said. ""The report's been done for about a week or so and it was time to get it out the door."" CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","At 41 percent, Latinos have higher high school dropout rate than blacks, whites, study finds .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Staring at the throngs of media representatives who came out to hear and see her Friday, Jessica Colotl took another step into the fight for her future. The undocumented student from Mexico whose case has become a lightning rod in the immigration debate had been released on $2,500 bond just a couple hours earlier. The 21-year-old student at Kennesaw State University in Georgia surrendered Friday morning to authorities in response to a warrant for her arrest issued Wednesday night by the Cobb County Sheriff's Office. Standing nervously before the crowd, Colotl fought back tears when people cheered for her. The media bombarded her with questions as she tried to give voice to her struggle. Just a week earlier, she'd been released from a deportation facility in Alabama after being stopped in March for a minor traffic violation. ""If I were to be deported, I'd have to start all over again,"" she said. ""I'm hoping for the best."" The sheriff's office said she gave a false address when stopped for that violation, a felony charge that her attorney denies. A spotlight has been trained on Arizona since Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law a bill that requires law enforcement officials to seek proof of legal U.S. residency from anyone whom they have stopped on suspicion of having violated the law. But advocates working with Colotl point out that a little-understood program already gives local authorities in many states the latitude to act as immigration officials -- a right that is often abused, they say. ""The future of Arizona already exists in Cobb County and Gwinnett County [also in Georgia],"" said Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials. Near him were other Colotl supporters, some holding signs reading ""Education not deportation."" Under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 287(g) program, state and local law enforcement can partner with the federal agency to gain some immigration enforcement authority in their own jurisdictions. If they conclude that someone is in the country illegally, they can turn that person over to ICE. Last year, a change to the partnership program prioritized the detention and arrest of those who have allegedly committed crimes. The Cobb County Sheriff's Office is one of 71 law enforcement agencies in 26 states that have entered into this partnership program, according to the ICE website. Labeling the program a ""civil rights disaster,"" Mary Bauer, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said it ""leads to racial profiling, distracts police from looking for real criminals and destroys families."" The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia called Friday for an end to the program. ""Jessica's case is yet another outrageous example of the unaccountable local enforcement of immigration laws in Cobb County gone awry,"" said Azadeh Shahshahani, ACLU of Georgia's national security/immigrants' rights project director. Colotl's legal problems started in late March when her car was stopped on the Kennesaw State campus.  Born in Mexico but living in the United States since she was 11, she could not produce a driver's license, so she handed over as identification an expired passport from Mexico. She was arrested the next day and turned over to immigration officials. She spent more than a month in the Etowah Detention Center in Alabama. Friends came out in force and marched on campus in her defense. Earlier this month, she was released, and her deportation was deferred for a year, which will allow her to finish her studies. She hasn't returned to classes yet, but looks forward to earning her degree. ""I'm just trying to live the American dream and finish my education,"" she said. Calling Colotl ""a symbol of what's wrong with the immigration system,"" immigration attorney Charles Kuck thanked ICE for allowing his client to stay in the country for a year to finish her studies. He then set out to educate people about the challenges facing Colotl, providing a reason why she did not have a license. ""Jessica can't start the process to become a U.S. citizen because she's not allowed to,"" he said. ""If Jessica could obtain a license, she would have."" In a statement Wednesday night, Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren said, ""Ms. Colotl knew that she was in the United States without authority to be here and voluntarily chose to operate a vehicle without a driver's license, which is a violation of Georgia law. She has further complicated her situation with her blatant disregard for Georgia law by giving false information."" As for the use of the ICE program, he said, ""I value any tool that helps me enforce the law and remove violators from our community."" But the band of lawyers and advocates who rallied around Colotl say Cobb County is abusing its power. In a joint statement Thursday night, they voiced outrage over Colotl's treatment and suggested that the felony charge is trumped-up. ""It is obvious from all the documents that I've seen that she has done nothing wrong and has given her proper address to Cobb County and immigration officials,"" said Chris Taylor, Colotl's criminal attorney. ""There has been no crime committed."" The car's registration simply reflected her old address, Taylor said in an interview, and she provided her new address when she was taken into custody. Taylor said he has the documents to prove this and looks forward to clearing her name. In front of the crowd that gathered Friday, he said of his client, ""She has not failed us. We have failed her. The system has failed her."" The Cobb Immigrant Alliance likened the actions of officials to ""schoolyard bullying."" Gonzalez, of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, called the sheriff ""Wild-West Warren,"" saying he ""has abused his authority in this case. His actions clearly demonstrate the problems that occur when local law officers are granted authority to enforce immigration laws."" ""Sheriff Warren has embarked on a witch hunt, wasting money and county resources for political gain,"" said Adelina Nicholls of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. ""This is not about public safety.""","Jessica Colotl, an undocumented immigrant, was arrested, detained after traffic violation .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan have won the Italian Serie A title for a fifth successive season -- and the 18th time in their illustrious history -- after Diego Milito's goal gave them a 1-0 win at Siena on Sunday. Jose Mourinho's side needed nothing less than a victory to secure the Scudetto and they achieved that feat in the 57th-minute when striker Milito collected a pass from fellow-Argentine Javier Zanetti, before firing home a shot with the outside of his right foot. A draw would have allowed second-placed Roma to snatch the title with a win at Chievo and Claudio Ranieri's side kept up their side of the deal with a 2-0 success. Mirko Vucinic volleyed home Daniele De Rossi's through-ball in the 39th minute and Italian international De Rossi added a second on the stroke of half-time with a superb long-range strike. With only 45 minutes remaining of the season, Roma were in pole position to win their first title since 2001 -- but Milito's strike ensured Inter became the first team since Juventus in the 1930's to win five titles on the bounce. The result, which condemned Siena to relegation to Serie B alongside Atalanta and Livorno, also means Inter Milan will now face Bayern Munich in next weekend's Champions League final in Madrid with both sides bidding for a unique treble. ""This is an incredible joy, a reward for all the hard work we've put in over the year,"" Milito told reporters. ""From tomorrow we will think about that great Champions Lague final."" Like the Bavarian giants, Inter have now added the league title to their domestic cup triumph -- and Saturday's Bernabeu showdown now ensures one of the two teams will secure a rare treble of trophies this season. For Mourinho, who has overseen Inter's last two Scudetto wins, there is the added incentive of joining a select band of coaches to have won the Champions League with two different clubs, following his success with Porto in 2004.","Inter Milan win the Italian Serie A title for a fifth successive year after beating Siena 1-0 .

"(Mashable) -- It was speculative before given the lack of independent confirmation, but now apparently Apple has gone on record to confirm that the original deal signed with AT&T for iPhone exclusivity back in 2007 was a five-year deal. That means at least some legal hoops would need jumping through if we're ever going to see that oft-rumored Verizon iPhone before 2012. Engadget reports that court documents filed by Apple in a California class-action suit confirm the original AT&T exclusivity deal had a five-year duration. The suit, ongoing since 2007, claims that Apple and AT&T were exerting a monopoly over iPhone service by surreptitiously locking iPhone buyers into renewing contracts with AT&T once their initial two years was up. On the flip side, there are a number of reasons such a contract might be amended or canceled, so it's not exactly a total given that the iPhone won't appear on another carrier before 2012. But given the original terms, it could require some tricky negotiation or legal fancy footwork to get there. Moreover, the class-action suit also alleges an illegal monopoly over the iPhone App Store, which the court ruled substantial enough to move forward. On both fronts then -- consumer market and legal proceedings -- it will be fascinating to watch for further details on when the AT&T iPhone exclusivity curtain might drop or even be forcibly struck down.

"(CNN) -- A former Mexican senator was reported missing on Saturday, Mexico's attorney general's office said. The case has rocked Mexico, with President Felipe Calderon saying he is closely monitoring the investigation into the disappearance of the former official, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos Ramos. The attorney general of the state where Fernandez de Cevallos was reported missing said that authorities have no clues as to his whereabouts. Fernandez de Cevallos was last seen on the ranch of his home in Pedro Escobedo, in central Mexico's state of Queretaro, the country's official Notimex news agency reported. The attorney general's office said that Fernandez de Cevallos' vehicle was located on his ranch and that ""in the place where the car was located, some of his belongings were found and there were traces of violence."" Queretaro attorney Arsenio Duran said the former legislator had arrived alone at his La Cabana ranch, as he usually did, at approximately 11 p.m. Friday (midnight ET Saturday) and that it was presumed that he was kidnapped in the driveway of his property, Notimex reported. Duran said that around 7 a.m. Saturday (8 a.m. ET) relatives of the former legislator noticed that the door to his truck was open, Notimex reported. Outside the vehicle were discarded glasses, pens and scissors; inside were traces of blood. The federal attorney general's office has declined to call the case a kidnapping. Queretaro authorities are investigating the case, the attorney general's office said. A statement on the Mexican president's website said that Calderon ""from the first hours of the morning, has been in constant communication with the attorney general and with the secretaries of Interior and Public Security,"" about the investigation. The statement said that Calderon has ""communicated with one of the two children of Fernandez de Cevallos, who is facing this difficult situation with integrity, to offer his solidarity and the necessary backing to successfully locate Fernandez de Cevallos.""

"(CNN) -- ""And the title of the sole Survivor of 'Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains' goes to ... Sandra Diaz-Twine."" With that, the winner of the 20th season of CBS' ""Survivor"" was announced last night at the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York City. It's been 10 years since the show crowned its first winner, Richard Hatch, earning Hatch $1 million, a Pontiac Aztek -- and status as America's newest celebrity. Hatch's fame was fickle: The celebrity spotlight, legal problems and a prison term for tax evasion took their toll on the love-to-hate-him corporate trainer. But ""Survivor"" came out of that first season as the country's No. 1 show -- and though ratings have never hit the peaks of the frenzied summer of 2000, it's been an unqualified success for its network, CBS, and producer Mark Burnett. Still, 10 years? The idea that ""Survivor"" would last a decade was not something that even host Jeff Probst would have put his money on. ""I would've lost everything I owned today by betting that we would not still be on-air,"" said Probst. ""In fact, I was so naive to how television really worked that I just assumed because the show was really popular in the first season that it would get a second season for sure ... then I thought this will probably go on for three seasons which is pretty good. I'll make some money, be a TV host. I had no idea we'd be doing this 20 seasons later,"" Probst told CNN. ""Survivor"" debuted in May 2000 when Falklands War veteran and eco-adventurer Burnett bought the rights from British producer Charlie Parsons to produce the show in the United States. It was first shown in 1997 in Sweden under the name of ""Expedition Robinson."" In an interview with Ontario's London Free Press, CBS president Leslie Moonves remembered an early conversation with the prolific producer: ""Mark told me early on, 'This show is going to last -- don't worry about a day job for a while.' "" He was right. Three months later, the show -- which introduced the novel concept of a group of strangers living together in an island while vying for $1 million -- captured the imagination of an audience of 60 million in its very first finale. And it could not have found a more perfect winner in the skilled conniver Hatch, thereby opening up the floodgates to a new decade of reality TV. The rest, as they say, is history. Of course ""Survivor"" wasn't the first of the reality TV genre -- others like PBS' ""An American Family,"" MTV's ""The Real World"" and Fox's ""Cops"" were around long before. But it was the first to challenge the face of prime time TV programming and introduce reality TV as mainstream fare for audiences in America and beyond. It made celebrities out of ordinary citizens. Perhaps the biggest evidence of its success is how it is still a consistent winner in the 8 p.m. prime time slot on Thursdays -- a huge achievement considering the increasingly overcrowded reality field. ""Survivor"" stands out because it possesses the key ingredients of great storytelling, says Misha Kavka of in the Film, Television and Media Studies department at the University of Auckland (New Zealand), who has a forthcoming book on the history of reality TV. Producer Burnett brings a brand of reality known as ""dramality"" -- a slick style of drama that is part of the show's identity and success, says Kavka. Its editors employ strong use of visual metaphors of nature, which parallel the dramas in the tribe. For viewers, it presents a group of people facing the challenges of meeting strangers and living in the open, which functions very well as an allegory for social situations that we understand from our lives, Kavka said. ""The reason [the show] works is because we can see our own social struggles played out on the 'Survivor' stage. We identify not with particular participants, exactly, but rather with many of the situations that arise. Much has been written about 'Survivor' as a metaphor for office politics, and I agree that that's certainly an aspect of it,"" she said. Probst recalls how the team had ""no idea what to expect"" when they were first reviewing tapes from the first season of ""Survivor,"" which took place in Borneo. ""And then there was this exact moment when Richard Hatch was sitting on the tree and he was saying over and over again, 'We need to talk, we need to talk.' And Sue Hawk, the truck driver from Wisconsin, is walking underneath him and she finally says something to the effect of 'Where we're from, we work while we talk!' and I think we all went, 'That's it!' ""And that was the show -- how do you get along when you're fighting for a million dollars."" The show's strong casting and the unpredictability of its people is a strong part of its appeal as well. Its characters are as volatile as the show's most hated villain, Russell Hantz. There is no telling when they'll call it quits (Johnny Fairplay) or if they'll go on to find all the immunity idols known to man (Russell Hantz) or if they'll step down for two doughnuts and a milkshake (Colby Donaldson). ""No one knows where it's going -- not even the producers,"" said Kavka. And then there's Probst himself, the everyman host who was probably best known before the show as the emcee of ""Rock and Roll Jeopardy"" on VH1. He's evolved from weekly torch snuffer to skilled questioner and meticulous observer. Probst's position in tribal councils should not be underestimated, said Kavka. ""Viewers see him at his best in the studio show at the end of a season, where he turns out to be a good study of human nature which is to say that his insights parallel our own 'intimate knowledge' of participants,"" she said. Ultimately, ""Survivor"" speaks to some of our inner fears, said Probst. The notion of being abandoned on an island is ""like a little kid who's separated from his mom. ... You're stranded in a supermarket and you get that feeling of, 'Oh my gosh, I'm alone,' "" he said. ""[And] being voted out is the same as being laid off from your job or being picked last in a basketball game. It's being told: 'I don't like you.' And the idea of 'The Tribe has spoken' is really just another way of saying, the news is in. It's final and it's not good."" But there's the dream, too, for contestants and viewers -- the dream that you'll be the last one standing. ""Everyone fantasizes about being in our place,"" says ""Survivor: Micronesia"" winner Parvati Shallow, ""and loves imagining what he would do in that situation.""","""Survivor"" debuted in 2000 after Mark Burnett brought rights from Sweden's ""Expedition Robinson""

"(CNN) -- A Rhode Island high school that fired all its teachers in February has reached a tentative agreement with the school's teachers union to rehire them, the union announced Sunday. The school board of the Central Falls School District, outside Providence, had voted to fire 93 staff members from its high school -- including teachers, administrators and other personnel -- over low student performance. The deal between the union and the school district allows teachers to return to work for the 2010-2011 school year without having to reapply for their jobs, though the union said Sunday that ""teachers will need to recommit to their jobs and interview with the new principal."" The agreement, which must still be ratified by teachers, includes measures to improve student achievement, including a longer school day, targeted professional development for teachers and more after-school tutoring, the statement from the Central Falls Teachers Union said. The school district and union have been working with a mediator since March. ""There has always been agreement on these points: that we all want what is best for our students, and that significant changes are needed at Central Falls High School,"" teachers union president Jane Sessums said in the statement. ""Working together, we and the district have arrived at a solid, forward-looking agreement that provides support for our students and the tools our teachers need to help them succeed."" A teacher ratification vote on the deal is scheduled for Monday afternoon. In a move that drew national attention, the Central Falls school board had voted 5-2 to approve a plan by the school district's superintendent to fire its high school staff, including the principal, three assistant principals and 77 teachers. The vote came after the high school, which draws students from an impoverished enclave of Rhode Island, graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year. Of Central Falls' 800 students, 65 percent are Hispanic and for most of them, English is a second language. Half the students are failing every subject, with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math, officials said earlier this year. President Obama publicly endorsed the school board's vote. ""Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right,"" he said in March. But the move outraged the school's teachers, who argued that they'd accepted most terms of a plan by the school district's superintendent to improve student performance. The plan approved by the school board in February allowed teachers to re-apply for their jobs but stipulated that no more than 50 percent would get rehired. The firings would have gone into effect at the end of this school year. ""From the start, my principal concern was not who would be working at the high school, but whether the new school leadership team would have the flexibility it needed to improve student achievement,"" Central Falls superintendent Fran Gallo said in the statement provided by the teacher's union. ""Today's agreement provides this flexibility."" Rhode Island officials applauded the tentative deal. ""I'm glad both sides have... [reached] this agreement,"" Rhode Island Education Commissioner Deborah Gist said, according to the union's statement. ""Now it's time to move forward and work together to make Central Falls High one of the best in Rhode Island.""","Rhode Island high school that fired all its teachers reaches tentative agreement to rehire them .

"(CNN) -- Condolences continued to pour in late Sunday night following the death of heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio, who lost his battle with stomach cancer earlier in the day. ""Today my heart is broken, Ronnie passed away at 7:45 a.m. 16th May,"" his wife, Wendy Dio, said in a message on his official website. Dio, 67, followed Ozzy Osbourne as Black Sabbath's lead vocalist in 1979. ""Many, many friends and family were able to say their private goodbyes before he peacefully passed away,"" she wrote. ""Ronnie knew how much he was loved by all."" The rock community paid tribute to Dio in messages late Sunday. ""In addition to his powerhouse vocal ability, Ronnie was a true gentleman who always emanated great warmth and friendship to us and everyone around him,"" KISS said. ""We will miss him."" Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian called Dio's death a big loss. ""So many memories of Ronnie. Toured together many times. He always had a kind word and a smile, and he loved the Yankees,"" Ian said. Musician Slash summed up the loss in one sentence: ""Ronnie died at 7:45 a.m., but his music will live for eternity."" Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx, who became friends with Dio while touring Europe, said the rocker will be missed. ""I still have this image of him standing on stage in front of 100,000 belting out 'Man on the Silver Mountain' and remember the shivers it sent up my spine,"" Sixx said. He called Dio ""one of the kindest souls I have ever met and his talent was beyond inspirational to so many of us."" ""Those of us that had the opportunity to know Ronnie can tell you what a wonderful and passionate man he was,"" Sixx said. Dio most recently was touring with Heaven and Hell, a version of Black Sabbath renamed for legal reasons. All shows were canceled last March because of his illness. His last public appearance was in April at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards when he accepted a vocalist of the year award for his work on last year's Heaven and Hell album. Dio appeared frail, but he spoke while accepting his award. Born Ronald James Padavona in 1942, Dio's professional music career began as a high school student in the late 1950s. His 1960s rock group The Electric Elves evolved into Elf by the early 1970s, when the group played heavy blues rock. Dio's rock became darker with his band Rainbow, which he left in 1979 to join Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath released three albums with Dio, including ""Heaven and Hell"" in 1980, ""Mob Rules"" in 1981 and ""Live Evil"" in 1982. Dio left that band in 1982, but he had a brief reunion with the group a decade later. He formed the group Dio in 1982 and later Heaven and Hell.","Rock community paid tribute to Dio in messages late Sunday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Investigators had a ""significant break"" in tracking the salmonella outbreak when they found the bacteria on a jalapeño pepper imported from Mexico at a Texas food supplier, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. The FDA has discouraged all consumers from eating raw jalapeño peppers. The FDA also warned consumers not to eat fresh jalapeños and products made with fresh jalapeños.

"(CNN) -- Professor Peter Furth has ridden his bicycle to work at Northeastern University each day for the past six years. The two-mile trip through the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts, is usually without incident. Furth's journey is worlds apart from his former Boston commute, which for 13 years was a battle with drivers who wanted him on the sidewalk. ""I've had motorists that drive a couple of inches from my elbow, trying to scare me,"" he said. Furth would catch up with drivers at stoplights and ask them whether they knew how close they'd come to hitting him. Invariably, they would say, ""Yes, move over."" It's a cultural thing, he said. In the town of Cambridge, motorists see bicyclists all over the place and are considerate. In Brookline, only every now and then does someone honk or yell. In the southern part of Boston, it's not quite war, but the relationship isn't very friendly. Although the street signs say ""Share the road,"" there's still a long road to travel before that sign reflects the reality, bicyclists say. Motorists often see bands of bikes on the streets on the final Fridays of each month as cyclists across the nation gather for evening group rides called Critical Mass. The purpose, advocates say, is to make cars and trucks more aware of bicyclists. But to some drivers, Critical Mass participants are nothing more than spandex-wearing, stop-sign-running Lance Armstrong wannabes who slow traffic. 'They think they own the road' It's somewhat symbolic of the tension on the roads. ""The roads were made for cars,"" KTAR-FM radio guest host John Hook said in Phoenix, Arizona, last month. ""And bicyclists share the road, but sometimes they think they own the road."" One caller to the program was a long-haul truck driver who accused many bicycle riders of failing to respect the law and not riding with the flow of traffic. A caller who identified himself as Jeff said he witnessed an incident in which a pack of bicyclists almost hit a car that had the right of way. Then the riders screamed at the motorist. ""I actually think the bikes are more disrespectful to the cars than the cars are to the bike,"" Jeff said. The number of cyclists is increasing. Although bike sales took a dip during the recession of 2009, more than 18 million were sold each year for the seven previous years, according to the National Sporting Goods Association. About 27 percent of adults in the United States bike at least once a summer, according a survey released in 2008 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Most bicyclists ride for recreation or exercise, while a small percentage ride to work. In Portland, Oregon, which is ranked second on Bicycling magazine's list of Top 50 Bike Friendly Cities, more than 6 percent of residents commute by bike to work. That's up from 1 percent two decades ago. See a map of the top 10 bike-friendly cities . Things are looking up, at least in the eyes of cyclists. Many cities are putting in bike lanes and paths. Google adds bike routes to maps . More than $730 million in federal stimulus funds has been allocated for bike and pedestrian projects, according to AmericaBikes.org. Washington is getting into the act. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood drew cheers from the cycling world in March when he blogged that the administration was ""integrating the needs of bicyclists in federally-funded road projects"" and advising state departments of transportation to treat biking and walking ""as equals with other transportation modes."" That drew an outcry from industry, which saw the new policy as taking money away from large transportation construction needs. ""Treating bicycles and other non-motorized transportation as equal to motorized transportation would cause an economic catastrophe,"" Carter Wood, a senior adviser at the National Association of Manufacturers, told The New York Times. ""If put it into effect, the policy would more than undermine any effort the Obama administration has made toward jobs. You can't have jobs without the efficient movement of freight."" Five blocks of controversy . Michael Ritchey is an avid biker and believes that bike lanes are good idea. He just thinks the project to add them to a five-block stretch of Hillsborough Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, is folly -- and dangerous. Hillsborough Street is one of the main arteries in Raleigh and borders the northern part of North Carolina State University and its 30,000 students. There are bars and shops and small restaurants. And lots of cars. The city, working with the state, has decided to redo the four-lane road, and when the project is done, there will be two lanes for cars, a center median and bike lanes on each side. Ritchey, who owns Global Village Organic Coffee and is a weekend cyclist, fears that bikers will get hurt. ""They are putting [the bike lanes] in the wrong place,"" he said. ""It's more of a symbolic gesture."" And it doesn't help that the relationship between cars and bicyclists in the city is ""antagonistic at best,"" he said. Ritchey is worried that distracted college students won't be on the lookout for bikers and someone will get hurt when a car door opens at the wrong time or someone texting will have an accident (he's seen that twice with cars). He said one of his business neighbors opposes the projects because he fears that he will lose parking spaces in front of the bar. City councilwoman Nancy McFarlane points out that the bikers are already there on Hillsborough and other in-town streets, and the city of 348,000 is growing quickly. Many people are moving into the downtown area, and last year, the city revised its comprehensive plan. ""The old one was all about the car, and we want to become a multimodal city,"" she said. ""That includes bikes, buses and light rail."" Steve Waters is one resident in favor of bike lanes. The freelance programmer works at home and uses his bike for short errands. He said that although some Hillsborough Street business owners might be concerned about losing money because of less car traffic, the opposite is likely to happen. ""It enhances the local economy,"" he said. ""It's all about creating options."" Bicycling.com: The best road bikes of 2010 . Not every street should get a bike lane . Although opponents say the money is better spent on other road projects, cycling advocates say the lanes are needed to make the roads safer and less congested. Denver, Colorado, is ranked 12th on Bicycling magazine's list. The city has little room for new roads, municipal bike planner Emily Kreisa said. She said Denver is interested in using bicycles to eliminate congestion and to help the environment, but they don't just add a bike lane anywhere. Bicycling.com: Five cities to watch . ""We look at the traffic volume, the turning issues and how much room we have in the right of way,"" she said. ""In choosing any kind of [project], the first thing is what is the connection to the system, then what is the characteristic of the road and then how do we need to provide for the cyclist."" Denver received $250,000 of stimulus money for cycling projects and is going to add 11 miles of bike lanes. The city is using its own funds to paint sharrows (painted bike symbols on the asphalt with arrows showing cyclists the way) to connect the roads of the network. Kreisa, who bikes 10 miles to work, says Denver is by far the easiest place she has commuted on two wheels. ""I've had one person honk at me and one person tell me to move over to the right,"" she said of her two years in the city.

"(CNN) -- Days of violent unrest in the Thai capital have left dozens dead and hundreds injured as security forces clash with anti-government protesters. The latest victims include a key opposition leader, Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol -- a renegade general better known as Seh Daeng -- who died days after being critically wounded by a sniper's bullet. But the current crisis follows a months-long standoff between Thai authorities and protesters opposed to the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. The protesters -- known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) -- support Thaksin Shinawatra, who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006, before he was ousted in a bloodless coup. What is happening now? The latest violence follows a government pledge to hold an election in November in an attempt to halt the protests. However, amid ongoing anger over a crackdown by security forces last month and a refusal by the protesters to comply with a deadline to vacate the district of Bangkok they have been occupying for weeks, authorities say the election date is now under threat. Prime Minister Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators (known as ""Red Shirts"" for the clothes they wear) stormed the country's parliament. Three days later, the deadliest clash in more than a decade between protesters (in this case the Red Shirts) and the military erupted, leading to the deaths of more than two dozen demonstrators and military forces. Violence erupted again last week when protesters once again ignored an ultimatum to end their occupation in downtown Bangkok by Wednesday. Seh Daeng's subsequent shooting by an unknown assailant raised tensions further and at least 35 people have been killed and 240 wounded in the latest wave of unrest. The government has imposed a state of emergency in 22 provinces and metropolitan Bangkok. What happens next? Authorities have urged protesters to evacuate the protest area by Monday afternoon or face up to two years in prison for violating the order. But around 5,000 protesters remained on the streets in defiance of the authorities. On Sunday protest leaders offered to resume talks with the government in U.N.-mediated negotiations if security forces were withdrawn from the streets. But the government has not accepted the offer. A senior official told CNN that authorities were under pressure to be more decisive in taking action to end the protests and claimed the government had been showing patience and restraint. Media and analysts in Thailand say civil war may be looming, between the Red Shirts and the so-called ""multi-colored shirts"" (who support Abhisit). They are displeased with the disruption caused by the protests. They are generally middle-class city dwellers. They are not pro- or anti-government, they simply want the government to shut down the Reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life. The red and multi-colored shirts have clashed in Silom Road, Bangkok's business and financial district. How will Seh Daeng's death affect the protest movement? CNN's Sara Sidner said it was unclear what the immediate impact of Seh Daeng's death would be. ""Not all the protesters followed him as some thought he was too much of a hardliner,"" Sidner said. Some protesters argue that the Red Shirt movement should negotiate with the government to reach a settlement. But militant armed factions loyal to Seh Daeng and known as ""Black Shirts"" reject negotiation and appear ready to use violence to achieve their goals. Haven't these protests been going on for a long time? Yes, Thailand has been embroiled in political chaos for years and many here are growing weary with the instability. Ever since Thaksin came to power, there have been protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule. Those protesters donned yellow shirts (the color of the king) and occupied the two main airports in Bangkok, until finally the pro-Thaksin government was brought down by a court ruling. In revenge Thaksin's supporters copied the yellow shirt tactics and took to the streets in red shirts. Why do the sides divide on colors? It's an easy way for them to create an identity. It all started with the Yellow Shirts wearing a color associated with Monday, the day of the week that Thailand's revered king was born on. That was designed to show their allegiance to the king, and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated Thai politics for years. Thaksin's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the Yellow Shirts. Why are they arguing? Essentially this is a classic power struggle. It's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor, but it is much more complicated than that, as illustrated by the fact that the Reds' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire. Thaksin rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor. His radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite, who felt he was in danger of becoming too big for his boots, and could erode their position. The ""civil society"" also become concerned over allegations of corruption and his brutal war on drugs, which saw summary executions. He was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the Muslim-dominated south. Finally the army decided to oust him in a coup, which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class, who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around Thaksin. That set the stage for an embittered power struggle, between Thaksin loyalists and those loyal to the army, aristocracy and their traditional Democrat Party. So who is Thaksin? Visionary leader or venal despot: Opinions vary, like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear. If you sport red, you think Thaksin was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits; if you wear yellow, you view him as akin to Ferdinand Marcos: greedy, self-serving and dangerous. What is not in dispute is that he won two elections, was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full-term in office and is still hugely popular. But critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself. As a businessman, Thaksin made billions of dollars from his communications company Shin Corporation. In 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value and he faces other corruption charges. More  than $2 billion in Thaksin's family assets are currently frozen in Thailand but there is speculation he has a great deal more money elsewhere. What are the wider implications of the protests? If the divisions in Thailand can't be healed it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region. Thailand's relations with Cambodia are especially frosty since Thaksin was appointed economic adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. The worst case scenario would see Cambodia drawn into the dispute, with Thaksin using the country as a political base, adding to the already considerable tensions on the border. Is Thailand safe for visitors? Many western embassies have shut their doors and are warning their citizens against travel to Bangkok as violence in the city continues. ""Due to escalating violence in central Bangkok, including gunfire near the U.S. Embassy, demonstrations in Chiang Mai, and other incidents throughout Thailand, U.S. citizens should defer all travel to Bangkok and defer all non-essential travel to the rest of Thailand,"" the U.S. State Department has warned. As well as advising against travel to Bangkok, the UK Foreign Office warned of protests and violent incidents in popular tourist destinations such as Pattaya, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Ayutthaya. But Bangkok's main Suvarnabhumi airport is operating as normal it said. CNN's Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","Thaksin supporters say that he gave the rural poor a voice and real benefits .

"(CNN) -- ""Movies aren't an actor's medium...actors are just color in other people's paintings,"" Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey told CNN's Talk Asia. ""I think there's almost any actor whose been around for a while who can say this with absolute conviction that sometimes you go and see a movie that you've made and you know you made a better movie than they cut."" He hasn't turned his back on his profession, but the versatile performer who won two Academy Awards for his roles in ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""American Beauty,"" has happily embraced the other challenges that have come his way. From reviving the fortunes of The Old Vic theatre in London to production credits on a number of films, acting has now become just one of Spacey's numerous professional guises. His latest venture is appearing in a joint production in China called ""Inseparable"" featuring Daniel Wu and Chinese actress Gong Beibi. ""I think there's no doubt that China is the next place for film-- there's no doubt -- and that collaborations, this kind of exchange of a Western actor coming to make a Chinese film is a very exciting step,"" he said. After his Chinese experience he'll be focusing on film until 2012 when he will then lead The Bridge Project, a transatlantic theatrical production company comprised of The Old Vic in London and Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York. The company will be bringing ""The Tempest"" to Hong Kong and Singapore in March and April. Longer term plans could see Spacey return to the stage, but as a singer. His 2005 biopic ""Beyond the Sea"" on 1950s crooner Bobby Darin was a labor of love where Spacey was able to perform the songs of one of his heroes. To promote the movie he even toured with a 20-piece big band across the U.S. ""I think it's great that actually Vegas wants to be able to bring back the headliner, and I think the nightclub act is one of the greatest things ever. ""But that to me would be to me kind of fun to do again at some point, because I love singing and I don't get a chance to sing as much as I'd like, so we'll see what happens.""","Spacey is an Oscar-winning actor and artistic director of The Old Vic in London .

"(CNN) -- The 9-year-old boy who was the lone survivor of a plane crash that killed 103 people in Libya plans to return to the Netherlands on Saturday, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said Friday. He is scheduled to leave Tripoli, Libya, at 10 a.m. Saturday and fly home with an aunt and uncle, as well as a doctor, the ministry said in a statement. Ruben van Assouw suffered multiple fractures to his legs and underwent surgery at Al Khadra Hospital, said a doctor who declined to give her name. Both of Ruben's parents and a brother were killed in the crash, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. Acting on a request from the boy's relatives, authorities do not plan to say where the plane will land, and the media will not be present when it does, the ministry statement said. ""His relatives have appealed to the media to exercise restraint and to leave Ruben and his family in peace at this difficult time,"" it said. Authorities said Ruben was the only survivor after an Afriqiyah Airways plane crashed at 6 a.m. Wednesday. The boy's aunt and uncle arrived in Tripoli to visit him Thursday. Saif al Islam Gadhafi, the second eldest son of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, visited the boy in the hospital along with airline chairman Capt. Sabri Shadi, according to a statement on Afriqiyah Airways' website. More than two thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the foreign ministry said. Passengers from Libya, South Africa, Belgium, Austria, Germany, France, Zimbabwe and Britain were also among the victims, the airline said on its website. The plane, an Airbus A330-200, departed Johannesburg, South Africa, and was at the end of its nearly nine-hour flight when it crashed. Officials recovered the plane's flight data recorder, but investigators are still trying to determine what caused the crash.

"(Health.com) -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is often, but not always, caused by smoking. While the risk reduction is relatively small, 10 percent, COPD is a common and life-threatening condition in which a decline in lung function can be slowed down but not reversed. COPD symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue. ""The effect appears to be modest. But for something for which there isn't really any effective therapy and tends to be a degenerative condition, anything that would reduce the risk even somewhat is not an insubstantial benefit,"" says Jeffrey B. Blumberg, Ph.D., a professor of nutrition at Tufts University in Boston who was not involved in the study. The research, from the government-funded Women's Health Study, included 39,876 women 45 years and older who were free of COPD before they were randomly assigned to take a placebo, vitamin E supplements (600 IU every other day) or aspirin (100 mg per day), either alone or in combination. At the end of 10 years, 760 of the 19,937 women who took vitamin E alone or with aspirin developed COPD compared with 846 of the 19,939 who took a placebo or aspirin alone -- a 10 percent risk reduction. Vitamin E did not lower the risk of asthma, a condition associated with a higher risk of COPD. Health.com: 10 ways to have cleaner air at home . The researchers took into account factors such as cigarette smoking and age, which can affect COPD risk. The study, conducted by Cornell University and Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers, is to be presented this week at the annual American Thoracic Society meeting in New Orleans. The idea that vitamin E can reduce the risk of developing COPD is ""biologically plausible,"" says Yvonne Kelly, Ph.D., an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London. Experts believe vitamins A, C, and E -- the so-called ACE antioxidants -- combat oxidative stress in the lungs that can lead to COPD. Health.com: Eight causes of a chronic cough . Several studies have shown that these vitamins, as well as vitamin D, may help improve lung health. In a 2003 study, Kelly and her collaborators found that men and women with diets high in vitamins C and E had greater lung capacity and produced less phlegm, respectively. Phlegm production and wheezing are also COPD symptoms. One limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on the women to report whether or not they had a diagnosis of COPD, says Michael Sims, M.D., an assistant professor in the pulmonary critical care division at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. He points out that people with asthma may think they have COPD, or vice versa, since the symptoms are similar. In addition, early diagnoses can be inconclusive or due to lung problems that don't turn out to be COPD. Health.com: How to buy the right air cleaner . In future studies, Sims says that the researchers should diagnose COPD using a breathing test called spirometry. ""If you showed in a similar study with a gold standard outcome [like spirometry], among smokers and nonsmokers, that you could affect the incidence of COPD, I would imagine the committees that meet on this would take a serious look at increasing daily recommended intake [of vitamin E] for the general population,"" he says. Currently, no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD. The best way to prevent the disease is to quit smoking, says Dr. Sims. About 24 million people in the U.S. have COPD -- 12 million who've been diagnosed with the disease and another 12 million who have COPD but don't know they have it. In the study, women who smoked were four times more likely than nonsmokers to develop COPD. Health.com:12 best COPD blogs and Web sites . The daily recommended intake of vitamin E is about 22 international units for those 14 and older, and is relatively easy to obtain from oils such as sunflower, almonds, peanut butter, and spinach. The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher, at 300 IU per day. However, Blumberg says this is within the range of most over-the-counter vitamin supplements, which deliver 100 or 400 IU daily. ""This study is still five times below the highest dose at which no adverse effect has been found,"" he says. Vitamin E intake is generally a concern only at very high doses, above 1500 IU per day. Several studies have suggested that these levels promote hemorrhaging and interfere with normal blood clotting. For this reason, high doses of vitamin E are not recommended for people taking blood-thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin) and aspirin. Health.com: Eight breathing tips for people with COPD . For people concerned about their lung health, taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea, says Blumberg. ""If I were talking to somebody who was a former smoker and who was concerned about minimizing their risk of not only lung disease but also heart disease and cancer, then taking a supplement of C and E would be a reasonable thing to do,"" he says. In fact, anyone who thought he or she was at increased risk of COPD could potentially benefit from these supplements, he adds. Supplements of beta-carotene, which is a precursor of the antioxidant vitamin A, should be used with caution, however. While a 2006 French study found that people with diets high in beta-carotene had a slower decline in lung function over an eight-year period, heavy smokers and drinkers may not benefit. Two studies found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in people who smoked more than one pack a day and drank heavily. According to Sims, the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin E or other antioxidants to help prevent COPD.

"(CNN) -- Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin joined the national battle over Arizona's controversial new immigration law Saturday, appearing with Gov. Jan Brewer in Phoenix to denounce the Obama administration's criticism of the law. ""It's time for Americans across this great country to stand up and say 'We're all Arizonans now and, in clear unity, we say Mr. President, do your job, secure our border,'"" Palin said, standing beside Brewer at a Saturday afternoon press conference. Brewer used the event to announce her first appointment to the state's new Joint Border Security Advisory Committee and the launch of a Website to combat what she said was a national misinformation campaign about the state's new law. Palin and Brewer, both Republicans, decried plans by opponents of the new law to boycott the state in protest. Passed in April, the law requires immigrants in Arizona to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance. Critics say it will lead to racial profiling, while supporters deny that and say it is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants. President Obama has criticized the Arizona law, saying that in dealing with the immigration issue, ""the answer isn't to undermine fundamental principles that define us as a nation."" ""You can imagine if you are an Hispanic American in Arizona, your great grandparents may have been there before Arizona was even a state, but now suddenly if you don't have your papers, and you took your kid out to get ice cream, you're gonna be harassed,"" Obama said, referring to the statute at a April rally in Iowa. ""That's something that could potentially happen,"" he said. ""That's not the right way to go."" Brewer signed a package of changes to the law shortly after it passed that she said addressed concerns about profiling, though critics said the changes made little difference. Palin joined Brewer on Saturday in denying the statute would lead to racial profiling. ""I think for most American people the reaction to that would be, 'Why aren't (police) already doing that?'"" the former Alaska governor said. ""And while Mexico's president has begun to crack down on the violent drug cartels and corruption in his own country,"" she continued, ""It's time for the United States government to enforce the rule of law as well."" Brewer also took jabs at Obama and the federal government.

"(CNN) -- President Obama will sign an executive order establishing a presidential commission to investigate the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, an administration official said Monday. Eight U.S. senators called earlier Monday for an independent federal investigation of whether oil giant BP violated civil or criminal laws in connection with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It hasn't been determined when Obama will make the announcement of the presidential commission or when he'll sign the executive order, said the official, who did not want to speak on the record ahead of an announcement. ""The commission will take into account the investigations under way concerning the causes of the spill and explore a range of issues,"" the official said. In particular, the commission's inquiry will focus on industry practices, rig safety, regulatory regimes, federal governmental oversight -- including the structure and functions of the Minerals Management Service -- and environmental review and other protections, the official said. Last week, Obama harshly criticized the companies involved in the spill, which threatens to become one of the nation's worst environmental disasters, and pledged to break up what he called the cozy relationship between regulators and the oil industry. In testimony on Capitol Hill, BP touted its progress toward plugging the spill, but a top Obama administration official said the disaster is far from over. Officials grilled on oil spill . ""We are in the middle of this crisis. We are not at the beginning,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a Senate committee Monday afternoon. ""We've been at it a month almost, but we are not near the end as well."" BP has successfully inserted a siphon into the damaged riser pipe from the underwater well at the heart of the spill. The procedure has allowed the company to collect more than 1,000 barrels (42,000 gallons) of oil a day that would otherwise spill into the Gulf, said Doug Suttles, the company's chief operating officer. That, combined with the use of chemical dispersants to break up the spill, has reduced the amount of oil reaching the surface, he said. ""This [is] probably the smallest amount of oil I've seen on the surface since the effort began,"" Suttles said. The well had been spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day into the Gulf since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Eleven workers are presumed dead after the sinking, and the cause has not been determined. Some of the oil has washed ashore on the Louisiana coast, and tar balls related to the spill have turned up as far east as Dauphin Island, Alabama. Some estimates put the amount of oil gushing from the well far higher than the 5,000-barrel-per-day estimate made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a few days after the spill began. Samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface. Samantha Joye, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that the size of the suspected plumes is hard to determine. ""Nothing like it has really ever been seen in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico before,"" she said. ""It's not only a large feature, but it's a very complex feature. There's a lot of vertical structure to it."" But federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed. Charlie Henry, a scientific adviser from NOAA, said descriptions of ""layers of oil"" beneath the Gulf were ""totally untrue."" ""They were able to detect what we think is hydrocarbons in the water column. It was stated as oil, but it wasn't like oil you could see,"" Henry told reporters Monday afternoon. The researchers were looking into the effects of the undersea dispersants used to break up the oil near the mouth of the well, nearly a mile beneath the surface, NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a statement issued Monday. But Lubchenco said the agency does not consider dispersants -- which have their own hazards -- ""a silver bullet."" ""They are used to move us towards the lesser of two environmental outcomes. Until the flow of oil is stemmed, we must take every responsible action to reduce the impact of the oil,"" she said. Suttles said the next step in capping the well is a ""top kill"" procedure, in which a large amount of heavy ""mud"" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, he said. ""That is the method we think we will be deploying later this week or this weekend,"" Suttles said. Another option -- putting debris in the well to stop the flow -- may also be utilized, he said. And once the leak is sealed, ""We intend to fill up the bottom of this well with cement and it will never be produced."" BP, as the well's owner, is responsible for stopping the underwater gusher and paying for the cleanup, and Napolitano said the company has paid more than $9.6 million so far without denying a claim. BP America CEO Lamar McKay, who appeared with Napolitano before the Homeland Security Committee, said the company was concentrating on plugging the leak and limiting the economic damage. ""We will put blame, liability, and those kind of things over to the side. That's not our concern right now,"" he said. Large oil plumes may pose additional threat . The April 20 explosion aboard Deepwater Horizon has left BP, rig owner-operator Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton pointing fingers at each other over the cause of the blast. The doomed rig's chief electronics technician told the CBS news program ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday that Transocean was being pushed to complete the well quickly because it was taking longer than expected -- an allegation Suttles would not discuss during an appearance on ""American Morning."" ""I know people are talking about various things that occurred that night on the rig, but I actually haven't seen any of the results of these interviews or investigations ...

Chris Oynes told his bosses after the Deepwater Horizon explosion that he would retire at the end of June, an administration official told CNN, but announced Monday that he would step down at the end of May instead. Oynes has been associate director of the Minerals Management Service's Offshore Minerals Management Program since 2007. In the past, critics have accused MMS of being too cozy with the industries it regulates. A 2008 report from the Interior Department's inspector-general found MMS employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar last week announced he would split MMS into separate divisions -- one for regulating offshore oil drilling and the other for collecting royalties from oil companies. Salazar is scheduled to appear before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday, while Elizabeth Birnbaum, the current MMS director, will appear before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. CNN's David Mattingly and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.","8 senators want to know if oil giant violated laws in connection with Gulf spill .

"Tuwaitha, Iraq (CNN) -- The shell of former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's efforts to produce a nuclear bomb is being slowly dismantled along the banks of the Tigris River, but its radioactive legacy lingers on. The Tuwaitha research complex, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Baghdad, was bombed by Israel in its 1981 airstrike on Iraq's Tammuz 1 research reactor. It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein. Now, engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site, but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work. ""It is difficult because of the destruction,"" said Anwar Ahmed, the project manager at Tuwaitha. ""This facility was bombed in 1991. Now, finally the decision was made to decommission all the destroyed facilities."" Workers and visitors have to wear protective suits and masks around the facility, where about 20 people are at work so far. Iraq's ministry of Science and Technology said it is training more specialists to decommission the facility, but acknowledged the cleanup could take decades. ""We have 18 facilities in Tuwaitha,"" said Fuad al Musawi, Iraq's deputy science and technology minister. ""We have another 10 facilities around the country. So you can imagine how long it will take."" Iraq's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s, when it obtained a Soviet-built research reactor. It built another, French-designed reactor in the 1970s. Israel's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid, in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility. Despite the damage inflicted by that attack, Iraq began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group reported in 2004. It accelerated that program after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait left it facing an international military coalition that ultimately drove out the Iraqi forces. The bombardment that accompanied the 1991 war inflicted extensive damage to the Tuwaitha plants. The U.N. sanctions and inspections imposed after 1991 forced Hussein's government to abandon its nuclear program, the ISG concluded. After the 2003 invasion, which was launched after the United States incorrectly accused Iraq of having restarted its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, nearby Iraqis inflicted further damage by looting the unguarded facility. Villagers nearby complained of symptoms that local doctors attributed to radiation sickness, particularly from using containers taken from the plant to store drinking water. The Iraq Survey Group found basements full of radioactive water in some of the buildings, and the U.S. military later spent $70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of non-weapons grade uranium oxide -- known as ""yellowcake"" -- to Canada. Some Iraqi scientists still hope to start a civilian nuclear energy program in the future. But for now, Iraq is still grappling with the shadow of its past.","Complex at the center of Saddam Hussein's nuclear efforts slowly being dismantled .

"(CNN) -- A disgruntled employee shot to death the owners of a store in Boulder, Colorado, and then may have turned the gun on himself, police said Tuesday. Police found Sean Griffin, 40, and his wife Staci Griffin, 41, dead in a back room of the Boulder Stove & Flooring on Monday morning. Also dead was Robert Montgomery, 50. Montgomery had a 9 mm Smith & Wesson handgun in his hand and appeared to have suffered a single gunshot wound, said police spokeswoman Sarah Huntley. The Griffins sustained multiple wounds. Montgomery told friends and wrote in a journal that he was upset over a recent change in sales commission and bonus policy at work, Huntley said. He purchased the gun on May 7, she said. Police said Montgomery had been employed at Boulder Stove & Flooring since 2003. A salesman and a customer were inside the store when the gunshots rang out at 11:09 a.m. They jumped in the customer's vehicle, drove away and called 911, Huntley said. Police arrived minutes later to find the three dead. An autopsy will determine whether Montgomery was the shooter, but Huntley said police suspect him after finding the same kind of Cor-Bon 9 mm ammunition at his house that was used in the shooting. Police said they found 13 spent shell casings around the scene of the shootings with one round still in the chamber of the gun. No rounds were left in the magazine, they said. At his home, they found a box of Cor-Bon 9 mm ammunition with 14 rounds missing. Investigators said they found a second magazine in Montgomery's backpack loaded with 10 rounds of Eagle brand 9 mm ammunition. At his home, they found an empty box of Eagle 9 mm ammunition.","Police find three dead in Colorado store .

"(CNN) -- England striker Wayne Rooney is expected to be fit for the World Cup in South Africa despite suffering another injury setback on club duty with Manchester United on Sunday. The 24-year-old, who last month was sidelined with ankle damage, went off with a recurrence of his recent groin problem 13 minutes from the end of United's 4-0 victory over Stoke. He was unable to score, finishing his European season with 34 goals and missing out on the Premier League's golden boot award to Chelsea's Didier Drogba, who netted a hat-trick in the 8-0 victory over Wigan that ended United's three-year grip on the title. England coach Fabio Capello will name his provisional 30-man squad for South Africa on Tuesday, and United were quick to dispel any fears that Rooney might be not fit for his second World Cup finals appearance. ""He should be okay,"" assistant manager Mike Phelan told the UK Press Association. ""All the phone calls and all the worries we can dispel straight away. ""He should be fine. It is just a precaution and he will be looking forward to his World Cup."" Marcello Lippi, coach of world champions Italy, will also name his preliminary squad on Tuesday. Veteran striker Francesco Totti's chances of being called out of international retirement were seriously damaged by his red card in the Italian Cup final defeat by Inter Milan last Wednesday. The 33-year-old redeemed himself with two goals on Sunday as second-placed Roma kept the Serie A title race going into the final round of the season, but on Monday he was handed a four-match Italian Cup ban for his controversial challenge on Inter striker Mario Balotelli. Balotelli, who said Totti had abused him, was also given a one-match suspension along with Inter teammate Cristian Chivu for separate incidents. Totti won the last of his 58 international caps in the 2006 World Cup final win over France, which ended Lippi's first stint in charge, and made himself unavailable a year after that. Totti's Roma strike partner Luca Toni also faces an anxious wait to see if he will be included in Lippi's squad. German media reported on Monday that his parent club Bayern Munich do not want him back despite having a contract until the end of next season, while Italian paper Gazzetta dello Sport said Roma president Rosella Sensi was unwilling to extend his stay.","Manchester United insist Wayne Rooney will be fit for World Cup despite latest setback .

"(CNN) -- For a few days there, it looked as if the typographical error was finally going to get its moment in the sun. The lowly typo -- a hastily pecked keystroke with a bad result -- has long been regarded as an irritation, a sloppy glitch, a skimmed-over eyesore. It's really much more than that, which we will delve into in a few paragraphs. But first, the typo's blown opportunity to gain worldwide stature: . When the financial markets were on the verge of a nervous breakdown this month, on the day the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted almost 1,000 points in 15 minutes, analysts and regulators immediately, frantically, started looking for a reason. Nothing on this scale had ever happened before. Who or what was responsible? Initially, suspicions centered on the ""fat-finger theory."" What this meant was that a trader with a symbolically fat finger (meaning a careless one) had purportedly entered a computer-ordered sale of billions of shares of stocks; the theory was that when he had meant to type in ""million,"" he instead typed in ""billion."" If this was so, it would have been the typographical error of all time: the Babe Ruth/Muhammad Ali/Frank Sinatra of typos. If one keystroke could put the world's economy on the brink of collapse, this would mean that a typo could be as powerful as an atomic bomb. By the end of last week, it was looking as if the fat-finger typo might not be the culprit. Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told Congress that while no cause for the financial plunge could be definitively ruled out, the typo-as-Armageddon was increasingly appearing to be an unlikely explanation. Drat. If a typo had been shown to have that kind of muscle, maybe the societal trend to regard typos as no big deal might have been reversed. In our computer-screen age, typos -- and their cousins, misspellings and grammatical errors -- have been given a reprieve. What once prompted people to shake their heads in stern disapproval when it appeared on newspaper or magazine pages -- a flat-out mistake, caused by lazy typing and indifferent proofreading -- produces not as much of a stir when seen on a glowing screen. The theory seems to be that, in e-mails and instant messages and various other forms of digital discourse, speed counts for more than accuracy, and those whose blood pressures rise when they see such typos are stodgy, ancient, out of touch. The contemporary attitude is: Who cares if a few words are mistyped? But it's a matter of discipline. It's a matter of diligence. You may have heard the wonderful story in recent days about what happened when CNN senior producer David Daniel was walking to work at the network's Los Angeles bureau. Daniel was striding along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as he does each morning en route to the office, when he glanced down at a newly installed pink stone star on the sidewalk. It was a star that was going to be introduced to the public that very day. It was intended to honor the actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Except the name on the star was: . Julia Luis Dreyfus. No ""o"" in Louis. No hyphen. Daniel, who told me he takes pride in being a longtime copy editor, could not simply walk on by. Dismayed, he stared at the star. ""I'm one of those annoying people who notices typos on restaurant menus,"" he told me. ""Annoying?"" Hardly. When it comes to words, he's a stickler, which is a fine thing to be. What he did next has elevated him into contention for patron saint of sticklers: . He phoned in a correction. He couldn't let this pass. He called the people who run the Hollywood Walk of Fame, told them about their typo that was set in stone and made certain the star got fixed. ""I can't help it,"" he told me. ""I go crazy when I see missing apostrophes."" He was preaching to the choir. My own obsessed-proofreader story is not quite as good as Daniel's, but it establishes us as kindred spirits. Some years ago, during my first and only visit to Shea Stadium in New York, I was with some friends watching the Mets play the Chicago Cubs in a night game. Ryne Sandberg of the Cubs, who would go on to be voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, came up to bat. In Shea Stadium there was a huge video screen behind center field, and as each batter came to the plate a gigantic color photo of him appeared on the screen, accompanied by his name. Sandberg's smiling face was up on the screen, all right. So was the name, in huge letters visible all over the stadium: . ""Ryan Sandberg."" Not Ryne. Ryan. I knew I shouldn't say anything. I knew, in the scheme of all the world's woes, it would make no difference. I knew I should just sit back and enjoy the ball game on a lovely, warm evening. But I couldn't help myself. I sought out a front-office executive of the Mets. ""Look,"" I said, pointing to the outfield. ""What's wrong?"" he said. It took him about 15 seconds to figure it out. ""Oh, my,"" he said. That night was my version of the Julia Louis-Dreyfus star. At Sandberg's next at-bat, Ryan became Ryne. A small victory for precision, perhaps. But we all take such victories where we find them. I half-wish that it had, indeed, been a typo that sent the Dow into that tailspin. It would have imbued typos with the seriousness they deserve, and would have been an inspiring triumph for sticklers everywehre. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","The societal trend to regard typos as no big deal is wrong, says Bob Greene .

"(CNN) -- West Indies pace bowling legend Michael Holding has launched a passionate defence of Test cricket, claiming that the 20/20 version of the game is threatening to completely destroy the five-day format. Speaking exclusively to CNN, Holding -- who has just released his autobiography ""No Holding Back"" -- admitted he disliked the limited-overs game so much that he turned down television work on the recent world 20/20 championship in his native West Indies. ""I am not interested in 20/20 at all. Maybe I am an old fogey but I think it is destroying Test cricket,"" said Holding. Blog: 20/20 broadening cricket's appeal . ""Kids should be playing Test cricket and then maybe progressing to 20/20 once established. But now, with all the money available in 20/20, top young players are not going to be interested in playing the five-day game. ""When you can earn $800,000 for playing six weeks in the Indian Premier League (IPL), why waste six years trying to earn that sort of money in Test cricket? ""If this isn't controlled properly, Test cricket will die. When I was playing, people said: 'Test cricket is too slow,' so they brought in 50-over one-day cricket. Now it's down to 20-overs. What happens next? 15 overs? 10 overs?. Holding also believes that Test cricket is not being helped by the way the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is managing the game. ""The ICC needs to see how football's governing body FIFA runs things. The ICC are letting the Indian Cricket Board (BBCI) dictate how cricket is run and that is all wrong. India is where the money is in cricket at the moment but that doesn't mean they should have a say in how cricket is governed. ""FIFA wouldn't let Brazil dictate how to run football and cricket shouldn't let India have more of a say just because they have money there. ""Basically, the ICC are governing cricket so badly that soon nobody will pay any attention to them at all. If Test cricket is boring it is because the ICC are handling the calendar all wrong. ""Bangladesh are playing a series in England soon, but who cares?. Imagine there was a two-division system, six teams in each, with promotion and relegation. India to face Pakistan with the losers being relegated to Division Two -- now that would be a Test series to watch!"" Holding also told CNN that he would suspend any player found to have been betting on matches, although would stop short of banning them for life. ""No cricketer, in fact no sportsman, should be betting on matches -- to win or lose. If there is irrefutable evidence that a player has been caught betting on matches, they have to be banned.

"(CNN) -- Sean Penn could have been walking the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. Instead, he was under the Capitol Dome in Washington on Wednesday to testify about Haiti. Penn's newest film, spy thriller ""Fair Game,"" will debut Thursday at Cannes, but the day before, the Oscar-winning actor was seated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as witness to an emergency. ""I come here today in the hope that we will address with bold clarity the razor's edge upon which Haiti lies,"" he said.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- The massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has triggered heated debate about where the United States gets its energy supplies. Some say domestic drilling is necessary to avoid U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Others say the country needs to look to other fuel sources. But one man has found his own solution. Patrick Vanderwyden uses solar power to run his water heater, hot tub, air conditioner, fans, and his refrigerator at his home of 24 years. Three years ago, the self-described New Age hippie began a personal mission to cut his energy usage by switching to alternative energy. ""What I do now has an effect on future generations,"" said Vanderwyden, 49. ""I don't want to leave future generations with a real problem if I can help it. And I think I can."" The sun also powers most of Vanderwyden's transportation. On any given day the conservationist can be seen throughout town quietly driving something with pedals or an electric motor. He has a collection of recycled bikes, an electric cycle and one bike fashioned from spare parts that he calls ""Frankenbike."" Vanderwyden carefully drives the strange-looking contraption, powered by a treadmill motor, since it can easily exceed the top legal speed of 18 mph allowed for electric bikes, he said. He also has in his arsenal of alternative vehicles a Chevrolet pickup truck with an electric motor. Vanderwyden stumbled upon the truck for sale on the internet auction site eBay. It already had been converted by a New Jersey electric company. He says he reduced his energy use by nearly 30 percent last year compared with the year before. That's in contrast to worldwide energy consumption, which has continued to rise for decades. ""What was started in the '70s was turned off in the '80s as far as the conservation and the use of renewable energy,"" said Vanderwyden. The U.S. Department of Energy reports that demand for oil has almost doubled since 1970 and the demand will continue to increase for decades to come. Oil accounts for more than one-third of U.S. energy use. The Energy Department statistics show that in 2008, the vast majority of America's petroleum use went toward consumer vehicles, commercial vehicles and air travel. Fuel-efficient hybrid cars only account for a small percentage of cars sold today, although the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Institute predicted that by 2035, alternative fuel cars will account for more than half of the cars bought. Critics of electric vehicles point out that electricity is mainly produced by coal-powered plants which, in turn, create large amounts of greenhouse gases. Acknowleging that concern, Vanderwyden said he reduces how often he drives his electric pickup truck. Instead, Vanderwyden drives his electric bike charged from his solar panels as often as possible. The conservationist admits his actions are extreme but says if everyone would reduce their energy use a little, ""all of us together would make an impact."" ""I'm sad about this oil spill, but at least it's bringing some attention to this issue again,"" he said. ""I really hope that [it] gets people to understand that it's our demand that ... makes them want to drill a mile deep in the Gulf of Mexico.""","In 2007, Patrick Vanderwyden began a mission to cut his energy use .

""You know, you always need a lot of luck,"" Jagger told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""And I think [the Stones] were in the right place at the right time. And ... when we work, we work very hard."" The Stones have been rocking for nearly 50 years, and even though its members are now at an age when most people have retired, the band shows no signs of slowing down. Tuesday marked the re-release of one of the Stones' most famous albums, ""Exile on Main Street."" The new album features previously unreleased tracks culled from recording sessions in a basement in France nearly 40 years ago. The album's release coincides with a documentary, ""Stones in Exile,"" out on DVD next month. ""Exile"" is ""a special album for me,"" said Jagger. ""It's one of the real good ones,"" he told King. ""And it's a real favorite of people. And we do play a lot on stage of this album. So, you know, I rank it right up there."" He said Stones fans are one reason the band is able to continue doing world tours. ""What really keeps it going is the audience, because ... you feed from the audience and their enthusiasm,"" Jagger said. ""And if you have an enthusiastic audience, you feel that ... you could give more, you know?"" Jagger said he and his bandmates learned how to play to an audience when they first started playing small clubs in England and developed an early following. ""We had a super enthusiastic club audience,"" he said. ""And that audience really taught us how to behave, how to have, you know, repartee with the audience and so on. Even from those early days, it's not really that different to the exchange that you get with a big audience."" And he also gave credit to the Beatles, calling them both ""rivals"" and ""trailblazers."" ""They were both rivals and they were also ... showing the way,"" he said. ""They were big international stars. ... Most English people have never really been stars outside of England. ... And the Beatles kind of showed that you could be international.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Idaho on Wednesday became the first state to pass a law saying no thanks to part of President Obama's health care proposal. The Idaho Health Care Freedom Act says in part, ""every person within the state of Idaho is and shall be free to choose or decline to choose any mode of securing health care services without penalty or threat of penalty."" Gov. C.L. ""Butch"" Otter, a Republican, said Wednesday he signed it because he believes any health care laws should ensure people are ""treated as an individual, rather than as an amorphous mass whose only purpose in this world is to obey federal mandates."" Several other states may follow suit. The governor of Virginia is expected to sign a bill passed in his state last week, and according to American Legislative Exchange Council, similar proposals have made it through one chamber of the legislatures in Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee. While such bills have recently failed in six states, 22 additional states have seen proposals introduced. These state laws would directly conflict with the national health care bill that Democrats are trying to pass, which includes a requirement that all individuals get health coverage or face a tax penalty. Several legal analysts said if Congress enacts a national health care law, it would supersede any state laws written to block them. ""I think most of the states that are passing these laws understand that they can't trump federal law with state law,"" said Professor Jonathan Siegel at George Washington University Law School. ""But what they get out of it is symbolic effect. They're sending a message to the federal politicians that they don't like the health care mandate."" Such state laws might not be the only legal challenge to Democratic health care legislation. Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican, on Tuesday sent a letter to the other 49 state attorneys general, asking them to join him ""in preparing a legal challenge to the constitutionality of whatever individual mandate provision emerges, immediately upon the legislation becoming law."" States have previously challenged federal laws and regulations in areas aside from health care. Five states have passed a Firearms Freedom Act, according to firearmsfreedomact.com, including Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The law declares that any guns that are manufactured and kept in-state are not subject to federal gun laws passed by Congress under interstate commerce authority, because the guns never crossed state lines. A number of states have also passed laws trying to wrest more control from Washington over issues such as how public lands are used or how a state's National Guard forces are deployed overseas, according to the 10th Amendment Center, which advocates for states' rights. While such laws may face an uphill path in court, supporters describe them as a sign of public opinion, which can still have impact. They point to last year's announcement of federal policy on medicinal marijuana, after 14 states passed laws to allow its use. While federal drug law makes no exception to allow medicinal use of marijuana, Attorney General Eric Holder said in October that prosecuting the use of medicinal marijuana users wouldn't be a priority. He said the Justice Department would instead ""effectively focus our resources on serious drug traffickers, while taking into account state and local laws.""

"(CNN) -- A year ago, football's finances seemed to be healthier than ever, bucking the trend of global economic hardship. The total European market had ballooned to a staggering $20.76 billion by the end of the 2007-8 season, and clubs -- especially in England -- splashed out big in the January 2009 transfer market, with the Premier League responsible for a record-breaking $252 million in player purchases. Things looked good. Spanish big-spenders Real Madrid, incredibly, then beat that English figure on their own in the off-season. Recession? Who's buying that. But this month's transfer merry-go-round looks like being a much more somber affair. Some big, big clubs are trying to stave off some big, big problems. Even given those rosy-looking figures of 2007-08, the most recent available, Europe's top clubs then still owed more than $6 billion according to a study by football finance expert Jose Maria Gay de Liébena, an accounting professor at the University of Barcelona. ""Clubs are getting deeper and deeper into the mire of enormous debt, and along with overvalued assets and costs that far outstrip income levels, this is the biggest of football's ills,"" Gay de Liébena said in his report. When reports start circulating that an outfit as big as Manchester United, regularly near the top of Deloitte's list of football's wealthiest clubs, are considering refinancing some $960 million of debt with a bond issue, then you know that something is up. The Glazer family saddled United with huge debts with their 2005 takeover, and the Americans also have outstanding personal sums owed on the deal which have since increased by $64 million, according to Britain's The Times newspaper. With European ruling body UEFA planning to bring in new rules governing debt and ownership from 2012 which mean clubs cannot spend more than they earn, the pressure is on to find a safe financial footing. Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich responded last week by converting the $540 million he has given the English club in interest-free loans into equity. And it's not just in England where clubs, also including the American-owned Liverpool, are battling to stay afloat in a sea of debt -- said to be around $4.3 billion for the whole of the Premier League, according to the Wall Street Journal. German giants Bayern Munich plan big wage cuts, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper, and may be forced to sell star asset Franck Ribery, long a target of Real, United and Chelsea. ""We are going to try to reduce the wages,"" the Bundesliga club's director of sport Christian Nerlinger said. ""The wages have gone through the roof and, therefore, we have got to get our message through to the players that a new contract does not necessarily mean a pay rise."" Belgian club Mouscron has been put into liquidation after being expelled from the Jupiler League on December 28 for failing to meet financial obligations, with debts of $1.15 million, ending 87 years of existence. While clubs such as United and Liverpool incurred vast debts when they were taken over by new owners, player wages have long been a major item on the expenses side of the balance sheet. Portsmouth have become the poster club of failed payments in recent times, on Tuesday failing to pay their players' wages for the fourth time this season. The English outfit is riddled with debt following two takeovers in the past six months, with former owner Alexandre Gaydamak claiming that he is still owed some $45 million in loans and the British tax department issuing a winding-up notice over unpaid debts. ""These chaps knew what they were getting. They must have realized there is a wage bill and the tax bill to meet every month. There are no surprises,"" Gaydamak told the www.fansonline.net Web site. The Premier League has also been forced to take action, diverting Portsmouth's latest $11 million in television money to Chelsea, Tottenham and Watford -- who are all owed sums by the struggling club for player transfers. And the problem is not restricted to the upper echelons of the English game, whose only big-spenders this month may be Chelsea and Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi oil billionaire Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Second division Crystal Palace, bankrolled by millionaire Simon Jordan, have failed to make wage payments to players on time for the past two months, and four times in the last year. Lower league club Notts County were saved from oblivion in July by the Munto Finance group, who promised to take the world's oldest side into the Premier League with a massive cash injection and the expensive acquisition of former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson as director of football. But that has fallen by the wayside with Munto selling to chairman Peter Trembling for a nominal fee, and the club again faces an uncertain future with a second winding-up order from the tax man, though Eriksson apparently remains committed to his post. Scottish clubs were last year forced to accept a far less lucrative replacement deal from Sky and ESPN following the collapse of Irish broadcaster Setanta, highlighting how precarious the existence of some leagues is. ""The economy of football is not an exception to the rule of economics,"" Gay de Liébena said. ""If one major sponsorship or television deal collapses, the clubs will sink.""","Football's finances may not be as healthy as previous figures have suggested .

"(CNN) -- The nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has caused quite a stir on the political left and right, as operatives on both sides try to ascertain exactly where she stands. But it has also opened another fissure in the complex relationship that exists between black organizational leaders and President Obama, the nation's first African-American president. Over the past year we have seen criticisms leveled by grass-roots activists, civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus. But instead of taking on the president, the beefs are largely aimed at ""those around the president."" In previous administrations, these same individuals wouldn't have hesitated to call out Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan. Why the hesitance? Because they also understand that a direct attack on President Obama could hurt them in two ways: They could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from Republicans. Even among African-American commentators, columnists and radio and TV show hosts, if you are too harsh on President Obama, the backlash has been swift and vicious. The organizations know this, and trust me, the White House knows this, and has used it to its advantage. That's why I call it the Obama-Black-Two-Step. I've been told countless times by folks on both sides that Obama can't be seen as favoring African-Americans over others, and his White House has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race. As a result, black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues, unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions. Instead, they quietly fume, mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones. Yet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for. I've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of Democrats to hold on to the House and Senate. The nomination of Kagan has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship, because this is the second time in a year that President Obama has made a Supreme Court appointment and his administration didn't seriously consider an African-American woman for the job. The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups. Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days. What's the big deal about including a black woman? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it's vital for Obama to appeal to them. When Obama was behind Sen. Hillary Clinton in the polls, it was because black women hadn't embraced him yet. When they did, the race changed. The uneasiness with Kagan's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at Harvard Law School, which was followed by the White House pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the Harvard faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions. They were quick to blast out blogs, columns and articles written by African-Americans at Harvard to make clear Kagan is a major advocate of diversity. When a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the White House on Tuesday with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, I was told ""more listening than talking"" was done by the administration. Civil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process, and were expected to rubber stamp the choice. When Kagan's nomination was unveiled Monday, the only prominent African-Americans in attendance were Charles Ogletree, a Harvard professor who taught both Obamas, and Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. That's a stark contrast to Sotomayor's unveiling, when a number of civil rights leaders were there to back her bid. That's why if you look at the public statements released this week by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Urban League and others, they are more neutral on Kagan's appointment, saying they look forward to hearing more about her views on a variety of issues as the nomination plays out. Folks, that's lukewarm at best. I've heard the previous complaints that congressional and civil rights leaders have been ignored by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, with one saying he has never attended a meeting with them (""Even Bush sent Andy Card to meet with us,"" one leader told me). And that extends to others surrounding the president in various parts of the White House. ""These problems are valid and BIG, and we cannot let them off the hook,"" I was told by one frustrated organizational head. Yet this time is different. White House officials would quickly suggest that they are on excellent terms with the Rev. Al Sharpton, but this goes beyond him. The Rev. Jesse Jackson is clearly on the outs with this administration, as seen in his banishment from the West Wing. But this contentious relationship is with civil rights, religious, economic and social justice officials. And it's getting worse. One civil rights leader opined that President Obama is ""losing his emotional connection with black leadership and black voters."" This has huge ramifications for the president and his agenda, because Democrats are facing a major battle to hold on to the House and Senate in November. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released Thursday shows that voters are split over who should control Congress -- Democrats and the GOP both got 44 percent. But of those most interested in the midterm elections, Republicans garnered 56 percent to 36 percent for Democrats. Yet according to a study released in April by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on African-Americans, upwards of 80 percent of black voters say they are very likely to vote in November. The group surveyed 500 African-Americans in Missouri, Indiana, Arkansas and South Carolina. What helped catapult President Obama into the White House was a high black turnout, especially in the South, and he garnered 95 percent of the black vote. A drop of 10 to 15 percent by black voters for Democrats in November would be catastrophic. As the Kagan nomination goes forward, White House officials have told me they expect no problems from civil rights groups. That may be the case. But the distance is growing between this president and what many figured are his natural allies. In a year when you have energized your enemies, the last thing you need is to push away your friends. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Martin: Twice Obama hasn't seriously considered an African-American woman for high court .

"(CNN) -- Tar balls found on Florida Keys beaches Monday and Tuesday are not from a massive oil spill off the coast of Louisiana, the Coast Guard said Wednesday. ""A sampling of tar balls discovered on beaches at Fort Zachary State Park, Fla., Smathers Beach in Key West, Big Pine Key, Fla., and Loggerhead Key in the Dry Tortugas National Park, Fla., were flown by a Coast Guard HU-25 Falcon jet based in Miami, Fla., to New London, Conn., Tuesday for testing and analysis,"" a Coast Guard statement said. ""The results of those tests conclusively show that the tar balls collected from Florida Keys beaches do not match the type of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,"" the statement said. ""The source of the tar balls remains unknown at this time."" However, ""the conclusion that these tar balls are not from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident in no way diminishes the need to continue to aggressively identify and clean up tar ball-contaminated areas in the Florida Keys,"" said Coast Guard Capt. Pat DeQuattro, commanding officer of Sector Key West. DeQuattro authorized the use of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund on Tuesday to begin cleanups of any oil pollution on Florida Keys shores and established a unified command made up of members of the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of the Interior, and state and local officials to manage the tar ball response, the Coast Guard said. The tar balls nevertheless have raised fears that oil from the Gulf spill is headed to the coastlines of Florida and beyond. Researchers and federal officials seem to agree that a plume of oil is being dragged into the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current. The current flows through the Yucatan Channel between Cuba and Mexico, and then northward, where it loops just south of the Florida Keys and travels to the west side of the western Bahamas, according to meteorologists. The European Space Agency issued a statement Wednesday saying satellite images show the oil is in the Loop Current. ""With these images from space, we have visible proof that at least oil from the surface of the water has reached the current,"" Bertrand Chapron of Ifremer, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, said in the statement. A new tracking forecast prepared by four experts relying on five computer models shows that part of the oil may reach the Keys in five to six days, and Miami, Florida, five days after that, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said in a statement Tuesday. ""While I always hope for the best, this is looking like really out-of-control bad,"" Nelson said. The forecast cited by Nelson assumes the Loop Current's persistence and does not take into account dispersion and evaporation from the oil spill, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. It remains to be seen how much oil has entered the current. In addition, he said, ""the Loop Current is much warmer than surrounding water, which would cause oil to evaporate at a greater rate than it is evaporating near the source of the spill."" Also Tuesday, NOAA shut down fishing in a larger part of the Gulf over which the federal government has jurisdiction: a total of 45,728 square miles, which is 19 percent of the Gulf, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said. An undersea oil well has been gushing an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day (210,000 gallons) into the Gulf since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Some estimates have put the amount of oil spewing from the well far higher. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the explosion and sinking, and the cause has not been determined. Samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface. But federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed. Some of the oil has washed ashore on the Louisiana coast. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday that the slick was 50 miles off the Mississippi coast. Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters said Tuesday that based on satellite imagery, ""the oil is definitely in the Loop Current. ... The only question is how much oil made it in."" Others, including Lubchenco, said the oil was poised to enter the current Tuesday but had not yet done so. Once it does, scientists say it could reach Florida in as little as four and as many as 10 days. Once in the Florida Straits -- waters between Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas -- onshore winds would be required to push the oil onto shore, along with oil getting into an eddy on the edge of the current, Lubchenco said. The oil might not actually make it to Florida, depending on current patterns, Masters said. ""The currents right now in the Gulf of Mexico are changing rapidly, day by day. It's kind of an unstable situation."" Chanmin Hu, associate professor of optical oceanography at the University of Miami, said scientists ""do not have a very reliable, sophisticated 3-D model to capture what's going on on the ocean bottom."" Most efforts have been concentrated on the surface of the water, he said, and different depths have not been observed. Hu said he and other researchers are headed to the spot where the oil meets the Loop Current and will collect samples and measure water properties on Wednesday. According to the NOAA website, tar balls are remnants of oil spills. When crude oil floats on the surface of the water, it is torn into smaller patches covering a wider area by winds and waves. The oil undergoes a process called ""weathering."" The lighter components of the oil evaporate, and heavier components are left behind. Some crude oils mix with water to form ""an emulsion that often looks like chocolate pudding"" that is thicker and stickier than the initial oil, NOAA said. ""Winds and waves continue to stretch and tear the oil patches into smaller pieces, or tar balls."" The tar balls can travel hundreds of miles, according to the website.","Coast Guard tested tar balls from Keys, Dry Tortugas; source is unknown, it says .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan on Thursday blocked access to YouTube -- a day after it shut down the social networking site Facebook -- in response to an online group calling on people to draw the Prophet Mohammed. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority ordered operators to shut down YouTube ""in view of growing sacrilegious contents on it,"" officials said in a statement. PTA said Thursday it reached its decision after all ""possible avenues were used within its jurisdiction, including using regular channels available on the Facebook and YouTube to launch protest, to avoid appearances of derogatory material available on their websites."" Facebook was blocked a day before ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day,"" which was scheduled by several Facebook groups dedicated to the idea. The largest of the groups was unavailable for several hours Wednesday and Thursday. Facebook said ""a small technical issue prevented some users from accessing this page and others for a very short period of time,"" and that Facebook had corrected the problem as quickly as possible once they became aware of it. ""While it may be considered objectionable to some, the Facebook Pages and Groups in question do not violate our policies,"" Facebook global communications director Debbie Frost said. The page was online as of Thursday morning Eastern time. Frost said Facebook was ""very disappointed"" to be blocked in Pakistan. ""We are analyzing the situation and the legal considerations, and will take appropriate action, which may include making this content inaccessible to users in Pakistan,"" she said. Khoram Ali Mehran of Pakistan's telecommunication authority said the block ""is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook."" ""We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it, then that's what we will do,"" he said. The telecommunication authority has not received any complaints from Internet users about the blocking of Facebook, he said. Devout Muslims consider it offensive to depict Mohammed. There were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2005, and at least two European cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the Muslim prophet. Mimi Sulpovar, who started one of the Facebook groups, said she read about the idea on a blog after Comedy Central bleeped out part of an episode of ""South Park"" that mentioned the prophet. ""This is meant to be in protest,"" she said. ""This is something I have felt strongly about for a long time: Bullying by certain Muslim groups will not be tolerated in a free country,"" said Sulpovar, who is American. But Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the idea behind the group was offensive. ""Islam discourages any visual representations of the prophets of God -- Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship,"" he said. ""The majority of Muslims worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of God,"" he added. The idea of ""Draw Mohammed Day"" originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea, Sulpovar and Hooper said. ""The whole campaign has been taken up by Muslim-bashers and Islamophobes,"" Hooper said. But Sulpovar denied being anti-Muslim. ""This extends beyond being able to draw Mohammed,"" she said. ""If it's offensive to you, that's fine, but I don't feel it's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation. ""This is nothing to do with hate or bigotry,"" she said. ""Nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals."" Sulpovar said she is not a Muslim but added that she had received ""hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me."" One group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised. ""This is a hot-topic debate, but so is abortion, illegal immigrants, gay marriage and politics. If we allow even a small compromise for one group, then the free speech on topics like abortion, illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate,"" Autumn Meadows said on CNN's iReport. ""Hate speech is wanting a group eradicated, physically harmed or dead. I don't think drawing Mohammed falls under that category,"" she said. ""Islam is not above criticism or cartoons. I believe in equality, and censoring Mohammed while we can draw every other figure in the world does not equal equality,"" she concluded. Sulpovar said Pakistan's decision to block Facebook was ""ridiculous."" Sulpovar's group had attracted more than 9,000 fans as of Thursday morning. The page which disappeared briefly had more than 80,000 fans. Groups opposing the idea had about 68,000 fans as of Wednesday. Facebook is investigating the block, said Frost, the communications director. ""We want Facebook to be a place where people can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights and feelings of others,"" she told CNN. ""We sometimes find people discussing and posting about topics that others may find controversial, inaccurate, or offensive. When these feelings, or any content reported to us becomes an attack on anyone, including Muslim people, it will be removed and further action may be taken against the person responsible,"" she said.","Pakistan blocks access to YouTube, a day after imposing Facebook ban .

"(Gannett) -- With more than a million units sold in its first month, there's no question Apple's much-hyped iPad is here to stay. But is this 9.7-inch touch-screen tablet as ideal for playing games as it is for reading electronic books, surfing the web, watching video or typing out homework? Absolutely. Spend just five minutes with your fingers on a high-definition iPad game and you'll know why it's a winner. And hey, a 12-hour battery for gamers on the go doesn't hurt either. Keep in mind the iPad will also work with most of the games already available for theiPhone and iPod Touch. Whether you already own an iPad or plan on buying one, the following are four examples of extraordinarygame applications available for purchase at the App Store (itunes.com). Note: Most iPad games are not rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), but please see our recommended age for each title below. Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front HD (Gameloft; $7.99; for teens; 2.5 stars out of 4) The celebrated World War II action series has made its iPad debut, allowing you to battle against computer-controlled enemies in the solo story mode or online with up to five friends on a handful of multiplayer maps. Use your fingers to move your squad throughout the war-torn environments (including hot spots in North Africa, Normandy, Italy, Germany and the Pacific), pick the best places to duck for cover and use a number of weapons, including sniper rifles, machine guns, bazookas and flame throwers. You can also hop into a vehicle, such as a tank or jeep, to press your way across enemy lines. Scrabble ($9.99; Electronic Arts; for everyone; 3 stars out of 4) This high-tech twist on the classic crossword board game can be played in one of four ways: against the game's artificial intelligence; versus a friend beside you in a Pass n' Play mode; over Wi-Fi (including social networking support, such as Facebook integration); or in a new Party Play mode, in which up to four players can manage their tiles on an iPhone or iPod Touch and then wirelessly play their words on the nearby iPad game board. The goal of Scrabble, of course, is to collect as many points as possible by spelling out words from letter tiles in your hand, each of which is worth a certain number of points. The player with the highest number of points at the end of the game wins. The only downside? The relatively steep cost of $10 for the app. Pinball HD (GameProm; $2.99; for everyone; 3 stars out of 4) One of the most popular apps on the iPad is a nod to the ol' silver ball. ""Pinball HD,"" as you'd expect, is a high-definition collection of pinball games for the iPad.

See the entire table in the landscape mode (holding the iPad horizontally) or by toggling between a close-up ""flying table"" view and full table view when the iPad is held vertically (slide both your thumbs up or down the screen to toggle the camera view). With its ball physics, built-in help and a local and global high-score board, ""Pinball HD"" is a great pick for players of all ages. Angry Birds HD (Chillingo; $4.99; for everyone; 3.5 stars out of 4) One of the most popular iPhone games is now available in high-definition for the iPad, and with a few extra feathery features, too.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's capital awoke to increasing desperation Thursday morning, a day and a half after a devastating earthquake, with covered bodies piling up along streets and modern aspects of life, such as electricity, mostly missing. The streets of Port-au-Prince resembled grainy black-and-white newsreels from World War II that showed the rubble of bombed-out houses in Berlin and London. The devastation was wide and often horrific. A one-hour drive from the airport to a walled-in hotel where the CNN contingent is staying revealed the widespread destruction from Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake. Flattened and severely damaged houses were found on every block, and the streets were choked with pedestrians and residents. They set up overnight camps and slept by the thousands in dark and crowded parks and on sidewalks, for fear of being inside if another powerful quake hit. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the capital. Sporadic gunfire was heard Wednesday night outside the hotel where CNN is lodged. Sirens could be heard at times, but the predominant sounds in the pre-dawn darkness were the shouts and screams from the thousands of people who spent the night in a dark park across the street. A rooster's crowing could sometimes be heard above the din. After electricity in the hotel was shut off at 1 a.m., CNN technicians worked on satellite equipment by flashlight. The hotel resembles a compound, with razor wire topping eight-foot walls and a gated parking lot, guarded by a man wielding an old shotgun. And although the hotel's residents seemed safe, and street violence had not been seen, there was a feeling of apprehension. As dawn broke, residents wandered slowly through the streets, their destination unknown in a city with seemingly nowhere to go. Still, there were glimmers of hope that the situation was inching toward improvement. The airport, damaged by the quake, began to come back to life Wednesday. The Aeroport International Toussaint Louverture had been closed since the quake struck. But by Wednesday afternoon, the first small-plane commercial flights started to arrive. The airport picked up energy and vitality as planes carrying supplies and ferrying search-and-rescue squads began filling the tarmac. Francklin Pierre, manager for Haiti's Copa Airlines, was in his airport office on Tuesday, sending an e-mail to a friend in Trinidad and Tobago, when he felt the tremor just before 5 p.m. He stood up and stumbled out of his office but could not go far because the building was shaking so hard. ""It was an eternity for me,"" he said. ""That building was shaking like a paper."" His mother and daughter survived, Pierre said, but his father is missing. ""We are all still looking for my father,"" he said. ""We can't reach him. We don't know where he is."" Lionel Isaac, director of the airport authority, said engineers will examine the structural damage Thursday to see if the terminal can be opened again. The runway and the electricity are sound, he said. If the terminal cannot be opened any time soon, Isaac said, an American Airlines cargo building may be used as temporary terminal. He hopes to have 30-seat commercial airplanes flying into the airport within the next few days. Large military cargo aircraft were landing routinely and often Wednesday afternoon. Several U.S. Coast Guard and Air Force planes stood on the tarmac, their engines running the whole time. One took on a load of passengers and left. International help also started to arrive. Thirty-five members of the Icelandic Search and Rescue Team arrived aboard a large jet. ""They will stay here for as long as it takes,"" said Thorbjorn Johnsson, a counselor from the Icelandic Foreign Ministry who accompanied the team. ""We offered to help and Haiti accepted."" A Canadian military squad also arrived to drop off supplies and a reconnaissance squad, in preparation for a disaster response team scheduled to arrive Thursday aboard a C-17 cargo plane with two helicopters on board. The Canadian crew planned to leave Wednesday night to make room for other planes on the crowded tarmac. ""Once I've dropped that off, I'm just taking up room,"" said Capt. Wayne Freeland, the plane's pilot. ""I've got to make room for everyone else. I'm just a bus driver, my friend."" American Airlines, which has been flying into Port-Au-Prince for 40 years, has brought in 30,000 pounds of water and food and plans to bring in more Thursday, said Art Torno, the airline's managing director for the Caribbean. As the sun climbed into the sky Thursday, the din from the park across the street from the hotel quieted, replaced by an occasional car horn and the chattering of residents speaking their rapid-fire French patois. A small crowd of young men gathered at a concrete wall that had toppled at a home next to the hotel. Stooped over, they busted the concrete blocks into smaller chunks, their purpose in doing so not readily apparent.","Bodies pile up in streets; residents wander, apparently aimlessly, in rubble .

"New York (CNN) -- The federal government moved Thursday to seize assets belonging to the Alavi Foundation and the Assa Corp., including a Manhattan skyscraper and four mosques, citing alleged links to the Iranian government. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced Thursday's filing of an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of the Alavi Foundation's interest in the 36-story office tower located on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The tower is owned by 650 Fifth Avenue Company, a partnership between the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp., the Justice Department said. The amended complaint alleges that the Alavi Foundation provided services to the Iranian government and transferred money from 650 Fifth Avenue Company to Bank Melli, Iran's largest state-owned financial entity. U.S. and European Union officials last year designated Bank Melli as a proliferator for supporting Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force, considered terrorist groups by the United States. Bank Melli issued a statement last year denying involvement in any deceptive banking practices. Thursday's amended complaint seeks forfeiture of all assets of the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp., including bank accounts owned by 650 Fifth Avenue Company, the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp.; and properties owned by the foundation in New York, Maryland, Virginia, Texas and California. It alleges that the properties were ""involved in and [were] the proceeds of money laundering offenses,"" and that the owners violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, executive orders and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations. ""As today's complaint alleges in great detail, the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran,"" Bharara said. ""For two decades, the Alavi Foundation's affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials, including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations, in violation of a series of American laws. The Alavi Foundation's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice, and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing."" John Winter, a New York lawyer representing the Alavi Foundation, said his client would challenge the complaint. ""We're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It may take some time, but at the end of this litigation, we're of the mind that we're going to prevail here."" The buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual. ""There are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants,"" said Yusill Scribner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in a written statement. ""The tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today's filing."" According to the complaint, the New York tower was built in the 1970s by a nonprofit organization operated by the Shah of Iran to pursue the country's charitable interests in the United States. Bank Melli financed its construction in prime real estate near Rockefeller Center. In 1979, after the Iranian revolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran established the Bonyad Mostazafan of New York, since renamed the Alavi Foundation, to take possession of and manage property it had expropriated from the former government, including the Fifth Avenue building. Calls to the Iranian Mission were not immediately returned. The mosques are in New York, Maryland, California and Texas. At the Islamic Institute of New York in Queens, two worshipers said they found out about the move Thursday as they arrived for evening prayers. The front page of the court document stating the terms of the case was tacked to the front door accompanied by a letter from the U.S. Attorney's office to the Mostazafan Foundation. A senior Justice Department official, trying to blunt any criticism from Muslim groups, told reporters that the government is moving against the Iranian landlords of the buildings, not targeting or ""seizing mosques"" as religious-oriented facilities. The mosques just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question, the official said. But, in a statement, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called the move unprecedented and said it may have First Amendment implications. ""Whatever the details of the government's case against the owners of the mosques, as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of American houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide,"" said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper. He said the move comes at a bad time, given the community's fear of a backlash resulting from a Muslim psychiatrist being charged in the deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood in Texas. Relations between Iran and much of the international community have been tense in recent years over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran states that it wants to develop its nuclear program solely for peaceful purposes; the United States and a number of other countries have said they suspect the oil-rich nation is pursuing a nuclear bomb. In another U.S.-Iran development, President Obama said Thursday in a letter to Congress that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in 1979 during the Iranian revolution has not ended. ""Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is still under way,"" Obama wrote in an official ""notice of continuation"" required to extend the emergency status with Iran beyond the anniversary date of November 14. ""For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, with respect to Iran, beyond November 14, 2009.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Firebombed. Cyberattacked. Attacked by a shouting mob. That's what happened to Lars Vilks in the week ending May 16. And if you think: ""Well thank goodness my week was a lot quieter,"" think again. The attacks on Vilks were an attack on you too. Lars Vilks is a Swedish cartoonist. In the summer of 2007, he was invited to submit three drawings to an exhibition sponsored by the town of Tallerud. The exhibition's theme: ""the dog in art."" Vilks produced three pencil sketches of street dogs with human faces, the face (Vilks said) of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Even if you don't know the rest of the story, you can easily imagine. In March, police in Ireland arrested seven people on charges of conspiring to murder Vilks. The same day, U.S. law enforcement announced the indictment of an American woman who had attempted to recruit assassins to kill Vilks. Yet Vilks has refused to be intimidated. On Tuesday of this week, Vilks appeared at the University of Uppsalla to lecture on his art and ideas. Two-hundred-fifty people passed through metal detectors to hear him speak. They never got the chance. Vilks opened his talk with a provocative short video that included an image of two nearly naked Iranian gay men wearing masks of Muhammad. At that cue, about 20 rowdies in the crowd shouted, ""Stop the film! Stop the film!"" The rowdies rushed toward the stage. One of them apparently struck Vilks. Police sought to restrain them. After eight or so minutes of chanting, yelling and fist-pumping by the rowdies, the university suspended the performance. You can watch the incident here in a 10-minute YouTube clip. The blogger who writes under the pseudonym Allahpundit directs attention toward two aspects of the confrontation that might be overlooked in the excitement: the ineffectiveness of the police and the passivity of a crowd of spectators who outnumber the protesters by at least 10 to 1. Daily life in Sweden and other European countries is increasingly governed by an unwritten set of rules very different from the country's formal law. The formal law forbids assault and upholds free speech rights. The actual rules of the game, however, concede that certain assaults and certain violations of free speech rights may proceed with impunity. Police arrested two men for disrupting the Vilks event; both were released without charge. Impunity invites further attack. In the aftermath of the Uppsalla University incident, Vilks' website was hacked and firebombs were planted in his house. (Two men have been arrested in connection with the firebombing.) The authorities look the other way in hope of obtaining social peace. This policy does not work, and for two reasons: . First, the policy of impunity emboldens aggressive minorities. Instead of accepting that they must live and let live, these groups get the message they can dominate others by the threat of force. But second, the policy of impunity backfires. While the authorities want quiet, ornery individuals like Lars Vilks are delighted to bust taboos and foment the very confrontations the authorities wish to avoid. Vilks is just one of a multiplying band of deliberate provocateurs who have appeared across Europe over the past five years. Their work may not have much artistic merit, but the issue here is not art but courage. And there will always be enough courageous people to complicate badly the lives of uncourageous authorities. The irony is that these uncourageous authorities would gain much more quiet if they upheld their formal rules. When the rules are clear and enforced, almost everybody will conform to them. Expel one student for disrupting a campus event, and you are unlikely to have to expel a second. But when the authorities declare a ""moral holiday"" (to update an old phrase from the U.S. urban riots of the 1960s), otherwise law-abiding people seize the opportunity. They commit acts of intimidation and violence they would never have dared if law-breaking had been met by immediate sanction and certain punishment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says university attack on cartoonist Lars Vilks should worry everyone .

"New York (CNN) -- The man accused of attempting to set off a car bomb in Times Square considered other targets in and around New York before the failed attack, an investigator said. Faisal Shahzad, 30, pondered attacks on Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Terminal, the World Financial Center and Connecticut helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky, going so far as to case some of the targets, a senior counterterrorism official with oversight of the investigation said Tuesday. Dressed in a gray sweatsuit, free of handcuffs, Shahzad appeared before a federal magistrate on Tuesday afternoon to hear the charges against him. As he walked into courtroom, Shahzad gave a slight smile to his public defender, Julia Gatto. At the end of the hearing, Gatto requested that Shahzad be served halal food -- prepared according to Islamic dietary laws -- while jailed. Gatto did not object to the government's request that he remain in federal custody. He did not enter a plea, and Magistrate Judge James Francis set his next hearing for June 1. Shahzad faces five counts in connection with the attempted bombing in Times Square on May 1. He could face life in prison if convicted. The Pakistani-born naturalized U.S. citizen has been in federal custody since his arrest two days after the bomb attempt. During that time, he ""has provided valuable intelligence from which further investigative action has been taken,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. After 15 days of questioning, Shahzad invoked his right to an attorney at Tuesday's hearing, a federal law enforcement official said. According to court documents, Shahzad has admitted to law enforcement that he attempted to detonate the bomb and that he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan region of Pakistan. Attorney General Eric Holder has said Shahzad was working with the Pakistani Taliban. E-mails obtained by CNN indicate he was looking for a way to strike back against ""foreign infidel forces"" he believed were oppressing the Muslim world. In one, sent to a large group of recipients in February 2006, Shahzad wrote, ""Everyone knows how the Muslim country bows down to pressure from the west. Everyone knows the kind of humiliation we are faced with around the globe."" At the time, he had been in the United States for about six years, had earned his MBA and was working as a financial analyst in Connecticut. CIA Director Leon Panetta and National Security Adviser James Jones are traveling to Pakistan to meet with officials there about the status of the Times Square investigation, a U.S. official said Tuesday. They also plan to discuss efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks in their meetings there, the official added. The U.S. government wants to see continued Pakistani cooperation in determining what role the Pakistani Taliban may have played in assisting Shahzad. Washington also wants an aggressive push by Pakistani authorities to take action against al Qaeda-linked groups in the largely ungoverned tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan.

""And just to be clear, my family comes from many different backgrounds and religions."" The newest Miss USA, crowned last weekend, was interviewed Wednesday for HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show."" Fakih downplayed the significance of photographs that emerged online this week showing her dancing against a stripper's pole.

"New York (CNN)  -- Spider-Man's alter ego cannot escape the harsh realities of the current economic times and will lose his job in an issue of the Amazing Spider-Man hitting stores this week. Peter Parker, official photographer of the mayor by day and New York City crime fighter by night, is going to face new challenges, including unemployment. ""He's going to struggle with unemployment and trying to save the city while he can barely afford to keep a roof over his head,"" said Steve Wacker, Marvel Comics senior editor. Parker has always been a grounded character with real-world problems, Wacker said. His aunt is frequently sick, he has girlfriend troubles, and he sometimes struggles to find work. In addition, Spider-Man story lines are often set against a backdrop of current events. In the near future, Parker will have to juggle paying bills and buying ""web-fluid"" and other materials to fix his superhero costume in addition to keeping his dual identities under wraps. Parker's work history includes photographer, assistant high school coach, science teacher and scientific researcher, according to his biography on the Marvel Web site. His education includes a college degree in biophysics and some postgraduate work in biochemistry. It was at a science exhibit he attended as a teenager that he was bitten by a radioactive spider and acquired the creature's strength, agility and weaving ability, says Marvel Comics. And although Parker has skills few other others can claim, he probably won't list these on his resume: superhuman strength, ability to cling to most surfaces, fast traveling ability aided by web-slinging and spider-sense danger avoidance system. The Amazing Spider-Man comic was first published in 1963.","Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker, will lose his job this week .

"(CNN) -- When 3-year-old Rowan Isaacson darted away from his father and dived into a herd of grazing horses, it easily could have been the end of the small autistic boy. He was babbling under the hooves of a boss mare. Rupert Isaacson says he noticed immediate improvement in his son's language skills when he started riding. ""I thought he was going to get trampled,"" recalled Rupert Isaacson, Rowan's father. But the horse, Betsy, dipped her head and chewed with her mouth in submission. Isaacson, who had trained horses for a living, had never seen it happen so spontaneously. Rowan had seemingly made a connection. The Austin, Texas, family had been struggling with Rowan. His wild tantrums were nearly driving Isaacson and his wife, Kristin Neff, to divorce. All the while, little Rowan was becoming unreachable. ""He would just stare off into space,"" Isaacson said. ""I was worried it was going to get progressively worse and that eventually, he might float away from us entirely. Luckily, right about that time is when he met Betsy."" Isaacson began riding Betsy, a neighbor's horse, with Rowan. He says he noticed immediate improvement in his son's language skills.  Watch Rowan and Betsy » . ""He would start to answer. He would start to talk. We would do song games up there on the saddle. I would take books up there in the saddle,"" Isaacson said. Autism specialists say that horse riding can be effective in gaining access to autistic children. Experts make a distinction between the kind of recreational therapeutic riding Isaacson was using with Rowan and hippotherapy, which is a medical treatment that uses horses and is supervised by a licensed speech-language pathologist. ""People perceive it's the interaction with the horse that's making the change. However, the movement of the horse is extremely powerful, and it's that movement that's having neurological impact on the autistic child,"" said Ruth Dismuke-Blakely, a speech-language pathologist and hippotherapy clinical specialist in Edgewood, New Mexico. According to preliminary analysis of an ongoing study by Dismuke-Blakely, hippotherapy has been shown to increase verbal communication skills in some autistic children in as little as 18 to 25 minutes of riding once a week for eight weeks. ""We see their arousal and affect change. They become more responsive to cues. If they are at a point where they are using verbal cues, you get more words,"" Dismuke-Blakely said. ""It's almost like it opens them up. It gives us access."" She cautions that a horse's movements can be powerful. For some autistic children, riding too long can overstimulate their nervous system, leading to more erratic behavior. On Betsy, Rowan was at ease. After about three weeks, Isaacson says, Rowan's improved behavior was translating into the home and outside world as well. But not consistently. In late 2004, Isaacson, a human rights activist, brought a delegation of African bushmen from Botswana to the United Nations. Among the men were traditional healers, who offered to work with Rowan. Isaacson says he was skeptical, but he had experience with the bushmen and allowed the healers to lay their hands on his son. ""I was kind of flabbergasted at Rowan's response. For about four days while they were with him, he started to lose some of his symptoms. He started to point, which was a milestone he hadn't achieved,"" Isaacson said. When the tribal healers left, Rowan regressed. Isaacson says he couldn't help but wonder what would happen if he were to give Rowan a longer exposure to the two things that he seemed to have responded well to: horses and shamans. ""I know it sounds completely crazy,"" he said. ""I just had a gut feeling."" Isaacson took his wife and son to Mongolia. ""It's the oldest horse culture on the planet. Everyone still gets around on a horse there -- so a nomadic culture. The word 'shaman' comes from there,"" Isaacson said, explaining his decision. ""I just thought, 'Well, what if we went there and rode across the steppe and visited traditional healers? You know, what might happen for Rowan? Might there be some positive outcomes?' "" Trekking across the Mongolian prairie on horseback, Isaacson says, Rowan's behavior was changed dramatically. ""Rowan was not cured of autism out there,"" Isaacson stressed. ""The word 'cure' is not in my vocabulary for this. Rowan came back without three key dysfunctions that he had. He went out to Mongolia incontinent and still suffering from these neurological firestorms -- so tantruming all the time and cut off from his peers, unable to make friends -- and he came back with those three dysfunctions having gone."" Isaacson credits Rowan's improvement to horses and time in nature -- and to shamanic healing, which he says he simply can't explain rationally. Isaacson has written a book, ""The Horse Boy,"" about Rowan's autism. Rowan, now 7, rides Betsy by himself. His parents never abandoned more orthodox treatments for his autism, and Rowan's applied behavioral analysis therapist has him studying math and English at the third-grade level -- a full year ahead of some of his peers. ""He's just becoming a very functional autistic person,"" Isaacson said. As far as the Isaacson family's journey took them, it is the same hard slog facing millions of families gripped by autism. ""A lot of the parents go to the ends of the Earth in their own living rooms every day,"" Isaacson said. ""I mean, we had more stressful car rides to the grocery store than any of the stresses and challenges of the trip to Mongolia."" You don't have to get on a horse -- or plane to Siberia -- for relief. For autism families, Isaacson encourages parents to simply follow their instincts and listen to what their child shows them. ""In our case, it was horses in Mongolia and these shamans,"" Isaacson said. ""It could just as easily have been bicycles and, you know, steam trains. And if it had been, we'd have done a steam train journey. We'd have done whatever Rowan seemed to be showing us he wanted to do, because that was where he was intrinsically motivated.""","Family travels across Mongolia so autistic son can ride horses, meet shaman .

"(CNN) -- Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO turned top John McCain aide, said she doesn't think Sarah Palin is qualified to run a major corporation. For that matter, Fiorina said, McCain, Obama and Biden aren't capable of that kind of job either. Ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO and McCain adviser Carly Fiorina said   Sarah Palin could not run a major company. The Republican presidential candidate has been trying to portray himself as someone who can fix the country's economic woes. But that is a far different task than running a Fortune 500 corporation, Fiorina told MSNBC Tuesday. Democratic candidate Barack Obama's camp immediately circulated copies of her words -- which didn't exactly paint their candidate in a soft light, either.

"(CNN) -- A court hearing is scheduled Thursday in the case of a northern California couple accused of abducting Jaycee Dugard and holding her captive for more than 18 years in a ramshackle backyard compound. Phillip Garrido, 58, and his wife, Nancy, 54, are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard, who was 11 when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California. The couple has pleaded not guilty. The hearing, scheduled for 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) at the El Dorado County Superior Court, is a procedural matter about witnesses in the case. Authorities say the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years. She was 29 when she was found in August at the Garridos' home in Antioch about 120 miles from her house. Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard's two daughters. Earlier this month, Judge Douglas Phimister denied a request by the Garridos to be able to see each other while they remain jailed. Instead, the judge ruled, the couple can have one five-minute phone conversation this month and in June. He also said that officials can monitor the calls. The judge did not offer a reason for denying the request. The prosecution had opposed the motion on security grounds. Authorities maintain Dugard does not want to speak to Garrido or his attorneys and have tried to keep her location a secret. In March, Dugard made her first public statement since the arrests of her alleged captors. ""Hi, I'm Jaycee. I want to thank you for your support, and I'm doing well,"" Dugard said in a home video released exclusively to ABC News. ""It's been a long haul,"" said Dugard, ""but I'm getting there."" The video showed Dugard baking cookies with her mother and playing with her dogs. ""We released this video so that you can see that we are happy and well -- when we have more to share, we will,"" Probyn said in the home video. ""As a mother I am pleading for our privacy in this very public story.""","New hearing concerns a witness in the kidnapping case .

"(CNN) -- Over the past month, we've watched from distant shores as Greece has plunged into a debt crisis. Mounting pressure from global financial markets forced Greece to begin a drastic austerity program. With a fiscal deficit of 8.1 percent of GDP and government debt of 115 percent of GDP expected this year, Greece has promised to turn itself around by 2013. To do this, the government has adopted an ambitious fiscal consolidation program that would reduce the annual deficit by 7 percent of GDP this year, 4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund have announced an extraordinary $1 trillion package to support the plan, and the European Central Bank has announced its own extraordinary measures. Are there lessons the United States can or should draw from the Greek situation? First, we are not Greece. The United States is by far the world's largest single economy.  Our economy is competitive, diversified and rich in human capital and natural resources. While the rest of the world is important for our growth, our domestic market is vast, which means that, unlike Greece, we can usually rely on domestic demand to drive the economy. At their best, our financial markets are dynamic, have deep pockets and provide the liquidity for our innovative economy. We issue the world's reserve currency, which minimizes our currency market risk. And unlike Greece, because we have currency flexibility, we can adjust the value of the dollar to improve our underlying economic performance, if necessary. But we are facing very serious fiscal challenges, too -- and for many of the same reasons as Greece. Like Greece, our fiscal path is unsustainable for as far as the eye can see. Our debt has surged far above what we have normally been able to manage. And unless fiscal policy changes, it is projected to continue heading up indefinitely. Our debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to exceed 60 percent this year, well above our average for the past 40 years (around 40 percent) and close to a peacetime high. And it's projected to keep on rising. Like Greece (and all advanced industrial countries), we can expect our fiscal situation to get worse in about 10 years, as the baby boomers' retirement accelerates. In a generation, the debt is expected to be well over 150 percent of GDP. By 2050, it's projected to be over 300 percent and still heading upward.  We cannot sustain this much debt without a crisis. While the United States may have more fiscal running room than Greece, we won't be able to outrun our creditors if they think we can't manage our fiscal affairs. The impasse in Washington is giving rise to jitters that we can't politically solve our problems, no matter how wealthy our economy. And as the past few weeks illustrate, if we lose credibility with creditors, they may downgrade our debt, demand higher interest rates, and in the worst case refuse to hold our debt because of fear of default. Maintaining the confidence of our creditors is critical for the United States: We depend on capital inflows to close our fiscal gap because our savings rate is so low. It is harder to rebuild confidence than to lose it. Finally, as Greece so vividly illustrates, it is better act on your own timetable and according to your own priorities, rather than have actions forced upon you by financial markets. If the United States can make fiscal changes sooner rather than later, once the economy is on a stronger footing, adjustment can be more gradual and less costly. Then our citizens will be able to manage change more easily. What will it take for the United States to get its fiscal house in order?  We need a plan. As we've seen in Athens -- and even on Wall Street over the past week -- uncertainty sows fear, panic and unrest.  But our fiscal future does not have to look like this. There is a way forward. America's first fiscal challenge is political will, not ability to pay. In partnership with the American people, U.S. policymakers need to settle on a reasonable and sensible fiscal recovery plan soon that is credible to both the markets and the ultimate financier: the U.S. taxpayer. It should be multiyear to reassure creditors and taxpayers that we can indeed manage our affairs over time and that it will not force draconian austerity, if done correctly. We need to know where we want to go and how we can get there. A clear road map for fiscal change will allow everyone to plan and manage, in contrast to the cold shower the Greeks are being forced to take. In broad economic terms, the answer is simpler than most people realize. As most experts agree, we need to put the budget on track for stabilizing the debt at no more than 60 percent of GDP when we can realistically manage change. (The 60 percent threshold still has credibility for advanced industrial countries in the global marketplace.) Although our debt is below that now, commitments already in place will put us on a higher path, even before the baby boomers start to retire. But we need to start phasing in policy changes soon to shift to a more sustainable debt path. Much like a household budget, a fiscal recovery package also needs to be fair to succeed. Any plan needs to reflect shared sacrifice. Our fiscal problems are so big, everything has to be on the table. Just cutting spending will savage government and prevent it from delivering the things we all rely upon to live our lives and to make them better. Just raising taxes will take money from the poorest and the middle class and rob the country of needed incentives for the investments that boost higher growth. But within budget limits, we also must make sure that any fiscal package promotes our key values and needs: protecting the weakest among us and raising living standards through increasing human capital (including education), promoting innovation and providing basic infrastructure. Ultimately, getting our fiscal house in order is about shared sacrifice -- and shared hope. Putting a fiscal recovery plan in place will hasten the recovery and make living standards higher than they would otherwise be. We don't have to look like Greece does now.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- When five students at Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill, California, taunted Latino students by wearing T-shirts bearing the American flag on Cinco de Mayo, even though administrators had told students beforehand not to wear flag clothing that day, they caused a ruckus, divided a community and reignited the culture wars. And, it turns out, they were just getting warmed up. The ruckus ensued when Assistant Principal Miguel Rodriguez -- apparently fearing that the boys' fashion choices might provoke a violent response from Latino students who have developed an emotional attachment to the faux holiday as ""their day"" -- told the youths to either turn their T-shirts inside out or go home. The lads chose the latter, and were, for this act of defiance, magically transformed from bratty kids to defenders of individual freedom and innocent victims of the establishment. Why not? Everyone else in society plays the victim. Nothing is ever anyone's fault. Someone else is always to blame. And so why shouldn't these five young men get a chance to portray themselves as an oppressed minority? This part is even more bizarre: Conservatives are defending the rights of the students because the story fits into their paranoid narrative of cultural displacement -- where the Mexican flag is supplanting Old Glory, Spanish is drowning out English, the tortilla has bread on the run, and so on and on. This is outrageous, conservatives say, as they blast school administrators by accusing them of overstepping their bounds. Conservatives take this stance, but have spent the better part of the last three decades asserting -- in legal briefs and oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court -- the power of public school administrators to maintain order and prevent disruptive behavior even at the expense of curtailing students' First Amendment rights. In a classic and clumsy flip-flop, conservatives were against First Amendment rights for public school students on campus before they were in favor of them. You see, conservatives usually don't give a hoot about whether students have the right to express, on school campuses, their opinion about this or that -- especially if doing so threatens to upset the social order. Now, suddenly, because of the Morgan Hill case, they've found religion and they're ready to side with the American Civil Liberties Union in defense of free speech rights for students? Talk about strange bedfellows. I got a chance to see this hypocrisy up close last week when I appeared on CNN to discuss the Morgan Hill story with Kris Kobach, conservative legal analyst and law professor. Kobach defended the right of the five students to defy school administrators in exercise of their First Amendment rights to free expression. He cited case law that is almost as old as I am -- Tinker v Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969). In that case, which involved high school and junior high school students who wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War and were suspended as a result, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and declared that students don't ""shed their constitutional rights to free speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."" But since Tinker, the justices have curtailed First Amendment rights of students, especially when the expression of those rights is disruptive,  in three other cases: Bethel School District v Fraser (1986), where the Supreme Court held that a high school student's speech during an assembly -- filled as it was with sexual innuendo -- was not protected; Hazelwood v Kuhlmeier (1988), where the court held that schools can regulate the content of student newpapers; and Morse v Frederick (2007), where the court held that officials can restrict student speech at a school-supervised event even if it takes place off-campus. Interestingly, in the Morse case, the school administrators were represented by no less prominent a conservative than Kenneth Starr, the former Whitewater Independent Counsel. The truth is that school administrators have a greater ability to restrict the speech of their students than the government does to restrict the speech of the general public.  That's what the Supreme Court has said repeatedly in the last three decades, and that's the way it is. Some of this should sound familiar to conservatives. This has been their argument for years. No matter how they feel about what happened at Live Oak High School on Cinco de Mayo, the least they can do is claim it.  They should be proud to do so. School administrators need the power to keep order and enforce codes of decency. Just look at what just happened in another, much more  offensive case of racial harassment, this one after a high school soccer game in Omaha, Nebraska. Lincoln East High School and South High School were matched up, and Lincoln East won the game 4-2 in overtime to claim the boys state championship. But now several Lincoln East students admit they made and distributed dozens of ""green cards,"" which fans threw onto the field after the game like confetti. Why green cards? Because South's soccer team is mostly Latino. Get it? The students behind this ugly act have been suspended. Glad to hear it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette, Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Students wore U.S. flag T-shirts after school said no flag shirts .
Navarrette: Was a taunt to Latinos; principal asked them to turn shirts inside-out or go home .

"Peekskill, New York (CNN) -- Police in Peekskill are investigating whether four men accused of brutally beating an Ecuadorian man can be charged with a hate crime, officials said. Julio Serrano, 39, remains in critical condition after he was attacked Saturday, police said. Detective Sgt. Raymond Henderlong said police are still gathering information on whether hate was a motive in the attack in the small Hudson River town. ""We are going to exhaust every avenue to see if this was racially motivated,"" Henderlong said. ""We are looking into whether they were targeting him because of his background."" Police said Serrano was walking near his home early Saturday when he was attacked. Surveillance video shows him staggering up a flight of stairs after fleeing his attackers, who follow and eventually ambush him as he seeks refuge in a building. Serrano suffered severe head injuries. Ronnie Juett, 23; Jarron Sligh, 23; and Keith Walker, 18, have been charged with gang assault, police said. Jamar Walker, 19, is awaiting arraignment in Peekskill County Court. According to the 2000 census, Peekskill has a population of about 22,000. Nearly 22 percent is of Hispanic or Latino origin. Peekskill Police Chief Eugene Tumolo said it is possible that Serrano was beaten ""because of the fact he is a Latino male, and a lot of these people are immigrants."" ""Even animals shouldn't be beaten like this. Nothing human, nothing alive should be beaten the way this poor man was. It was an incredibly cowardly and vicious attack,"" he said. In April, jurors convicted a Long Island man of manslaughter as a hate crime in the death of an immigrant from Ecuador. Jeffrey Conroy was tried in the death of Marcelo Lucero, 37, who was fatally stabbed in the chest on November 8, 2008, in Patchogue. Conroy was also found guilty of gang assault and conspiracy as well as of assaulting three other Latino men on Long Island. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center said that increasingly virulent hate speech emerging from anti-immigrant groups has a role in recent attacks on immigrants. ""This is yet another example of America's anti-immigrant propaganda to demonize immigrants,"" Potok said. ""We've seen these cases popping up around the nation because of this type of hate speech. Words have consequences,"" he said.","Ecuadorian man beaten Saturday in Peekskill, New York .

"Washington (CNN) -- Politically sensitive issues such as immigration, border security, drug trafficking and trade took center stage in Washington on Wednesday as President Obama welcomed his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, to the White House. Both leaders used the occasion -- the fourth time they have met for bilateral talks -- to take sharp aim at Arizona's new law meant to crack down on illegal immigrants. Calderon characterized the measure as discriminatory; Obama called it a ""misdirected expression of frustration."" The leaders criticized the law while meeting with reporters shortly after Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rolled out the red carpet for Calderon in a formal White House arrival ceremony. U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala joined their husbands for the occasion, which was to be followed by a state dinner Wednesday night. Calderon is to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday. ""Our progress today marks another step forward in a new era of cooperation and partnership between our countries, a partnership based on mutual interests, mutual respect and mutual responsibility,"" Obama said. Calderon said the United States and Mexico now face a series of common challenges, including climate change and organized crime, which is a rising threat to border stability. But what ultimately ""turns us into good neighbors"" is a common belief in ""freedom, justice and democracy,"" he said. Obama ticked through a list of items he said the two leaders had agreed upon during their meeting. On the economy, he said, they had agreed to streamline regulations while strengthening protection of intellectual property. To facilitate trade, they had reaffirmed a ""commitment to a 21st-century border that is modern, secure and efficient."" He also pledged to expand joint initiatives promoting renewable energy and ""smart grid"" technology. Turning to illegal drug and weapons trafficking, Obama noted that his administration is now screening 100 percent of south-bound rail cargo. Moving in the other direction, Mexican authorities in recent years have seized 45,000 weapons that could be traced to the United States. Obama also cited new initiatives to cut U.S. demand for illegal drugs. ""As your partner, we'll give you the support you need to prevail ... against the drug cartels that have unleashed horrific violence in so many communities,"" Obama told Calderon. Drug violence claimed 6,500 lives in Mexico last year. But Calderon said 90 percent of the casualties from the war on drugs are criminals fighting each other, adding that the cartels ""are not winning."" ""The Mexican gangs are passing through a very unstable process ... and fighting each other and that explains most of those casualties,"" Calderon said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" He acknowledged, however, that innocent people have also been killed. Obama also noted Mexico's current seat on the U.N. Security Council, highlighting the two countries' agreement on possible sanctions against Iran to stop Tehran's current nuclear program. The issue of Arizona's new immigration law, however, consumed most of the leaders' time during their meeting with reporters. The measure, which will allow law enforcement officers to ask for proof of legal residency of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction, has drawn widespread criticism in Mexico. Critics contend, among other things, that the law will lead to racial profiling against Hispanic residents. Later Wednesday, Calderon acknowledged that immigration is the biggest challenge Mexico is facing with the United States. ""It is provoking a lot of tensions between our people,"" Calderon said. ""This is a phenomenon that we need to solve. ... And the best way to solve that is creating new jobs in Mexico and that is exactly what we are trying to do."" Calderon said Mexico is working to change its own immigration policies to address criticisms from officials in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico who claim they're only trying to do in their states what Mexico is doing in the southern part of its country. Calderon said that illegal immigration has not been a crime in Mexico since last year. ""In the past, Mexican authorities were in an unfortunate way in the treatment (of immigrants),"" he said. ""We changed already the law and that is different today. We are trying to write a new story."" Regarding Arizona's tough new immigration law, Calderon said the potential for racial profiling with the statute ""is against any sense of human rights."" Obama said he thinks the Arizona law ""has the potential of being applied in a discriminatory fashion. ... A fair reading of the language of the statute indicates that it gives the possibility of individuals who are deemed suspicious of being illegal immigrants from being harassed or arrested. ""The judgments that are going to be made in applying this law are troublesome,"" he noted. Obama noted that he has directed the Justice Department ""to look very carefully at the language of this law to see whether it comports both with our core values and existing legal standards, as well as the fact that the federal government is ultimately the one charged with immigration policy."" Obama said he'll make some decisions about how to address the law after he gets a final report from the Justice officials. A broad coalition of civil rights groups filed a class-action lawsuit against the measure Monday, arguing that it violates the U.S. Constitution's equal protection and free speech guarantees, among other things. In Arizona, the city councils of Tucson and Flagstaff have also decided to challenge the law in court. A majority of Americans, however, appears to back to the measure. Fifty-nine percent of adults nationwide supported the law in a May 6-9 Pew Research Center Poll. Thirty-two percent opposed it. The Arizona law, Obama asserted Wednesday, ""expresses some of the frustrations that the American people have had in not fixing a broken immigration system, and, frankly, the failures of the federal government to get this done. I'm sympathetic to those frustrations."" Obama repeated his call for comprehensive immigration reform but said such a measure can't pass without Republican support. A Mexican official familiar with arrangements for Calderon's visit cautioned that it would be wrong to let the controversy over Arizona's law overwhelm the rest of the visit. ""It will not define the visit or the relationship,"" the Mexican official said. ""The U.S.-Mexican relationship is much more rich and diverse than one issue."" A senior Obama administration official, however, acknowledged that ""this is an issue that has resonated in Mexico (and) is of deep concern to the Mexican government."" This month, Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Arturo Sarukhan, warned of ""a worrying surge"" of anti-immigrant sentiments. He warned that the Arizona law might ""poison the well from which our two nations have found and should continue to find inspiration for a joint future of prosperity, security, tolerance and justice.""

"(Mashable) -- Yesterday, Tweetie 2 for iPhone disappeared from the App Store. Its replacement, simply titled Twitter, is now available. This comes a little more than a month after Twitter acquired Tweetie from its creator, Loren Brichter. In addition to being free, the app now carries the distinction of being ""version 3.0."" If you were expecting a big update and iPad support alongside the new name, brace yourselves; Tweetie -- er -- Twitter has remained relatively unchanged from its prior release. That's not a bad thing; as we reported in our original reviews of Tweetie 2 and Tweetie 2.1, Tweetie is one of the best Twitter experiences for any platform and, in our opinion, was the winning app on the iPhone by a wide margin. That said, check out some of the new features and tweaks that you can find in the newly rebranded app: . • You can use Twitter without an account. Spy on your friends without having to actually use Twitter. • You can sign up for a Twitter account within the app itself, complete with Suggested User List. • The ""More"" tab has been reorganized and popular actions have been moved to the main action bar. • Search results include Top Tweets. In acquiring Tweetie, Twitter raised the ire of its developer community, who worried about what this means for their own applications now and in the future. Twitter has argued that it needs to have an official client to improve basic user experience. Earlier this month, Twitter for Android was released and RIM launched its own Twitter application for the BlackBerry. This means that the three hottest smartphone platforms all have official Twitter clients. If you never used Tweetie, we highly recommend downloading Twitter for iPhone.

"(CNN)  -- Calling law enforcement accounts ""absurd,"" a Michigan attorney sued police Tuesday in the death of 7-year-old girl killed during a raid in Detroit. Attorney Geoffrey Fieger said members of the Detroit Police Special Response Team acted out of line when they conducted a raid on the family home of Aiyana Jones, who was severely burned and then killed by an officer's bullet. She died Sunday. ""This type of activity by a police force is unacceptable in America,"" Fieger said at a news conference in his office. ""What is equally unacceptable is the cover-up that has occurred."" Fieger filed both state and federal lawsuits alleging gross negligence, a violation of civil rights and a conspiracy to cover up the violation of civil rights. Detroit Assistant Police Chief Ralph Godbee has said that preliminary information indicated that officers approached the house with a search warrant for the girl's uncle in connection with the shooting of a high school student Friday. Godbee said the officer's gun discharged accidentally inside the home after an altercation and physical contact with the girl's grandmother, Mertilla Jones. Jones denied such an altercation Tuesday. Fieger said he plans to file another lawsuit for false arrest and accused the police of covering up their own mistakes by blaming the family. Fieger said videotape of the incident shows that the shooting was not accidental. In an interview Monday, he told CNN affiliate WDIV that a crew was filming the raid for the A&E network's show, ""The First 48."" The program documents police investigations in the first 48 hours after a homicide. Tuesday, Fieger recounted the events shown on the video that he said led to the girl's death. At times, he had to pause, his voice drowned out by sobbing family members. Fieger said officers tossed a smoke bomb -- described by police as a ""flash bang device"" to distract occupants -- into the house, severely burning Aiyana, who was on the couch in the front room with her grandmother. She was then struck in the neck by a bullet fired from outside the house, he said. Godbee has said he doesn't know how Fieger saw the video, according to WDIV. ""If Mr. Fieger has access to anything that would be evidence in this case, he should, as an officer of the court, get it immediately to the Michigan State Police, which will be investigating,"" he said in a statement. Fieger said the police and the city owe apologies to the family, especially to Mertilla Jones for trying to blame her for her granddaughter's death. He said officers need to be held to account just as anyone else would. ""The people of the city of Detroit have got to believe the police will protect them, and not kill them,"" Fieger said. ""This is an opportunity to come together, not to tear us apart,"" he said. ""Apologize now and we can start the road to healing.""","NEW: Attorney recounts events leading to girl's death that he said were caught on video .

"(CNN) -- It was the best of times in 2004, when attorney Dave Dineen graduated from Boston University School of Law and landed a job at a top Massachusetts corporate firm, Foley Hoag LLP. Attorney Dave Dineen at his new job at Greater Boston Legal Services. By 2007, the National Association for Law Placement was reporting the most promising year in two decades. Nearly 92 percent of graduating attorneys were employed, and the median starting salary at private practices had increased by $13,000 --to a total of $108,500 a year. But times have changed. In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the legal industry is taking an unprecedented beating from the sputtering economy and housing meltdown. Dineen, 37, lost his job as layoffs and salary freezes have spiked at law firms across the country during the past three months. Rather than just hand out a severance package with the pink slip, Foley Hoag gave Dineen an option. He could work for Greater Boston Legal Services, a legal aid group serving people living in poverty. The firm agreed to pay Dineen about a quarter of his former salary for a year. Dineen, who needed to support his wife and a newborn daughter, accepted. ""This gave me a chance to do something different with my legal career, and help out people who generally don't  have access to public service,"" said Dineen, who now works on foreclosure cases helping victims of predatory lending. Foley Hoag is among many megafirms across the country using the economic slump as an ideal time to lend a hand to cash-strapped public interest and legal aid firms. The massive corporate layoffs and program cuts could redirect thousands of young graduates and experienced attorneys from corporate firms into the public sector, legal experts say. Once insulated, law firms are shedding young and mid-career associates at extraordinary rates. This is especially true at large corporate firms that overestimated their growth and extended too many offers to associates last fall. White & Case LLP, a leading global firm with headquartes in New York, made a second round of cuts last week. In addition to about 70 associates laid off in November, the firm last week let go of another 400 people, including 200 attorneys. Other well-known firms such Heller Ehrman LLP and Thelen Reid & Priest LLP on the West Coast have gone bankrupt in recent months. At least 2,149 attorneys have been laid off in 2009, bringing the total to 3,045 since January of last year, according Lawshucks.com, an industry Web site tracking the slump. Hundreds more associates set to start jobs this fall are bracing themselves for rescinded offers and deferred start dates. Some students are finding their summers wide open as law firms like Luce Forward, based in California, have canceled internship programs. Amid all this dark news, there might be a silver lining. It could transform the legal profession. ""There is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity coming out of a difficult situation,"" said Esther Lardent, president of the Pro Bono Institute in Washington D.C., who began discussions this month with at least 15 corporate firms nationwide about placing unemployed attorneys in public interest firms. The project will get under way in a few months, she said. Other firms have already encouraged attorneys to go into the public sector. Just last week,  one of the largest firms in the country -- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- announced it will pay deferred associates graduating in 2009 a $5,000 monthly stipend for one year if they secure a job in the public interest field. International law giants Latham & Watkins LLP and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP offered incoming associates who defer employement until October 2010 a $75,000 compensation package. While working in public service isn't mandatory for Latham & Watkins associates, the firm said there was a ""sincere hope"" the deferred associates would ""use the intervening period to pursue a community service or other public advocacy projects of their choosing."" Such deferral plans can save the companies about $100,000 per associate, and law experts expect the list of firms enacting deferral programs to grow geometrically as the economy worsens. ""Firms are doing this to be flexible and regulate their labor force because there just isn't as much work anymore,"" said James G. Leipold, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement. Corporate giants are also scrambling to find work for mid-level attorneys in the public sector. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, a major New York-based law firm, introduced a yearlong public service fellowship program this year that would pay current attorneys $60,000 a year to work in areas such as social service, community development or academia. The company hopes the program will alleviate ""significant budgetary constraints."" ""You aren't just throwing somebody out there,"" said American Bar Association President Tommy Wells, who requested funding in President Obama's stimulus package to help pay attorneys to work in the public sector. (The proposal was rejected.) ""You're meeting a real need in these tough times where you have more of a legal need and fewer resources,"" Wells said. Encouraging laid-off and deferred attorneys to go into public service is filling a desperate need at public interest firms. Public interest and legal aid firms serving the underprivileged have long been under-funded and overwhelmed with cases even in a good economy. Tightened state budgets and a decline in donations have further stretched resources for the public interest firms, forcing them to make staff cuts at a time when demand for their services is greater than ever before. At Greater Boston Legal Services, the public interest firm where Dineen arrived in January, the effects of a sick economy are apparent. Robert Sable, the public interest firm's executive director, has already reduced staff. The agency, which handles 15,000 matters a year, expects to make more staff reductions in the coming months because of a $2 million funding shortfall. ""We're burning through our reserves right now, so it's nice to have extra help,"" said Sable, who is talking to another local corporate firm this week about taking in subsidized attorneys. Some attorneys and law students worry that paying corporate attorneys to work in public interest firms may displace those who actually wanted to work in the public sector in the first place. Jocelyn E. Getgen, who works with students at Cornell Law School, said strained legal aid organizations and nonprofits will want to take in the ""free"" labor. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the economic free-fall is changing the ways current attorneys-- and a new generation of young attorneys-- view the field. Traditionally, law students have equated best jobs with highest-paying jobs, career counselors say. Students saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt find themselves pressured to work at large firms that will pay enough to cover the bills, said Tricia McGrath, a director at Lateral Link Group LLC, a job placement agency for lawyers. Many times, going into the public sector isn't even an option, she said. ""Everyone has to rethink all the old models that we believed in, the model where you go to school and then a big firm,"" said McGrath, who graduated from Fordham University School of Law School in 1998, a time when law jobs were abundant. Even students at top law schools are finding that their offers have been rescinded. At Harvard Law School, Mark Weber, assistant dean for career services, said he has been working with a handful of students whose job offers have been deferred. ""It can be a tremendous opportunity for the student to take that year and try something entirely different,"" Weber said. ""Hopefully within a year, the economic picture will do better."" After not receiving a corporate firm job offer in the downtrodden industry, Scott Greenwood, set to graduate this spring from the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law, will instead work for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""I can see what it's like to work for a regulatory agency, and that's a different expertise that attorneys don't always get to have,"" said Greenwood, who will begin working in Washington, D.C., this August. ""I've been thinking about it as a blessing in disguise.""","At least 2,149 attorneys have been laid off in 2009, according to Lawshucks.com .

"Washington (CNN) -- Wider restrictions on fishing in the Gulf of Mexico are raising fresh concerns in an industry already hard-hit by the massive BP oil spill. With thousands of barrels of oil still spewing out of a damaged undersea well every day, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Tuesday that it was nearly doubling the portion of the Gulf's federal waters that are now closed to fishing. The restricted zone now pushes south and east into the heart of the Gulf -- another blow to a $2.4 billion industry already reeling from the nearly month-old spill. For Greg Abrams, a commercial fisherman in Panama City, Florida, that means his boats are being pushed further west to chase big catch like bluefin tuna, swordfish and mahi-mahi. ""They'll have to go in somewhere else, probably around Galveston (Texas), instead of coming home,"" Abrams said. ""That'll cause some problems, but it's better to be safe than sorry."" Louisiana fisherman get paid for helping cleanup . Abrams owns a fleet of 14 fishing boats and hires another 41. One of them has  caught 80 tuna in a seven-day stretch off the Gulf's Loop Current, a haul he called a ""great start"" to a seven-month season. ""Now he has to leave the current and go farther west,"" Abrams said. NOAA's latest order extends the closed zone to a nearly 46,000-square-mile stretch, about 19 percent of the Gulf. The ongoing spill now threatens to be picked up by the Loop Current, which could spread some oil around the tip of Florida and up the U.S. East Coast. Unconfirmed reports from researchers that large amounts of oil is spreading below the surface, as well as concerns about the effect of chemical dispersants used to break up the spill, also worry people in the industry. Deborah Long, a spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimpers Association, said fishermen could face a ""multi-generational effect"" on the creatures from which they draw their living, with shrimp and bluefin tuna the two species with the most to lose. ""We're not just worried about the shrimp stocks here,"" Long said. ""We're worried about the entire marine food chain."" Many areas off the Louisiana and Alabama coasts remain open to both commercial and recreational fishing as BP, the Coast Guard and volunteers try to battle the spreading slick offshore. But news accounts of the spill have prompted tourists to cancel fishing trips even in waters that are so far unaffected, said Sonny Schindler, of Shore Thing Charters in Diamondhead, Mississippi. ""The oil hasn't done a thing to us -- it's the exposure,"" Schindler said Tuesday. He added, ""Our water's still open, we're still trying to fish every chance we can, and we're open for business."" And some of those who are still able to get out on the water are now seeing buyers go elsewhere, said Bobby Lovell, a crab fisherman in Louisiana's St. Bernard Parish. State-controlled waters near New Orleans were opened for three days starting Saturday, Lovell said. He and his father laid crab traps last weekend in Lake Borgne and came back with an ice chest full of crustaceans -- but he said many of his buyers have turned to suppliers in western Louisiana, which isn't currently threatened by the spill. Tar balls found in Florida Keys not believed to be from Gulf spill . ""I'm stressed. I'm pacing back and forth, and I'm normally a calm guy,"" he said. However, ""The big wholesalers are in the same predicament I am right now,"" he said. The closures follow an April 20 explosion that sank the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon, taking 11 workers with it. Efforts to shut down the well that was ripped open by the accident have failed so far, though well owner BP says it has been able to capture some of the escaping oil and pump it to a ship on the surface. ""The fish will move. They have fins. They will travel,"" Abrams said.

"Washington (CNN) -- What the hell do we Republicans do now? In the very short run, our course is obvious enough: There will be more votes on health care in the Senate, and we will vote nay again. But this is anti-climax territory. The decisive vote occurred Sunday night. The ""what next?"" question pertains to the days further ahead, after President Obama signs the merged House-Senate legislation and ""Obamacare"" becomes the law of the land. Some Republicans talk of repealing the whole bill. That's not very realistic. Even supposing that Republicans miraculously capture both houses of Congress in November, repeal will require a presidential signature. More relevantly: Do Republicans write a one-sentence bill declaring that the whole thing is repealed? Will they vote to reopen the ""doughnut"" hole for prescription drugs for seniors? To allow health insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions? To kick millions of people off Medicaid? It's unimaginable, impossible. But there are things that can be done, and here are some early priorities: . 1) One of the worst things about the Democrats' plan is the method of financing: an increase in tax on high-income earners. At first that tax bites only a very small number, but the new taxes will surely be applied to larger and larger portions of the American population over time. Republicans champion lower taxes and faster economic growth. We need to start thinking now about how to get rid of these new taxes on work, saving and investment -- if necessary by finding other sources of revenue, including carbon taxes. 2) We should quit defending employment-based health care. The leading Republican spokesman in the House on these issues, Rep. Paul Ryan, repeatedly complained during floor debate that the Obama plan would ""dump"" people out of employer-provided care into the exchanges. He said that as if it were a bad thing. Yet free-market economists from Milton Friedman onward have identified employer-provided care as the original sin of American health care. Employers choose different policies for employees than those employees would choose for themselves. The cost is concealed. Wages are depressed without employees understanding why. The day when every employee in America gets his or her insurance through an exchange will be a good day for market economics. It's true that the exchanges are subsidized. So is employer-provided care, to the tune of almost $200 billion a year. 3) We should call for reducing regulation of the policies sold inside the health care exchanges. The Democrats' plans require every policy sold within the exchanges to meet certain strict conditions. American workers will lose the option of buying more basic but cheaper plans. It will be as if the only cable packages available were those that include all the premium channels. No bargains in that case. Republicans should press for more scope for insurers to cut prices if they think they can offer an attractive product that way. 4) The Democratic plan requires businesses with payrolls more than $500,000 to buy health insurance for their workers or face fines of $2,000 per worker. Could there be a worse time to heap this new mandate on smaller employers? Health insurance comes out of employee wages, plain and simple. Employers who do not offer health insurance must compete for labor against those who do -- and presumably pay equivalent wages for equivalent work. Uninsured employees have now through the exchanges been provided an easy and even subsidized way to buy their own coverage. There is no justification for the small-business fine: Republicans should press for repeal. That platform is ambitious enough -- but also workable, enactable and likely to appeal to voters. After 18 months of overheated rhetoric, it's time at last for Republicans to get real. I've been on a soapbox for months now about the harm that our overheated talk is doing to us. Yes, it mobilizes supporters -- but by mobilizing them with hysterical accusations and pseudo-information, overheated talk has made it impossible for representatives to represent and elected leaders to lead. Now the overheated talk is about to get worse. Over the past 48 hours, I've heard conservatives compare the House bill to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 -- a decisive step on the path to the Civil War. Conservatives have whipped themselves into spasms of outrage and despair that block all strategic thinking. Or almost all. The vitriolic talking heads on conservative talk radio and shock TV have very different imperatives from people in government. Talk radio thrives on confrontation and recrimination. When Rush Limbaugh said that he wanted Obama to fail, he was intelligently explaining his own interests. What he omitted to say -- but what is equally true -- is that he also wants Republicans to fail. If Republicans succeed -- if they govern successfully in office and negotiate attractive compromises out of office -- Rush's listeners get less angry. And if they are less angry, they listen to the radio less and hear fewer ads for Sleep Number beds. So today's defeat for free-market economics and Republican values is a huge win for the conservative entertainment industry. Their listeners and viewers will be even more enraged, even more frustrated, even more disappointed in everybody except the responsibility-free talkers on television and radio. For them, it's mission accomplished. For the cause they purport to represent, however, the ""Waterloo"" threatened by GOP Sen. Jim DeMint last year regarding Obama and health care has finally arrived all right: Only it turns out to be our own. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says Republicans suffered a big defeat with passage of health care .
Frum says it's not realistic to think the bill's benefits, which will be popular, can be repealed .
He says GOP can pledge to stave off higher taxes and more regulation of small businesses .

"Washington (CNN) -- The efforts by leaders of Turkey and Brazil to broker a nuclear deal with Iran reflects growing dissatisfaction with the traditional world order in which the United States is the only superpower, which they view as outdated and unjust. And their intervention on the Iran issue reflects a growing perception among many countries that the United States is unable to resolve international conflicts alone. The visit this week to Tehran by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was a rare show of personal, high-stakes diplomacy by a pair of world leaders. Turkey and Brazil hailed the agreement they reached for Iran to ship some of its nuclear fuel out of the country as a major step toward resolving Iran's years-old standoff with the West. But it was promptly pooh-poohed by the United States, which, a day after the deal was announced, introduced a sanctions resolution to the United Nations Security Council in what was perceived widely in Ankara and Brasilia as an American snub of two close allies. The Obama administration never really supported Turkey and Brazil's diplomatic efforts. While U.S. officials were prepared to be pleasantly surprised if Lula and Erdogan were able to produce a deal that addressed all their concerns about Iran's nuclear program, they didn't think that it would happen and were concerned the deal would complicate efforts to pass the U.N. resolution. For Lula and Erdogan, however, the introduction of the resolution handicaps their efforts to get Iran to cooperate. Brazil and Turkey, both emerging democracies, have been eagerly flexing their muscles on the international stage for some time. Some of their reasons for pursuing a more active global diplomatic role are similar, others are quite different. Ankara's interest in trying to mediate the standoff with Iran is primarily regional, driven by the desire to avoid a conflict on its border. Iran is also a large trading partner with whom Turkey has lucrative oil and gas deals. Iran isn't the first issue Turkey has tried to mediate between countries in its neighborhood. In 2008 Turkey led indirect talks between Israel and Syria, although there was no breakthrough. For years Turkey has sought to position itself as a bridge between East and West. Even as it plays an important role in NATO and seeks to join the European Union, Turkey has clung to its Muslim identity. This week Ankara announced its bid to host the summit meeting of leaders of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in 2014. Turkey argues it is uniquely poised to coax the Iranian regime into cooperating with the international community. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu recently told a group of reporters in Washington that no country understands the Iranian mindset and culture like Turkey. In addition to sharing a border, he noted the two countries share a long history and that many Iranians speak Turkish, including Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Lula, who leaves office at the end of the year, also saw himself as the one leader who could broker a deal between Iran and the West. But his interest is largely for that of his stature and his country's. As one of the world's big emerging economies, Brazil and the other BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- account for about half of the global growth and represent 40 percent of the world's population. Lula has artfully parlayed his country's newfound economic influence into a role for Brazil as a growing world power . Hugely popular at home and abroad, Lula was hailed by newspapers around the world as a talented diplomat when the Iran deal was announced. But privately U.S. officials complain that Lula is trying to play statesman at the expense of their own diplomatic efforts. ""For him it's a brass ring,"" one senior U.S. official said. ""Iran just happens to be convenient."" It may be a little of both. Lula has spent much of his seven-year term advocating for a greater international role for Brazil, including a permanent seat at the United Nations, which he argues is dominated by a handful of nations. He has positioned himself as a leader of Latin America's growing leftist movement and has been able to skillfully balance Brazil's growing partnership with Washington with warm relations with U.S. foes like Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Ahmadinejad. Perhaps most importantly, Lula has become a champion of developing nations, many of which have a different world view than the United States. This ""different"" world view includes the notion that sanctions are not an effective means of diplomacy and only leaders to escalation, a belief which Turkey shares. The U.S. lost much of its credibility over the war in Iraq, Guantanamo and, more recently, the world economic crisis. While Brazil and Turkey both have good relationships with the United States, they have sought to fill what they see as the leadership vacuum left by America. While Obama has made it a priority to restore U.S. prestige around the world, he faces no shortage of thorny international issues: Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, extremism in Pakistan, the Middle East conflict and North Korea's antics to name a few. Emerging powers like Brazil and Turkey are ready, willing and eager to help solve them if the United States will let them.","Intervention from Turkey, Brazil reflects dissatisfaction with U.S. leadership, Labott says .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP said Wednesday that efforts to contain and clean up oil gushing from a ruptured pipe in the Gulf of Mexico have made a ""measurable difference"" even as Louisiana's governor announced that thick, heavy oil has begun polluting the state's wetlands and estuaries. Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, said at a news conference that the company is ""very pleased"" with the performance of an insertion tube that was put in place over the weekend to suck crude oil from the well and funnel it to a surface vessel. The flow rate from the tube has reached 3,000 barrels of crude (126,000 gallons) and 14 million cubic feet of gas a day, Suttles said, adding that crews hope to increase those numbers in coming days. He said favorable weather conditions have also played a major role in cleanup efforts. About 14,000 barrels of oily water was skimmed Tuesday, and 50 percent of that mixture was oil, he said, adding that crews continue to deploy boom and conduct controlled burns. But Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana says the efforts haven't stopped oil from reaching his state's coastline. Thicker, heavier oil than seen in previous days has blanketed some of the state's precious interior wetlands, he said, and he called for the Army Corps of Engineers to approve an emergency permit to dredge sand from barrier islands to create sand booms as another line of defense. ""These are not tar balls, this is not sheen, this is heavy oil that we are seeing in our wetlands,"" Jindal said. Video from Pass a Loutre in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, showed oil with a syrupy consistency lapping against reeds in a small area of marshland after creeping past booms and barriers. ""Everything that that blanket of oil has covered today will die,"" parish President Billy Nungesser said. ""Imagine [this oil] on top of a turtle or on top of a frog,"" he said as he held a stalk of reed that coated his hands in oil. CNN iReporter Eileen Romero, touring the state's Chandeleur Islands by boat on Tuesday, described a ""foamy sheen on top of the water"" left by the oil and dispersants, and she said she counted between 10 and 15 dead Portuguese man-of-wars trapped in debris. ""While we were out there, my nose and the back of my throat began to burn as I inhaled the putrid-smelling air,"" Romero said. Jindal compared the fight to head off the approaching oil to ""knowing your body has cancer. ... We've got to stop this cancer from spreading [and] we'd much rather fight it on these coastal barrier islands than inland."" ""We need more than just boom or skimmers,"" Jinadal said. ""We need multiple lines of defense."" iReport: Track the spill, or share your story . Meanwhile, BP said it is continuing to mobilize equipment and perform testing in preparation for the first effort to actually stop the flow of oil. Suttles said the first attempt at a ""top kill"" procedure could come as early as Sunday. In that procedure, a large amount of heavy ""mud"" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, officials have said. Suttles cautioned, as he has with previous efforts, that the procedure will be performed at a depth of 5,000 feet, ""which has never been done before."" ""We're absolutely holding out hope that top kill works,"" said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry. ""Everybody is anxious to see success with this intervention. ... Let's keep our fingers crossed [and] let's all say our prayers."" Oil has been leaking at an estimated rate of 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) a day for nearly a month after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig the Deepwater Horizon. The rig burned for two days and then sank, causing the ruptured pipe. Also Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said it has been in communication with Cuban officials over the possibility of oil reaching that country's shorelines. ""The U.S. Interests Section in Havana today delivered a diplomatic note to the Cuban Foreign Ministry informing the Cuban government about the oil spill and what we currently know about its projected movement,"" the State Department's deputy spokesman, Mark Toner, told CNN. ""We have had working level discussions with the Cuban government to keep them informed of developments."" The communication came after reports of oil possibly reaching the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current. The current flows through the Yucatan Channel between Cuba and Mexico, and then northward, where it loops and exits the Gulf just south of the Florida Keys and travels to the west side of the western Bahamas. The European Space Agency issued a statement Wednesday saying satellite images show the oil is in the Loop Current. ""With these images from space, we have visible proof that at least oil from the surface of the water has reached the current,"" Bertrand Chapron of Ifremer, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, said in the statement. Charlie Henry of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday that amounts of light sheen ""are feeling the effects of the Loop Current and that oil is going to move slowly"" with the current. ""We actually expect that oil to dissipate,"" said Henry, adding it was ""not an immediate threat"" to Florida or other shorelines.","Cleanup efforts have made ""measurable difference"" on ocean surface, BP says .

"(CNN) -- Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has included three uncapped players in his final 23-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa. Winger Pedro Rodriguez, 22, was named along with his Barcelona teammate Victor Valdes, who edged out 19-year-old David De Gea and Villarreal's Diego Lopez for the third goalkeeping place. De Gea's 21-year-old clubmate Javi Martinez was handed a midfield berth, having impressed as Atletico Madrid won the UEFA Europa League this season and reached the final of the Spanish Cup. ""They have had a good season, they are coming to strengthen the squad as substitutes for other players,"" Del Bosque told reporters. Martinez's fellow under-21 international, Osasuna defender Cesar Azpilicueta, missed out along with midfielders Santi Cazorla and Marcos Senna, who both featured when Spain won Euro 2008. Sevilla striker Alvaro Negredo was also chopped, as was another member of the triumphant 2008 squad, Dani Guiza. Del Bosque is giving England-based stars Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas every chance to be fit, retaining the duo as they recover from injuries. Midfielder Andres Iniesta is also expected to be ready, having returned from a calf problem in the last game of the Spanish league season as Barcelona claimed the title. Barcelona's 19-year-old Bojan Krkic, who missed Spain's Euro 2008 success at his own request due to fatigue, did not even make the initial 30-man squad named earlier this month. England coach Fabio Capello was forced to go back on his previously iron-clad rules in selecting his preliminary squad for the World Cup. The Italian has always said he would not pick players who are injured or out of form, but brought Liverpool's Jamie Carragher out of international retirement to bolster his defensive options as cover with injury-prone captain Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King also in the 30-man line-up. Neither Carragher nor versatile Tottenham star King have yet played for Capello, who retained his midfield mainstay Gareth Barry despite the Manchester City player being in doubt for the June 12 opener against the United States due to injury. Carragher made himself unavailable in 2007 after not being often used by previous managers Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren despite being regularly named in squads. Blog: Will ""the Force"" be with Capello at World Cup? Capello also asked Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes to become available again following his own international retirement in 2004, but the 35-year-old turned down the opportunity. ""He said no, he preferred to stay with the family. But I tried,"" Capello told the UK Press Association. Liverpool fullback Glen Johnson was named despite being sidelined with injury, while striker Emile Heskey retained his place although he has not been a first-choice selection for his club Aston Villa. Key forward Wayne Rooney was named despite his niggling groin problem, with Tottenham's Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch taking the other striking spots along with Sunderland's 25-goal Darren Bent. Winger Aaron Lennon was included after only recently returning with Tottenham after a long-term absence, as was fellow right-sided player Shaun Wright-Phillips despite his failure to win a regular place at Manchester City, who also have 22-year-old Adam Johnson in the squad. Midfielder Joe Cole also got the nod, having last played for England in 2008, after a strong end to a season that saw him on the fringe of league champions Chelsea's first team. Germany captain Michael Ballack was ruled out of the World Cup after suffering an ankle injury in the English FA Cup final. The Chelsea midfielder was caught by a bad tackle from Portsmouth's Berlin-born Kevin-Prince Boateng, who has decided to switch nationalities to play for Group D opponents Ghana and whose half-brother Jerome was earlier named  in the preliminary 27-man German squad. With No. 1 goalkeeper Rene Adler also sidelined by injury, the 35-year-old Hans-Jorg Butt received his first call-up since 20003 to vie for a starting place with Schalke's Manuel Neuer and Werder Bremen's Tim Wiese. Butt's young Bayern Munich clubmates Holger Badstuber, 21, and Thomas Muller, 20, gave the Bundesliga champions seven players in coach Joachim Low's squad. Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi has stuck with the players who qualified for South Africa in his 30-man squad, resisting suggestions that he should bring in-form Roma striker Francesco Totti out of international retirement. Totti's on-loan teammate Luca Toni also missed out along with veteran Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Villarreal's Giuseppe Rossi one of seven strikers named. Inter Milan's controversial Italy under-21 forward Mario Balotelli missed out as Fabio Quagliarella (Napoli), Vincenzo Iaquinta (Juventus), Antonio Di Natale (Udinese), Marco Borriello (Milan), Alberto Gilardino (Fiorentina) and Giampaolo Pazzini (Sampdoria) were picked. Lippi omitted his former Juventus player Nicola Legrottaglie despite the defender being included in a recent 29-man training squad. France coach Raymond Domenech has trimmed his initial 30-man selection down to 24, with Marseille striker Hatem Ben Arfa and Lille goalkeeper Mickael Landreau dropped along with defenders Adil Rami and Rod Fanni, midfielder Yann Mvila and forward Jimmy Briand. Defender Williams Gallas has been warned by Domenech that he must prove his fitness, having been sidelined since March with a leg injury. His Arsenal clubmate Samir Nasri missed out on the initial squad, but Gael Clichy, Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna were included. Young Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema also failed to pass the first selection obstacle, while the omission of veteran midfielder Patrick Vieira meant Thierry Henry was the only survivor from the 1998 World Cup-winning squad. Veteran Netherlands striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy has missed out on a place in coach Bert van Marwijk's 30-man, potentially signaling the end of the 33-year-old's international career. Van Nistelrooy left Real Madrid to join German club Hamburg to revive his hopes following a serious knee injury, but Van Marwijk said the player had not returned to a high enough level to be selected. ""I told him that we have followed him closely and admire his commitment and dedication to get to the World Cup,"" Van Marwijk told AD Sportwereld. ""I believe that Ruud is fit, but after his lengthy knee injury he does not have time to get back to his old level."" Dutch champions Twente have only two players in the squad, which features 14 overseas-based names. Feyenoord defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst, 35, has announced he will retire after the month-long tournament. Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz named a 24-man squad due to doubts over a couple of players including Real Madrid defender Pepe, who has only just returned to training after being sidelined since December. Goalkeepers Beto and Daniel Fernandes were named as deputies to Braga's Eduardo despite not playing in any of the qualifiers, but there were no other surprises for the 2006 semifinalists, who will be led by Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel, Filip Holosko and fellow striker Robert Vittek were named in a 29-man squad by coach Vladimir Weiss despite their recent injury problems. Liverpool's Skrtel has not played for three months since breaking a bone in his foot, while Holosko is struggling to get over a broken leg suffered last year and Vittek -- who is also based in Turkey -- has had a knee problem. Weiss also selected his 20-year-old son and namesake Vladimir of English club Manchester City, who as loaned to Bolton this season. Serbia coach Radomir Antic named just five home-based players in his 30-man squad, with six from English Premier League clubs including key defender Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United. Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek kept faith with the players who helped the small East European nation qualify for the second time when he named his 30-man squad. Denmark coach Morten Olsen picked Thomas Sorensen in his 26-man squad despite the goalkeeper suffered a dislocated elbow on duty with English club Stoke last month. Olsen, who won more than 100 caps as a player and took Denmark to the 2002 World Cup, gave defender Patrick Mtiliga his first call-up since his debut in November 2008. Greece coach Otto Rehhagel has picked Christos Patsatzoglou and Giorgos Seitaridis despite the duo's struggles with injuries this season. The German selected nine overseas-based players including qualifying campaign top scorer Theofanis Gekas of Hertha Berlin, Celtic striker Georgios Samaras and Liverpool defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos. Switzerland defender Christoph Spycher has pulled out of coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's experienced 23-man squad for the finals after failing to overcome a knee injury. The 32-year-old, who had already decided to retire from internationals after the tournament, has been replaced by Ludovic Magnin -- one of seven reserve players named by the German. Hitzfeld has stuck with the likes of Blaise Nkufo of Dutch champions Twente, fellow striker Alexander Frei and midfielder Hakin Yakin, who are all 30 and above. Defender Philippe Senderos was included despite his lack of action with English club Arsenal, while Sampdoria midfielder Marco Padalino and Kosovo-born Swiss under-21 international Xherdan Shaqiri were also included.","Barcelona's Pedro and Victor Valdes among three uncapped players in Spain's 23-man squad .

"Washington (CNN) -- A BP official says a gusher of oil pouring from its damaged Gulf of Mexico well could be shut off as early as next week. BP Managing Director Bo Dudley said Thursday night the company will pump fluids into the well this weekend in the beginning of a process that -- if successful -- could lead to the leak finally being closed off in a matter of days. ""If that option doesn't work, we've got a second and a third option we'll do after that,"" Dudley said on CNN's Larry King on Thursday. ""We're hopeful that next week we'll be able to shut it off."" Earlier in the day, BP acknowledged that the underwater gusher is bigger than estimated to date, as new video showed a cloud of crude billowing around its undersea siphon. Company spokesman Mark Proegler said Thursday that the siphon is now drawing about 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) per day up to a ship on the surface of the Gulf -- as much as government and company officials had estimated the spill was pouring into the Gulf every day for a month. Proegler declined to estimate how much more oil was escaping. BP America Chairman Lamar McKay said Wednesday that the figure used by the oil spill response team had a degree of ""uncertainty"" built into it. But figures by independent researchers have run up to many times higher: Steve Wereley, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that the spill could be as big as 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. And members of Congress released video from the company that showed much more oil pouring out of the damaged well than the siphon was capturing. Rep. Ed Markey, who leads a House subcommittee investigating the disaster, told reporters, ""I think now we are beginning to understand that we cannot trust BP."" ""People do not trust the experts any longer,"" said Markey, D-Massachusetts. ""BP has lost all credibility. Now the decisions will have to be made by others, because it is clear that they have been hiding the actual consequences of this spill."" Meanwhile, the Coast Guard announced the creation of a federal Flow Rate Technical Group to assess the actual flow rate from the well. Coast Guard Capt. Ron LaBrec said that Adm. Thad Allen would oversee the team, which will include members from the Coast Guard, the Minerals Management Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Society and others from the science community and academia. The peer-reviewed team, which has already begun its work, is to determine the flow rate from the beginning of the incident to the present, LaBrec said. The Obama administration announced Thursday that it has ordered BP to release all data related to the massive spill, including environmental sampling analyses, internal investigation reports and details of the cleanup effort. In a letter to BP Group CEO Tony Hayward, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson told BP to post that information on a website and update it daily. ""The public and the United States government are entitled to nothing less than complete transparency in this matter,"" they concluded. The spill began with an April 20 explosion and fire that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon two days later. Eleven workers were lost with the rig, which was owned by drilling contractor Transocean and hired by BP. The resulting slick now threatens the coastal marshes of southeastern Louisiana, where brown, syrupy oil made it past protective booms and into the wetlands near the mouth of the Mississippi River on Wednesday. Over the weekend, BP inserted a piece of pipe into the larger of the two leak points and began drawing oil from the undersea gusher, located about a mile underwater, up to a ship on the surface. It also has been laying booms out along barrier islands and spraying hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersants on the surface and near the sources of the leak. But that element of the response came under new fire as well on Thursday, as the EPA ordered BP to find a less toxic chemical to use to break up the oil. The EPA gave the company a day to pick a new substance and three days to start using it instead of the current dispersant, known as Corexit 9500. The chemical has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday. ""Because of its use in unprecedented volumes and because much is unknown about the underwater use of dispersants, EPA wants to ensure BP is using the least toxic product authorized for use,"" the agency said in a statement announcing the order. ""We reserve the right to discontinue the use of this dispersant method if any negative impacts on the environment outweigh the benefits."" Corexit 9500 includes petroleum distillates, propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonic salt, and prolonged contact with it can cause eye or skin irritation, according to the manufacturer's material data safety sheet. The document warns that ""repeated or prolonged exposure may irritate the respiratory tract."" But BP says Corexit is biodegradable, has been approved by the EPA and the Coast Guard and is ""readily available in the quantities required"" by a response plan approved by the government before the spill. iReport: Track the spill; Share stories . ""It has been very effective in causing the oil to form into small, isolated droplets that remain suspended until they're either eaten by naturally occurring microbes, evaporate, are picked up or dissolve,"" the company said. But it added, ""At the same time, we are conducting ongoing assessment of alternative or supplemental dispersant products."" Meanwhile, BP is readying a new attempt to plug the leak for Sunday by injecting a large amount of heavy ""mud"" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, officials have said. ""Everything is being done to make sure that happens,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, whose department oversees offshore oil drilling, told CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday. ""We have the best scientists in the world who are overseeing what is going on. So, we are hopeful that it will happen soon."" Salazar said BP, which leased the rig from Transocean, has tried many techniques to stop the leaking and the government will do all in its power to hold them accountable. ""They're putting a lot of hope on that Sunday,"" he said. ""We'll see if it happens."" Salazar announced Wednesday that he was dividing the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, which regulates oil exploration, into three divisions. The agency has come under fire since long before the spill, and Salzar said it would be reorganized to separate what he called the conflicting duties of regulating oil companies and collecting royalties from them. ""We inherited here what was a legacy of an agency that essentially was rubber-stamping whatever it was that the oil and gas industry wanted,"" Salazar said. ""We have been on a reform agenda from Day One."" CNN's Ed Lavandera, Marylynn Ryan and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: Well could be shut off next week, BP official says .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's government rejected a Qatari offer to re-establish trade relations that would have allowed the Gulf state to provide aid to Gaza, two senior Israeli government officials said Thursday. One official, who did not want to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter, said there had been ""tentative discussions"" within the Israeli government on the informal Qatari proposal, which would have linked the re-establishment of economic ties with Israel with Israel's granting permission for the Gulf state to send reconstruction supplies and other goods into Gaza. The official said that the idea was rejected because it was seen ""as a way of bolstering Hamas"" and said American and Egyptian officials had expressed similar concerns. The same official said the proposal did not come as a ""formal request or offer"" from the Qatari government but could offer no details on who initially presented the idea. News of Israel's rejection of the Qatari offer was first reported by Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Tuesday. An official from the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem could not immediately comment. Qatari officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Another senior Israeli government official said ""we were favorable"" to the idea of renewed relations, but that the Qatari ""precondition"" of allowing ""large amounts"" of goods into the Gaza was a deal breaker. The official said it was not clear who would have overseen the process. The proposal did not address Israel's concerns ""about the unrestricted flow of material that can be used for defensive fortifications"" by Hamas and ""we had to say no,"" the official said. The Palestinian territory of Gaza has been subjected to an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since 2007, when the Islamist group Hamas staged a violent coup ousting the Palestinian Authority government lead by Fatah, a rival political faction. Qatar and Israel maintained trade relations from 1996 until last year. Relations fell apart after the start of Israel's military operation against Hamas in Gaza at the end of 2008. The three-week campaign, dubbed Operation Cast Lead, ended with approximately 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed. In protest, the Qatari government in Doha ordered the Israeli trade office closed. Qatar was the only Gulf country to maintain official relations with the Jewish state. In a statement released earlier this month after a meeting of Arab leaders, the Qatari Prime Minister Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabor Al-Thani criticized Israel's Gaza policy, saying it contravened international legitimacy. ""We have to concentrate on confronting the Israeli siege imposed on Gaza which is oppressive and it is our duty to save the Palestinians who are part of us and we are part of them,"" he said. Qatar has long sought to bolster its role in regional diplomacy. Bringing about a deal to send in construction supplies to Gaza would be regarded by many in the Arab world as a diplomatic coup, though it is unlikely that Egypt would be receptive to such an arrangement. The Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz reported Thursday that Egypt had expressed its opposition to Israel over the Qatari proposal, and that it was ultimately rejected so as not to upset the government of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki told CNN that ""the Israeli newspaper report is a fairy tale and quite illogical."" ""Since when do the Israelis need to consult with Egypt when they want to establish relations with any other party?"" Zaki asked. ""It is clear that the Israelis do not want to offend the Qataris and therefore they (the Israelis) resorted to their usual game in striking a nerve in order to start trouble between Egypt and Qatar, just to make Israel look innocent,"" the spokesman added.","Israeli officials say Qatar offered to re-establish trade relations .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States, Russia, China and other key nations have reached agreement on a ""strong"" Iran sanctions resolution, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday. Speaking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Clinton said the United States has been ""working closely"" with its international partners -- the so-called P5 plus 1 -- on a resolution to present to the United Nations Security Council. She said they forged ""a strong draft with the cooperation of Russia and China,"" the two countries that have been reluctant to impose strong sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. ""We plan to circulate the draft resolution to the entire Security Council today,"" said Clinton, who made the remarks before she began testifying about START, the U.S.-Russian treaty on nuclear arms. The P5 plus 1 comprises the five permanent member of the Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, France, and Britain -- as well as Germany. The group has been concerned that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has denied that claim, saying it wants to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Clinton noted an Iranian offer to send low-enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for highly enriched uranium but said it would not stop U.S. efforts to impose sanctions. ""We acknowledge the sincere efforts of both Turkey and Brazil to find a solution regarding Iran's standoff with the international community over its nuclear program,"" Clinton told Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, citing the two countries that brokered the deal. But, she said, the P5 plus 1 ""are proceeding to rally the international community on behalf of a strong sanctions resolution that will, in our view, send an unmistakable message about what is expected from Iran.""","U.S., France, Britain, Germany also in group hammering out sanctions plan .

"(CNN) -- An Aruban police dive team will search the site where an underwater photograph was taken that might show human remains, a spokeswoman for the Aruban prosecutor said Saturday. The picture has renewed interest in the nearly 5-year-old Natalee Holloway case. Officials first heard of the picture, taken in October by a vacationing American couple, on Thursday, Ann Angela, a spokeswoman for Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken, said . ""We have received the picture, and the diving team of the Aruban police will start doing preliminary work at the spot where we believe it was taken,"" Angela told CNN. She declined to identify the location, saying authorities want to avoid attracting onlookers during the search. The picture has raised the notion that, if it shows human remains, they could be those of Holloway, an 18-year-old Alabama high school student whose 2005 disappearance while on a graduation trip to Aruba was widely publicized. Holloway was last reported seen leaving a bar in the capital of Oranjestad on May 30. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the photo nor confirm whether it shows human remains. Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty, declined to comment on the photo. The photo was taken by a Pennsylvania woman using a disposable film camera during the first stop on her Royal Caribbean cruise. Three months after snapping what she said she thought were pictures of colorful fish, Patti Muldowney and her husband said they realized that one picture contained what they believe appear to be human remains. ""When I looked at that photo, I said, 'By darn, that certainly does look like a skeleton,' "" John Muldowney told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" on Friday. ""You can see the skull. You can see where the eye sockets were. You can see where the chin was. ""It's lying flat on its back. And its arms are cradled around. You can almost see fingers. And then on the one sleeve it looks like some kind of maybe clothing that's deteriorating."" The couple, who took the photo to police and the FBI, said it was taken near a shipwreck. The FBI said Friday that it is investigating. ""The photo has been made available to all elements of the FBI that are involved in this foreign police cooperation case,"" Mike Kortan, assistant director of the FBI's office of public affairs, said in a statement. ""Investigative leads are being pursued and the effort is ongoing."" The main suspect in the Holloway case, Joran van der Sloot, remains free. Van der Sloot has made alleged confession-like statements in TV interviews, one of which involves dumping Holloway's body in the ocean after she suffered a seizure on the beach. Aruban judges have ruled there isn't enough evidence to arrest him. Whether the object in the photo is human remains is still up for debate. In underwater burials, it is typical for arms, legs and other extremities to be dispersed and for lighter bones to be carried away from heavier bones by fish, wildlife and water, according to Heather Walsh-Haney, a forensic anthropologist. ""It looks as if there's something that may be on top of the skeleton,"" Walsh-Haney said of the image in the photograph. ""That would certainly bode well for preserving the center of the mass of the body and keeping most of it there."" Dr. Marty Makary, a physician who serves on the faculty at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, said he sees mixed signs, some indicating the image may not be a skeleton. ""What I don't like about the photo is there's no spinal cord or vertebral column,"" he said. ""In fact, below this roundish skull-type profile you see a curvature which doesn't really represent a normal spinal column."" CNN's Tracy Sabo and Philip Rosenbaum contributed to this report.","Picture has renewed interest in case of missing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway .

"(CNN) -- ""Banchao! Banchao!"" Save me! Save me! A rescue worker could hear the screams of a passenger on Air India Flight IX-812, but the plane was consumed with flames. Fire was leaping in every part of the Boeing jet that crashed early Saturday in southern India. The rescue worker heard things bursting in the extreme heat, he told CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN. Then it was quiet, and he understood that no one else was alive. The Air India plane had flown in from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, carrying 160 passengers and six crew members. Among them were 19 children and four infants. Some people were returning home. An anxious young bride-to-be and a man on his way to perform last rites for his father were also on the flight. Others were migrant workers. Millions of Indians work as laborers in Persian Gulf states. Most perished, charred beyond recognition in the fiery wreckage. Only the aircraft's tail was left intact, officials said. Rescuers scrambled to find survivors all day Saturday. Mostly they pulled bodies. The eight who survived recounted their harrowing tales for CNN-IBN. Ummerfarook Mohammed said the cabin quickly filled with smoke after the jet skidded off the runway and hit a boundary wall. The impact created a hole in the plane's body, he said. He crawled out and ran for his life. Nearby villagers carted him to the hospital in a rickshaw. And then there were those who counted their blessings on Saturday for not having boarded their ill-fated flight in Dubai. Vasant Shetty's friend had booked him on the Mangalore-bound plane, but he was too busy at work and decided not to take the flight. ""It's all God's grace. I missed the flight and survived,"" Shetty told the Press Trust of India news agency. ""I don't know what to say about the ill-fated passengers who were killed,"" he said. ""I pray for them.""","Rescue worker heard a passenger's screams .

"New York (CNN) -- As the story goes, God spent six days creating the world and then rested on the seventh day. He told the Jewish people to always rest on the seventh day of each week, which was to become known as the Sabbath for them for eternity. This was before Facebook, Twitter, BlackBerries and iPhones, of course. Adam and Eve didn't have friends who would get upset if texts weren't returned promptly, parents who wanted to know where their children were all the time or bosses who had complete access to their employees via work-issued devices. There is no excuse good enough to ignore the boss, even on a weekend. But one group is trying to take back the Sabbath: Reboot -- a nonprofit organization aimed at reinventing the traditions and rituals of Judaism for today's secular Jews. Composed of Internet entrepreneurs, creators of award-winning television shows, community organizers and nonprofit leaders, these ""Rebooters"" are people who typically have their cell phones glued to their palms. Several of them go so far as to say they have an addiction to their devices. They pledged to observe 24 hours of freedom from their devices this past weekend: a National Day of Unplugging, lasting from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. The day was to launch Reboot's ongoing project, the Sabbath Manifesto. Dan Rollman, a Rebooter and founder of the Universal World Record Database Web site, created the Sabbath Manifesto because he felt that technology was taking over too much of his life. ""There's clearly a social problem when we're interacting more with digital interfaces than our fellow human beings,"" Rollman said in an e-mail to CNN. ""Rich, engaging conversations are harder to come by than they were a few years ago. Our attention spans are silently evaporating."" The Sabbath Manifesto consists of 10 principles. However, people are encouraged to discuss online which principles work and which should be tweaked. As they stand now, the guiding principles are: . 1. Avoid technology. 2. Connect with loved ones. 3. Nurture your health. 4. Get outside. 5. Avoid commerce. 6. Light candles. 7. Drink wine. 8. Eat bread. 9. Find silence. 10. Give back. The National Day of Unplugging specifically promotes the first principle. Even though Reboot is technically focused on reaching out to hyper-connected Jews, the values behind the Sabbath Manifesto are meant for all denominations, Rollman said. ""We believe that everyone can benefit from a respite from the relentless technology. Unplugging on a weekly basis won't provide a magical solution to these issues, but it's a start ... a chance to catch our breaths, replenish our souls and reconnect with the living, breathing people we love."" It may sound like a nice idea, but how realistic is the concept? Can people live without their beloved technology for 24 hours? ""No,"" said Chris Maroudis, 22, without missing a beat. ""The problem is, I live in Jersey and work here [Manhattan]. I have to contact my friends in Jersey to make plans. I'm not just going to go all the way there and then they're not home."" Some people are able to remember a simpler time before cell phones. ""This is new for me,"" said 26-year-old Amanda Norman, laughing and waving her BlackBerry. ""I remember even before cell phones, when you had to make plans with someone beforehand and meet them there. If you were late, you were late."" Walking around Manhattan, though, it is hard to find people without a phone of any kind in their grasp. As Nano Paulino, 27, pointed out, everyone in the city is working. The bosses need to stay in touch with you. Asked if he would answer a call from his boss at 10 at night, he said no. Why not? ""I'm sleeping!"" His friend, Arnold Diaz, 30, would also have a hard time without his phone, but for a slightly different reason. ""Definitely not on a Friday night. We have to make plans. Maybe on a Monday or Tuesday,"" he paused. ""Not Monday, because if you meet a girl over the weekend, you want to call her on Monday. So maybe Tuesday or Wednesday."" There is one piece of irony to the whole thing. Lisa Keller, 42, said she can easily go a day without using her phone. Asked if her friends and family would get frustrated by not being able to call or e-mail her, she laughed. ""I would first put up a Facebook status to say I'll be off my phone and computer for 24 hours."" Reboot also recognizes the irony that it has been promoting the National Day of Unplugging largely using social-networking sites. However, the group was asking people not to log on to their sites in the 24-hour window starting Friday evening at sundown.","Reboot aims to reinvent traditions of Judaism for today's secular Jews .

"(CNN)  -- A worldwide network of fraudsters conned thousands of people into buying fake golf clubs on eBay, a London court has heard. Ebay was hit by a massive worldwide fraud in counterfeit golf clubs. In allegedly the largest fraud uncovered by the online auction site, the counterfeit clubs, as well as clothing and other golf accessories, were sold ""on a scale, it is believed, has never been seen before,"" prosecutors told Snaresbrook Crown Court. The mastermind behind the million dollar operation, Greg Bellchambers, from east London, has already admitted fraud and conspiracy. His six co-defendants, who deny playing a ""crucial role"" in the plot, are said to have assisted Bellchambers in managing accounts and acting as distributors in the scam. Bellchambers sourced the ""below-par"" clubs in China and then marketed them on eBay as the original top of the line brands. The fraud only came to light when a disgruntled customer complained to a local trading standards office in London about sub-standard Acushnet clubs and an investigation was launched. When Bellchambers' home was raided, ""a large quantity"" of clubs were seized, with all of them fake apart from those which belonged to the 45-year-old. Adam Davis, for the prosecution, said: ""Nearly every major golf brand has been affected by the sale of counterfeit goods through the eBay accounts. ""It is the belief of the fraud investigation unit at eBay that this case represents the single largest counterfeiting conspiracy yet uncovered on their Web site."" Prosecutors claimed that many other people were involved, but proceedings have not been brought against them as they live abroad or there is insufficient information to identify them. The trial of Bellchambers' six co-defendants is expected to last three months. All deny conspiracy.","Fake eBay golf clubs scam left thousand out of pocket, court is told .

"Vatican City (CNN) --  Pope Benedict XVI championed the environment in the Vatican's annual World Day of Peace message. In his address, called ""If You Want to Cultivate Peace, Protect Creation,"" the pope said peace with the natural environment is the beginning of peace with all of God's creation, including people. ""Respect for creation is of immense consequence, not least because creation is the beginning and the foundation of all God's works, and its preservation has now become essential for the pacific coexistence of mankind,"" the pope said. The papal message of peace comes a week after the traditional Christmas address known as ""Urbi et Orbi"" -- Latin for ""To the City and the World"" -- a message of hope for the world's afflicted. During the Christmas Eve Mass the night before, Benedict was dragged to the ground after a woman jumped a barrier and grabbed his robes. The pope appeared uninjured. In his homily, the 82-year-old pontiff asked parishioners to consider the possible effect of an ecological crisis on the stability and peace of the world -- a world in which there is increasing competition for the ""fruitfulness of the Earth."" ""Can we remain impassive in the face of actual and potential conflicts involving access to natural resources?"" the pope asked Friday. ""All these are issues with a profound impact on the exercise of human rights, such as the right to life, food, health and development."" ""Technologically advanced societies must be prepared to encourage more sober lifestyles, while reducing their energy consumption and improving its efficiency,"" while preparing ""sustainable strategies to satisfy the energy needs of the present and future generations,"" he said. Pope Benedict XVI challenged the faithful to be good stewards of what ""God has given us,"" suggesting that peace with the Earth will lead to peace on Earth. ""For this reason, it is imperative that mankind renew and strengthen that covenant between human beings and the environment, which should mirror the creative love of God, from whom we come and toward whom we are journeying,"" he said.","Pope Benedict XVI urges ""respect for creation""

"(CNN) -- Changes to social studies curricula introduced by conservative members of the Texas State Board of Education were approved Friday after months of ideologically driven debate. Three separate votes on amended guidelines for elementary-, middle- and high-school curricula each resulted in 9-5 splits along party lines in favor of the new standards, known as Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills. New standards for the high school economics course passed 14-0. Debate over the guidelines has drawn scrutiny since conservative members of the board introduced the changes in 2009 in what they considered an effort to bring ""balance"" to the curriculum. ""What we have is the history profession, the experts, seem to have a left-wing tilt, so what we were doing is trying to restore some balance to the standards,"" board member Don McLeroy said in March. Among the approved amendments, according to the Texas Education Agency: discussions of the ""solvency of long term entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare""; and an examination of why ""the Founding Fathers protected religious freedom in America and guaranteed its free exercise by saying that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and compare and contrast this to the phrase 'separation of church and state.' "" The board also voted ""to add a direct reference to the election of President Barack H. Obama"" and to require students to become familiar with the political philosophies of Thomas Jefferson. What is taught in Texas often is taught in other states because publishers typically tailor textbooks for Texas, one of the largest buyers of textbooks in the country. However, digital publishing has diminished the state's influence on textbooks nationally and that curriculum is always going to be decided at the local level, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said. ""Whatever Texas decides, I do not think there will be large ripple effects around the country,"" he said before Friday's votes. ""Textbook companies today have a real ability to customize textbooks and whatever the Texas board decides, I don't think that's going to impact education in other parts of the country.""","Conservatives on Texas board vote on changes to ""balance"" curriculum .

"(CNN) -- Two teachers at a Baltimore, Maryland, high school say they were attacked by students, and one says such assaults are commonplace, according to CNN affiliate WBAL. ""No learning place should be this violent,"" art teacher Jolita Berry said of the school where she teaches. The school district says it is investigating and will take appropriate action, but both art teacher Jolita Berry and English teacher Marc Standish say the administration has failed to protect and support them. ""I looked over, and her friends were cheering her on. And before I knew it, she hit me in the face,"" Berry told WBAL. She showed the station a cell-phone video depicting what she said was a student beating her last Friday. Individuals in the video are difficult to identify, and no charges have been filed, WBAL reported. Berry said her principal told her she brought the attack on herself. ""On one hand, she told me that she is sorry that this happened to me,"" Berry told WBAL. ""But then she turned right around and told me that telling a student that I was going to defend myself was a trigger word. I triggered them."" Berry called the administrative response frustrating. ""Too many times this has happened at this school and at other schools, and nothing's being done. No learning place should be this violent,"" she said. Baltimore City Schools public relations department said it would have no comment beyond a statement issued by Bennie Williams, the district's chief of staff, that says the district has ""a fundamental commitment"" to keep schools safe. ""We take any disruption of the learning environment extremely seriously and respond immediately and forcefully to any disruption. ... We are currently investigating the specific incident at Reginald F. Lewis High School to determine appropriate action. ... We are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness,"" the statement said. But the problem goes beyond one incident, Standish said. He told WBAL that students regularly issue ""very visceral threats"" against him. ""I just had a couple last week, and it's just everyday routine,"" he said. Standish said he has filed a grievance with the district through the teachers union. Union President Marietta English met with about 20 principals Wednesday evening to discuss teacher safety. ""We really want to implement some policies that principals can follow [so] that teachers won't be having to be afraid to come in their classrooms or come into their schools,"" she told WBAL.

"(CNN) -- Dennis Blair, the president's top intelligence adviser, announced his resignation after 16 months of power struggles, politics and personality clashes. Blair was the third person to serve as director of national intelligence since the position was created five years ago. His resignation is effective May 28. Although President Obama praised Blair for his ""remarkable record of service,"" there has been tension between the two. Blair found himself at odds with the White House over the scope of his role, and there was indirect conflict with others in the intelligence community. ""From the beginning the White House did not have the same view of what the DNI should be,"" according to a source familiar with the situation. ""[Blair] is a manager and a leader. He is not a politico. He doesn't run around doing political stuff,"" the source said, acknowledging the Blair's candor got him in trouble. Blair, a retired four-star Navy admiral, has served in the post since January 2009. His office oversees 17 federal intelligence agencies, including the CIA, FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Word of his resignation came two days after the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report that sharply criticized the National Counterterrorism Center, overseen by Blair's office, for failing to coordinate properly intelligence activities to detect the attempted Christmas Day airline bombing. The report highlighted 14 points of failure and said that the center was not organized to fulfill its mission. Blair, who also caught some of the blame for the more recent failed Times Square bombing attempt, responded to the report by noting changes made in response to the Christmas incident, including creation of a National Counterterrorism Center analytical unit dedicated to following up on terrorist threat information. However, Blair's statement noted that ""institutional and technological barriers remain that prevent seamless sharing of information."" Although Blair's resignation was not a complete surprise for those in the intelligence community, he was not expected to step down for another month, senior intelligence officials said. He decided to leave sooner than expected when Obama asked CIA Director Leon Panetta and national security adviser James Jones to go to Pakistan and Blair was not asked to participate, the sources said. ""When the president looked to Leon Panetta and Jim Jones to go to Pakistan on this very serious threat, it was a slap at him. It was an indication of a lack of confidence in Adm. Blair,"" said Fran Townsend, CNN national security contributor who was President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. One Senate source said Blair has been unhappy and frustrated. ""He was losing every turf battle to Panetta,"" the source said. Blair and Obama also didn't have a good connection, Townsend said. ""You've got a very bright, engaged president and with a lot of charisma, and there wasn't a real chemistry between them,"" she said. The DNI was intended to be the CEO of the intelligence community, looking at the 17 agencies' budgets, capabilities, training and cross-department communication. When the position was created, the DNI was given a lot of responsibility but not enough authority, Townsend said. ""It's clear in this case between Adm. Blair and President Obama there was a mismatch and misunderstanding of expectations and responsibilities. And it will be very important that whoever the new DNI is, understands and accepts what the president's view of that position is,"" she said. Even before Blair officially turned in his resignation, the White House already had spoken to potential replacements, the senior intelligence officials said. John Hamre, a defense official in the Clinton administration; retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Jim Clapper, defense undersecretary for intelligence; and former Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Nebraska, are considered top contenders. CNN's Kristi Keck, Gloria Borger and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Dennis Blair's resignation as director of national intelligence effective May 28 .

"(CNN)  -- Facing near-record floodwaters, Red River communities in Minnesota and North Dakota raced Tuesday to shore up levees and dikes, officials said. ""We're in the full flood fight mode here,"" Fargo, North Dakota, City Administrator Pat Zavoral said. Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell as it flows north. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities. Forecasters predict the river will crest Saturday about 20 feet above flood stage. Last year, the river rose to a record 40.8 feet at Fargo. ""We have every contractor we have in the area on a 24-hour shift, preparing dikes, hauling dirt, delivering sandbags,"" Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said. ""We have never lost a flood fight here in Fargo,"" he said. ""We're going to be optimistic about this for the rest of the week, that we're going to be able to save our community one more time."" Volunteers have answered the call to fill 1 million sandbags this week, Zavoral said. ""We're putting up temporary clay levees, and we've produced sandbags, and we're delivering them to the low-lying neighborhoods,"" he said. Early Tuesday, the river level stood at 27.6 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Flood stage is 18 feet, according to the service. ""We thought we had a couple more weeks, and with the weather and the quick thaw and the rains we've had recently, it's really made it more difficult and it's really sped up the crest,"" Fargo police Sgt. Carlos Nestler said. Residents in Fargo and Moorhead are busy building sandbag dikes along the river's edge. Fargo's Kurt Kaye is doing what he did last year, helping friends protect their home from the rising Red River, which runs through their backyard. Like most residents, he said he's resolved to keep the water at bay. ""I think everyone is a little tired of it, but they'll get behind it and go,"" he said. ""They need to get it done to save their houses."" Zavoral, the city administrator, said Fargo is better prepared this year to deal with a major flood. ""We've spent about $10 million putting in permanent flood protection in some of the neighborhoods and bought out about 26 homes in the low-lying areas,"" he said. City officials have said they believe they'll need about 1 million fewer sandbags than were used last year. Is severe weather happening near you? Share your stories, photos and video .

"AUGUSTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Walking into the Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor is a lot like walking into a head shop. One wall is lined with gang monikers and symbols, the other with bongs for smoking marijuana and other drugs -- one even shaped like a skull. The Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor was set up by authorities to get at the heart of gang members. Only this head shop was a setup. It was a police front in a sting operation to bust gangs in this Georgia river city that most people associate with the Masters Tournament -- not violent thugs with high-powered weapons. Authorities said some guns sold to the shop were used in crimes just hours earlier. The tattoo parlor was the brainchild of Richmond County Sheriff Ron Strength, who wanted to snuff out gangs carrying out violent crimes in his east Georgia community. The idea was to create a place where the gang members would feel right at home, said sheriff's Lt. Scott Peebles. And that they did. ""We put the idea in their heads that there's no way these guys are in law enforcement,"" he said. On Wednesday, more than 100 sheriff's officers, state investigators and agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives carried out a major bust after an 18-month joint investigation into the gang activity.  Watch cops set up tattoo parlor » . Sixty-eight suspects were arrested on charges ranging from trafficking of illegal weapons to serious drug offenses. Authorities seized more than 300 weapons, including high-powered assault rifles. Rich Marianos, a special agent with the ATF, said such gang activity is spreading across the nation, with small-town gangs increasing their ties with gangs in major cities. For instance, New York gangs have begun moving as far south as the Carolinas, where they set up operations to buy and sell guns and drugs, he said. Chicago gang activity extends more than 60 miles into the Illinois city's suburbs for narcotics and weapons trading. In fact, Marianos said the ATF has begun seeing some Chicago gangs establishing a ""pipeline"" for illegal arms more than 500 miles away in Mississippi. ""It's not just an urban problem,"" Marianos said. ""We're seeing it all over the country."" The ATF, he said, has seen one of the most dramatic increases in gang activity in the last three years and is cracking down. ""We want to look at a way to go after these offenders and prevent it before it happens,"" he said. ""[We're] making the community safer by disarming the bad guys -- not taking guns away from the American citizen, but going after the people who shouldn't have them in the first place."" That's why setting up a tattoo parlor in Augusta was key. Strength, the Richmond County sheriff, said he remembers when the worst crimes in these parts were lawn mower thefts and vandals pushing over birdbaths. But those days are long gone, with gangs such as the Georgia Deadly Boys and Fairington Gangster Thugs causing mayhem on a regular basis. ""In the past 2 1/2 years, we've noticed some major changes,"" he said, ""with the type of criminal offenses they were involved in."" So he devised the undercover business. The Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor on Tobacco Road was set up on the outskirts of Augusta. It's a location not heavily patrolled by police, but staffed 100 percent by undercover agents. Business was slow at first, but then things took off. Gang members soon began dropping in to sell guns, drugs and even stolen cars, authorities said. Every transaction was recorded by surveillance cameras around the store. Soon the shop had so much business the Richmond County Sheriff's Office had to call in reinforcements from the ATF. Four federal agents helped the sheriff's deputies man the counters; others worked behind the scenes. Vanessa McLemore, ATF special agent in charge, said the teams had to coordinate their behaviors so it seemed like they fit in the store. ""They spent a lot of time together learning each other's mannerisms, learning each other's body language. It had to be a brotherhood,"" she said. On the store counter was a jar of colored markers to invite clients to write their favorite gang affiliation on the wall. Peebles said agents used the wall for intelligence. ""At the very least we got names,"" he said. The shop even put up its' own MySpace page. ""You think it, we ink it"" was the MySpace slogan. It featured the back of a tattooed man, and below in large red letters agents told visitors to the site, ""We buy what others won't."" Authorities said the guns came rolling in, and then came this week's bust. ""Today marks the end of one era and the beginning of another,"" McLemore said. ""The era that is ending is one that has brought destruction and decay to the streets of Augusta."" E-mail to a friend .","Tattoo parlor run by cops leads to major bust of Georgia gangs .

"(CNN)  -- She's been called Italy's answer to Michael Moore, and she doesn't pull any punches -- even when the subject she's taking to task is Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi. Filmmaker Sabina Guzzanti puts the prime minister's handling of the L'Aquila earthquake, which killed nearly 300 people and devastated the city when it struck last year, under deep scrutiny in her latest documentary ""Draquila -- Italy Trembles."" Recently screened at Cannes Film Festival, the documentary is creating a stir among critics and the Italian government alike. Even though he has been dogged by allegations of corruption and fraud --  which he strongly denies -- as well as criticism of his personal lifestyle, many Italians still support Berlusconi. There are so many scandals in Italy, the picture can get quite complicated, Guzzanti told CNN. At home, she is a well-known political satirist and critic of the government. She decided to focus on one disaster, L'Aquila, to show how abuse of power, corruption and misinformation have contributed to what she presents as the precarious state of democracy in Italy today. ""The idea was this: Explain Italy through L'Aquila,"" she told CNN. The Italian government has responded angrily to the film, whose title is a combination of the words ""Dracula"" and ""L'Aquila."" Culture Minister Sandro Bondi refused to attend Cannes, where the film was shown as part of the festival's special screening program. Bondi issued a statement, dismissing the documentary as ""propaganda"" and saying it ""offends the truth and all of the Italian people."" Guzzanti is used to incurring the government's displeasure. ""Raiot,"" a political satire TV show she wrote, directed and acted in, was cancelled after just one episode on a state-owned television network following a defamation suit filed by Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset TV network. In a retort, she made ""Viva Zapatero,"" a 2005 film that examines censorship. So, what is it about ""Draquila,"" Guzzanti's fourth feature, that has created an uproar among Berlusconi supporters? Guzzanti argues that Berlusconi, whose ratings were suffering when the earthquake hit in April last year, took advantage of the tragic event to improve his image and boost the public's opinion of him. The documentary uses straightforward language to paint a stark picture of what the filmmaker sees as Berlusconi's exploitation of the tragic event. ""Opinion polls showed his popularity was plummeting. So, when, at 0332 on April 6, 2009, an earthquake awoke even those in the Big Brother house, and when it emerged an entire town was destroyed, for Berlusconi it was like God reaching out to him again,"" a voiceover says in the film. Watch a clip of the film . In the wake of the quake, Berlusconi made a last-minute decision to move the G8 Summit to L'Aquila from Sardinia -- a gesture that attracted world attention -- and took advantage of photo opportunities in several trips to the leveled city. Even more damning, though, is the documentary's examination of the reconstruction efforts in L'Aquila. In particular, the film takes issue with the role played by the Civil Protection Authority. The film argues that the government agency has amassed such immense power under Berlusconi that it can dodge the law -- when granting reconstruction contracts, for instance -- all in the name of emergency and safety. For Guzzanti, investigating the aftermath of the earthquake and the power of the Civil Protection Authority is a way of examining Italy's drift into authoritarianism. ""They became like a private army of the prime minister with licence of spending money and making laws,"" she said of the agency. ""And I was shocked and started to investigate."" Her film has won praise, not only for its high degree of scrutiny, but for its even-handedness as well. The Hollywood Reporter described ""Draquila"" as a ""straightforward and surprisingly balanced documentary."" While her probing style and knack for ruffling feathers make it easy to draw comparisons with Michael Moore, Guzzanti distinguishes herself with an ability to control her outrage. As Variety pointed out in its review: ""While she's omnipresent, this is not the Sabina Guzzanti show; the helmer knows she doesn't need to constantly register her outrage for it to come across."" Grace Wong and CNN's Neil Curry contributed to this report.","Documentary screened at Cannes takes aim at Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi .

"YANGON, Myanmar (CNN) -- Courts in Myanmar have sentenced a blogger, a poet and several dissidents to several years in jail for anti-regime activities, a court official told CNN Tuesday. Young people at an Internet cafe in Myanmar. The verdicts were announced Monday and Tuesday, the court official said. Blogger Nay Phone Latt was sentenced to more than 20 years in jail for his illegal Internet activities, the court official said. The blogger was a ""major source of information for the outside world"" when the military junta used force last year to suppress anti-government demonstrations, said The Irrawaddy, an online newspaper published by exiles from Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. The government exercises strict controls over media outlets in the southeast Asian country. Dissidents often turn to the Internet to disseminate information. In the second case, poet Saw Wai received a two-year jail sentence for a poem he wrote for Valentine's Day that contained a veiled jab at the junta's leading figure, Senior Gen. Than Shwe. The first words of each line in the eight-line poem, ""February the Fourteenth"" spelled out the message: ""Senior General Than Shwe is crazy with power."" On Tuesday, the government handed down prison sentences to about a dozen members of a pro-democracy group known as the '88 Generation Students. Irrawaddy said the members were each sentenced to 65 years in jail, but CNN could not independently confirm the figure. Members of the group took part in the anti-government demonstrations that ended with the death of as many as 100 people last year after security forces clashed with thousands of protesters. The dead included 40 Buddhist monks. Witnesses said the violent crackdown in September 2007 came as hundreds of monks defied a military ban on public assembly. Until then, demonstrations led by the monks -- who are highly respected in the predominantly Buddhist country -- had gone largely unchallenged by the military, which has ruled the country since the 1960s. The protests were sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government, and quickly escalated. The action was informally dubbed the ""Saffron Revolution"" because of the maroon robes with saffron sashes that the monks wore.","Myanmar court jails blogger, poet and dissidents for anti-regime activities ."
"London, England (CNN) -- Britain said Thursday it expects Iceland to live up to its obligations, two days after Iceland's president refused to sign a bill that would pay back billions of dollars Iceland owes the country. Britain spent 2.3 billion pounds ($3.69 billion) last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed. Under a European Union directive, Iceland owes compensation to Britain. Iceland's parliament passed a bill last week authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds, but President Olafur Ragnar Grimmson refused to sign it Tuesday. It means there will now be a public referendum on whether to approve the bill. It also puts into question whether Britain can get repaid. ""We expect Iceland to live up to its obligations,"" said a British Treasury spokesman, who was not authorized to give his name. ""We support them in finding a way to do that."" Similar comments came from Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos, whose government spent 1.3 billion euros ($1.87 billion) to cover bank losses in the country. Despite his refusal to sign the bill, Grimmson told CNN Wednesday that Iceland will not shirk its duty to repay the money. ""Iceland recognizes its obligations under this agreement,"" he said. Resolving the issue, he added, ""is a key to our recovery and our harmonious relations with these countries."" Grimmson acknowledged that the referendum puts repayment in doubt, though he said at the very least, Icelandic opinion polls show the vote will be ""very close."" He did not explain how Iceland would repay the money if voters reject the bill. Britain and the Netherlands said it was too early to speculate on what might happen if voters in Iceland vote no, but both Bos and the British Treasury spokesman said it would have negative consequences internationally for the small Atlantic nation. ""If the referendum goes against us, then I think Iceland will have a big problem because they will have shown themselves to be very unreliable partners in the international financial scene,"" Bos told CNN. Bos said non-repayment of the funds would affect ""the long-term interest of the Iceland economy and the Iceland people."" In a statement Tuesday, Grimmson said the reason he refused to sign the bill was so it would go to a referendum, which is required by law in such a case. He said he received a petition over the weekend, signed by a quarter of the electorate, urging the decision be put to a public vote. ""It is the cornerstone of the constitutional structure of the Republic of Iceland that the people are the supreme judge of the validity of the law,"" Grimmson said in the statement. The law passed by Iceland's parliament would compensate Britain and the Netherlands by 2024. The International Monetary Fund approved a loan of $2.1 billion to Iceland in November, making repayment of the British and Dutch funds a requirement. It is unclear how the IMF loan would be affected if Icelandic voters were to reject the repayment bill.","UK spent $3.69 billion last year to cover British savers' losses when Icelandic banks collapsed .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's prime minister acknowledged on Sunday he did not expect protesters would use weapons and apply violence toward authority. Speaking on national television, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva made the admission a day after he rejected a call from anti-government protesters to dissolve the country's parliament in 30 days. Abhisit said other groups' political opinions must be taken into consideration before any such action is taken. More than two dozen civilians and military personnel have died since protesters began occupying key tourism and shopping areas in Thailand's capital. The demand from the anti-government protesters, known as the ""Red Shirts,"" was the latest in a long list issued since the group stormed parliament in early April and Abhisit declared a state of emergency. Red Shirt leaders offered Friday to return to the negotiating table -- but only if the government meets certain demands, including lifting a state of emergency and accepting responsibility for the deaths of protesters earlier this month, said Weng Tojirakarn, a co-leader of the group. iReport: Are you there? Share your story, images . On the government's side, spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn told CNN Saturday that there was no counter-proposal to get the negotiations back on track. ""We need to make sure negotiations take place under a conducive environment,"" Panitan said, explaining that previous attempts to talk to opposition leaders had been derailed due to threats against government officials. Other conditions that must be met before any negotiations could take place include having protest leaders make sure there will be no further expansion of demonstrations into other districts and no threats to government officers, the government spokesman said. ""These conditions are very critical for peaceful negotiations,"" Panitan explained. ""Negotiation is the only way out in the end, but... we need to stabilize the situation first."" He cited the fact that several demonstrations were taking place ""by different 'shirts' and colors,"" and said that all demonstrators must observe the rule of law and ""peace and civility will be restored first."" His remarks came as tension remained high on the streets of Bangkok, where a political standoff has gripped the country for several weeks. The Red Shirts have been clashing with the Thai military in a Bangkok area that serves as a financial hub. Another co-leader of the Red Shirts, Veera Muskapong, met with foreign diplomats Friday and told them he might meet with the government if it meets certain conditions. Abhisit, meanwhile, huddled with the chiefs of the country's armed forces early Friday after a string of grenade attacks killed at least one person and wounded dozens of others. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said in a televised address that the grenades were launched from the area where the Red Shirts have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks. Watch red shirt protests . Suthep told Thai television earlier that three people died in the attacks, but Bangkok's Erawan Emergency and Rescue Center later revised the number to one. At least 87 people were wounded, the center said. Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, spokesman for the Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES), said at his daily news conference Saturday that the protests remain manageable at this time and therefore, authorities would not try to disperse the demonstrations. He did charge, however, that ""terrorists"" were interspersed among ""innocent demonstrators."" The official said authorities would suppress the terrorists at the appropriate time, but did not want to complicate the situation by trying to take action against them now. Sansern also dismissed rumors of discord between the government, police and military forces, saying that representatives of all those entities were meeting daily to discuss the situation. Explainer: What are the protests in Thailand about? The Thai Department of Special Investigation warned Friday that those responsible for the grenade attacks could face the death penalty, the MCOT news agency reported. The attacks prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a travel alert advising American citizens of the escalating violence in Bangkok. Suthep said riot police and helicopters were deployed to join Thai troops in the affected area, which was still littered with glass amid the standoff. Across the barricades, the Red Shirts were playing music and trying to encourage a festive atmosphere. Demonstrators told CNN late Thursday they wanted to drive home the point that their rallies are supposed to be peaceful. Thrown into the volatile mix are a group of protesters who called themselves the Multicolored Shirts, made up of mainly middle-class city dwellers, who took to the streets in large numbers Friday. They are not pro- or anti-government, but simply want the government to shut down the Reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life. Some fear that the emergence of such groups could spark a civil war. ""I am so afraid that people will do the wrong thing and think they are brave and fight and they all have arms and that is what I am afraid (of),"" said resident Josh Orajan. He said the Thai are all one people and this shouldn't be happening. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. They want Abhisit to dissolve the government, hold new elections and leave the country.

"(CNN)  -- At least 1 million people marked the passing of another year at the iconic ball drop in New York's Times Square, despite an early morning dusting of snow and late-night freezing rain. With the help of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and students from 12 city high schools, the dazzling crystal ball began its descent Thursday at 11:59 p.m. ET. Revelers counted down the final seconds of the decade. The New Year got under way with blasting horns and fireworks shot from the Sky Tower as revelers partied Friday morning in Auckland, New Zealand. Similar celebrations were moving like a wave from east to west as midnight struck across the globe, starting at the International Date Line in the mid-Pacific Ocean. Throngs danced to pounding rock 'n' roll music and cheered a spectacular 12-minute fireworks display over the picturesque Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia. A giant bell rang before a huge crowd in Seoul, South Korea. Crowds across Europe braved near-freezing temperatures to ring in 2010. In London, England, people gathered along the banks of the River Thames to hear Big Ben strike midnight and watch a fireworks display at the London Eye. A multicolored light show at The Eiffel Tower dazzled crowds in Paris, France. In New York, security was tight for Thursday night's iconic ball drop. After the Christmas Day attempt to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane over Detroit, Michigan, security forces are on high alert. ""We want people to have a happy experience. But we are also concerned about a terrorist event. We have to do that after 9/11,"" New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Celebrating? Share your photos and videos . New York police estimated a million people had already filled the square by early Thursday evening. Weighing 11,875 pounds, the sparkling sphere features 2,668 crystals woven into a triangular pattern and is powered by 32,256 LED lights. It is capable of producing a kaleidoscopic array of 16 million vibrant colors and billions of patterns, according to the event's official Web site. This New Year's ball is also be greener, consuming 10 to 20 percent less energy than last year's ball and 78 percent less energy than the 2007 ball. It uses the equivalent amount of energy per hour as two traditional home ovens. The 2010 numerals are also more energy efficient, as Duracell Batteries set up a lab in which visitors ride stationary bikes to provide the power to light the numbers on the ball. Key stories in 2009: You rank them . Times Square has served as one of the most popular sites of New Year's festivities since 1904, though the New Year's Eve ball made its inaugural drop down the flagpole at One Times Square in 1907. That first ball, built with iron and wood, featured a hundred 25-watt light bulbs and was designed by Jacob Starr, a young immigrant metalworker. The New Year's Eve ball has beamed every year since with the exceptions of 1942 and 1943, when America was embroiled in World War II and New York City observed a city-wide ""dimout"" to cut energy costs. As in previous years, security is tight. Police are searching garages and subway tunnels for bombs, trash cans are being removed, and mailboxes and manhole covers are being sealed. Detectives were asking hotel and restaurant personnel if they had noticed any suspicious people or activity. See images from Times Square . Law enforcement officials have a number of tools at their disposal to help combat potential crime and terrorism, including sniper teams, bomb-sniffing dogs, infrared radar-equipped helicopters, and radiation detectors on New York's waterways, Kelly said. In the years before terrorism was a concern inside the United States, the Times Square celebration was a rowdy affair, fueled by copious amounts of alcohol, often transported via backpack. Today, alcohol and backpacks are banned from the area on New Year's Eve, and revelers are herded into 2,500-person pens, but the mood is festive nonetheless. New Yorker Julio Ortiz-Teissonniere, a CNN iReporter, said he's too jaded to take part in the spectacle, but that wasn't always the case. ""When the ball drops, it's like an earthquake,"" he said. ""The amount of people screaming and stomping -- it's amazing."" According to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne, revelers can expect Times Square to be ""the most heavily guarded piece of real estate in the world"" Thursday night. Both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers were patrolling the crowds, keeping an eye out for pick pockets and revelers who might have had too much to drink. Plain-clothes officers would pinpoint any troublemakers, allowing uniformed officers to arrest and remove them from the crowd, Browne said. Snipers were perched on rooftops, bomb sniffing canine units patrolled the crowds and counter-terrorist intelligence forces were on hand, equipped with radiation detectors. Cars were restricted from driving through the area, and several barriers along with police officers blocked cars in-place throughout the area. The FAA has put an air restriction in place over New York City for the celebration; however police helicopters as well as helicopters from the news media will be allowed to fly overhead and monitor the crowds. A security scare at Times Square Wednesday involving a suspicious white van halted traffic and forced the evacuation of several nearby buildings, including the Nasdaq Stock Exchange's MarketSite. Though a false alarm, the scare highlighted the sense of alert in the area at this time of year. ""We know any time in our post-9/11 world when large numbers of people get together, we've got to do certain things -- we have to do extra things that weren't done in the past,"" Kelly said. People began securing standing space as early at 6 a.m. Thursday morning in Times Square and snow began to blanket the city shortly after 8 a.m. Weather forecasters expect New York CIty to receive a steady mix of snow and rain throughout Thursday evening and Friday morning. ""Tourists come in and see it as part of the New York experience and indeed it is. It is sort of the total package,"" he said. ""When the ball drops, you get a feeling of relief that you made it through another year."" CNN's Allan Chernoff, Jim Kavanagh, Jesse Solomon, Jamie Guzzardo and Katie Hawkins-Gaar contributed to this report.","In Times Square, huge crowds welcomes 2010 with famous ball drop .

"Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Gulf Coast states have seen drops in tourism linked to the BP oil spill in the Gulf, though it has not caused any beaches to close, tourism officials told CNN Wednesday. More worrisome than the people who call to cancel are those who don't call to book their trip in the first place, said Kathy Torian, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida, the state's tourism bureau. Hoteliers have a shot at dissuading worried would-be vacationers who call to cancel, she said. But they are unable to have any effect on those who opt not to book travel to the state in the first place, she said. The stakes are high. Tourism in Florida is a $65 billion industry that employs more than a million people, Rep. Corinne Brown, D-Florida, told the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on Wednesday. Complete coverage of Gulf Coast oil spill . ""And so we are devastated,"" she said. ""People are canceling. They're not coming to the hotels. They're canceling, not coming to Florida. So we're in lock-down devastation."" Florida has $2.5 million in its coffers for use in advertising and is making plans to use the $25 million promised this week by BP, Torian said. Louisiana's coastal area, known more for sport fishing than for beachgoing, is also suffering. Gov. Bobby Jindal toured part of Louisiana's vast coastal marsh Wednesday and found thick, oily sludge encroaching on the fragile ecosystem. ""We saw some heavy oil stranded in the wetlands. The oil is no longer just a projection or miles from our shore. The oil is here. It is on our shores and in our marsh,"" Jindal said at a news conference after the airboat tour in Plaquemines Parish. According to NOAA, about 35 miles of Louisiana shoreline has been affected by oil. The annual Seafood Festival in the town of Jean Lafitte the last weekend in July has been canceled so resources can be concentrated on the oil, CNN affiliate WWLTV reported. On Grand Isle, the annual Tarpon Rodeo is still on for July, but could be called off, local officials told WWLTV. Several other fishing rodeos have been canceled. The good news is that the state on Wednesday reopened three oyster beds and parts of two others that have not been affected by the oil, the station reported. The Louisiana Office of Tourism website assures visitors and potential visitors that there is no need to change travel plans, as the spill risk lies mostly east of the mouth of the Mississippi River and 75 percent of coastal fishing waters are west of there. BP promised $15 million apiece to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to help the states attract visitors. Alabama tourism spokeswoman Edith Parten said her state has seen a small number of cancellations, but it has launched a $1.5 million ad campaign that it plans to supplement with BP's money. ""I think we are getting word out with the tourism campaign,"" she said. In Mississippi, about half of the people who had made vacation plans along the state's coast before the April 20 spill have canceled them, said Ken Montana, president of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Tourism Commission. And it gets worse, he said. ""What's happening is we are not getting the phone calls to book,"" he said. ""It's almost come to an 80 percent reduction in calls for future bookings."" The tourism commission has spent $600,000 of its own money for an advertising campaign set to begin Monday ""to let people know we are open,"" he said. He predicted the state would begin using money from BP -- which he credited for moving quickly -- starting next week. But he bemoaned the image that the disaster has conjured among many. ""The perception is that everybody has oil on the beach and we are all closed up,"" he said. ""No beaches are closed, period."" All the state waters are open and open to all activities, he stressed. For some, the ripple effects of the spill have yet to hit shore. Bob Mahoney, owner of Mary Mahoney's Old French House in Biloxi, Mississippi, said business at his seafood restaurant located 150 yards from the high-tide mark is pretty good. ""The truth of the matter is it hasn't affected me yet,"" he said. ""I don't think it has."" But he has already seen the price for shrimp shoot up from $4.75 per pound last year to $6.75. At about 500 pounds per week, that adds up, he said. And, the 63-year-old restaurateur said, ""If the stuff starts starts hitting our beaches, I'm sure we'll be affected."" Whatever happens, though, he vowed to stay put. ""I ain't leaving Biloxi,"" said Mahoney, whose mother in 1964 founded the restaurant, which has survived other challenges. After Hurricane Katrina filled it with eight feet of water in 2005, he and other relatives rebuilt it in 55 days, he said. Asked Wednesday in the congressional hearing how he planned to address the long-term issue of the psychological impact on the area -- the fact that people might not visit the Gulf Coast or eat its seafood because they fear contamination -- Lamar McKay, president and chairman of BP America, was stumped. In testimony to the House committee, he told Rep. Anh ""Joseph"" Cao, R-Louisiana, ""I don't have a specific answer for that, but I do want to let you know that our intent is to stand behind what we're saying, and it doesn't end when the cleanup ends.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama pledged Monday to make good on his promise to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs and said he would ""dramatically improve"" mental health aid. President Obama and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, seen here last month, vow to increase aid.

"(The Frisky) -- Sunday is the series finale of ""Lost."" For the past six seasons of ""Lost,"" every single episode has brought us at least one new oddity to ponder. And yet, as frequently as questions are posed, it's not that often a question is actually answered. This is why the love the show, but also what makes it such an ever-evolving mind bender. Now we are down to the final episode. It's a long one -- two and a half hours to be exact -- but it has all us fans wondering, how the heck are they going to tie up all the loose ends? Sadly, they won't. Today, producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse announced that because they felt they didn't have enough time to finish all the story lines, the season six DVD will contain 20 extra minutes. But, um, we don't want to wait until August or have to drop $50 to know everything! So, guys, here are 10 questions we need the answers to on Sunday. Mmm-k? The Frisky: 11 most romantic (and hawt) ""Lost"" clips . 1. What the heck is the island? So many different theories have been presented by different characters this season. Is the island a cork on a wine bottle of evil that keeps the darkness from spilling out into the regular world, as suggested by Jacob? Is the island hell and everyone on it is dead, as Isabella told Ricardo? Or is it a hiding place for the world's life source, as Jacob and the Man in Black's mother proposed? Or is it something else entirely? 2. What's up with that white light? Jacob has been tasked with guarding the white light for forever, and in this week's episode, Jack volunteered to take over the job -- which makes sense, as Jacob tells him that the light is near the bamboo field where he awoke in the show's first seconds. But, uh, what is the light exactly? And whom does it need to be protected from? The Frisky: The 5 most kick-butt scenes in ""Lost"" 3. Why are the characters' lives in the ""sideways"" universe different from what they were before the crash? All season, we've been getting flashes to an alternate reality where flight 815 never crashes and lands safely in Los Angeles. Some of the characters' lives match up with what we've seen in flashbacks to their lives before the crash. But most are way different -- for example, Jack has a son, Locke has a loving fiancé, and Desmond appears to be a bad guy (maybe?) pulling strings and making puppets dance. Why? 4. Speaking of, what is Desmond's function in all this? Last episode, we found out that Desmond is a ""fail safe."" And we've known for a while now that, somehow, he survived the electromagnetic explosion of the hatch. Is Desmond super-powered? Because of the explosion, or has the island always been his destiny too? How will he play into whatever is coming? The Frisky: 8 things I will NOT miss about ""Lost"" going away . 5. What about the polar bears? In the series pilot, Sawyer shoots and kills a polar bear. We know that the Dharma Initiative kept them in the cages -- but did they bring them? Or were they already there? 6. Why can't women have babies on the island? Another question that goes seasons back with no explanation. Why was Claire able to give birth to Aaron and Jacob and the Man in Black's mother able to give birth to them -- but all other women on the island are unable to have babies? 7.

"(CNN) -- President Obama told West Point graduates that the United States faces ""difficult days ahead"" in its fight against insurgents in Afghanistan and said that the threat posed by al Qaeda operatives across the globe ""will not go away soon."" Speaking at the U.S. Military Academy commencement in New York, Obama praised the graduates for their achievements and laid out a scenario of military and societal challenges in what is the ninth West Point commencement during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fight against international terrorism. ""This time of war began in Afghanistan, a place that may seem as far from this peaceful bend in the Hudson River as anywhere on Earth,"" Obama said, referring to a conflict that started after the al Qaeda terror network attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. ""The war began only because our own cities and civilians were attacked by violent extremists who plotted from that distant place, and it continues only because that plotting persists to this day."" While the United States and its allies battled in Afghanistan, the U.S. military launched an invasion of Iraq in 2003, toppling the Saddam Hussein regime and battling insurgents for years until that war began to wind down in the last couple of years. But the Afghan conflict persists as the United States and its allies battle tenacious militants from the Taliban militant movement. Obama said as the Iraq war ends, America is ""pressing forward in Afghanistan"" and faces a ""tough fight"" against a nimble insurgency. ""From Marja to Kandahar, that is what the Taliban has done through assassination, indiscriminate killing and intimidation,"" Obama said, referring to the main militant and two southern Afghan battlegrounds. ""And any country that has known decades of war will be tested in finding political solutions to its problems, and providing governance that can sustain progress and serve the needs of its people. "" Obama said that even though the nature of the war has changed in the past nine years, it remains just as important as it was after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. He said the United States has helped bring hope and sovereign government to Afghanistan, but ""there will be difficult days ahead."" ""We toppled the Taliban regime; now we must break the momentum of a Taliban insurgency and train Afghan security forces,"" he said. ""We will adapt, we will persist, and I have no doubt that together with our Afghan and international partners, we will succeed in Afghanistan."" As for al Qaeda's activities, Obama defended the ""campaign to disrupt, dismantle and to defeat al Qaeda,"" saying it's an ""international effort that is necessary and just."" While he said there has been ""more success in eliminating al Qaeda leaders in recent months than in recent years,"" the group will continue its recruitment efforts. ""We see that in bombs that go off in Kabul and Karachi. We see it in attempts to blow up an airliner over Detroit or an SUV in Times Square, even as these failed attacks show that pressure on networks like al Qaeda is forcing them to rely on terrorists with less time and space to train,"" he said. ""We see it in al Qaeda's gross distortion of Islam, their disrespect for human life, and their attempts to prey upon fear and hatred and prejudice."" Obama dismissed al Qaeda and its affiliates as ""small men on the wrong side of history,"" but acknowledged that the threat they pose ""will not go away soon."" ""This is a different kind of war,"" he said. ""There will be no simple moment of surrender to mark the journey's end. No armistice or banner headline."" The president said America's ""strength and resilience"" will counter people attempting to sow fear. ""Terrorists want to scare us,"" he said, but ""New Yorkers go about their lives unafraid. Extremists want a war between America and Islam, but Muslims are a part of our national life, including those who serve in our Army. Adversaries want to divide us, but we are united by our support for you -- soldiers who send a clear message that this country is both the land of the free and the home of the brave."" Obama made reference to West Point's diversity, pointing out that women in uniform are playing ""indispensable role in our national defense."" They include West Point's No. 1 overall cadet and valedictorian, Liz Betterbed and Alex Rosenberg. Obama noted it was the first time the academy's two top awards were earned by female cadets. ""America's Army represents the full breadth of the American experience,"" with cadets hailing from all walks of life, Obama said. The president noted that one thing that sets the cadets apart is that they ""have come together to prepare for the most difficult tests of our time"" and know they are being sent into ""harm's way."" ""And through a period when too many of our institutions have acted irresponsibly, the American military has set a standard of service and sacrifice that is as great as any in this nation's history,"" he said. Obama also stressed that economic and technological innovation ""must be a foundation of American power"" and that the efforts of America's armed forces must be complemented by effective diplomacy, world development and security. ""We need intelligence agencies that work seamlessly with their counterparts to unravel plots that run from the mountains of Pakistan to the streets of our cities; law enforcement that can strengthen judicial systems abroad and protect us at home; and first responders who can act swiftly in the event of earthquakes, storms and disease. "" Obama said the world's burdens cannot just be America's, and alliances that has served the United States well must be maintained, strengthened and widened. ""The international order we seek is one that can resolve the challenges of our times -- countering violent extremism and insurgency; stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and securing nuclear materials; combating a changing climate and sustaining global growth; helping countries feed themselves and care for their sick; preventing conflict and healing its wounds.""","President Obama speaks at West Point's ninth wartime commencement .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi officials Monday condemned the weekend killings of eight civilians during a Baghdad street battle involving American security contractors and said they would shut down Blackwater, the company involved. A Blackwater helicopter hovers over Baghdad in July 2005. Blackwater said its employees acted in self-defense. The U.S. State Department said it plans to investigate what it calls a ""terrible incident."" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to express regret for the weekend killings, both governments said. In addition to the fatalities, 14 people were wounded, most of them civilians, an Iraqi official said. Sunday's firefight took place near Nusoor Square, an area that straddles the predominantly Sunni Arab neighborhoods of Mansour and Yarmouk. The ministry said the incident began around midday, when a convoy of sport utility vehicles came under fire from unidentified gunmen in the square. The men in the SUVs, described by witnesses as Westerners, returned fire, the ministry said. Blackwater's employees were protecting a U.S. official when they were hit by ""a large explosive device, then repeated small-arms fire -- and to the point where it disabled one of the vehicles, and the vehicle had to be towed out of the firefight,"" said Marty Strong, vice president of Blackwater USA. A senior industry source said Blackwater guards had escorted a State Department group to a meeting with U.S. Agency for International Development officials in Mansour before the shootings. A car bomb went off about 80 feet (25 meters) from the meeting site and the contractors started evacuating the State Department officials, he said. A State Department report on the attack said the convoy came under fire from an estimated eight to 10 people, some in Iraqi police uniforms. The guards called for backup, at one point finding their escape route blocked by an Iraqi quick-reaction force that pointed heavy machine guns at one vehicle in the convoy. A U.S. Army force, backed by air cover, arrived about half an hour later to escort the convoy back to the Green Zone, the report states. A team from another security company passed through the area shortly after the street battle. ""Our people saw a couple of cars destroyed,"" Carter Andress, CEO of American-Iraqi Solutions Groups, told CNN on Monday. ""Dead bodies, wounded people being evacuated. The U.S. military had moved in and secured the area.  It was not a good scene."" An Interior Ministry spokesman, Brig. Gen. Abdul Kareem Khalaf, said, ""We have revoked Blackwater's license to operate in Iraq. As of now they are not allowed to operate anywhere in the Republic of Iraq. The investigation is ongoing, and all those responsible for Sunday's killing will be referred to Iraqi justice.""  Watch why the Interior Ministry revoked Blackwater's license » . Company and State Department officials said they had not been notified of any order to that effect. Rice and al-Maliki agreed to conduct ""a fair and transparent investigation into this incident"" and punish those responsible, the prime minister's office said. The Diplomatic Security Service has launched an official investigation, a review that will be supported by the Multi-National Forces-Iraq, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. ""The secretary wants to make sure we do everything we possibly can to avoid innocent loss of life,"" he said. McCormack said that while the United States tries to avoid innocent casualties, ""we are fighting people who don't play by any rules"" and have no problem killing innocent civilians. The weekend's incident raised concerns in the U.S. Congress about the use of private security guards. Rep. Henry Waxman, whose House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held hearings on contractor operations in February, said he will hold new hearings into the issue in light of Sunday's shootings. ""The controversy over Blackwater is an unfortunate demonstration of the perils of excessive reliance on private security contractors,"" said Waxman, D-California. Blackwater, founded in 1997 and based in Moyock, North Carolina, is one of many security firms contracted by the U.S. government during the Iraq war. An estimated 25,000 employees of private security firms are working in Iraq, guarding diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials. As many as 200 are believed to have been killed on the job, according to U.S. congressional reports. Some Blackwater personnel died in a grisly attack in Iraq more than three years ago that sparked shock and outrage in the United States. Four Americans working as private security personnel for Blackwater, all of whom were military veterans, were ambushed, killed and mutilated in March 2004 in Falluja, west of Baghdad. People close to the company estimate it has lost about 30 employees during the war. Iraqi authorities have issued previous complaints about shootings by private military contractors, the Congressional Research Service reported in July. ""Most recently, a news article discussing an incident in which a Blackwater guard shot dead an Iraqi driver in May 2007 quoted an Iraqi official's statement that the Iraqi Interior Ministry had received four previous complaints of shootings involving Blackwater employees,"" the congressional service report said. The Congressional Research Service report cited other concerns, such as ""the apparent lack of a practical means to hold contractors accountable under U.S. law for abuses and other transgressions and the possibility that they could be prosecuted by foreign courts."" The reported added, ""Iraqi courts do not have jurisdiction to prosecute contractors without the permission of the relevant member country of the Multi-National Forces in Iraq."" Contractors fall under Justice Department and FBI jurisdiction for alleged crimes, said a Pentagon official, who confirmed the accuracy of the congressional report. Other developments .

"(CNN) -- BP plans to continue using a controversial subsea dispersant to break up a plume of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, saying that the leading alternative could pose a risk over the long term, the EPA indicated Saturday. The EPA issued a directive on Thursday, ordering BP to find, within 24 hours, a less toxic but equally effective chemical than its current product, Corexit 9500 -- and one that is available in sufficient quantities. The directive also gave the company 72 hours to stop applying it to the undersea gusher. Corexit has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday. The EPA released BP's response to the mandate on Saturday. The response, which BP submitted late Thursday night, said that the oil company identified the only other effective, less toxic alternative available in mass quantities as Sea Brat 4. However, BP said the Sea Brat product ""contains a small amount of a chemical that may degrade to a nonylphenol."" Nonylphenol is an organic chemical that is toxic to aquatic life and may persist in the environment for years. Corexit, however, ""does not contain chemicals that degrade into NP [and] the manufacturer indicates that Corexit reaches its maximum biodegradeablility within 28 days of application"" and does not persist in the environment, BP's response said. ""Based on the information that is available today, BP continues to believe that Corexit was the best and most appropriate choice at the time when the incident occurred, and that Corexit remains the best option for subsea application,"" BP said. Despite the continuing use of Corexit, BP is not in violation of the EPA directive, which said that should the company not be able to identify alternative products, ""BP shall provide ... a detailed description of the products investigated [and] the reason the products did not meet the standards"" required by the agency. ""We will continue to review and discuss the science through the end of the 72-hour window on Sunday, and then we will reach a decision,"" an EPA spokesman said Saturday. John Sheffield, president of Alabaster Corp., which manufactures Sea Brat, took issue with BP's response, saying Saturday that the company is ""nitpicking my product because they want to use what they've always used."" Sheffield told CNN that he discussed the nonylphenol issue with EPA officials earlier this week, saying the chemical makes up less than 1 percent of the Sea Brat dispersant. ""I've already diffused this issue with the EPA,"" he said, adding the agency ""accepted that response days ago."" The EPA has not yet publicly issued a formal response to BP's letter. EPA officials met with BP executives on Friday to discuss the issue and to explore alternatives. The EPA said Saturday that it ""will continue to work over the next 48 hours to ensure BP is complying with the directive,"" but did not respond to requests for additional comment. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will lead a bipartisan Senate delegation to inspect the Louisiana coastline after globs of thick, heavy oil began washing into some of the state's marshlands this week. The delegation will meet with federal officials and BP representatives to discuss the ongoing response efforts. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","EPA says it ""will continue to work over the next 48 hours to ensure BP is complying""

"(CNN) -- While most Americans continue to get fatter, Coloradans stand out as being among the fittest in the country, the Trust for America's Health says. Exercise and good nutrition are part of the Colorado public consciouness, says one former official. The state ranked 51st in obesity, with 17.6 percent of its 4.3 million residents squeezing into that category. (The rankings included the District of Columbia.) And fewer than one in five state residents leads an inactive lifestyle, the trust found. That appeared to pay off in health benefits, with Colorado ranking 50th in diabetes and high blood pressure. These figures did not surprise Spenser Havlick, former deputy mayor of Boulder, where exercise and good nutrition rank high in the public consciousness and attract like-minded people from other parts of the country, he said. ""They are leaving behind a more sedentary life in the larger cities,"" he said. ""Every weekend, there's a 5K race, a 10K race; there are ultramarathons."" A number of organic health food stores dot the city, and organic produce ""is pushed throughout the schools,"" he said. Boulder's 100,000 residents have 360 miles of bike paths and 64 underpasses, so cyclists need not stop when they reach an intersection. ""We think that's much safer, and it's much faster and it's more fun,"" said Havlick, 72, who returned last week from hiking on glaciers in Alaska. Exercise is also part of the political culture of Boulder, where seven of the nine City Council members are bicyclists, said Havlick, professor emeritus of architecture and planning at the University of Colorado. ""There's a strong inclination for more money to be spent on reducing car dependency."" Weather, too, plays a role, with 330 days of sunshine, he said. And social pressure may have an impact. ""I think there is a stigma attached to people who have a BMI that's high,"" he said, referring to body mass index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight. Still, he noted, the percentage of obese Coloradans has gone up slightly in the past two years. ""Some of the folks who come to Colorado to work may not have picked up on these healthy lifestyles yet,"" he said.

"Editor's note: Dr. Vance Harris is a primary care physician in Redding, California. An earlier version of this commentary was posted on SERMO.com, a private, physicians-only online community. Dr. Vance Harris says primary care doctors get minuscule payment for saving the system huge sums of money. (CNN) -- Health policy experts agree that any reform in our health care system must include a well-educated, caring primary care doctor who is able to manage the health of his or her patients with an eye to using resources optimally to keep costs down. That's a tall order and it seems that few policy makers realize the value of primary care physicians. People are making a huge assumption in this reform effort that as we extend coverage to millions who don't have health insurance, there will be doctors there to actually provide the health care. Fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care and many primary care doctors are leaving the field. Let me share with you why we are losing so many primary care doctors. What follows are a few examples I experience each week. How many dozens of chest pain patients have I seen in the last month for whom I didn't order an EKG, get a consult, set up nuclear imaging or send for a catheterization? Only I have the advantage of knowing how anxious some are and that they have had similar symptoms over the last 20 years. After a history and exam, I am willing to make the call that this is not heart disease. In doing so, I save the system tens of thousands of dollars. Most of these patients are worked into a busy day, pushing me even deeper into that mire of tardiness for which I will be chastised by at least six patients before the end of the day. My reward for working these people in and making the call is at most $75. How many times has an anxious patient come in demanding an endoscopy who I examined and then decided to treat less invasively for three to four weeks first? Few of these patients are happy no matter how many times I explain that it is reasonable to treat their reflux symptoms for several weeks before endoscopy. This delay in referral has led to many tense moments in the last 20 years. The cost savings to the system is thousands of dollars each and every time I am willing to make the call and go with the treatment. My reward is about $55 from Medicare and private health insurers. How many low back pain patients have come to the office in agony knowing that there has to be something serious to cause this kind of pain? A good history and exam allows me to reassure the patient that there is nothing we need to operate on and that the risk of missing anything is low. This takes a lot of time to explain as I teach them why they don't need an MRI. If someone else ordered the MRI, guess who gets to explain the significance of bulging disks to an alarmed patient? Setting realistic expectations on recovery and avoiding needless imaging helps saves the system thousands of dollars. My reward is another $55. How many diabetics do I struggle with, trying to get them to take better care of themselves? How many hours have I spent with teenage diabetics who will not check their blood sugar and forget half of their insulin doses? Hundreds of hours seem wasted until one day they open their eyes and want to take care of themselves. My reward for years of struggle is a few hundred dollars at best. The savings to society for my hard work and never-give-up attitude is in the tens of thousands of dollars. I am in my 22nd year in practice, now caring for 3,600 patients. Having me in the system has resulted in savings in the hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year. My financial incentive to hang in there and work harder is that I now make less than half what I did 20 years ago. This year I will make even less. These are the reasons so many physicians have left medicine entirely and most of us who are left wonder how long can we continue to work like this? I have always served my fellow man out of a sense of love and compassion. That's why I went into medicine. I have been richly rewarded by my patients over the decades as they have appreciated my judgment and skills. Isn't it a shame that after all this time and with skills honed by decades of experience, many of us can no longer afford to work as a physician? No one is talking about this on the national level. If they don't address these issues, then good luck having physician assistants provide the safety net with two years of training. Good luck getting newly trained physicians once they see our salaries. Good luck finding internists in your community with only 1 percent of medical students going into internal medicine. Good luck recruiting primary care specialists when we are projected to be short 39,000 by 2020, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. And nearly half of all doctors surveyed by the Physicians' Foundation have said that over the next three years they plan to reduce the number of patients they see or stop practicing entirely. I know this is true because I am struggling to find a primary care doctor to take care of my wife and myself. Now that is ironic. Anyone know who is taking new patients in California? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vance Harris.","Dr. Vance Harris: Health care reform assumes doctors will be available .
He says primary care doctors are dropping out of the business .
He says he saves the system big bucks but gets only small payments .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people turned out on Washington's National Mall on Sunday to support the Obama administration in its next big battle, a renewed effort to overhaul U.S. immigration laws. Speaking by video to the crowd, President Obama said he would do ""everything in my power"" to get a bipartisan deal within the year. ""You know as well as I do that this won't be easy, and it won't happen overnight,"" Obama said. ""But if we work together across ethnic, state and party lines, we can build a future worthy of our history as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws."" Obama's appearance was followed by comments from Gustavo Torres, executive director of the Baltimore-based immigrant advocacy group CASA de Maryland. Torres told the crowd, ""Mr. President, we are going to hold you accountable."" Though overshadowed by the historic debate on health care taking place in the nearby halls of Congress, Sunday's rally set the stage for a revival of efforts to reshape U.S. immigration law. The issue has been largely sidelined since a similar push by the Bush administration failed in 2007. ""You are a spectacular sight,"" Ali Noorani, chairman of the coalition that organized the demonstration, told the crowd. Noorani said the rally had drawn more than 150,000 people ""from across the country, and we are demanding comprehensive immigration reform now."" Noorani's figure could not be verified immediately. The crowd packed more than two blocks of the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. Then-President George W. Bush supported a bipartisan effort to overhaul U.S. immigration laws four years ago, proposing to set up a path to legal status for the estimated 11 million people in the United States without authorization. But those measures were criticized as establishing amnesty for illegal immigrants, and legislation Bush supported died with a Senate filibuster -- one led by members of his own party but joined by more than a dozen Democrats. Sunday's event followed last week's publication of a new plan backed by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. The plan would create a ""tough but fair"" path to legalization, as well as a temporary worker program and tighter border controls, the sponsors wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece Friday. Obama called the senators' plans promising and said it should be the basis for moving forward. He called on Congress to act on that plan at the earliest possible opportunity. Obama's push on immigration also helped secure a key vote for his health care bill. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, announced his support for the bill after receiving a commitment to move forward on immigration ""as soon as possible."" ""The wait is over. The time is now,"" Gutierrez told Sunday's rally. ""We're ready to turn our hope into victory.""

"New York (CNN) -- An Austrian daredevil is planning to become the first person to break the sound barrier in a free fall, without riding in a vehicle. This summer in New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner hopes to make the highest, longest and fastest fall ever. His attempt will take him to an altitude where the atmosphere ends and space begins -- where blood boils at body temperature, and the air temperature could be as low as minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The first step in the attempt will be riding a helium balloon to an altitude of 120,000 feet above sea level -- almost 23 miles -- higher than anyone has ascended in a balloon before. Then, wearing a pressurized suit and oxygen tanks, he plans to jump out of his capsule for a five-minute fall back to Earth. Within the first 30 seconds, he expects to be falling faster than the speed of sound, which at that altitude is around 690 miles per hour. Crossing that barrier would mark a new test of the limits of the human body. ""This is what we want to find out: What happens to the human body when it breaks the speed of sound,"" Baumgartner said. ""That's a big question mark."" To increase his chances of survival, his parachute is set to open automatically, even if he's unconscious or spinning so fast his hands are pinned by the G-force. He said his engineers are taking every precaution, testing out the suit in a wind tunnel and providing him with a backup chute, sealed gloves and boots, and an advanced helmet. ""This helmet also has face-shield heating to make sure your visor's not getting fogged up on the way down, because that would be fatal,"" he said. ""If you don't see anything, you can't move anymore. You can't make decisions."" Still, the risk of the unknown remains. ""If something happens, it happens fast,"" he said. ""You can never say you're not going to get killed under any circumstances,"" but ""we have a lot of solutions for emergency situations like this."" A chain reaction of events would have to occur before the jump could turn fatal, he said. A potential benefit from the mission, he said, would be demonstrating that it is possible to return from space without a spacecraft. ""In the future, a lot more tourists will go and travel to space. And if something goes wrong with their spacecraft, they have to return to Earth somehow,"" he said. ""We will show to the world that egress from high altitude is survivable."" The main difference is that Baumgartner will start from a standstill, whereas astronauts in a craft like the space shuttle are traveling at orbital speeds close to 18,000 mph when their re-entry begins. The previous record for the highest jump has stood for half a century, since it was set in 1960 by Joe Kittinger with the Air Force. He reached an altitude of 102,800 feet, and says it felt like a very distant and hostile place to be. ""You know that right outside of you is a vacuum of space,"" he said, ""and without the protection of that pressure suit, you cannot live. And that's an interesting thought."" Baumgartner, whose attempt is being financed by energy drink maker Red Bull, has enlisted Kittinger as a consultant. ""We have learned a lot from people in the past who tried to break that record, and they all failed,"" Baumgartner said. ""Some of these people got killed."" But he adds, ""I think it's human nature, you know. Records are meant to be broken. And I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge.""","Within 30 seconds of jump, Felix Baumgartner expects to break sound barrier .

"(Mashable) -- ""What would people most like to see in 3-D? Probably a naked lady."" Those are the words of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, whose magazine will soon include a centerfold playmate photographed naked and in 3-D. The 3-D centerfold will appear in the June issue, which hits newsstands this Friday. The subject of the photos is 51st Playmate of the Year Hope Dworaczyk. Consider this a grab for attention more than anything; Playboy editorial director Jimmy Jellinek was quoted byMSNBC saying, ""In today's print environment you have to create newsstand events."" The environment he's talking about is one in which Playboy circulation has dropped almost 60 percent in just four years. Though the magazine's gimmick is obviously inspired by the increasing popularity of 3-D films like ""Avatar,"" Hefner said that the appeal of 3-D movies is lost on him personally. That might not be true of his readers, though. Hefner actually commissioned a Chicago photographer to take 3-D photos of naked women back in the 50s, but he decided against running the images when he realized how expensive it would be to include 3-D glasses with each copy of the magazine, MSNBC claims.

"(CNN) -- Police in California say that with the arrests of 23 people this week, they are getting closer to those responsible for a string of brazen attacks against officers in a gang task force. The booby trap-style attacks believed to be targeting the Hemet Police Department began in December when, police say, a natural gas line was rerouted into the task force's headquarters, risking an explosion. The most recent incident occurred in March, when four city code enforcement trucks were set ablaze in the Hemet City Hall parking lot. None of the 23 suspects arrested Tuesday face charges directly related to the four attacks, but police are hopeful that they will lead them to the people responsible, Hemet Police Capt. Dave Brown told CNN. ""Tuesday's operation produced an enormous amount of property and evidence. The 23 people arrested were detained and interviewed, producing leads, and those leads are being followed up,"" Brown said. The suspects were arrested throughout Riverside County on a variety of felony and misdemeanor charges -- from possession of weapons and stolen property to outstanding warrants and narcotics. Local and state law enforcement agencies participated in the raids, in which 35 locations were searched and evidence, including 16 weapons, was seized. Read the names of the suspects . Some of those arrested have gang affiliations, Brown said, but it's still unclear whether the attacks are gang-related. A motive is still not known. ""Motive has been a missing piece, but once the suspects are identified, we believe a motive will follow,"" he said. ""Sometimes, in gang cases, the motive is clear from the beginning. But in this case, we're not even sure it's a gang case, and if so, we're not sure if one gang is operating independent of others or if there's some sort of cooperation between the gangs."" Hemet is one of eight local, state and federal agencies that make up the Riverside County Gang Task Force, which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs. As the county expanded and its population grew, so did the presence and reach of organized crime. Since 1997, the number of gangs in Riverside County has grown from 266 to 391, according to the task force's website, and total gang membership has grown to 10,620 people countywide. Authorities believe the attacks could be related because of their close timing and identical targets, John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said last month. On New Years Eve, the unmarked headquarters of the Hemet Gang Task Force was filled with deadly natural gas. Two task force members detected the gas, backed away and reported it. On February 23, a task force member at the Hemet headquarters opened a security gate outside the building, which launched a homemade zip gun attached to the gate. The weapon fired, missing the officer's head by inches. The headquarters has since been moved to an undisclosed location, where extra security precautions are being taken, Hall said. On March 5, criminals targeted a task force member who had parked an unmarked police car in front of a convenience store in Hemet. The officer found what appeared to be a homemade pipe bomb hidden underneath the vehicle. The attacks have drawn the attention of state and federal law enforcement, which have contributed manpower and money to a $200,000 reward offered in the case. The Hemet Police Department has set up a confidential tip line for anyone with information: 951-765-3897.

"(CNN) -- Coming back this weekend after a stay in Europe, I had that distinct sensation -- last felt when Lehman Brothers capsized, setting off the Great Recession -- that we once again find ourselves at the mercy of events and people just beyond our control. Here at home, one hears that by Wednesday dawn, we will know whether BP's latest big try to stop the oil spill will work. If it does, we can begin to feel that we are moving in the right direction, but if it doesn't -- well, no one is quite sure what Plan D looks like. Is this really where we have come: that the fate of our precious coastlines and the waters off our coasts are in the hands of a single foreign-based company? A month ago, it looked like the White House was on top of this problem, as Cabinet officers scurried here and there, the Coast Guard and others swung into action, there were talks with BP, and the president paid a personal visit. But increasingly, it has become apparent that the federal government may be present but is not in charge. It keeps saying that BP bears ultimate responsibility. It is keeping the press away. No wonder James Carville, Chris Matthews and Donna Brazile exploded late last week. They are right on a basic point: Ultimately it is not the responsibility of BP or any other company to protect American interests but the responsibility of the federal government. Some Obama supporters have argued that the 1990 Oil Pollution Act limits the president's capacity to take action. Others disagree. Either way, in an emergency, laws can be changed. Although this disaster is not an existential threat, it could be argued that if the U.S. government had fought World War II in the same way it has fought the oil spill, we might well be speaking German now. Faced with a growing danger to our well-being, a WWII-type government would at minimum have: . • Brought in the CEOs of all the major oil companies and charged them with the duty of an all-hands collaborative effort to stop the spill and help ward off the damage. • Brought in the best minds in the country, from universities and technology, for emergency efforts to find solutions. • Moved quickly to mobilize the National Guard and other military forces, if necessary, ensuring that they received the resources needed to protect our beaches. • Made a clear call to citizen volunteers to help where necessary. • Given Cabinet officers an ultimatum: Get this under control in the next 30 days, or else. There will be ample time after this disaster for finger-pointing and blame-laying. The key now is to get this spill under control before it does far more damage. Meanwhile, the Washington Post had it exactly right Monday morning when it argued that with the European crisis spreading now beyond Greece, ""the knife-edge psychology currently governing global markets has put the future of the U.S. economic recovery in the hands of politicians in an assortment of European capitals."" Across Europe, one finds people stunned at the rapidity with which this crisis has grown, threatening not only their weak economies but also their dreams of a European utopia with people living a honeyed existence. All that could go smash now. Indeed, it is ironic that Europe may now be forced to give up its strong welfare state even as the U.S. is moving toward it. But the immediate point is that the U.S. finds itself too much at the mercy of whether European politicians and publics now make the right moves. It may take a while, but Americans are going to start feeling a lot happier about our country when we once again believe we have strong control of own destiny. Leadership, anyone?

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Art Linkletter, the easygoing, smooth-voiced emcee famed for his long-running hosting gigs of the radio and television shows ""House Party"" and ""People Are Funny,"" and author of ""Kids Say the Darndest Things,"" has died, according to his spokeswoman. Linkletter ""died peacefully at home with his family on Wednesday,"" a statement from the family said. He was 97. ""Just one month earlier, while being honored at an event, he was asked what he considered his greatest life accomplishment,"" the statement said. ""He responded 'Family.'"" Linkletter rose to fame as a radio announcer in San Diego, later becoming a program director. In 1944, he launched ""Art Linkletter's House Party,"" a daytime CBS radio show that moved to television in 1952 and ran until 1969. ""Kids say the darndest things,"" was Linkletter's often-repeated phrase because of his humorous interviews with children. It became the title of his best-selling book, a country music hit and was reprised by Bill Cosby as a 1998 TV show. The phrase began as a segment on ""House Party."" Linkletter would ask several children their thoughts on various topics; their responses were often hilariously absurd. ""I was Oprah before there was Oprah,"" he once told The Wall Street Journal. Flowers were placed on Linkletter's star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame Wednesday afternoon. His nighttime show, ""People Are Funny,"" started on radio in 1942 and ran on NBC television from 1954 to 1961. According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh's ""The Complete Directory to Primetime Network and Cable Shows, 1946-Present,"" the show featured everyday guests who would be interviewed by Linkletter and then asked to do a stunt. The result for those who failed at the stunt was often a pie in the face or being splashed by water. Linkletter also hosted a short-lived quiz show, ""The Art Linkletter Show,"" in 1963. At its height, Linkletter's fame was notable enough to make him part of Milton Bradley's ""Game of Life,"" which featured Linkletter's endorsement and his photo on the game's $100,000 bill. His 1960 biography was called ""Confessions of a Happy Man."" But the host's own life was touched by a famous tragedy. In 1969, his daughter Diane -- just 20 at the time -- jumped to her death from a sixth-floor apartment in Hollywood. Linkletter blamed the death on LSD, though the drug use was never confirmed. Linkletter became an ardent anti-drug crusader, releasing a hit record, ""We Love You, Call Collect,"" which won a Grammy Award. Of his five children, two others also predeceased Linkletter: son Robert died in a 1980 auto accident, and another son, Jack, died of lymphoma in 2007. Linkletter is survived by his wife of 75 years, Lois, and two daughters, Dawn Griffin and Sharon Linkletter. Linkletter was born Gordon Arthur Kelly in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, on July 17, 1912. Orphaned as an infant, he was adopted by traveling evangelist John Linkletter and his wife, Mary. After a short stint on Wall Street -- he was a typist at an investment bank at the time of the 1929 Crash, he told the WSJ -- he eventually moved to San Diego and attended college at San Diego State University. While in college, he took a job as a staff announcer at CBS affiliate KGB-AM. Linkletter was an astute businessman. The owner of Linkletter Enterprises, he owned millions of acres in Australia and was a sheep and cattle rancher. He also owned oil wells and was a spokesman for several products. CNN's Todd Leopold and Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","Art Linkletter hosted ""House Party"" and ""People Are Funny""

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Sometimes, a film is so powerful that it haunts you long after you've left the theater. Usually, it's because of the weight of the message. The film haunting me is ""The Blind Side."" And the message? I'll leave that to Leigh Anne Tuohy to explain. Tuohy and her husband, Sean, are the subjects of the new movie, ""The Blind Side."" The film is an adaptation of the 2006 book, ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"" by Michael Lewis. It tells the incredible story of Michael Oher, who went from being a homeless inner-city high school student whose father was dead and whose mother was a crack addict to a star lineman at the University of Mississippi -- eventually being selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2009 NFL draft. The Ravens recently signed the 6-5, 309-pound Oher to a 5-year, $13.8 million contract. This American Dream is brought to us not just by Oher's talent, perseverance, and hard work but also by the fact that he was adopted by the Tuohys. The white, wealthy Memphis family not only fed and clothed Michael but also loved him as one of their own along with daughter Collins and son Sean Jr. The ""Blind Side"" is the No. 2 film in America, and the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy is played to perfection by Sandra Bullock. Still, some critics dismissed the film as hokey and condescending, with one calling it the latest chapter in Hollywood's ""long, troubled history of well-meaning white paternalism, with poor black athletes finding success through white charity."" They missed the point. Simply put, there's a lot that any one of us can do to improve the life of our fellow man. And the fact that we do it is its own reward. ""He had a much greater impact on our lives than we did on his life,"" Leigh Anne said in a recent interview. ""You have this child, and you bring him in, and you realize how fortunate you are, how you're blessed to have family, you're blessed to have your health. So much in life you take for granted."" There's the message: So much in life you take for granted. We've forgotten how lucky we are, because we're busy cursing fate. We've stopped being grateful for what we have, because we somehow find it more satisfying to complain about what we don't. Until we meet someone who has much less than we do. So much in life you take for granted. As Americans, we've become victims of our own success. We've strayed so far from the example of our immigrant parents and grandparents that we bear no resemblance to that model. Weighed down by own bloated sense of entitlement and self-importance, we've lost our appetite for competition and we prefer to talk instead about what we think we ""deserve."" At the first sign of adversity, we play the victim, give up, or fall apart. With all the blessings that come with living in the world's most remarkable country, still we complain. We retreat. We whine. Here in the Golden State, thousands of students at the University of California turned out to protest a 32 percent fee increase. I wrote a column, expressing disappointment that these ""brats"" consider a publicized subsidized college education an entitlement and telling them to go get jobs if their education is that important to them. I heard back from many of their parents who, angrily rising to their children's defense, informed me -- in incompatible narratives -- that either there were no jobs or their kids already had two of them. How about that? Bratty parents. Apparently, in California, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. After a few days of that noise, I was ready for a movie where, in one of the more poignant scenes, a young man is given his own bedroom and remarks that he's ""never had one before."" Not a room but a bed. In another scene, Michael is so grateful to be at Thanksgiving dinner that he respectfully sits at the dining room table while the rest of the family plops down in front of the television. In another scene, he requests a driver's license just so he can have something with his name on it. So much in life we take for granted. I saw the movie in a well-to-do suburb north of San Diego. The crowd cheered, laughed, and cried. When it was over, there were smiles all around. I wondered: For all we've acquired, what have we lost -- and look to movies like this to replenish? The scene about the bed made me want to run home and gather up every one of my kids' toys and give them to Goodwill. And, I tell you, the next time they ask for something they don't need, they're getting a paper route. Or at least they would if they weren't a preschooler and a toddler. In one scene, Leigh Anne interrupts football practice to give Michael a helpful tip for a lineman -- treat the team like your family and protect the family. She tells the startled football coach: ""You can thank me later."" Treat yourself to a nice present this holiday season. See this movie. You can thank me later. The opinions expressed by this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","A new film, ""The Blind Side,"" tells inspirational story of hope and caring, says Ruben Navarrette Jr.

"(CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth and the royal family cost British taxpayers an average of 66 pence ($1.32) per person last year, Buckingham Palace announced Friday in its annual report of royal finances. The Queen and the royal family cost Britons a little bit more in the latest financial year. The total cost of the queen and royal family was 40 million pounds ($80 million) in the past fiscal year, an increase of 2 percent from the year before, according to the Royal Public Finances report. The man in charge of managing the queen's financial affairs said she has tried to keep costs down, pointing out that the queen's expenses are more than 3 percent lower in real terms than they were in 2001. ""The reduction in the amount of head of state expenditure in real terms reflects the continuous attention the royal household pays to obtaining the best value for money in all areas of expenditure,"" said Alan Reid, whose official title is ""keeper of the privy purse."" Funding for property maintenance at the royal palaces increased by almost 1 million pounds ($2 million) from the year before to 15.3 million pounds ($30.6 million), but it will stay at that level for the next three years, the palace said. Reid warned that the money is not enough to deal with a backlog of maintenance work. ""This backlog relates to essential maintenance and does not include any allowance for projects such as the redecoration of the state rooms at Buckingham Palace, most of which were last redecorated before the queen's reign,"" he said. Available funds are also unlikely for replacing the lead and slate roofs at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle (which would cost an estimated 16 million pounds, or $32 million); replacing heating and electrical wiring and removing asbestos at the palace (2.4 million pounds, or $4.8 million); and replacing Victorian cast iron and lead water mains at the castle (3 million pounds, or $6 million). Travel was a major expense for the queen and her family over the past year, the reports showed. The most expensive trip was the queen's six-day state visit to the United States, which cost a total of 414,042 pounds (about $828,000). It cost 316,061 pounds (about $632,000) for Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, to take an eight-day trip to Uganda and Turkey in November for Britain's Foreign Office. Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, also had a series of expensive trips as part of his role as the United Kingdom's special representative for international trade and investment. He visited more than 20 countries in that capacity last year, trying to attract investors to Britain and helping British companies improve their prospects overseas. ""This report is provided every year to show transparency in the royal accounts,"" said CNN royal watcher Richard Quest. ""It is often used as an example to show profligacy, for instance with the cost of the royal train, which runs around 20,000 pounds ($40,000) a day.""","Queen and royal family cost British taxpayers 66p ($1.31) per person last year .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people gathered Tuesday night for a candlelight vigil outside a San Diego, California, church in honor of a teenage girl missing since Thursday. The vigil was held just hours after authorities said they found human remains in an area where they had been searching for 17-year-old Chelsea King. ""There is strong likelihood that we have found Chelsea,"" San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference. The remains were found in a shallow grave along the shoreline of a tributary south of a lake in Rancho Bernardo Community Park, authorities said. Searchers have been combing the edge of Lake Hodges for any clue into the disappearance of King, a cross-country runner who often ran along the park's trails. The last reported sighting of the high school senior was at school Thursday, according to sheriff's department spokeswoman Susan Plese. Her car, with her cell phone inside, was found at the park, Plese said. Police arrested 30-year-old John Albert Gardner III on Sunday in connection with the disappearance. Gardner is being held in the San Diego Central Jail on rape and first-degree murder charges, according to jail records available online Tuesday night. Gardner is due to appear in court later Wednesday. Follow local coverage on KGTV . Gore said the body was found in a heavily wooded area not visible from nearby homes. A shoe had been found earlier in the same area. He said King's parents have been informed of the discovery. ""They were holding out hope as we all were that we would find Chelsea alive,"" he said. ""This is our worst fears that we would find her as we did today."" At Tuesday night's vigil, friends and family were expected to speak about King and play some of her favorite songs. Gore said he expected to have positive identification of the body by Wednesday. Gardner, a registered sex offender, is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday, according to San Diego County district attorney's spokesman Steve Walker.","Hundreds gather for a candlelight vigil to honor teen girl missing since Thursday .

"(CNN) -- BP is doing all it can to respond to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, a top BP official said Monday, even as criticism of the company's handling of the crisis was growing. ""We are going to clear every drop of oil off the shore,"" Tony Hayward told reporters at Fourchon Beach, Louisiana, where cleanup efforts were under way. ""We will remediate any environmental damage and we will put the Gulf Coast right and back to normality as fast as we can."" The company's next effort to plug the leak is to come at dawn Wednesday. BP plans to pump thick, viscous fluid twice the density of water into the site of the leak to stop the flow so the well can then be sealed with cement -- the ""top kill"" procedure. Hayward, noting that the attempt will be carried out on the seafloor a mile below the sea surface, estimated the odds of success for the method at 60 percent to 70 percent. Asked about the company's continued use of an oil dispersant in the face of an EPA request that it use a less toxic alternative, Hayward said, ""Everything that we do with dispersants is with the explicit approval of the EPA."" But EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said she was not pleased with BP's response to the government's request. ""The answer we got back from BP, to me, seemed more like a defense of their current choice -- reminded me a little bit of that old commercial 'I'd rather fight than switch,'"" she told reporters in Venice, Louisiana. ""We need to ask ourselves whether there's not a better product out there."" Federal officials told BP that ""we expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used,"" from 50,000 gallons or more per day to less than 15,000 gallons per day, she said. That can be accomplished by releasing the dispersant below the surface of the water, she said. She said tests showed that the dispersant, Corexit 9500, was more toxic to baby shrimp and baby silverfish than were any of five other dispersants. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen, the Obama administration's point person in the Gulf, called the decision to use dispersants a tradeoff. ""It means we're willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather than on land,"" he said. Hayward acknowledged that BP's reputation has taken a beating, but said the company is being straightforward about its efforts. ""We're trying to communicate openly and transparently about everything that we've done,"" he said. As the environmental impact of the disaster was just beginning to unfold, he noted that BP will set aside a half billion dollars to open a research program to study the effects of the spill. Hayward's comments came a day after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar expressed frustration with the delay in stopping the spill, asserting that BP has ""from day one, frankly, not fulfilled the mission it was supposed to fulfill."" He said the company has missed ""deadline after deadline"" and that he was not confident that BP knew what it was doing. ""If we find that they're [BP] not doing what they're supposed to be doing, we'll push them out of the way,"" Salazar said. BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles acknowledged Monday that the federal government could take over the effort, but said the results would be no better. ""I don't think anyone else could do better than we are,"" he said. If the ""top kill"" procedure does not work, he said, BP will try to fit a second, smaller containment dome over the ruptured pipe, Suttles said. A first containment dome failed to stop the leak. If the second dome does not work, he said, the company would ""still have plenty of other options."" The company could try a ""junk shot,"" which would involve plugging the well with rubber and other substances, BP Managing Director Robert Dudley said Sunday. However, a permanent solution could take until August -- the estimated completion date for a relief well, said Allen. By the time the runaway well is capped, the amount of oil discharged could be comparable to the total released in the Exxon Valdez environmental disaster 20 years ago, Allen said. But he expressed no appetite for suggestions that the federal government should take over the project. ""You need to do very technical work at 5,000 feet,"" he said, referring to the depth of the leak. ""You need equipment and expertise that's not generally within the government -- federal government -- in terms of competency, capability or capacity."" The administration vowed to persevere. ""We are going to be tireless in working to do everything we can to support the community and everybody whose livelihoods have been imperiled down in the region,"" President Obama said at a reception celebrating Asian-American and Pacific-Islander Heritage Month. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke on Monday declared a fishery disaster in the Gulf of Mexico because of the economic impact of the oil spill on fisheries in the region. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has closed nearly 20 percent of the commercial and recreational fisheries in the area because of the spill, and Locke's declaration will allow the federal government to put additional resources into the Gulf states to soften the blow. Meanwhile, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Salazar -- each on a fourth visit to the region since the April 20 spill began -- toured the spill area Monday accompanied by a phalanx of politicians. ""We are going to do everything we can to protect these lands, to protect these parishes, to make sure that claims are paid,"" Napolitano told reporters in Galliano, Louisiana. Read about Louisiana's closed oyster harvesting areas . With an armada of more than 1,000 vessels and the efforts of more than 22,000 people who have put into place hundreds of thousands of feet of boom, the response to the oil spill is the largest in U.S. history, said Napolitano. That did not satisfy Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who called Monday for more resources to be mobilized against the oil and reiterated his call for the Army Corps of Engineers to move quickly to approve a plan to protect threatened marshland by building sand booms. ""We've got to take matters into our own hands if we are going to win this battle to protect our coast,"" he said. ""Every day we are not dredging sand gives one more day for oil to enter the ecosystem."" He bemoaned the fact that nearly 70 miles of Louisiana coast has been hit by oil. Read about a lawsuit filed by oil rig victims, families . ""BP is the responsible party and we need the federal government to make sure they are held accountable,"" he said. ""Our way of life depends on it."" Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry, the federal on-scene coordinator for the response effort, told reporters the barrier island project was under review. Environmental and wildlife officials ""are weighing in on the impact to endangered and threatened species, and other impacts this large-scale project could have,"" she said. Since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon in late April about 40 miles off Louisiana, oil has been gushing into the Gulf at an estimated rate of at least 5,000 barrels a day (210,000 gallons). Some estimates are far higher. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the sinking.

Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts are now in their sixth year of seven at the school. They've seen a lot of changes, particularly as the influence of the reawakened Voldemort (that is, He Who Must Not Be Named) has made itself known. And the movie series itself is now nearing its conclusion. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" which comes out Wednesday, is likewise the sixth movie in the series based on J.K. Rowling's seven Harry Potter books. There is one benefit to having such history, director David Yates says: Pretty much everybody going to see ""Half-Blood Prince"" is familiar with the characters, whether through the books or the movies. ""We made a decision -- we kind of crossed a line, actually, I think, on this movie, where we said, 'You know, this is the sixth one in the series; it's the most popular franchise probably in history; do we stop and explain things to the audience who may have not seen any of the others?' And we said 'no,' "" Yates said. ""And you know why? It's because they can always go back to DVDs. They can go back to the books."" Indeed, many fans know the books -- and the movies -- backward and forward.  Interactive: Harry Potter 101 » . The new film reflects the growth of the characters: Harry, the orphaned boy wizard who has been forced to take on responsibilities beyond his youthful years; Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), his red-haired best friend, who is finding depths of courage in himself he wasn't aware of; Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), the bookish and indispensible member of their clan, who has demonstrated key leadership qualities; and all the rest, preparing for the showdown with the archvillain Voldemort.

Despite the growing darkness, there's also a lightness to the new film, says Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry. Unlike the previous two movies in the series, which were rated PG-13, this one is rated a more family-friendly PG. ""I think this film's funnier,"" Radcliffe said. ""There are a couple of moments which I laughed out loud at."" Not that it's going to be a barrel of laughs, Yates cautions. (How could it, with the snake-faced Voldemort growing ever stronger?) ""It is a bit bipolar,"" Yates said. ""On the one hand, there's all this ... romance, and on the other hand, people are getting killed, and bridges are being blown up."" Oh, yes, there's romance. After all, the main Potter characters are all teenagers now, with all the teenage longings. Potter fans have had their own longings. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was scheduled to be released in November but was pushed back to its Wednesday opening after Warner Bros., Potter's studio, expressed concerns about putting it out over the holiday season. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) Warner Bros. said at the time that the film ""perfectly fills the gap for a major tent-pole release for mid-summer"" and added that the delay was also due to ""repercussions"" from the 2007-08 writers strike. But fans weren't so easily placated, filling message boards with angry comments and starting petitions that garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Warner Bros. President Alan Horn was even moved to put out a statement assuring fans that the scheduling change ""was not taken lightly."" Now that the moment is finally at hand, the fans seem to have forgiven the studio. According to Fandango.com, a movie ticket-selling site, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is outselling ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" at the same point in the sales cycle. It's also in MovieTickets.com's top 25 advance sellers of all time.

""I started running."" Broward County, Florida, prosecutors released the interview, along with other audio, video and documents, to media outlets including CNN on Monday and Tuesday. Three teenagers have been charged as adults with attempted murder in connection with Brewer's burning. Detectives said eyewitnesses have told them that 16-year-old Jesus Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Denver Jarvis, 15, allegedly poured alcohol over him, and that Matthew Bent, also 15, allegedly encouraged the attack. Detectives said Mendez admitted that he set Brewer on fire, and that he made a ""bad decision,"" according to an arrest transcript. Interviews with the suspects were not part of the evidence released this week. Detectives believe that Brewer owed Bent $40 for a video game. When Brewer did not pay, police said, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle, then was arrested when Brewer reported him to the police. The next day, police believe, the group sought out Brewer. In the interview, Brewer speaks in a soft, labored voice and sounds breathless. He can be heard inhaling and exhaling on the recording. He told police that Bent ""came to my house and he tried to take my dad's bike. He threatened me. He threatened my sister."" He said Bent wanted him to buy something that he didn't want to buy, but he couldn't remember what. ""I think it was stolen,"" Brewer said. He said he saw Jarvis pour the flammable liquid on him, and told police he was walking away from the others when it occurred. When the teens approached him, he said, one told him, ""Nobody's going to hit you."" Instead, he recalled ""cold stuff all over my clothes and ... burning."" Bent, Mendez and Jarvis face a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Two other boys who were allegedly involved, a 13-year-old and 15-year-old, have not been charged in the attack. After he was set on fire, ""I'm like, run. Run,"" Brewer said. ""I ... jumped the fence and jumped into the pool."" ""This guy comes running out and tries to pull me out of the water, and I said, 'Leave me, leave me,' 'cause my skin was, like, hanging,"" he said. ""I got out of the pool, and ... in a chair. And then they put me on a stretcher, and they strapped me, and then they put me on the helicopter."" A videotaped interview with an eyewitness to the incident is also among the pieces of evidence released. In it, the teenager recalls hearing Bent, who is known as Zeke, tell Jarvis to pour the flammable liquid on Brewer. ""Zeke's like, 'Yeah, yeah, pour it on him,'"" the witness says, estimating the pouring lasted three to five seconds. Asked if a lot of fluid was poured on Brewer, the boy said it soaked his entire back. Brewer was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital's burn unit on December 22 after more than two months. During that stay, he had three skin-graft surgeries and was on a ventilator for a month. He was readmitted to the hospital earlier this month after experiencing trouble breathing, but was re-released after three days. Doctors have said he faces a long recovery and rehabilitation process. Brewer is recovering at an undisclosed location. His mother, Valerie Brewer, has said he will be home-schooled once he has recovered enough to resume his school work.

"(CNN)  -- Eight people were arrested Tuesday, one on a charge of murder, in connection with the fatal shooting of a woman at a remote Louisiana campsite during what police say was an initiation ceremony for the Ku Klux Klan. Chuck Foster is charged with second-degree murder in the woman's death. The woman, whose identity has not been confirmed, was recruited over the Internet to join the Klan by the suspects, said Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. The woman traveled from Oklahoma to Louisiana for the ceremony and was taken to a campsite near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans. On Sunday, the woman asked to be taken from the camp to a nearby town. An argument ensued, and the woman was fatally shot by the group's leader, Bonnett said. Some of the suspects then tried to conceal the killing by burning the woman's personal items, he said. Police received a tip about the killing and found the woman's body hidden under loose brush alongside a road, Bonnett said. The suspects, most of whom were still in the woods near the campsite several miles from where the body was found, were taken into custody without incident, he said. The group's leader, identified as Chuck Foster, 44, was charged with second-degree murder. The others were charged with lesser crimes related to trying to conceal the killing, Bonnett said. Authorities found weapons, several flags and six Klan uniforms in the area, he said. Bonnett said he has not seen any Klan activity in the area in three years he has worked there. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there were seven active Klan organizations in Louisiana in 2007, the last time the civil rights law firm tracked hate groups. None of these organizations was in the Sun area. CNN's Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report.","Suspects recruited Oklahoma woman to join Klan, Louisiana police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has decided that the family of a slain professional wrestling personality can continue its lawsuit against Hustler magazine, a case that tested privacy concerns and the competing right to publish ""newsworthy"" material. The justices without comment Monday turned aside an appeal from the publishers of the men's magazine, which featured old nude photos of Nancy Benoit, who was killed nearly three years ago by her husband and fellow wrestling superstar Chris Benoit. The couple's young son also was slain in the family's Georgia home. The order is a victory for the estate of Nancy Benoit, which is seeking damages from Hustler. At issue was whether the constitutional right of privacy indirectly referenced in the 14th Amendment trumps the First Amendment protections of the media and publishers in this ""right-of-publicity"" dispute. The original lawsuit was brought by Maureen Toffoloni, whose daughter, Nancy Benoit, had posed nude for a photographer more than two decades ago. Toffoloni claims that her daughter, who was also known by the wrestling moniker Woman, had asked immediately after the shoot to have the photos and video destroyed and believed that photographer Mark Samansky had done so. He later sold stills from the video to Hustler, a men's magazine founded by Larry Flynt that publishes racy material. The photos were published in the March 2008 issue. The murders had occurred the previous summer. At the center of the crimes was Chris Benoit, a Canadian-born athlete who worked for several professional wrestling circuits, including the popular World Wrestling Entertainment. In 2000, he married Nancy Sullivan, a Florida native who had become a well-known wrestling manager after her time in the ring. Their son, Daniel, was born earlier that year. Police say the crimes occurred over a three-day period in June 2007 at the Atlanta-area home of the Benoits. Investigators concluded that Chris Benoit first bound his 43-year-old wife and strangled her. The 7-year-old boy was then drugged and strangled. The man then committed suicide by hanging himself with a weight machine. No formal motive was ever established. CNN reported at the time that doctors found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of 40-year-old Chris Benoit, according to Georgia's chief medical examiner. Performance-enhancing anabolic steroids were later found in the home. Weeks after the killings, a study of Chris Benoit's brain showed damage from ""prior repetitive injury."" His father, Michael Benoit, said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that a series of concussions from his high-flying moves in the ring were in part to blame. Georgia has a law similar to many states' recognizing the right to privacy against ""the appropriation of another's name and likeness ... without consent and for the financial gain of the appropriator."" That would include ""a private citizen, entertainer, or a public figure who is not a public official"" like a legislator. The state's high court ruled against Hustler magazine in June, finding that a ""brief biography"" of Nancy Benoit and her murder accompanying the nude photos did not represent a ""newsworthy article."" ""The photographs published by [Flynt] neither relate to the incident of public concern conceptually [the murders] nor correspond with the time period during which Benoit was rendered, against her will, the subject of public scrutiny,"" the state court wrote. ""Were we to hold otherwise, [Flynt] would be free to publish any nude photograph of almost anyone without their permission, simply because the fact they were caught nude on camera strikes someone as 'newsworthy.' Surely that debases the very concept of a right to privacy."" The state justices said ""crude though the concept may seem,"" Nancy Benoit's mother is now entitled to control such images ""in order to maximize the economic benefit to be derived from her daughter's posthumous fame."" Such power is known legally as the ""right of publicity."" Flynt and the photographer, Samansky, later filed the appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court and had the support of several media organizations. In a brief filed in support of Hustler, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said the Georgia ruling ""makes no sense, as it goes well beyond the photographs that appear in magazines such as petitioner's to affect all news-gathering."" The group noted that other courts have long recognized a broadly read ""newsworthiness"" standard for commercial media like CNN and that such specific ""dissection"" of content-based stories and pictorials by judges would cripple editorial decision-making by all news outlets. The case is LFP Publishing Group (dba Hustler Magazine) v. Maureen Toffoloni, as administrator and personal representative of the estate of Nancy E. Benoit (09-625).","Supreme Court turns aside appeal over Nancy Benoit nude photos .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- For all the ballyhoo about Black Friday, the crown jewel in the holiday shopping calendar has been something of a bust for retailers. That's led to a shift in how the day is being handled this season. Historically, nobody outside the retail world was really familiar with the idea behind Black Friday. But sometime in the '90s, it suddenly became the thing to do to camp out overnight the day after Thanksgiving and wait for stores to open with their door-buster deals at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. But talk about inefficiency. The crowds that waited so long would thin out by 9 a.m., and stores were more like ghost towns the rest of the day. And retailers probably didn't make any money on the stuff they were selling anyway! Then there have been the actual physical dangers of having large crowds of people mill around and then dash like mad to snatch up deals. During Black Friday 2008, a Wal-Mart employee was actually trampled to death by a mob of shoppers in New York. All of these factors have prompted retailers to rethink Black Friday. And in a new development, the deals will be available from right now throughout the remainder of the holiday season. No need to freeze your butt off in a long line overnight! For example, I picked up a laptop at Best Buy for $249 on November 11. It was part of a one-day sale that the electronics retailer held to kick off the holiday shopping season. You can monitor the best deals out there on any number of Web sites dedicated to Black Friday deals. Some of the ones I've checked in the past have included blackfriday.info, gottadeal.com and bfads.net. While we're on the topic of holiday shopping, you'll no doubt be asked to buy extended warranties on some of your purchases. I want to reiterate my annual refrain that they aren't necessary and are really just a waste of your money. Modern electronics seldom fail. In fact, flat-panel LCD and plasma TVs fail at only a 3 percent rate during the first three years of ownership, according to Consumer Reports. Why would anyone buy a warranty when you have a 97 percent chance that your TV will work perfectly for that long? Yet most people have a strange psychology about what they'll throw their money at. The Journal of Consumer Research found that people are more likely to buy a warranty on something they enjoy than on something they don't. So a business owner may not buy a warranty on operational equipment, but he or she will do so on a big-screen TV! The reality is that extended warranties have massive costs and just aren't a good investment. For example, The New York Times found one popular Nikon camera where the warranty was 27 percent of the purchase price. For laptops, a warranty can be up to a third of the sale price. Yet there is a free way to extend a manufacturer's warranty. Many credit card issuers will double the warranty up to one additional year if you use their card to make the purchase. Now that's the Clark Smart approach to spreading some holiday cheer to your gift recipients and your own wallet!","There's a shift in how Black Friday is being handled this season .

"London, England (CNN) -- The United Kingdom votes on a new government May 6 through a political system that dates back centuries.   When does an election happen? The UK has no written constitution. Instead the country's electoral system is based on a series of parliamentary acts dating back to the 17th century, when men wore the sort of tights and wigs still donned on ceremonial occasions by some officials of the Houses of Parliament. A general election is when voters nationwide choose lawmakers who will sit in the House of Commons, the lower chamber which initiates and approves legislation. An election must take place, by law, at least every five years. That said, governments can call an election at any time during their term. They could also be forced into an election if they lose a majority of lawmakers in the Commons. Who calls an election? The starting gun in a general election is traditionally fired when the prime minister travels to Buckingham Palace to ask the queen, the UK's head of state, to dissolve parliament by royal proclamation. An election must then take place within weeks. Since 1979, elections have been held between April and June. It is customary for an election to be held on a Thursday. The vote is conducted through the ""first past the post"" system whereby the candidate in each constituency with the most votes wins the seat. If the queen is the head of state, then how come the UK a democracy? Although the UK is a monarchy, the powers of the reigning head of state have gradually dwindled since King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 following the English Civil War between Royalists and Parliamentarians. Today, the monarch's role is largely ceremonial and mostly restricted to state functions and appearing on stamps and banknotes. But the monarch still retains formal powers and opens parliament each year. How does parliament function? The job of parliament is to make laws, scrutinize the actions of the government and debate issues of the day. The Commons -- which has green benches -- currently consists of 650 directly elected lawmakers known as Members of Parliament or MPs who each represent a geographical constituency. The upper house, the Lords -- which has red benches -- is mostly appointed by the government with members serving for life. Its main duty is to vote on legislation passed by the Commons and, when necessary, to send it back for further debate. In certain circumstances the government can force through legislation passed by the Commons but rejected by the Lords. How is an election decided? Voters do not elect the prime minister, or head of government, directly. Rather, they vote to elect a candidate representing a particular party to serve as their local MP. The leader of the party which wins the most seats is then asked by the Queen to form a government. The leader of the second largest party in the Commons becomes the ""Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition.""  MPs are elected by a plurality, rather than a majority, of votes. This means that a party can win a majority of seats in the Commons without achieving an overall majority in the overall popular vote. In fact, because there are three main parties in the UK it is extremely rare for a party to win an outright majority. The last prime minister elected by an outright majority was Stanley Baldwin, the Conservative Party leader, in 1931. In 2005, Tony Blair's Labour Party won just 35 percent of the vote but still controlled a 66-seat majority in the House of Commons.  So who can I vote for? For most of the past century, British politics has been dominated by two parties, the left-wing Labour Party and the right-wing Conservative Party. That said, the boundaries between left and right have been blurred as each has strived to occupy the strategically important center ground.  A third party, the centrist Liberal Democrats, usually picks up around 20 percent of votes but wins far fewer seats because it is squeezed between the two main parties. Parties from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also send small numbers of lawmakers to Westminster.  Full guide to UK political parties  What happens if a party doesn't win a majority of seats?  If no party wins an overall majority -- a ""hung parliament"" --- then the leader of the party which takes the most seats will usually be invited by the monarch to form a government. But its powers will be limited because it cannot control a majority of votes in the Commons. The party will usually call another election within months in a fresh attempt to secure a majority.  What would a hung parliament mean in 2010? The last time this happened was in 1974, when an election in February resulted in a hung parliament. A second election followed in October of the same year. Many opinion pollsters and observers believe that the 2010 general election will result in a hung parliament.","A general election must take place in the UK at least every five years .
The power of the monarchy has gradually dwindled since the 17th century .
Power in the UK parliament rests with the lower house, known as the Commons .

"(CNN) -- Let's just say it. The whole thing sounds insane. Despite blisters and 130-degree heat, Canadian Sandy McCallum pulls ahead on a grueling day in the desert. For six days, people from across the world -- accountants, school teachers, farmers, CEOs -- will run 150 miles, the equivalent of five consecutive marathons, across one of southern Africa's most remote landscapes. Without showers, toilets or beds, the racers must fend for themselves by carrying in their backpacks all the food they will need for the week. Water is rationed, despite 120-degree heat. And the racers will wear whistles to summon help should they encounter a wild animal that seems inclined to make them into dinner. Oh, and to have this... adventure... each person pays $3,100, not including travel costs.  Listen to racers say why they do it » . ""Nothing has ever made more sense to me,"" said Jim Molaschi, a 46-year-old South Florida engineer, who escapes from his cubicle as often as possible to do adventure races that make ""Survivor"" contestants look like pageant queens. Molaschi is among the 214 racers who will, beginning May 17, traverse Namibia. It's the latest footrace staged by Racing the Planet Limited, which has hosted 18 similarly styled races, known as the ""4 Deserts,"" since the mid 1990s. The first three courses -- each about 150 miles -- run across Chile's Atacama Desert, where it hasn't rained in 200 years; China's Gobi Desert, where the first dinosaur eggs were discovered; and North Africa's Sahara Desert,  where camels have been known to eat Racing the Planet's pink flag race markers. Sahara racers were asked: What happens if you're racing and stop seeing pink flags along the way? Wear a GPS, they say, and hope you find the next pink flag.  Watch racers lance blisters, eat mush and run across the Sahara » . Only those who complete the first three are allowed to participate in a walk across Antarctica known as the Last Desert. Racing the Planet is the first group to stage an endurance event across Namibia. Mary Gadams, Racing the Planet's director, was stunned this year as more people registered than ever before. ""It's the worst economy in years, and the world seems like it's falling apart, yet there is this real thirst out there to do this,"" she said. ""Maybe when everything that you defined yourself by in the 'normal' world isn't so stable, some people want to rediscover who they are outside of 'normal.'  They want an incredible experience."" Racing the Planet competitors include a Mount Kilimanjaro summiteer from Germany, a British insurance broker, a Spanish government official, a Canadian physician and an American architect. There are Ironman competitors in the mix with a few people who have never run more than 13 miles. The oldest woman in the race is a 68-year-old grandmother from Australia, Jennifer Murray, who set a record in 1997 by becoming the first woman to circumnavigate the earth in a helicopter. Most racers compete for charity, and over the years they have collectively raised about $500,000, said Gadams. In 2008 Racing the Planet teamed with Operation Smile to provide 97 villagers in Egypt with free reconstructive surgery, she said. Physicians and trained volunteers ride in all-terrain vehicles along the route, distributing water and medical aid. No one has been seriously hurt during past races. Helicopters -- including one provided by the Namibian government -- are at the ready. Competitors, as in any endurance event, sign off on the risks. Letting go of their vanity is something most racers learn after a couple of hours on the course. ""When you've got a CEO of a major company copping a squat in the desert, you are seeing them in a way their board members would never dream of,"" said Sandy McCallum, a 47-year-old former reporter turned record-setting fulltime runner who won Sahara among women in 2007. ""Out there, you stink like everyone else, you sweat like everyone else, you hurt like everyone else. It's a grounding force,"" she said.  Watch McCallum and Molaschi hit Miami Beach for a training run » . Pain also begets camaraderie. At the end of each stage, racers are given hot water for the dehydated food they have carried in their packs and sleep six to a tent. ""You can imagine how that makes people let go of their vanity and their personal space real quick,"" said McCallum. Friendships form quickly; romances are not uncommon. McCallum met Molaschi during the Gobi race and the two are reuniting with other Gobi competitors in Namibia. Rory O'Connor, an Irish Army vet and father of five, is also meeting Racing the Planet friends in South Africa. Namibia is the fourth desert ultra for O'Connor, a South Carolina personal trainer who was inspired to do his first race, Gobi, in 2006, after catching a National Geographic special on the event. ""I was watching that and I immediately said out loud, 'I could do that,' "" he said. O'Connor sent a reporter a photo from the Atacama race of his ankle so blistered and bloody that CNN isn't showing it. The 41-year-old underwent surgery for a hernia two months ago, but that hasn't deterred him from wanting to run Namibia. He put his backpack soon after the operation and started training again. ""People have said, 'Oh you shouldn't do that, you'll hurt yourself.' But I don't want to live my life like that, afraid of something that could happen, that might go wrong. I could hurt myself anywhere."" ""After [these races], everything else in my life seemed like such a smaller hassle,"" O'Connor said. ""They humble me. When you come back to your real life, nothing is going to seem like too much for you to handle.""","Footrace, which begins May 17, is the equivalent of five consecutive marathons .

"(CNN) -- As if the heavy snow, ice and high winds from a major winter storm weren't enough, temperatures plummeted in the upper Midwest and elsewhere Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. The storm brought blizzard conditions to some areas as gusty winds and blowing snow created whiteout conditions across much of the upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions. Winds of at least 35 mph and rain to the east caused hundreds of flights to be delayed or canceled, leaving travelers stranded. Parts of the Southeast received more than 6 inches of rain, causing flash flooding. A 28-year-old woman was killed in Omaha, Nebraska, Tuesday night when a truck plowing snow in a parking lot backed into her, police spokesman Jacob Bettin said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. In Nashville, Tennessee, early morning winds -- possibly up to 50 mph -- toppled the Christmas tree at the Tennessee State Capital, said CNN affiliate WKRN-TV. A facilities supervisor said the tree had been secured with hooks in concrete. An Arctic high pressure system or air mass began moving southward from Canada on Wednesday, bringing with it frigid temperatures. The temperature in Portland, Oregon, was 12 degrees, breaking the previous record of 15 degrees, set in 1972, said Jonathan Wolfe, meteorologist with the weather service's Portland bureau. By Wednesday afternoon the temperature in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was 9 degrees. It was minus 2 degrees in Denver, Colorado; and 11 in Kansas City, Missouri. Forecasters warned that places such as North Dakota and Minnesota could get dangerous wind chill readings of 25 to 35 degrees below zero. Madison, Wisconsin, received more than 17 inches of snow, prompting the University of Wisconsin to cancel classes for the first time since 1990. The campus police department estimated 3,000 students descended onto the school's Bascom Hill Wednesday afternoon for a snowball fight, with a few minor injuries reported, according to the university's Web site. Watch snow blow outside a hotel in Wisconsin . Early Wednesday morning, students began forming a giant snowball about six blocks from the campus and rolled it to an intersection near the university, former student Chad Krueger told CNN's iReport. How is the weather where you are? Send an iReport . The storm prodded Nicole Stec of Janesville, Wisconsin, to finally buy those new tires her car had been needing. ""I'm a procrastinator, so I put it off for a while. But now it's time because there's snow on the ground,"" Stec told WISC-TV at a Janesville tire shop. ""It's my Christmas present from Santa, apparently."" Elsewhere, Des Moines, Iowa, received more than a foot of snow, with more to come, and Freeport, Illinois, had 11 inches. Schools were also closed across Iowa and parts of Minnesota. Passengers heading to cities in snow-bound states were left waiting. High winds in the Northeast were creating flight delays of more than an hour Wednesday night. New England also was expected to get dangerously low temperatures as snowfall was tapering off by Wednesday evening. Areas in Maine were expected to get an additional 4-8 inches of snow overnight after as much as 10 inches fell earlier in the day, the weather service said. Connecticut's Department of Transportation deployed all of its 632 trucks to clear roads of snow that prompted numerous school closings Wednesday morning, CNN affiliate WFSB-TV reported. Watch iReporters' shots of the storm . Flash floods struck north-central Alabama where rescuers ended up in a tree early Wednesday when their boat overturned as they tried to help a motorist whose car was swept into a rain-swollen creek, said the administrative assistant for Morgan County's Emergency Management Agency. ""The people were all right,"" said Rita Weeks. ""They waited in the tree until people could come get them."" Earlier Wednesday, in the same county, a man hung on to a bridge over a creek after his vehicle was swept away by floodwaters, Weeks said. Forecasters said the area got more than 3 inches of rain before it stopped Wednesday morning, but flood advisories were still in effect Wednesday night for much of the South. The storm left its mark on the West on Monday and Tuesday. Alpine Meadows, California, near Lake Tahoe received 42 inches of snow before the storm moved out of the region Tuesday afternoon. Pagosa Springs, Colorado, received 33 inches, and Flagstaff, Arizona, got 30, with similar amounts throughout the Rockies.

"Sandy Springs, Georgia (CNN) -- During the week before Halloween each year, Lt. Steve Rose of the Sandy Springs Police Department in Georgia knocks on the doors of every registered sex offender in his jurisdiction. Rose set out in his unmarked Dodge Charger Wednesday with a printout of 20 names to verify that the people on the list live where they say they live. His mission brings him and members of his force to subdivisions, houses, hotels and and apartment buildings in this Atlanta bedroom community of about 85,000 people. ""We do this to give people a level of comfort so they know we're keeping tabs on them,"" said Rose, a former sex crimes detective with 34 years of police experience. Sandy Springs is one of many local law enforcement agencies across the country taking extra steps this Halloween to assure the community that the agencies are keeping track of the sex offenders living among them. There are 686,515 registered sex offenders in the United States, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Houston, Texas, Police Department says members of its Juvenile Sex Offender Registration Unit performed checks on the residences of registered sex offenders to ensure they are in compliance with the provisions of their parole or probation. They were also told not to decorate their homes, distribute candy, turn on their porch lights or answer the door. Similar restrictions are in place in Nashville, Tennessee. ""This is a proactive effort on our part to ensure community safety,"" said Melissa McDonald, spokeswoman for the Board of Parole and Probation. Some registered sex offenders in parts of Arkansas, Texas and Illinois must report to mandatory meetings, which critics have mockingly nicknamed ""sex offender Halloween parties,"" for a few hours on Saturday evening. In Rose's experience, however, most sex offenders keep to themselves on Halloween. In some areas, they cannot attend Halloween parties or events such as haunted houses or corn mazes. ""They just want to stay out of trouble,"" he said. ""But it's still incumbent on us to provide the community with the most up-to-date information about these people who are living in here."" Technically, Sandy Springs police are not responsible for verifying the addresses for the state's sex offender registry. As soon as all the addresses are verified, Rose says he includes the information in his weekly newsletter to the local homeowners' associations. He'll also notify the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, whose jurisdiction includes Sandy Springs, of any incorrect listings. After maneuvering through traffic for nearly three hours in the sprawling suburb, Rose had visited five residences. He spoke with one man, who calls a room at the Intown Suites home. Weekly rates start at $199. ""They don't have to worry about background checks in places like these,"" Rose said as he made his way down the fluorescent-lit hallway, the faint scent of fast food wafting through the vents. He knocked twice, announcing himself as Sandy Springs police, and a tall, thin man opened the door, revealing a sliver of the pitch black room as he rubbed sleep from his eyes. ""Just checking in to verify your address. Has anyone else been by lately? Sheriff or probation?"" Rose asked. ""Yes. Sheriff. I'm off probation,"" answered the man, who was convicted of receiving child pornography in 2001. ""Everything OK here?"" ""Yes sir."" ""OK then. Have a good day."" ""Thank you sir,"" the man said, closing the door. In two other stops, Rose confirmed with the leasing offices that the offenders were no longer living at the listed addresses. He failed to gain entry to another, and spoke with the roommate of another. ""We'll go back until we find them,"" he said. Such measures, which have been part of the season for years now, are widely perceived to provide the community with a sense of comfort, said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. ""We applaud and understand the vigilance that these jurisdictions want to take, and I don't think it hurts anything, but I think it's important not to feel a false sense of security just because registered sex offenders in the community are required to stay home with their lights off or at a counseling session. It's not a panacea, it's not a guarantee,"" he said. Allen said there is no evidence of higher incidence of sex offenses against children on Halloween. On its Web site, www.missingkids.com, the center provides parents with tips on how to keep their kids safe on Halloween, from supervising them on rounds to teaching children to be cautious and alert. ""The most important thing for parents is to use this time to talk about safety with their children and share common sense lessons, like only go to homes of people you know, be aware of your surroundings.""","Police in Georgia take it upon themselves to check sex offenders' addresses .

"LA GLORIA, Mexico (CNN) -- Tucked away in this small mountain village in Mexico, off a dusty road flanked by pig farms, is where the earliest case of swine flu -- a virus spreading globally -- was confirmed. Five-year-old Edgar Hernandez, known as ""patient zero,"" survived the earliest documented case of swine flu. Meet the child known as ""patient zero"" by his doctors -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez, who survived the earliest documented case of swine flu in an outbreak that, officials say, has now spread across four continents. His family lives in the 3,000-population village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz, where a flu outbreak was reported on April 2. State officials arrived and tested dozens of people. Lab tests confirmed that Edgar was the only patient in Veracruz to test positive for the swine flu virus; the others had contracted a common flu. Health officials had returned to Edgar's sample only after cases of the new flu strain were spotted around the country.  Watch Dr. Gupta meet little Edgar » . ""In this case, there's a patient who turned out to be positive for the swine-flu virus, with the exception that at that time in no region of the world it had been established as an etiological, epidemic cause,"" said Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova. Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better. His mother blamed a huge pig farm in the neighborhood for the virus. Officials have conducted tests at the farm owned by U.S. company Smithfield Foods, and those tests came back negative. Swine influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs. When the flu spreads person to person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it harder to treat or fight, because people have no natural immunity. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Learn more about swine flu and how to treat it » . Common seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year worldwide, far more than the current outbreak of swine flu. But there is no vaccine for this new disease, and little natural immunity, an expert said. ""I think the reason to be concerned is ... we had a vaccine for regular flu,"" said Dr. Carlos del Rio of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. ""This is a totally new virus. ... You have a virus to which there's no pre-vaccination, there's no prior immunity. And, therefore, the mortality rate may be higher than other influenza viruses.""  Watch why swine flu is a ""sloppy virus"" » . Researchers do not know how the virus is jumping relatively easily from person to person, or why it's affecting what should be society's healthiest demographic. Meanwhile, in hard-hit Mexico City, the government closed universities, postponed sporting events, asked restaurants to serve only take-out food, and canceled church services in an effort to try to stem the spread of the virus. Worried residents continue to flood in night and day at hospitals, only to be turned away by armed guards.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta inside a Mexico City hospital » .

"(CNN) -- Carrie McGonigle doesn't want to believe that her missing daughter could be connected to a registered sex offender accused of killing a California teen. ""That would mean that she's dead, and I don't want to think that,"" said McGonigle, whose 14-year-old daughter, Amber DuBois, was last seen walking alone to school on February 13, 2009. But authorities say they are looking into whether John Albert Gardner III, who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to raping and murdering Chelsea King, was involved in Amber's disappearance. ""We have been working closely with San Diego Sheriff's Office, and our investigators are working with theirs in case there is a connection,"" Lt. Robert Benton with the Escondido, California, Police Department said. ""We are involved in the daily briefings on the King investigation."" Amber's father, Moe DuBois, attended Gardner's arraignment Wednesday. ""Just the similarities in our case, you know, if there is any connection to Mr. Gardner and our case, I want to be there for his prosecution and soon to be execution I would hope,"" DuBois told HLN's Nancy Grace. Amber's family lives in the San Diego, California, suburb of Escondido, less than 10 miles from Poway High School, where King was last seen alive. The shy, bookish teen was walking to Escondido High when she disappeared. She had a check in her backpack to buy a lamb for a Future Farmers of America project, according to her mother. But she never made it, and since then, investigators have been stymied by a lack of viable leads. McGonigle says Gardner came up on her radar shortly after Amber disappeared, when she began looking up registered sex offenders in the area. ""One of the first things we did when we couldn't find her was look at the sex offenders in the area because we know that they have a history of repeated offenses,"" McGonigle said. ""I didn't personally visit his home but one of our volunteers did, and we didn't find anything that raised suspicions."" Gardner is on California's sex offender registry for a conviction of lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14, according to online records. He was also charged Wednesday with assault with intent to commit rape in connection with an attack on a jogger in December 2009. A call to Gardner's public defender, Michael Popkins, was not immediately returned. In addition to keeping the search going for her daughter, McGonigle has also become involved in educating parents and children on how to prevent abductions. She also spends time reaching out to parents of other missing children. As soon as she learned of Chelsea's disappearance, McGonigle says she contacted Chelsea's parents and assisted in search efforts. Chelsea's car, with her cell phone inside, was found at the Rancho Bernardo Community Park, where she was known to go for runs. ""Ever since Amber went missing I've reached out to all the parents I possibly can because once it happens to you, it's going to be with you the rest of your life,"" she said. ""It becomes your life. Supporting families, that's what it's all about. Even when we find Amber, I'll continue because I wouldn't want any other family to go through this."" Searchers found a body Tuesday that they believe to be King's, San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference Tuesday. He said he expected a positive identification of the body to come this week. To some in Amber's family, Chelsea's disappearance has other stinging implications. ""It's heartbreaking in another way because now we know of everything that was available to search for Amber but wasn't used,"" Sheila Welch said. ""There weren't helicopters used with heat sensitivities, there weren't any dogs brought out for Amber, and now to know that's available, it's heartbreaking to think it wasn't used."" But Benton said investigators used all the resources available to them. ""We asked for and received the resources we needed at the time,"" he said. ""As far as law enforcement is concerned, we had outstanding cooperation from local agencies, the FBI, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and we had a significant amount of resources at our disposal."" Amber's mother has her doubts as to whether Gardner could actually be involved. ""I think the guy is too sloppy and that we would've found some evidence if he had taken Amber,"" she said. ""But he never should have been out in public. If he were incarcerated, like he should have been, maybe Chelsea would be alive right now.""","Authorities probe whether John Albert Gardner III was involved in Amber DuBois' disappearance .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Zablon Simintov is always guaranteed the best seat in his local synagogue here, but the privilege comes with a downside: he's the last Jew in Afghanistan. The country's 800-year-old Jewish community -- an estimated 40,000 strong at its peak -- is now a party of one. But Simintov, for his part, isn't going anywhere soon. For more than a decade, he has refused to join his wife and two teenage daughters in Israel. ""My family call me all the time and say, 'Come here, you're the last Jew in Afghanistan, what are you doing there?' "" he says. Simintov, a former carpet dealer, refuses to answer that question. ""I don't know why I'm still living here,"" he says. ""It's God's will."" He hasn't seen his daughters -- now ages 14 and 16 -- since his one trip to Israel 12 years ago. But the bald and bespectacled Simintov says he is content guarding a cupboard full of dusty prayer books -- one is 400 years old, he says -- spending holidays with visitors from Europe and the U.S. and surviving off donations from Jews around the world. Historical evidence suggests a sizable Jewish community in Afghanistan since the Middle Ages, according to the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, a nonprofit group. Afghanistan's Jewish population reached 40,000 in the mid-19th century, the group says, and began declining around 1870 with the passage of anti-Jewish measures. Israel's creation in 1948 drew most of Afghanistan's remaining Jews. Simintov's synagogue -- the last in Afghanistan's capital -- sits inconspicuously in a courtyard behind busy city streets, though a close inspection reveals Stars of David in second-story metal railings. The interior is adorned only by broken light fixtures and ceiling fans. But Simintov says he is hardly in hiding. ""They're all like my brothers here,"" he said of his fellow Afghans. ""It doesn't make a difference whether I'm here or in Israel."" That wasn't the case under Taliban rule, which ended with the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, though Taliban forces have been resurgent in parts of the country. Simintov says he was arrested four times under Taliban rule and that he was beaten while in custody. ""The Taliban was a problem,"" he says. ""They interfered in everyone's business, but now they're gone, they're finished."" Which means that Simintov is more inclined than ever to stay put.","Afghan Jews peaked at 40,000 in mid-19th century; now there's only one left .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- They headed to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow after news broke that Michael Jackson had died. And they're still coming. Alexandra Belayeva, left, and Zhenya Iordanskaya visit the Michael Jackson memorial in Moscow. Young Russian fans, some of whom don't even speak English, bring homemade signs, pictures and drawings of Jackson, Russian religious icons, candles, teddy bears -- all signs of how much they loved the singer. ""At first I couldn't believe it had happened,"" 23-year-old Zhenya Iordanskaya said. ""I thought it was another rumor. My friend told me about it, and then I saw it on TV, on every channel. I was really in shock. And I still can't believe it."" Iordanskaya was standing in the rain Sunday with her friend Alexandra Belayeva, 20, looking at the shrine Jackson's fans have erected along the fence in front of the Embassy. Iordanskaya says she was 8 when she first heard ""Black or White."" ""I didn't understand English, but the faces of all the different people really inspired me. And the fact that he dealt with all these issues, you really have to give him credit for that,"" Iordanskaya said. Belayeva says she became a fan about three years ago. ""The way he lived his creative live really inspired me,"" she said. ""I really got into him as a person. Because you can really see the soul of a person in their creativity, can't you? It was such a shame that people put him down so much."" Belayeva says she's still in shock over Jackson's death at his California home on June 25. ""When I heard he had died, I really couldn't believe it. He was so close to us. Not one of us, but so close. He was unbelievably kind. ""It's so sad to lose a person like him. It's also so sad that he was so alone at the end of his life. People didn't understand him. But at least they recognized his genius during his life. Sometimes that doesn't happen."" Iordanskaya and Belayeva love to dance, and when they saw ""Dangerous,"" they knew they had to try it out. ""We studied his moves in that for days! We practiced. We really loved it!"" I ask the women to name their favorite Jackson songs. They roll their eyes. Where do you start? Iordanskaya starts with ""Liberian Girl."" ""Also 'Earth Song.' "" ""It's really powerful,"" she said, ""the energy and the lyrics!"" On a rainy, cold day in Moscow, Iordanskaya and Belayeva say they still cry thinking that Jackson is no longer on Earth. In the garden of flowers and mementos that sprouted almost overnight in front of the U.S. Embassy, next to eight flickering votive candles that make you feel as if you are in a Russian church, one fan has written a poem: ""You're an angel flying into the distance, you're an angel, a carefree angel, flying into the distance.""","Young Russian fans erect memorial to pop star outside U.S. Embassy in Moscow .

"(CNN) -- Several thousand barrels of North Slope crude oil spilled into a containment area along the Alaska pipeline Tuesday when an open valve at a pump station allowed oil to overflow a tank, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company said. Alyeska said the incident took place about 10:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) during a planned pipeline shutdown while the company was conducting fire command and valve leak testing at the pump station. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said a battery failed to control the valve when power was switched from the main grid during Alyeska's tests. The valve has been closed, shutting off the flow, the department said, but the pipeline remains shut down. The department said the next steps would be to clean up the oil in the containment area, determine the cause of the problem and restart oil flowing in the pipeline. No oil has been reported outside the containment area. Mark MacIntyre, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Seattle, Washington, said two EPA coordinators would arrive on the scene from Anchorage on Wednesday and have a report in the afternoon. The pump station is near Delta Junction, about 100 miles south of Fairbanks. Ayleska said the lined containment area that took the spill has a capacity of about 104,500 barrels. Ayleska also said there were no injuries and the pump station was evacuated. An incident management team and other responders were dispatched. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Several thousand barrels of oil overflow Alaska pipeline tank .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Lori Berenson, a U.S. citizen jailed in Peru since 1995 for helping leftist rebels, has been granted conditional release, a judge announced. Berenson has served nearly 15 years of a 20-year sentence for aiding Peruvian rebels in a 1995 plot to overthrow Peru's Congress. Judge Jessica Leon Yarango made the announcement Tuesday in a televised court hearing after Berenson's lawyer, Anibal Apari Sanchez, made the request. Apari, a Lima lawyer and candidate for mayor of a Lima suburb called Villa El Salvador, is also Berenson's husband from whom she is separated, according to her parents. Berenson, 40, who last year gave birth in prison to their son, Salvador, has long maintained her innocence. Her original sentence of life in prison was reduced to 20 years on appeal. The news of her release was welcomed by her parents in New York. ""My wife Rhoda and I were ecstatic,"" Mark Berenson told CNNI. ""We were waiting for this day for 14-1/2 years."" ""We are thrilled that it's been determined that she's earned her conditional liberty and that she and her baby, Salvador, will be able to take their first steps in freedom soon."" He said his daughter applied for the conditional liberty, which he referred to as parole, in September. ""The process took many months because they had to check on her work records and conduct records in all the prisons that she's been in since 1995."" He said she had been working seven days a week co-managing a prison bakery for more than five years in order to shave time from her sentence. On the Web site freelori.org, the Berensons said their daughter and her son will be leaving prison ""in a few days"" and plan to move to an apartment in Lima, because parole requires they remain in the city in which they were incarcerated. ""We do not know if there are exceptions for foreigners or whether Lori will be permitted to travel to the U.S. while on parole,"" they wrote. ""Lori will be a single mom -- Anibal and Lori are legally separated but remain friends and both share concerns for Salvador's proper upbringing,"" they wrote. ""Salvador, now an active 1-year-old boy, will certainly enjoy the opportunity to run around outside the confines of the prison. He is learning both English and Spanish but babbles continuously in 'unknown tongue.' He is a very happy child and loves to be with people.""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama used the growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to renew his pitch for alternative energy Wednesday, arguing that the unfolding environmental disaster ""gives you a sense of where we're going"" without comprehensive reform. The federal government is ""going to bring every resource necessary to put a stop"" to the spill, the president said during a visit to a solar panel manufacturing facility in Fremont, California.  ""We will not rest until this well is shut, the environment is repaired, and the cleanup is complete."" But, he added, ""a lot of damage has been done already. The spill in the Gulf, which is just heartbreaking, only underscores the necessity"" of seeking alternative fuel sources. A failure to enact comprehensive energy reform, he argued, would pose a threat to national security and the economy, as well as the environment. Obama's remarks came two weeks after Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, introduced a sweeping energy and climate change bill intended to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions while reshaping the energy sector. The House passed its own energy bill last year, and Obama has said he backs the efforts by Kerry and Lieberman to move the issue forward in the Senate. The president asked for Senate GOP cooperation on the issue during a closed-door meeting Tuesday with Republicans on Capitol Hill. However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has indicated he wants immigration reform to take priority, and the politics of midterm congressional elections in November raises questions about the the possibility of gaining final approval this year of such major legislation as energy reform. Reid's position caused a potential Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, to drop out of the talks with Lieberman and Kerry on drafting the proposal. The proposal addresses a range of energy issues, including expanded nuclear power production, incentives for the coal industry to seek cleaner methods, money to develop alternative energy sources and programs to help U.S. industry in the transition to a low-carbon system. On climate change, the measure seeks escalating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades that match the levels set as goals by the Obama administration and contained in the House bill. Among other things, the proposal calls for emissions reductions from 2005 levels of 17 percent by 2020, 42 percent by 2030 and 83 percent by 2050. The Senate proposal includes expanded offshore oil drilling as part of a strategy to increase domestic production. However, provisions strengthening the ability of states to prevent more drilling off their coasts were added in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. CNN's Tom Cohen and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Obama cites Gulf oil spill while promoting alternative energy in California .

"London, England (CNN) -- Union members representing British Airways cabin crew announced Friday they will hold two separate strikes this month in a dispute over working conditions. The first strike will last three days from March 20, and the next will last four days from March 27, said Len McCluskey, the assistant general secretary of the Unite union. There will be no strikes over the Easter period, he said. Further strikes could be called if needed, he said. Will a British Airways strike impact you? ""Regrettably, management turned down a remarkable offer,"" McCluskey said. British Airways, which lost hundreds of million dollars last year, responded by saying it is ""extremely disappointed"" with the union's decision. ""We are very sorry for the stress and disruption Unite's decision will cause,"" the airline said in a statement. ""We are currently considering our response to this strike threat and what action we will need to take to minimize disruption."" The industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions, which BA says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds ($91 million) a year. Unite has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut, changes that it has said will damage customer service and the BA brand. The two sides have been holding talks to avoid strikes. BA management submitted a formal offer to the union Thursday, Unite said, but added that the offer fails to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery. That prompted Unite officials to announce the strike dates. There is still a chance the strikes could be averted. Unite said union members will be able to vote on BA's offer on the first day of the planned strikes, and if they vote to approve it, the strikes will be canceled. British Airways declined to share details of its offer with CNN. ""Unite's action has no shred of justification,"" the airline said. ""British Airways' crew are rightly renowned for their professionalism and skills. Our entire package for crew recognizes that and is reasonable and fair."" BA said all union proposals so far would save the airline ""significantly"" less money than BA's own planned changes. ""In addition, Unite's plans would cut crew pay and allowances,"" BA said. ""The reductions required to generate sufficient savings would leave each crew member between 1,000 and 2,700 pounds ($1,516 and $4,095) a year worse off. These proposals lack credibility, and Unite did not inform crew of them when it asked them to vote for a strike."" In December, a judge blocked a planned 12-day strike by Unite over the same issues that would have started just before Christmas.","First strike will last three days from March 20, and the next four days from March 27 .

"(Wired) -- Joe Wilkins knew there was only one way to give his supercharged, alcohol-injected Hemi-engined hot rod more power: Put a jet engine in the trunk. ""It started as a hobby and turned into a monster,"" said Joe Wilkins, the motor madman behind what might be the wildest 1939 Ford ever built. He's an inventor and defense department contractor, and the idea of goosing the Ford's ability to turn heads and shred tires came when he bought a used gas turbine engine. ""I got hooked on the simplicity and power that this thing produced, and I decided one day I want to put it in a car."" Luckily for us, he did. The Hemi Jet -- Wilkins has copyrighted the name -- fires up this weekend at the Houston AutoRama, and Wilkins plans to attempt a land speed record in the near future. In the meantime, he's tooling around Navasota, Texas, in what he says is the ultimate sleeper when the jet engine's tucked away in the trunk. Most people say ""Nice car"" and assume he's got the obligatory small-block Chevrolet engine under the hood. Little do they know. ""I can drive it up to the store and get a gallon of milk if I want to,"" he told Autopia. The car is an amalgamation of the Big Three, with a Chrysler engine, Chevrolet drivetrain and Ford body. Wilkins says the jet engine was probably used as an APU and weighs 110 pounds. He claims the car is street legal so long as the jet stays stowed. He fires it up from time to time to show off, and he plans to run it flat-out at the Bonneville Salt Flats. ""We want to be the fastest street legal car in the world,"" he said. He's got some intense competition. The Bugatti Veyron tops out at 253 mph and the Shelby Supercars Ultimate Aero TT does 255. And then there's Red Vector One, that crazy Vauxhall that does zero to 60 in under a second. Record, schmecord -- we just want to see the video. ""I'm more than certain the car will go over 300,"" Wilkins said. ""We've still got a ways to go [before Bonneville], but not a long way. We'll have to experiment in some wind tunnels and end up with a spoiler on the back to keep the front end on the ground."" Sadly, Wilkins won't be behind the wheel during the car's test run. ""I turned 61 last Sunday. I just don't think I'm going to be able to handle it [without] the reflexes I had 20 or 30 years ago,"" he said. ""I know several people who would be more than interested."" So do we, and we even suggested Wilkins give the job to fellow jet-junkie Bob Maddox. After jumping from a plane with a pulse jet strapped to his chest, we suspect Maddox would welcome the opportunity to stay on the ground.

It's the first public statement from Dugard since the arrests of her suspected captors -- Phillip Garrido, 58, and his wife, Nancy, 54. The Garridos are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard, who was 11 when she was snatched from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California. She was 29 when found in August at the Garridos' home in Antioch, California, about 120 miles from her home. Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Authorities say he and his wife held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years. The Garridos have pleaded not guilty. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard's two daughters.

"(CNN)  -- A Russian heavy missile cruiser stopped three pirate ships off the coast of Somalia, and detained 10 pirates, according to a statement released Friday by Russian Navy headquarters in Moscow. Russian missile cruiser ""Peter the Great"" moored in Cape Town, South Africa, last month. The cruiser, Peter the Great, halted two small high-speed motor boats and a mid-size, support vessel on Thursday, the Russians said. ""Ten pirates have been detained. All of them are citizens of Somalia,"" the press release obtained by CNN stated. ""Officials from the Northern Fleet's military prosecutor's office are currently questioning the detainees aboard the Peter the Great. Their future will be decided in coordination with the Russian Foreign and Justice ministries."" The Russians said a Russian helicopter Ka-27, which took off from the cruiser, had located two small boats, which were moving toward an Iranian fishing vessel at high speed last Thursday. When those in the boats spotted the helicopter overhead, the boats began slowing down, then veered off toward their support vessel, which was adrift nearby. The helicopter crew could see pirates in the two motor boats throwing weapons into the sea, and kept chasing the boats until the Russian cruiser arrived in the area. ""The three boats were (captured and) delivered to the Peter the Great, and ten Somalian pirates were taken aboard. ""The detainees possessed weapons, including a G-3 rifle, an Ak-47, two AKMS machine-guns, two grenade-launchers and two anti-infantry grenades, and also had a GPS receiver, a ladder, 500 grams of drugs, a large amount of money, a bag of sugar and a bag of rice. The detained pirates were high on drugs,"" the press release said. Meanwhile, Somali pirates have released a Panamanian-flagged, Japanese-owned vessel that was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden in November, according to a non-governmental group that monitors piracy. The ship, named the MT Chemstar Venus, was released late Thursday, according to Ecoterra International.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . The 18 Filipino and five South Korean crew members were reportedly unharmed. The International Maritime Board, a group that also monitors piracy, told CNN that the company had not confirmed the release of the ship, but said shipping companies sometimes wait a few days before going public to ensure the safety of the crew. The ship was hijacked on November 15. It was unclear whether the pirates were paid a ransom to release the ship. This incident comes a week after Somali pirates released a Ukrainian ship carrying tanks, ammunition and crew after receiving a ransom of $3.2 million. -- CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Russian cruiser halted two small high-speed motor boats and a support vessel .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona couple who wanted to adopt a woman's baby know more than they're saying about the 8-month-old boy's disappearance, police say. Gabriel Johnson hasn't been seen since December 26, police said, and his mother was arrested last week in Miami Beach, Florida, after not reporting for a December 28 child custody hearing in Arizona. ""We have some good indications at this point with our investigation that Tammi and Jack Smith do know more information than they have provided to us that could possibly lead us to Gabriel,"" Sgt. Steve Carbajal, spokesman for the Tempe (Arizona) Police Department, told HLN's Nancy Grace on Thursday. For their part, the Smiths told HLN's Jean Casarez on ""Nancy Grace"" that they voluntarily took polygraph tests Friday at the Tempe Police Department. ""The polygraph test is not like what you see on TV,"" Jack Smith said. ""It's almost like being strapped into the electric chair, so it's very intensive. And we were very happy to do it."" The Smiths have said they met Elizabeth Johnson, 23, seven months ago during a long layover at an airport, and later the three discussed a plan to adopt Johnson's child, Gabriel. But the boy's father, Logan McQueary, has legal custody and has said Elizabeth Johnson urged him to sign papers giving the Smiths custody of the boy, but he refused. ""She didn't want Logan to have the baby, and we couldn't adopt the baby because Logan wouldn't sign the papers,"" Tammi Smith said on ""Nancy Grace."" ""So her idea was to just keep running forever. And we told her, 'You can't run forever. They're going to find you.' "" Elizabeth Johnson has refused to say where the boy is, according to police, and remains in a Florida jail on suspicion of custodial interference. Carbajal's department has indications that Gabriel is alive, he said, adding that the Smiths have spoken with investigators. But he declined to say why police believe that the couple has more information. The Smiths say they do not know where Gabriel is. Watch what they say about the polygraphs . Detectives have not been able to confirm that Johnson gave the child to an unidentified couple in San Antonio, Texas, as she has claimed. ""On one hand, we hear that that went down and the child was given away to an unknown couple at a park,"" Carbajal said. ""We balance that with statements made by Elizabeth that she killed Gabriel. Which story is true? Our investigators are trying to get to the bottom of that right now."" New leads and developments in the case were coming in by the minute, he said. The FBI found Johnson's car in San Antonio and have examined it for any clues that could lead them to the boy, but his whereabouts remain unknown. Anyone with more information is asked to call the Tempe Police Department at 480-350-8311 or the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST.","NEW: Would-be parents tell HLN they volunteered for polygraph tests .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- As mental health advocates, policy makers, practitioners, educators and researchers gathered at the Carter Center to discuss the progress in addressing American children's mental health needs, a drama of sorts was reaching its conclusion halfway across the country. The former first lady kicked off the 24th annual Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy. The governor of Nebraska signed a bill Friday to change a controversial safe-haven law by restricting the age at which a child could be dropped off at a hospital without parents being prosecuted. Since the law took effect in September, 35 children -- all but six of them older than 10 -- have been dropped off at Nebraska hospitals. The revised law adds a 30-day age limit; it was approved by the legislature at a special session Friday and goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. These two events appear to have little in common, but they are ""intimately related,"" according to Jane Knitzer, one of the pivotal speakers at the 24th annual Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Many of these families are families that have come to the attention of the service systems already, have been struggling since their children were young. They haven't gotten the help they need; they are feeling totally desperate. We have a system that doesn't respond early enough and with appropriate intensity."" Knitzer, director of the National Center for Children in Poverty and a clinical professor of population and family health at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, should know. Twenty-five years ago, she wrote a report that summarized, state by state, the programs available to children with mental health needs and their families, and the policies that govern them. The portrait was a bleak one, with many states not even able to identify the dollar amount budgeted for children's mental health. Twenty-five years later, the situation is improved but isn't much better, according to the report's sequel, ""Unclaimed Children Revisited: The status of children's mental health policy in the United States,"" which was unveiled at the symposium. The landscape is still one of patchwork policy and hodgepodge programs both among states and within individual states, with very few states having a cohesive strategy for addressing the needs, much less the infrastructure and funding to carry that strategy out. ""I am really distressed about how we treat children; this is something I have worked on and been concerned about for years,"" former first lady Rosalynn Carter told CNN. ""We know what to do for them, and we don't do it. When we finally do something with them is when they get in trouble. We neglect children."" Carter has been a mental health advocate since 1970, when her husband, former President Carter, was running for governor of Georgia. ""We have learned so much about children, about the developing brain and treatments that work, and we just don't use them; that is one reason this symposium is so important,"" Carter said. ""We have children's advocates from across the nation, and if we can just band together and try to do something about it. This is a really, really great time, because we have a new administration in Washington, and hopefully we can form a strong enough advocacy group and get some things changed, if not everything we'd like."" The endeavor is a giant undertaking, and the number of affected children and families is huge. Research shows that approximately one in five children has a diagnosable mental disorder ranging from ""mild,"" such as attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder, to the more severe. More than three-quarters of these children don't get the services they need, and what they do get is based purely on chance: which state they happen to live in. ""For the last 25 years, most of the leadership has come from states as opposed to having a federal system,"" explains Janis Cooper, co-author of ""Unclaimed Children Revisited."" ""That is kind of our make-up in the United States; on the other hand, there are certain things that are very hard to move without having a federal vision."" Cooper is the director of child health and mental health at the National Center for Children in Poverty and an assistant clinical professor of health policy and management at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. ""There are all kinds of consequences of untreated mental illness,"" Cooper said, from unneeded suffering to suicide to situations like the Columbine High School shootings. ""On the other end of the spectrum, untreated mental illness can cost us a lot of money in our system. If you want to talk in terms of cost effectiveness: We have a lot of kids in juvenile justice facilities, in child welfare facilities, because we are not intervening early enough with them."" That is not even counting the cost of lost productivity to society. ""We know in the mental health community that if you give children good health care before and after birth, good nurturing, good mind stimulation, they have a much better chance to grow up to be contributors to the community, well-adjusted young people,"" Carter said. ""And we just don't do it. It is very, very distressing."" There are many barriers to better mental health care for children: a lack of awareness of the issue, a lack of a unified vision from the federal government, no political will to change the situation, a lack of adequate funding and the de-stigmatization of mental illness. Progress is plodding forward. Carter, Cooper and Knitzer all pointed to the recent passage of the ""mental health parity"" provision, tacked on to the $700 billion economic bailout bill, which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness on an equal basis with physical illness. Another hopeful sign, they say, is the incoming Obama administration and its possible appointment of former Sen. Tom Daschle to be secretary of health and human services. ""My hope for the new administration is that we will be able to enact, to build, a supportive health care framework and a mental health framework that makes sense given our knowledge and given it's the 21st century,"" Knitzer said. ""And to really move forward. I am hoping that there will be support for this as we talk about health care reform."" The situation in Nebraska ""is no surprise,"" Knitzer said. ""We need to see this as an opportunity to say 'this is why we need a stronger mental health system,' not that we should only let people drop off the babies. This is a clarion call to say why it is so important that we build a mental health system that supports children and families. Because these are families that are crying out for help, and we are saying there is nobody there.""","Experts from across the country gather to discuss mental health needs of children .

"(CNN) -- Sandra Herold, the owner of a chimpanzee that was involved in a vicious attack on her friend last year, has died, her attorney said Tuesday. She was 72. Herold suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm Monday night, Roger Golger said. Herold ""had suffered a series of heartbreaking losses over the last several years, beginning with the death of her only child, then her husband, then her beloved chimp Travis, as well as the tragic maiming of friend and employee Charla Nash,"" Golger said. Nash lost her nose, upper and lower lips, eyelids and both her hands in the attack in February 2009, as well as the ""bony structures in her mid-face,"" according to doctors. More than a year later, numerous surgeries and therapy sessions have helped Nash regain some mobility. Her family filed a lawsuit against Herold shortly after the attack, seeking $50 million in damages. Criminal charges were not filed, however, because authorities ruled Herold was not aware of the risk her pet posed. ""This past year was particularly difficult for Sandy,"" Golger said. ""She hated living alone in a house where she faced constant reminders of the vibrant and happy life she once led with her family and friends. The stress of defending a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and all that it entailed also weighed heavy on Sandy. In the end, her heart, which had been broken so many times before, could take no more."" The attack occurred February 16, 2009, when Herold called Nash for help in getting Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived at the Stamford, Connecticut, home, the chimp, who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her. Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds. The mauling has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals that citizens are not allowed to own. Nash was discharged from the famed Cleveland Clinic, where doctors performed the nation's first face transplant, earlier this month. She is continuing her recovery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, where doctors have said she is a candidate for a face transplant. CNN's Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","Sandra Herold died Monday of a ruptured aortic aneurysm .

"(CNN) -- The brother of skater Nancy Kerrigan, charged with assault and battery in an incident involving his father, was released on bond, authorities said Wednesday. Mark Kerrigan posted the previously set $10,000 bail and was released from custody, according to the Woburn District Court Clerk's office in Massachusetts. Kerrigan, 45, was fitted with a tracking device and under conditions of his release is not allowed to leave his home other than to visit his attorney, the clerk's office said. He also is forbidden to use any drugs or alcohol other than prescription medication, can have no access to weapons and must have mental health counseling. ""The Kerrigan family is delighted to have Mark back with them,"" family spokeswoman Nancy Sterling said in a statement. ""They ask that you respect their privacy as they welcome Mark home."" He was arraigned in January and pleaded not guilty to charges he assaulted his father, Daniel Kerrigan, 70. The elder Kerrigan died January 24 after an alleged altercation with his 45-year-old son at the family's home in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Mark Kerrigan, through his attorney, has denied any responsibility in his father's death. Daniel Kerrigan's death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, but Middlesex County prosecutors have not said whether other charges might be filed against the younger Kerrigan in light of the finding. The Kerrigan family has said, in a statement released through their attorney, that they believe the medical examiner's finding to be ""premature and inaccurate."" ""The Kerrigan family does not blame anyone for the unfortunate death of Dan Kerrigan, who had a pre-existing heart condition,"" said the family statement, released by attorney Tracy Miner. According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley, police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. January 24 from Brenda Kerrigan, wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan. Keeley told District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son, resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor. Keeley said that Mark Kerrigan told authorities ""that he did in fact have an argument with his father, the argument became physical, he grabbed his father around the neck, and at some point the father collapsed to the floor."" According to Keeley, police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house, ""clearly intoxicated"" and ""extremely combative."" He refused to comply with police officers, said Keeley, and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home. Mark Kerrigan's attorney, Denise Moore, said in court that Kerrigan was unemployed, was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents. He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress, apparently from his time in the Army, she added. Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. In 1994 she earned an Olympic silver medal in Lillehammer, Norway. She is perhaps best remembered for surviving an attack before the 1994 Winter Games by skating rival Tonya Harding's ex-husband and an accomplice. CNN's Bob Crowley, Evan Buxbaum and Vanessa Juarez contributed to this report.","NEW: Mark Kerrigan free after posting $10,000 bail .

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams' latest tennis outfit -- a revealing black-lace corset dress with bright red straps -- has caused controversy since she wore it for her first round match at the French Open. But this is not the first time the wardrobe choices of Venus and her younger sister Serena have come under the spotlight. Ever since the pair appeared on the WTA Tour in the 1990's -- complete with multi-colored braided hair -- they have been setting, and sometimes destroying,  trends with their extroverted dress sense. From Serena's denim skirt and boot combo to Venus's designer dresses, there isn't much that the sisters have not tried to wear on the court. However, not all their outfits have been popular with the critics, least of all Venus's lace number and the skin-colored shorts that she wears underneath, which has caused quite a stir in Paris. Whatever you think of their fashion there is no doubt the Williams sisters eye-catching ensembles bring some much needed glamor to the women's game.

"(CNN) -- Seven members of the environmental group Greenpeace were arrested Monday after protesting at a private ship that the group says is scheduled to depart for Alaska this summer as part of a drilling mission. The group said it was sending a message to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to ban new drilling in the Arctic or any U.S. waters. The ship was docked at Port Fourchon, Louisiana, near the site of the massive BP oil spill that for more than a month has been gushing thousands of barrels of oil daily into the Gulf of Mexico. Photos from the scene show two protesters repelling off the side of Harvey Explorer, a 240-foot supply vessel, with one holding a sign reading ""Salazar: Ban Arctic drilling."" The activists also smeared messages -- ""Arctic next?"" -- on the boat in raw crude from the BP spill in the Gulf. The seven arrested, between ages 24 and 32, face unauthorized entry charges of a critical infrastructure and an inhabited dwelling, according to the Lafourche Parish County Sheriff's Department. They could face additional charges pending an investigation into the incident, authorities said. The protest comes as the Obama administration has decided to establish a presidential commission to investigate the disaster and look into federal oversight of offshore oil drilling, safety aboard rigs and environmental protection. Permits to drill offshore were suspended last month pending an Interior Department safety review after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drill rig. Still, the government is under pressure to issue new permits for offshore drilling as early as next week. The safety review is due this Friday, and the Obama administration will use it to help decide when and how drilling should resume. The Harvey Explorer is a vessel contracted by Shell for offshore operations off the Alaskan coast that had been scheduled for July. ""The safety and security of this contracted vessel and its crew are a top priority,"" Shell said in a statement Monday. ""While we welcome discussions regarding Shell operations, we are disappointed in the approach taken by Greenpeace today."" Greenpeace and other environmental groups argue there should be no new drilling until the investigation into the disaster is complete, which will take months. ""As long as we continue to rely on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels and offshore drilling, we can't prevent future disasters from destroying our oceans and the industries and wildlife that depend upon them,"" said John Hocevar, oceans campaign director for Greenpeace. ""Pulling the plug on plans to drill in the Arctic would be a first step towards a comprehensive ban on all new drilling in the United States,"" he said.","Greenpeace activists want interior secretary to ban new drilling .

"(CNN) -- Vaccines that can be quickly produced to fight evolving diseases such as AIDS, flu and the common cold. Algae that can be engineered to turn carbon dioxide into gasoline and diesel fuel. These are among the innovations that could result from the research of J. Craig Venter's team, which announced last week that it had created ""the first cell that is totally controlled by a synthetic chromosome."" Venter, a leader in the sequencing of the human genome, also hinted at another, more basic and less immediately practical, reason for creating synthetic life. He explained that scientists had embedded in the genetic code of the new cell three quotations, including this one from physicist Richard Feynman: ""What I cannot build, I cannot understand."" To understand life really, the quotation suggests, it's necessary to know how to create it. In a video announcing the breakthrough that was posted at TED.com, Venter describes a 15-year-long quest that ended with creation of ""the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer."" Scientists did it by designing a digital code on a computer, building a chromosome ""from four bottles of chemicals,"" assembling the chromosome in yeast cells and transplanting it into the cell of a bacterium, creating a new species. For more about Venter, click here . Venter said before the work was done, a team of experts conducted a two-year study of the ethics of creating life in a laboratory. He said the White House and other government officials have been briefed about the work -- and that White House officials favored open publication of the research, rather than deciding to classify it. The work of Venter's team has been widely hailed. The Economist said it creates the possibility of demonstrating ""mankind's mastery over nature in a way more profound than even the detonation of the first atomic bomb."" Yet it warned, ""No one now knows how easy it would be to turbo-charge an existing human pathogen, or take one that infects another type of animal and assist its passage over the species barrier. We will soon find out, though."" Venter pointed to the ""extensive work that we've done, asking for ethical review, pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side, this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community, in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government."" ""Even with this announcement, as we did in 2003 -- that work was funded by the Department of Energy -- so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House, trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it. And they came down on the side of open publication, which is the right approach. We've briefed the White House. We've briefed members of Congress. We've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances."" For another talk by Venter, click here . He said the three quotations were embedded in the genetic code to help make sure that the new synthetic form of life couldn't be mistaken for regular life. Scientists inserted the names of more than 40 authors of the research but wanted to add something ""more profound than just signing the work."" In addition to the Feynman quote, the code contains this quote from James Joyce: ""To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, and to recreate life out of life."" And this one, from ""American Prometheus,"" a biography of scientist Robert Oppenheimer: ""See things, not as they are, but as they might be.""","Scientist's team announces creation of a cell controlled by a synthetic chromosome .

"(CNN) -- The federal government has instructed BP to scale back its use of oil dispersants in the Gulf of Mexico, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday. Jackson said she believes BP's total use of dispersants can be reduced by as much as 80 percent. While the dispersants are successfully breaking up much of the oil being spilled into the Gulf, she said, ""we are making environmental tradeoffs"" and are ""deeply concerned"" about potential side effects. Jackson and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry, the federal on-scene coordinator for the oil spill response effort, told reporters that subsea use of dispersants at the source of the leak will continue. But the federal government strongly prefers to eliminate oil on the surface through a combination of burning and mechanical skimming, they said. The ""use of dispersant in the subsea means that you don't need to spray as much (on the surface),"" Jackson later explained. ""The idea from the very beginning was that if you could use it in the subsea ... you wouldn't need to spray as much on top."" Jackson's announcement came less than a week after EPA ordered BP to find another chemical dispersant to use on the oil spill after concerns arose about the long-term effects of the substance now being used. Federal officials have been seeking an alternative to the hundreds of thousands of gallons of Corexit 9500 that have been sprayed on the oil slick since April. The product has been rated less effective and more toxic than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday. Corexit 9500 includes petroleum distillates, propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonic salt, and prolonged contact with it can cause eye or skin irritation, according to the manufacturer's material data safety sheet. The document warns that ""repeated or prolonged exposure may irritate the respiratory tract."" ""I wasn't satisfied with the answer that we got"" from BP regarding possible alternatives, Jackson said. While the data compiled so far does ""not show a problem with toxicity"" as a result of the use of Corexit, it ""seems to me that a month into this and with no end in sight ... we need to ask ourselves whether there's a better product out there. And BP seemed to spend a lot of time saying why everything else didn't work."" The EPA is in the process of setting up a series of toxicity tests, Jackson said, ""to look at what's going on out there now and to look at whether there's a better choice."" Asked earlier about the company's continued use of an oil dispersant in the face of an EPA request that it use a less toxic alternative, BP official Tony Hayward said, ""Everything that we do with dispersants is with the explicit approval of the EPA."" On Monday, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen -- the Obama administration's point man for the spill -- warned reporters at the White House that the ""decision to use dispersants doesn't do away with the problem."" It simply means ""we are willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather than on land. It is a trade-off of where the impact of the oil is going to be made.""","Government instructs BP to scale back use of oil dispersants in Gulf .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If mention of The Pirate Bay conjures up images of parrots, peg legs and planks, or geeky jargon like BitTorrent and jailbreak leaves you all at sea, this handy A-Z will help you navigate the choppy waters of the online piracy debate. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" starring Hugh Jackman, was downloaded over a million times after being leaked in early April. The Screening Room's indispensable lexicon of online piracy will teach you cracking from key generators: You'll never again be caught out wondering how ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" fits into warez. A is for anti-piracy  Efforts to prevent the illegal transfer and use of copyrighted material -- often spearheaded by corporate associations like the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) -- using a variety of digital rights management (DRM) tools like encryption, product keys and serial numbers. Technologically often a step or two behind the pirates, the entertainment industry will sue for breach of copyright. B is for Bill Gates As early as 1976, Gates wrote an open letter saying that software piracy could be a problem. Ironically, he has since said that Microsoft actually benefited from piracy in China, where over 90 percent of computers use Windows, most copies of which are pirated. The widespread use of Microsoft's operating system has enabled the software giant to gain pole position in the fast-growing market. C is for cracking  Modifying software to remove copy protection -- one of the technologies companies use to prevent unauthorized reproduction of media -- to enable the illegal duplication and proliferation of pirated material on disks and online. Mostly done by hackers, not usually for money but to gain respect within the hacker community. D is for digital rights management (DRM) Access-control technologies used by manufacturers. Most pirating technology is created to circumvent various types of DRM in order to share copyrighted material online. Apple rid its iTunes library of DRM in early April, but is charging users 30 cents per song to upgrade to DRM-free tracks. E is for encryption Originally used by militaries to protect secret message transmissions, encryption allows a user to transform and ""lock"" information that, upon transfer, can only be opened by a person who has the right ""key."" Encryption software is one of many anti-piracy measures designed to prevent the spread of copying and transferring copyrighted material. F is for Free Culture movement Led by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, the movement believes restrictive copyright laws are strangling humanity's creativity. Under Lessig's ""Creative Commons"" organization, the movement is advocating for the free copying and modification of creative works -- and rejecting what they perceive to be the culturally oppressive ""permission culture"" of copyright and intellectual property. G is for Global Software Piracy  This report by the Business Software Alliance suggested that 35 percent of software installed on PCs worldwide in 2006 was pirated. H is for hackers  Hackers ""wiped,"" or erased, all the data from the Recording Industry Association of America's (RIAA) Web site in 2008. The incident, which exposed serious flaws in the RIAA's web security, was an embarrassment for the group, which represents the recording industry of the United States. I is for International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI)  According to the IFPI's 2008 Digital Music Report, up to 80 percent of data traffic via Internet service providers (ISPs) is involved in the illegal transfer of pirated material. J is for jailbreak Mostly commonly associated with the iPhone, it is the practice of downloading illicit software designed to bypass digital rights management, allowing people to upload pirated versions of official iPhone applications for free and use them on their phones. K is for key generators Small programs found on pirate sites that allow users to crack open key-locked software like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop by generating valid serial numbers for pirated copies of software that would otherwise only be included with legitimately purchased copies. L is for Limewire One of the oldest and most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing clients, Limewire is a free program used to search for and download pirated content. The program has been accused of having massive security gaps and an abundance of ""malware"" files, which contain computer viruses that infect users' computers upon completion of a download. M is for Metallica The first major band to sue for online music piracy in 2000, Metallica sued file-sharing service, Napster and three U.S. universities for enabling illegal downloading of copyrighted content. The case, which saw the rock group harshly criticized by many of its fans, was eventually settled out of court when Napster agreed to block illegal downloads of the band's songs. N is for Napster Online music-sharing service created by a college student in Boston in 1999, which spearheaded the widespread illegal copying and transferring of MP3 music files. A judge shut down the service in 2001. Napster has since relaunched as a legitimate monthly subscription music site. O is for organized crime International recording industry organization, IFPI and Interpol say there are links between online piracy and organized crime and terrorism, citing examples from South America to South Africa and Eastern Europe to East Asia. P is for P2P More than 20 times as much music is exchanged on peer-to-peer networks as is legally purchased, the Economist magazine wrote in 2008. BitTorrent is a growing P2P technology that allows the rapid downloading of large, multi-gigabyte files. Q is for quality According to a survey by the auditor Ernst and Young in India, 66 percent of people believe pirated content is of an inferior quality to the original, but 89 percent say they've used pirated music or films anyway. R is for R4 card A $30 Nintendo DS cartridge that can be loaded with hundreds of free, pirated Nintendo games, the R4 card is cheaper than the store price of many single authentic games. S is for Sweden Prosecutors in the country filed suit against The Pirate Bay Web site earlier this year for ""promoting other people's infringement of copyright laws."" Dubbed the ""Internet piracy trial of the decade"" by UK newspaper The Times, the verdict against the site will have massive implications for the future of online file-sharing, but The Pirate Bay's founders plan to appeal and have previously said that the site will stay up and running. T is for The Pirate Bay A very popular file-sharing Web site primarily used as a linking site to find and download pirated movies, music, video games, applications and more. It tracks BitTorrents -- file sharing protocols that enable big, fast file transfers. The Pirate Bay's founders have constantly argued that the Web site does not violate copyright law because the site does not host any copyrighted material, but simply provides a service by indexing the BitTorrents. U is for Usenet.com Regarded as a source of much pirated material, this bulletin board site is being sued by the RIAA. Unlike The Pirate Bay, Usenet allows paying customers to download files in a way that is nearly impossible to track. But, like the Swedish site, Usenet has had to defend itself from charges that it encourages its users to violate copyright law. V is for video games The Entertainment Software Association says the industry loses $3 billion annually to online piracy. W is for ""Warez"" Slang for any movies, music, applications or any other materials being traded in violation of copyright law. X is for ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" A version of the upcoming blockbuster leaked online in March this year, the film has already been downloaded over a million times. The FBI says it is investigating the source of the leak, and the film's star Hugh Jackman has spoken out, calling the leak ""a serious crime,"" and ""heartbreaking."" Y is for YouTube  The ubiquitous video site has been sued by major companies like Viacom for publishing and proliferating unauthorized video content online. YouTube has responded by removing copyrighted content, but popular clips of television programs are often reposted by users as soon as they are taken down. Z is for Zune Microsoft's answer to the iPod plans to make its entire catalogue of music DRM-free, which will make it even easier to copy and share copyrighted music.","A run-down of the biggest online piracy moments since Napster in 1999 .

"(CNN)  -- It's interesting how many people have swallowed the BP public relations' bait to call the explosion from Deepwater Horizon oil rig the Gulf oil spill. We need to call it what it is: the BP oil spill. The federal government needs to take control and take punitive action against BP and any negligent government regulators immediately. As a concerned citizen, preparedness speaker and author, and former commander of federal troops in disaster response, I watched with interest as BP brought out its big PR guns to protect its brand and its platoon of expert engineers, paid by BP to talk about how it happened and how they intended to fix it. BP's reaction was much like Toyota's when it was confronted with safety issues. It, too, focused on PR to protect its brand, versus telling the truth, and sent out its engineers to talk about the problem and the fix. The U.S. Coast Guard was the first responder. The Coast Guard's priority always is to save lives. They spent days looking for the 11 missing men. Meanwhile, BP took advantage of this time to make itself the authoritative voice in the news about the spill and blame other companies. The  U.S. government response was based on laws and rules that were created after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. After Valdez, the law changed to make the offending company responsible for the cleanup. A fund was created that all oil companies contributed to. If there was an emergency oil spill, a company could draw  up to $75 million from this fund to fix the problem.  But the fund was meant to help small wildcat operations, not huge conglomerates like BP. Sticking to that regulation was part of the problem. The No. 1 rule when dealing with disaster is to figure out which rules you need to break. Rules are designed for when everything is working. A democracy is based on trust. BP has proved it can't be trusted. iReporters share views on oil spill response . The government needs to change the game and make this a punitive effort. The government has been too friendly to oil companies. The government should immediately freeze BP's assets and start to charge the corporation -- say $100 million -- each day the oil flows. The money could be held in a fund that U.S. government draws on to take care of the people along the Gulf Coast and pay the states for doing the cleanup. Next, BP and the government bureaucrats who broke a law and put the public at risk need to go to jail. I remember when we were evacuating New Orleans on Saturday following Katrina. We pushed the survivors to the airport and a major called and said the pilots refused to fly the plane without a manifest and there was trouble with weapons scanners. I told him to direct everyone to put the people on the planes as fast as possible, and we would to do the manifest en route or on landing. As a result, we flew 16,000 people out of NOLA airport in less than seven hours. The priorities of the response to the spill must be to stop the flow of oil, prevent the oil from getting into the shoreline as much as possible, mitigate the effects of the oil in the ocean, and take care of the people who have lost their source of employment, such as  fishermen and those in the tourist industry. BP's job is to focus on stopping the flow of oil. The government needs to provide more military ""command and control"" of the situation. As BP works to stop the gusher, the government must address the problem of the oil coming ashore and take care of the people affected, possibly retraining them in other jobs. The government could do this by using the Stafford Act to fund the states so they can  protect their shoreline and clean up the oil. Then, the long-term effects of the spill must be mitigated. The people of the Gulf Coast, particularly South Louisiana, are still recovering from Katrina. They've been through hurricanes Rita, Gustav and Ike. They know hurricane season is right around the corner and this BP oil spill has the potential to get much worse. And they don't trust BP. In fact, the latest curse going around in southern Louisiana today is, ""BP you."" Punitive action must start immediately, with BP supplying the money, from fines, to help the Gulf Coast get over this catastrophe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russel Honoré.","Gen. Russel Honoré: This disaster is the BP oil spill, not the Gulf oil spill .
BP should be fined, he says, even $100 million, each day the oil is gushing .
Money from fines should be used to help Gulf Coast and its people recover, Honoré says .

"(CNN) -- A Toyota Prius was not the cause of a March 9 crash in Harrison, New York, said authorities citing ""black and white"" results in their investigation. Harrison, New York, Police Capt. Anthony Marraccini revealed at a news conference Monday that evidence extracted from the wrecked 2005 Prius' data recorder showed no indication of brake compression as the car headed toward a stone wall. Rather, the accelerator was pressed 100 percent, authorities said. Marraccini said the data, which he described as ""black and white,"" was collected in a cooperative effort between Harrison police, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Toyota. ""Toyota has been very cooperative,"" said Marraccini. ""There's no possibility of any distortion of this data,"" he continued. ""These are the facts that surround this."" A housekeeper was driving the car at the time of the accident. She told police the vehicle accelerated on its own as she eased forward down her employer's driveway, causing her to crash into a stone wall on the other side of the road. The incident, which did not involve other vehicles nor injuries to anyone, drew attention because the 2005 Prius was part of Toyota's November recall to address the risk of pedal entrapment in the floor mat. But police said early on that floor mats were not a factor in this accident. A recall to address a sticky accelerator problem did not include the Prius. Monday's announcement corroborates a NHTSA statement from early in the investigation, explaining that ""information retrieved from the vehicle's onboard computer systems indicated there was no application of the brakes and the throttle was fully open."" The statement suggested at the time that the driver may have been stepping on the accelerator, instead of the brake as she told police. ""We do see these accidents on occasion,"" Marraccini said Monday. ""I think with all this hype about Toyota, people are just looking to point fingers,"" he said. Marraccini said that he spoke with the housekeeper about the findings of the investigation, but she remains ""very passionate about her statement."" ""When a driver believes they are on the brake pedal, they believe it. But there is no indication of that,"" Marraccini said. Toyota spokesman Wade Hoyt called the investigation ""thorough"" and ""conscientious,"" and praised authorities for their ""really outstanding piece of detective work."" CNN's Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","The wrecked 2005 Prius' data recorder showed no indication of brake compression.

"(CNN) -- The coming summer and fall could be an ""active to extremely active"" hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, U.S. forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted. There is a 70 percent chance that three to seven major hurricanes will swirl in the Atlantic in the six months following the start of the hurricane season on June 1, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. ""If this outlook holds true, this season could be one of the more active on record,"" said Jane Lubchenco, the under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, and NOAA's administrator. The forecast predicts between 14 and 23 storms with top winds of 39 mph or higher, the threshold for tropical storm status. It predicts eight to 14 of those will become named hurricanes, with winds topping 74 mph or higher, and three to seven of those will become major ones, meaning Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Category 3 storms have sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Forecasters have said that El Nino conditions will dissipate by summer and that unusually warm tropical Atlantic surface temperatures will persist, leading to favorable conditions for hurricanes to develop and intensify. A report released in April by Colorado State University's forecasters William Gray and Phil Klotzbach also said that this year's hurricane season could be difficult, but they predicted only 15 named storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes. Gray and Klotzbach will issue a revised forecast next Wednesday. A typical season has 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The hurricane season ends November 30, although later storms have been known to happen. Last year's hurricane season was below average, with only nine named tropical storms, three of which were hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center said it was the lowest number of tropical storms for the Atlantic basin since 1997.","NOAA predicts three to seven ""major"" hurricanes in the Atlantic .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will deploy up to 1,200 more National Guard troops to the U.S. border with Mexico, an administration official told CNN on Tuesday. In addition, Obama will request $500 million to supplement current spending for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities, the official said. The National Guard troops will help with drug enforcement efforts and intelligence efforts until Customs and Border Protection can recruit and train additional officers and agents to serve on the border, the official said. The news followed Obama's lunch meeting with Senate Republicans, where Sen. John McCain of Arizona raised the issue of increased border security. McCain and fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, as well as Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, have called for Obama to send more troops to the border region. ""It's simply not enough,"" McCain said Tuesday on the Senate floor. He called for 3,000 more National Guard troops just for the Arizona-Mexico border. Giffords, who had called for the National Guard's deployment immediately after the March 27 murder of Cochise County rancher Rob Krentz, said Obama's step was ""the right thing."" ""Arizonans know that more boots on the ground means a safer and more secure border,"" Giffords said in a written statement. ""Washington heard our message."" A previous troop deployment to the border region, called Operation Jump Start, ended in 2008. The operation sent more than 6,000 troops to California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to repair secondary border fence, construct nearly 1,000 metal barriers and fly Border Patrol agents by helicopter to intercept illegal immigrants. The Mexican Embassy issued a statement later Tuesday saying the additional National Guard troops should help prevent the illegal flow of weapons and cash into Mexico. It also said Mexico ""expects that National Guard personnel will strengthen U.S. operations in the fight against transnational organized crime that operates on both sides of our common border and that it will not, in accordance to its legal obligations, conduct activities directly linked to the enforcement of immigration laws.""","NEW: Mexico says additional U.S. troops at border should battle organized crime, not illegal immigration .

"(Mashable) -- According to Apple's latest commercial, ""iPad goes anywhere"" -- anywhere, that is, except for Yankee Stadium. Yahoo Sports confirmed with the stadium that the iPad falls under its ""no laptops"" security policy and patrons won't be able to enter the ballpark with one in their possession. Say what? The TSA says that you don't have to take an iPad out of its case to go through security, but Yankee Stadium says the device is a no-go? The discussion surrounding the ban was spurred by a message from Spacekatgal on the IGN Boards. Spacekatgal tried to bring her iPad in to the Yankee/Red Sox game, only to be turned away at the gate. Undeterred, she did re-enter the stadium with her iPad in her jacket, but the ban exists all the same. While you can reasonably ask why someone would want to bring an iPad -- or any electronic device aside from a cellphone, for that matter -- into a ballgame, the outright ban of such a device strikes us as odd, especially given that Wi-Fi is available throughout the complex. In any event, if you want to bring an iPad to Yankee Stadium this summer (assuming you're sitting in the shade), you might want to make sure you've got a bag or windbreaker that can mask said device from the security guards. Or you could just leave the gadgets at home and watch the game. © 2010 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","The iPad falls under the stadium's ""no laptops"" security policy .

"(CNET)  -- Are you confused by the myriad changes Facebook keeps making to its privacy settings? Are you angry about your data being exposed without your express consent? Are you just fed up and not going to take it anymore? You're not alone. A recent poll from Sophos found that an estimated 60 percent of users are considering quitting Facebook over privacy issues. More than 11,000 people have committed to ditching the social-networking site on May 31, according to QuitFacebookDay.com. And more people are searching Google for ways to delete their Facebook accounts than ever, according to the Search Engine Land blog. But leaving Facebook can be almost as confusing as navigating the privacy backwaters on the site. Here are some tips on deleting your account and answers to questions about what that means for your data, and more. What's the difference between deleting and deactivating a Facebook account? Deactivation means the profile information and content are hidden from view of others but are saved on Facebook servers in case you want to reactivate the profile. Messages you've sent and Wall posts remain, but your name appears in black text that is not clickable since your profile is now hidden. Deleting an account removes it from the site permanently and you have to start from scratch if you decide later that you want to be on Facebook again. There is a 14-day delay before the data is completely deleted to give users time to change their mind. If you change your mind you can merely log into the account and the deletion request will be canceled. How do I deactivate my account? Click the Account tab in the upper right-hand corner of your main page. The Settings tab should be highlighted and there is a Deactivate link at the very bottom of the list. When you click it, you will be asked if you are sure you want to deactivate your account and why you are doing so. You will also be shown photos of you with friends with accompanying messages that say ""(Your friend here) will miss you."" There is also a box to check at the bottom to opt out of receiving e-mails from Facebook if friends tag you in photos or invite you to join the site. How do I delete my Facebook account? It's not as easy to find out how to delete your account. I clicked on the Account tab and then Help Center and typed in ""delete account"" in the search window. Under the question prompt ""How do I permanently delete my account"" there is a link to this page where you can click the Submit button or the Cancel button. What happens to my data after I delete my account? According to this Facebook Help Center page all personally identifiable information associated with your account will be purged from Facebook's database if you choose to permanently delete the account. ""This includes information like your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and IM screen name,"" the site says. ""Copies of some material (photos, notes, etc.) may remain in our servers for technical reasons, but this material is disassociated from any personal identifiers and completely inaccessible to other users. Facebook also does not use content associated with accounts that have been deactivated or deleted."" I asked a Facebook spokesman why copies would need to be kept at all and for how long, exactly when all traces of the data are gone entirely, and whether any data remain on any servers of partners, and if so for how long? Here is his reply: . ""When a photo or video is deleted, or when a person deletes his or her account, we quickly delete all of the metadata for the photo as well as any and all tagging and linking information. For all practical purposes, the photo no longer exists, and we wouldn't be able find it if we were asked or even compelled to do so. This is similar to what happens when you delete information from the hard drive of your computer. Technically, the bits that make up the photo persist somewhere, but, again, the photo is impossible to find. It's possible that someone who previously had access to a photo and saved the direct URL from our content delivery network partner (this is different from the Facebook URL) could still access the photo. However, again, the person would have to know the URL, and the photo only exists in the CDN's (content delivery network's) cache for a limited amount of time."" If I'm not ready to leave Facebook what can I do? You can shore up your privacy settings and hope that Facebook doesn't make any new modifications that will undo what you've specified. There are several tools that can automatically check your Facebook settings and set them to the most private option, including browser bookmark tool SaveFace and a Facebook privacy scanner available at ReclaimPrivacy.org. Or you can do it yourself in a number of steps. First, make sure the default setting for different types of information you have on your page -- particularly Posts by Me -- is not set to the default of ""everyone,"" which means everyone on the Internet. Click the Account tab at the top right of your profile page and click Privacy Settings. From there you can set the information in Personal Information and Posts, as well as Contact Information, and Friends, Tags, and Connections to a range of options from ""everyone"" to ""only me."" You also need to set privacy for each of your photo albums, under the Personal Information and Posts section. Under the Search option you can specify who can see your search result on Facebook and allow or disallow search engines to display a preview of your Facebook profile. The Applications and Websites section lets you control how much of your information friends and applications can see and share. There you can opt out of the Instant Personalization setting, which allows partner sites like Yelp and Pandora to provide a customized experience when you visit their sites based on your Facebook activities. To block ads from sharing your information you can click Account Settings from the top-right Account tab on your main page and click the Facebook Ads tab and switch it to the default ""only my friends"" to ""no one."" The Huffington Post has a helpful video that walks through all of these steps. And if you want to just make a statement but not leave the site, you can join the Facebook Protest movement and avoid logging on June 6. What other social-networking sites are there? Wikipedia has a long list of potential alternatives, but none of them are as popular as Facebook, which boasts 400 million active users. A social network is only as useful as the number of friends or relevant contacts it has and it would be tough to get your friends to move en masse to another site. One upcoming promising option is Diaspora, which calls itself ""the privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all distributed open-source social network"" and was started in response to the Facebook's problems. The creators are raising money to finish the site and had reached the $100,000 mark on May 13, but it's unclear when it will be up and running. What does Facebook say about all of this? Company executives realize there is a backlash and that they've got a public relations problem on their hands. They held a companywide meeting last week to assuage the concerns of the rank and file. A Facebook spokesman said he could not provide an executive to discuss the privacy issues with CNET this week. However, Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of public policy, answered reader questions on The New York Times site last week. ""Clearly, we need to rethink the tempo of change and how we communicate it,"" he said. ""Trust me. We'll do better."" Asked why the company doesn't put the control in the hands of its users with an opt-in policy, Schrage said: ""Everything is opt-in on Facebook. Participating in the service is a choice...Please don't share if you're not comfortable. That said, we certainly will continue to work to improve the ease and access of controls to make more people more comfortable."" What does the government say? So far, there have been no Congressional hearings or battle cries from Washington, D.C., but there have been some complaints lodged. More than a dozen privacy and consumer groups complained to then Federal Trade Commission about Facebook late last year. And more recently, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York has asked the agency to question Facebook about its privacy practices. What's all the fuss, anyway? This interactive site entitled ""The Evolution of Privacy on Facebook"" shows visually exactly how site changes to the privacy settings over time have encroached on users' privacy, revealing more of their data to more and more people. Facebook is obviously making a business decision to expose more member content that can be monetized. Web surfers are used to dealing with the privacy versus profit trade-off, but what really irks them is that with each modification, users have to go back in and redo their settings or risk having photos, contact information, and other data exposed to the public that they want only friends to see. Ted Weinstein, a San Francisco-based literary agent, said he is annoyed that Facebook keeps changing the rules on privacy and he has removed almost everything from his profile bit by bit. But he's reluctant to entirely cut ties with all of his contacts on the site. ""I don't want to throw those (Facebook contact) linkages away lightly. So I have removed material I'm not comfortable having everybody I've ever connected with having access to,"" he said in an interview. ""I don't have confidence that Facebook won't make changes that make my prior settings irrelevant."" © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States hopes cool, careful language will keep the North Korean crisis from boiling over. The United States has been vocal in condemning North Korea for what it calls an act of aggression and provocation in the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors. But you won't hear American officials call this ""an act of war."" In fact, from President Obama on down the chain of command in this latest Korean crisis, the word ""war"" is missing in action. Obama set the tone, offering support and condolences to the South Koreans in March. Once an international investigation concluded last week that the patrol ship Cheonan was sunk by a North Korean torpedo, a White House statement called the ship sinking ""an act of aggression ... one more instance of North Korea's unacceptable behavior and defiance of international law."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hit the same notes during her trip to China. ""We are working hard to avoid an escalation, belligerence and provocation,"" Clinton said Monday. ""This is a highly precarious situation that the North Koreans have caused in the region and it is one that every country that neighbors or is in proximity to North Korea understands must be contained."" Washington is standing with South Korea's decision to halt trade agreements with North Korea. The United States also is emphasizing -- in both words and deeds -- its military ties to South Korea, including an announcement Monday at the Pentagon that the U.S. and South Korean militaries would conduct joint anti-submarine exercises. And the administration is holding its South Korean ally close. Clinton will be in Seoul on Wednesday, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates will meet his counterpart in coming weeks, while Obama will see South Korean President Lee Myung-bak at the Group of 20 conference of developed countries in Canada in June. But while White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday that U.S. support for the defense of South Korea is ""unequivocal,"" he didn't mention war. ""Specifically, we endorse President Lee's demand that North Korea immediately apologize and punish those responsible for the attack, and, most importantly, stop its belligerent and threatening behavior,"" Gibbs said in a prepared statement. North Korea has denied it was responsible for the March 26 sinking and has threatened to back out of a nonaggression pact between the two Koreas. Despite that pact and the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, the North and South technically remain at war. And North Korea has a huge standing army; it bristles with missiles and has tested nuclear weapons twice, in 2006 and 2009. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said last week the sinking of the ship was a violation of the armistice, but he chose the phrase ""act of aggression."" ""As we've made clear, this was a clear and compelling violation of the existing armistice. It was without doubt a hostile act. It was provocative. It was unwarranted. I think our characterizations are broadly consistent,"" Crowley said. Over at the Pentagon, Gates and Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both sidestepped questions about whether what North Korea did constitutes an act of war. ""Well, first of all, we certainly support the findings of the Korean -- the South Korean investigation,"" Gates said last week. ""We obviously are in close consultation with the Koreans. The attack was against one of their ships. And we will -- naturally they would have the lead in determining the path forward. They've laid out some paths forward, and we will be consulting very closely with them as we move ahead."" Mullen was equally evasive. ""Certainly we're concerned about it. We've supported them. We've helped them in the investigation, and we agree with the conclusion. They're a great friend and great ally, and we'll continue to do that,"" Mullen said. Nicholas Szechenyi, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN, ""If you respond to bombastic rhetoric with equally hot rhetoric, chances are this could escalate."" ""This is a very sensitive period,"" Szechenyi said in a telephone interview. ""You have to be very careful in forming a response because North Korea is so unpredictable. You don't want this crisis to develop into all-out war."" And Bruce Klingner, a northeast Asia analyst at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, said avoidance of the phrase ""act of war"" is both a question of how legal experts may evaluate what happened according to international rules -- and one of caution about fanning the flames. ""It may be both definitional as well as concerns about inflammatory language,"" Klingner said. He said the U.S. was taking an appropriate tack in supporting South Korea. But he pointed out that the South Koreans themselves, outraged by the ship's sinking and loss of life, are treading carefully. ""The Korean people are angry, but not angry enough to bring about an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula,"" Klingner said.","Term ""act of war"" is missing in U.S. response to sinking of South Korean warship .

"(InStyle.com) -- Think of a swimsuit as your strategic dare-to-bare ally: Find one in a flattering color and cut, and it can give you the confidence you'll want when it's time to drop the towel. There's no getting around the fact that swimsuit shopping can be a major drag, but if you put your mind to it, you will find a suit that downplays what you don't love and highlights what you do. Maximize a small bust . Underwires, boning and padding add shape and fullness to your chest, says stylist Julie Weiss, who has worked with Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Gabrielle Union. Just be sure that any padding is subtle and, once wet, doesn't show through. InStyle.com: Lose muffin top in 3 weeks . Ruffles, like shirring, can also be a plus, since they can make any area look bigger. Also consider the art of distraction. Jeanne Yang, who has styled Katie Holmes and Brooke Shields, says a top with a funky pattern, polka dots or embellishments will camouflage a petite chest. Minimize a large bust . In a top, don't be tempted to go too small: Spillage along the sides will just make the chest look bigger. And keep in mind that suits run about two sizes smaller than your clothing size. InStyle.com: 12 ways to look thinner by tonight . An underwire or built-in bra gives structure and support, says Weiss. Seek out bra sizing in bathing suit tops for a more accurate fit. And when you're trying on either one or two-pieces, make sure the straps are sturdy. Keyhole or string-bikini triangle tops and demi bras aren't ideal for big busts, says Yang, since they don't provide enough coverage or support. Banish belly bulge . A plunging halter top draws the eye up and away from any pooch below. Details or a bold pattern on the midsection can also be positively distracting -- a busy print keeps the eye moving so it doesn't settle on a less-than-flat tummy. InStyle.com: How stars get bikini-ready . In one-piece styles, look for extras like built-in tummy control panel or a suit that has significantly more spandex; the Miraclesuit, for instance, has up to three times more than the usual swimsuit. In terms of two-pieces, a tankini is probably a better choice than a bikini. In either style, make sure that any elastic in the waistband does not cause belly spillover. Lower body help . A high cut in the leg (but nothing higher than the hip bone) helps heavy thighs look slimmer. Leave boy shorts at the store - -they make the derrière and thighs look bigger. Also pass on any prints and ruffles on the lower half that draw attention to the rear. Emphasize your top with color blocks, light colors or embellishment at the chest--they'll draw the eye away from a heavier bottom. And consider mix and matching bikini pieces: Wear a print on top and a dark solid on the lower half, or white on top and black on the bottom. See more fashion coverage at InStyle.com .

"(CNN) -- Love was present everywhere at the University of Virginia's Klockner Stadium on Sunday -- in the stands, over the loudspeaker and on the field. ""One Team; One Heart; One Love,"" read the warm-up T-shirts that members of the school's women's lacrosse team wore. Spectators waved a sign reading ""No. 1 Yeardley in our hearts."" At the end of the game, as the team celebrated its 14-12 victory over Towson University, the song ""Believe"" by Cher played over the stadium sound system. Its lyrics: ""Do you believe in life after love?"" The tribute was in honor of slain teammate Yeardley Love, the 22-year-old senior found dead in her off-campus apartment on May 3. A former boyfriend and member of the school's men's lacrosse team, George Huguely, has been charged with first-degree murder in her death. Sunday's game in the first round of the NCAA championship tournament was the first the team had played since Love's death, and the day was marked with remembrance. The Virginia team wore black patches on the front of their jerseys with one word: Love. The Towson team wore orange armbands stitched with her initials Y.L. Love's mother and sister, Sharon and Lexie Love, were present in the stands to honor the game she loved. ""I think we're exhausted, we're drained and I think it's never felt so good to win a game,"" head coach Julie Myers told ESPNU after defeating Towson. ""Not only is it an NCAA game, but just to get this hurdle cleared over -- the kids did a great job."" After celebrating the win at midfield, the team surprised those in the stands by emerging from their huddle holding signs emblazoned with the number 1.

"New York (CNN) -- Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik arrived at the federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, Monday to begin a 48-month prison sentence, prison authorities said. Kerik reported to the medium-security facility, which houses some 500 inmates, at approximately 1 p.m. ET, authorities said. Kerik -- nominated by President George Bush in 2004 to be homeland security adviser, only to later withdraw from consideration -- was sentenced to four years in prison last February. He pleaded guilty to charges including lying to Bush administration officials during his 2004 nomination. Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said Kerik will be expected to perform a number of manual jobs including plumbing, landscaping and food service at the prison, which also has a minimum security camp. On the eve of his imprisonment, Kerik maintained his prosecution was unjust, and said he had to prepare his two daughters, ages 7 and 10, for his departure. ""Words cannot express my disappointment in the prosecutors and the judge's behavior, and his sentence that followed,"" Kerik wrote on his blog Sunday. ""I have repeatedly expressed remorse for what I may have done, however, unlike many, I can't remain silent in the face of what I believe has been a gross injustice, which I pray will be remedied by an appellate court."" He said he made his two daughters watch the movie ""Rocky Balboa"" for the scene in which Sylvester Stallone's character tells his son that the world can be an unfair place but one has to persevere. ""As I prepare to serve my sentence, I have had to likewise prepare Angelina and Celine, my 7- and 10-year-old daughters for what is next to come, and had to teach them that there are times when we are put in situations which are beyond our control and that no matter how undeserved, unsought, or unwanted, we must find the strength, courage, and perseverance to carry on and move forward."" Kerik, 54, pleaded guilty in November to tax fraud and six other felonies. He has been under house arrest in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, since then. In court papers, prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was ""any possible concern"" about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating his apartment or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors. Kerik had been scheduled to go to trial on various corruption charges, including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale, New York, apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York. He pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax-related counts in November. Kerik was New York police commissioner from 1998 to 2002, a tenure that included the September 11, 2001, attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people. He spent a brief stint in Iraq training the country's police force after the U.S. invasion in 2003, and President Bush nominated him to be homeland security secretary in 2004. However, Kerik withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had employed a nanny with a murky immigration status. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while working as city corrections commissioner. Under his plea agreement, he paid $221,000 in fines and avoided jail time. His admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said his endorsement of Kerik had been ""a mistake."" Kerik made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to Bush in 2008, according to court papers released in October. Kerik's sentence exceeded the 27- to 33-month prison term recommended by federal prosecutors. ""With great power comes great responsibility and comes great consequences,"" said U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson during the sentencing on February 18. Kerik ended his blog post Sunday, saying: ""Finally, I can only hope that history will judge me based on my 30 years of public service to our great nation, and not by tabloid headlines, my imperfections, or the mistakes that I may have made.""","NEW: Ex-New York police commissioner turns himself in to begin 4-year sentence .

"(CNN) -- A woman who pleaded guilty to kidnapping Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart in 2002 -- and attempting to kidnap Smart's cousin a month later -- will be sentenced for both offenses in state and federal court Friday. Wanda Eileen Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in Smart's kidnapping. As part of that plea agreement, she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband, Brian David Mitchell, federal prosecutors have said. Barzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy in the company of Barzee and Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. Federal prosecutors have recommended Barzee be sentenced to 15 years in prison in exchange for cooperation against Mitchell. In state court in February, Barzee pleaded guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in the attempted kidnapping of Smart's cousin. In exchange for her plea, prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart's abduction, said Nancy Volmer, spokeswoman for Utah state courts. The month after Smart was kidnapped, prosecutors alleged, Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin, but were unsuccessful. The girl was 15 years old at the time, according to CNN affiliate KSL-TV. She is not named in court documents. ""Mr. Mitchell's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened, which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee,"" the court documents say. After her arrest in 2003, Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home to abduct the girl, and planned to hold her, along with Smart, in the couple's camp in the mountains, according to court documents. Barzee faces between one and 15 years in state prison. But prosecutors have agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with her federal sentence if she cooperates with the case against Mitchell, said Mark Biljanic, spokesman for the Salt Lake County district attorney's office. The federal sentencing will be held first Friday, at 10:30 a.m., followed by the state court sentencing at 1 p.m. When she entered pleaded guilty to Smart's kidnapping in federal court, Barzee apologized to Smart, according to a transcript. ""I'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry, Elizabeth, for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family. It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day."" Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell's. After years of being declared incompetent, she recently was declared competent to stand trial, according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper. A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple, the Tribune said. At a competency hearing for Mitchell in October, Smart, now 21, testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California. Just after her abduction, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her, she said. During the nine months of her captivity, Smart testified, no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell. In March, U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball ruled Mitchell competent to stand trial. His federal trial is set to begin November 1. State court proceedings against him are on hold pending the outcome of the federal case.","Wanda Barzee to be sentenced Friday on federal kidnapping, state attempted kidnapping charges .

"Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he will urge President Obama to veto a coming $726 billion defense authorization bill if it contains funding for unwanted projects Gates has been trying to cut for years. Gates has been vocal about financial reform at the Pentagon, trying to rein in some big-ticket contracts and telling Congress to stop spending money on C-17 transport planes that are not needed and a $485 million alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The JSF engine program -- already delayed and over budget -- could end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars, according to Gates. But with jobs at stake, Congress has ignored those requests for years and continued to appropriate funds for the C-17 and a second F-35 engine. ""The detailed conditions they [Congress] have imposed on the overall JSF program would make it essentially un-executable and impose unacceptable schedule and budget costs,"" Gates said Thursday at a Pentagon briefing. ""As I have stated repeatedly, should the Congress insist on adding funding for a costly and unnecessary JSF extra engine or direct changes that seriously disrupt the JSF program, or impose additional C-17 aircraft, I will strongly recommend that the president veto such legislation,"" he said. The Pentagon believes the proposal for the new engine, made by General Electric, would end up costing about $2.9 billion which includes re-working the engine already being tested because there is concern it does not meet the performance needs for the F-35. Those costs would be picked up by taxpayer dollars, according to Pentagon estimates. Additionally the contract for the new proposal by Congress would require cutting the purchase of the current engine by half to let the General Electric engine purchase catch up, according to Gates. ""Only in Washington does a proposal where everybody wins get considered a competition, where everybody is guaranteed a piece of the action at the end,"" Gates said. ""Yes, we're in favor of competition, but my idea of competition is winner takes all, and we don't have that kind of a situation here,"" he continued. The House Armed Services Committee passed the bill Wednesday. The bill must be approved by the entire House then matched by a Senate version and signed by Obama before becoming law.","Gates wants veto of defense spending bill if projects he deems unnecessary remain .

"Clarksburg, West Virginia (CNN)  -- North Central West Virginia Airport boasts quick check-ins, free, accessible parking and a convenient baggage claim. That's not surprising, considering that fewer than 20 people fly out of the facility on any given day. And all three scheduled daily departures to Washington have a stop in Morgantown, West Virginia, only 35 miles away. But the airport offers a special treat as the end of the year approaches -- free sightseeing flights. Thanks to a Federal Aviation Administration program that gives small regional airports millions of dollars if they can reach a certain level of passenger traffic, the Clarksburg, West Virginia, facility tries its best to get 10,000 passengers off the ground by the end of the year. For Suzanne Pierson, that meant she and her grandson Donavan got an ""awesome"" bird's-eye view of Clarksburg and neighboring Bridgeport, West Virginia, from a chartered Boeing 757 last December. ""They were trying to meet the quota, and they were 300 passengers short,"" said Pierson, who saw an ad placed by the airport advertising the free flights. Since the difference between 10,000 and 9,999 is the difference between $1 million and $150,000 in federal funds, airport managers in Clarksburg and other small towns do whatever they can to get over that number. In Kearney, Nebraska, residents get to take aerial tours of the city's Christmas lights for $15. In Altoona, Pennsylvania, residents got free 10-minute flights to reach the local airfield's goal of 10,000 passengers. Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who is a frequent critic of federal spending, said ""about 40"" airports are believed to offer similar flight programs to reach the threshold, which was set by Congress. Coburn is asking the FAA and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to come up with a definitive figure. ""The whole purpose for that isn't to say what you're doing is illegal -- it's probably not -- but to have a more cogent policy that truly represents the needs based on enplanements for every airport,"" Coburn said. He said federal support for small airports like Clarksburg's ""should be earned in terms of grant process,"" not by gaming the system. ""We created the incentive to kind of weasel on it so you can get more money, and it's exacerbated now because of the economic downturn,"" Coburn said. Clarksburg is about 200 miles west of Washington and about 110 miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where most area residents catch flights when they travel by air. But airport director Rick Rock said an economic benefit analysis said the facility contributes about $395 million into the local economy, ""So I definitely think there's no question that we need this airport."" In addition to the $1 million based on passenger traffic, the Clarksburg airport got $30 million to lengthen its runway in 1999 and another $1.6 million from the Obama administration's economic stimulus bill in 2009. Local students get free flights to Washington for school trips as well, Rock said. And the airport just got another $150,000 grant from the FAA to promote itself. Rock said the money is needed to meet FAA mandates for security, runway paving and safety, and he's proud of what the facility has achieved -- particularly for students. ""We're trying to introduce aviation to them at a young age, so they can look at it as a career,"" he said. ""A lot of these kids have never had the chance to fly. We've been able to share that opportunity, and the kids love it. It's special."" But Coburn said at least five airports have used ""creative ways"" to keep the money flowing in and has managed to get support for a congressional investigation to find out how airports like North Central West Virginia can get so much money for so few passengers.","North Central West Virginia airport offers free sightseeing flights to boost numbers .

"(CNN) -- A predicted busy hurricane season this summer is on a collision course with an unprecedented oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the results are anyone's guess, weather experts say. ""The problem is that this is a man-made experiment we wish we hadn't made,"" said Jenni Evans, a professor of meteorology at Penn State University. Scientists on Thursday said as much as 19,000 barrels of oil have been spewing every day from the BP well in the Gulf, making it the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Most of the oily water lies off the coast of Louisiana, where marshes and wildlife have been coated and the state's fishing and tourism industries have taken direct hits. Not only is it hard to track how contaminants would be redistributed by a hurricane, but it's also hard to predict how the slick would affect the storm, NOAA Public Affairs Officer Dennis Feltgen and Evans agreed. Evans said the storm could either move the oil along the water's surface or it could mix the oil with the water and cause it to sink. If the oil moved horizontally, the shoreline would be polluted, she said. If it moved vertically, the marine life under the surface would suffer. The oil could slow the storm's growth, Feltgen said. Evaporated ocean water fuels hurricanes, and the oil forming a film across the Gulf could buffer the water from the air, preventing the ocean water from feeding the hurricane, he said. But other scientists say the storms could be stronger than usual because the black oil would heat the water faster and accelerate formation of hurricanes, which rely on warm waters for their development, Evans said. CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers said there was another threat from the volatile mix of hurricanes and oil: storm surge. ""All the winds would be coming here,"" he said, indicating the coast on a map, ""and there would be storm surge here. All the winds would be going this way, and there would be scouring and cleaning of the beaches on this side. But the storm surge that could make its way up and bring the oil miles inland could be completely contaminating the oil inland."" Oil in the Gulf coast isn't the only worry for hurricane forecasters this year: In earthquake-devastated Haiti, roughly 1.5 million displaced people are at risk. They are living under tarps and in tents in makeshift camps. In Haiti, aid agencies relocated about 20,000 people who were vulnerable to flooding and mudslides when the rainy season began. But it is impossible to hurricane-proof the congested tent cities that many are calling home right now, said Heather Paul, CEO of  the aid program SOS Children's Villages. Paul's program is working to provide permanent, stable homes to orphans in the form of polypropylene shelters. While her program's anchored shelters have the greatest potential to withstand strong winds, the outlook appears grim for many Port-Au-Prince residents. ""It's only short of a miracle to prepare these people for hurricane season,"" she said.","Hurricanes would pile on to problems of oil spill, Haiti quake survivors .

"(CNN) -- Gulf Coast chefs and fishing advocates claim, ""Come on in; the water's fine!"" but find themselves facing a public awash in apprehension over potentially oil-tainted seafood. When New Orleans, Louisiana, chef John Besh recently urged people to choose U.S. shrimp over imports during an interview about the state of seafood in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico spill, commenters responded negatively, writing, ""What's a little tar or mercury in your system anyways?!"" and ""I hope you enjoy the petrol in your fish."" Another commented, ""You eat the fish from down there, don't complain to anyone when you get cancer in 10-15 years. I can't even believe a responsible human being would advocate for eating seafood slathered in oil first."" A tweet in their response to CNN's query about diners' feelings on New Orleans seafood declared all post-spill offerings ""a no-geaux."" Similar sentiments abound online, despite authorities' assurances as to the safety of seafood currently on the market. Maps and apps track spill . The supply of Gulf Coast food -- and the cost of it -- fluctuates on a daily basis, with the NOAA Fisheries Services map of safe and affected fishing waters constantly being redrawn. ABC reports that in light of the reduced amount of seafood on the market, ""Fish that normally sold for $2.50 a pound were going for $3.25."" On Tuesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a commercial fisheries failure to trigger aid for commercial fishermen from the Economic Development Administration. In a letter to Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, the governor wrote, ""The waters offshore Louisiana's coast supply nearly one-third of all commercial seafood harvested in the lower 48 states, with values in excess of $2.85 billion annually. As the largest provider of domestic seafood in the continental United States, protection of Louisiana's fisheries, habitats and catch are critical to our nation's economy and food supply. In addition to the potential biologic and ecologic impacts in these coastal communities, we must not overlook the crippling effect that this event will have on the commercial and sport fisheries in Louisiana. The seafood industry is not only a large economic driver, but a defining element of the unique culture, and a crucial tourist draw to the state."" While the impact of the Gulf Coast oil spill on the future of shellfish harvesting is unknown, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals is closely monitoring conditions and sampling water at oyster beds and fishing docks to determine whether the haul is suitable for public consumption. It has the authority to order closures of areas that are deemed unsafe. The department's daily assessments and harvesting closures are distributed to restaurants and seafood purveyors, and agency Secretary Alan Levine has released a statement declaring, ""Oysters exposed to the spill will not be permitted to be harvested, and thus are not available for consumer purchase. DHH stands by the quality of Louisiana seafood as a healthy and delicious choice for consumers."" On the other side of the Gulf, groups like the Florida Sea Grant, which operates as a partnership between the Florida Board of Education and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, echo that sentiment. Steve Otwell, a seafood specialist with the Florida Sea Grant College Program, writes in an Oil Spills and Seafood Safety FAQ on the group's website, ""All seafood sold in Florida retail stores, supermarkets and restaurants will remain safe to consume prior to and during any potential exposure to contamination from the pending oil spill."" Michael Herdon of the Food and Drug Administration backed that claim in a statement, writing, ""The FDA is closely monitoring the developing situation in the Gulf Coast region to help ensure that seafood potentially impacted by the oil spill is not making its way into commerce. Fish and shellfish harvested from areas unaffected by the closures are considered safe to eat. There is no reason to believe that any contaminated product has made its way to the market."" For the proprietor of several New Orleans restaurants and author of the award-winning cookbook ""My New Orleans,"" Besh's livelihood hinges on their assessments being correct. He said, ""We have the best and the brightest working for us on the state level, out there testing the waters every day to make sure they know exactly where this oil is and what effect it's having. As the oil shifts and moves with currents and we get a list from Health and Hospitals telling us what fisheries have opened or closed, and we buy accordingly."" He and some other well-known chefs are putting their time and money where diners' mouths are. Besh and TV star and celebrity chef Paula Deen will participate in a seafood cooking demo at the New Orleans Wine & Food Experience on May 29 and then join Food Network star Aaron Sanchez and James Beard Award-winning chef John Currence for a fundraising dinner at Besh's flagship restaurant August that evening. All the proceeds will go to aid the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Foundation. The help is surely needed, as the situation in the Gulf worsens and the financial future of multigenerational oyster and shrimp families hangs in the balance. ""Right now, it's a really sad sight,"" Besh said. ""We had Catholic Charities of the New Orleans area started putting together food baskets and goods and a little bit of cash for the shrimping and oyster families of southeast Louisiana, because now they've been out of work for a long time. Many of our local fishermen, their only hope of getting work right now is helping out with oil mitigation."" Dennis O'Hern of the Fishing Rights Alliance echoes Besh's fears that a way of life hanging by a thread is even more deeply imperiled by the spread of misinformation. ""The further you get away from the coast, the greater the perception that the fish is tainted. People will shy away from the line-caught grouper sandwich and opt for tilapia."" He continued, ""That will absolutely ruin fishing for my generation as well as my daughter's generation. I put my roots down here; my daughter may not be able to dive again. I recommend anybody that comes down here to fish, to do it while they can."" Even avid eaters without a stake in the business have stepped forward to offer their support. CNN contributor Donna Brazile took to Twitter to declare, ""The Louisiana Seafood Festival will be held in June. Paula Deen from the Food Network will come down for the contest. Buy Louisiana seafood."" She told CNN, "" It's still the best seafood in the world. And I know Ewell [Smith, executive director of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion & Marketing Board] is working nonstop to ensure the best quality hits our marketplace.""","Chefs and fishermen fear customers will refuse safe Gulf seafood .

"Grand Isle, Louisiana (CNN) -- President Obama returned from a tour of the oil-stricken Gulf Coast on Friday and vowed to do all he could to help area residents and businesses clean up the mess and recover financially. ""We want to stop the leak, we want to contain and clean up the oil, and we want to help the people in this region return to their lives and livelihoods as soon as possible,"" the president told reporters. Flanked by more than a dozen Gulf-area politicians and officials, the president -- the sleeves of his shirt rolled up -- called the oil spill that began April 20 and continues today ""an assault on our shores, on our people, on the regional economy and on communities like this one. ""This isn't just a mess that we have got to mop up. People are watching their livelihoods wash up on the beach."" Obama said he had heard ""heartbreaking stories"" from Grand Isle Mayor David Camardelle of fishermen who are trying to figure out where their next paycheck will come from. ""This is something that has to be dealt with immediately,"" he said. ""This is our highest priority, and it deserves a response that is equal to the task. That is why this has already been the largest cleanup effort in U.S. history."" More than 20,000 people are working in the region to clean up the spill, including 1,400 National Guard troops activated in four states, he said. So far, more than 3 million feet of boom have been deployed, he said, adding that he will ensure that the lead federal official responding to the spill, Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, gets ""whatever he needs to deal with this crisis."" Obama said it would be ""welcome news"" if BP's ""top kill"" effort succeeds in stopping the runaway flow from the well a mile below the surface of the water, but he said that that other efforts are under way, too. ""A team of some of the world's top scientists, engineers and experts -- led by our energy secretary and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu -- has for some time been exploring any and all reasonable contingency plans,"" he said. Obama said he has directed Allen and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to triple the manpower in places where oil has hit shore or appears within a day of doing so. Information about resources available to area residents and businesses will be posted at whitehouse.gov, he said. In addition, doctors and scientists will be stationed in the affected states to monitor the potential impact of the spill on the health of residents, an expense that BP will pay, he said. ""BP is the responsible party for this disaster,"" he said. ""But as I said yesterday and as I repeated in the meeting we just left, I ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis. I'm the president, and the buck stops with me."" He added that federal authorities are prepared ""to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to stop this catastrophe, to defend our natural resources, to repair the damage and to keep this region on its feet."" In a response to some local officials, who have been calling for a berm to be created to keep the water from getting into fragile marshlands, Obama said Allen is prepared to authorize moving forward with ""a portion of the idea."" And he called on Americans to help, too, by visiting the region. Except for three beaches in Louisiana, all of the Gulf beaches are open, safe and clean, he said. But it was to the long-term residents that he targeted his message: ""I'm here to tell you that you are not alone,"" he said. ""You will not be abandoned, and you will not be left behind."" Though about 25 percent of the Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone has been shut, most federal waters in the Gulf are open to commercial and recreational fishing, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","Obama vows to put federal muscle behind cleanup, says there are alternatives to ""top kill""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll from Friday's attacks on a religious minority in Lahore has risen to 98, officials said Saturday. The strikes with bombs and firearms took place at two mosques in Lahore belonging to the Ahmadi religious group, police and rescue officials said. At the Baitul Noor place of worship in the Model Town region, two attackers on motorbikes fired at the entrance of the building and tossed hand grenades, a rescue official told CNN. Police said one of the attackers was critically injured. The other, clad in a suicide jacket, was detained. At a mosque in the Garhi Shahu neighborhood, one witness told CNN he saw two attackers armed with AK-47s, and another witness said he saw at least four gunmen. Sajjad Bhutta, the senior official, said the heads of three suicide bombers were discovered there. Bhutta said more than 70 people were injured in the violence. Ahmadis regard themselves as Muslim. But the government says they aren't, and many Muslim extremists have targeted them. Sunni and Shiite Muslims do not regard followers of the religion as Muslims because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a non-governmental organization, deplored the attacks and said it has warned the Punjab provincial government about threats to the Ahmadi community center in Model Town for more than a year. Lahore is the capital of Punjab province. . ""An HRCP delegation had held meetings with Chief Minister Punjab Shehbaz Sharif to apprise him of the situation and had demanded enhanced security measures to protect the vulnerable minority and its worship places. HRCP is of the view that though the Punjab government apparently took some steps to bolster the security ... they were not enough to face the well-coordinated and well-planned terrorist attack as witnessed on Friday,"" it said. It urged the government ""to provide foolproof security and protection to the Ahmadi community."" The movement was founded in 1889. Its followers believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908) was sent by God as a prophet ""to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality, justice and peace,"" the worldwide Ahmadi group says. The group, which is thought to number between 3 million and 4 million people in the country, endures ""the most severe legal restrictions and officially sanctioned discrimination"" among Pakistan's religious minorities, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. The religious freedom commission, an independent, bipartisan U.S. government body, said in its latest annual report that ""Ahmadis may not call their places of worship 'mosques,' worship in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer rooms which are otherwise open to all Muslims, perform the Muslim call to prayer, use the traditional Islamic greeting in public, publicly quote from the Koran, or display the basic affirmation of the Muslim faith."" The agency says it's illegal for the group to preach publicly, pursue converts or pass out religious material, and adherents are restricted from holding public conferences and traveling to Saudi Arabia for the hajj pilgrimage. While the greatest number of its followers are in Pakistan and India, it has a presence in many European countries, such as Britain, where the religion's fifth and current spiritual head, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, resides.","Human rights group says it warned of a possible attack .

"(CNN) -- Get four successful women together on a movie set and you'd think it's all claws, all the time. Some rumors would insinuate that ""Sex and the City's"" Kim Cattrall doesn't get along with her co-star Kristin Davis, while another would allege there were catfights on the set of the sequel, as the stars revealed in the June issue of Marie Claire magazine. Last week there was a similar tiff making headlines, although the spat seemed to be a bit one-sided. In an interview with Out magazine, pop star Christina Aguilera referred to fellow superstar Lady Gaga as a ""newcomer"" who was ""fun to look at,"" but Aguilera posted a statement on her website claiming that there wasn't any malice behind those words. ""It is very easy for comments to be taken out of context and create unnecessary drama -- especially between us women,"" Aguilera said in the statement. ""So I would like to tell you all directly so my words cannot be misconstrued to sell someone else's story. ... I have absolutely nothing against Lady Gaga or any other female artist in this business."" As Aguilera noted in her statement, this isn't the first time she's ""been unfairly pitted against another female artist."" If Aguilera or the ""Sex and the City"" stars really are estranged from other famous women, so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars Chris Noth or John Corbett? For that matter, where are the stories about how the male actors got along on the set? ""There are hardly ever any stories about male celebrities fighting,"" said celebrity blogger Vera Sweeney, who runs IAmNotObsessed.com. ""Even when Shia LaBeouf got into that car accident while on a date with Isabel Lucas -- even though she was dating Adrian Grenier at the time -- nothing happened. Adrian said they weren't serious, and the story was dropped."" Obviously, this doesn't mean that male celebrities are never pitted against one another in the media -- take a look at earlier beefs between Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, Eminem and Moby or Nas and Jay-Z. The difference, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones, and they're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have. Or, Sweeney said, the ""celebrity men in conflict"" angle will be given a different spin. ""Instead of there being a power struggle or an emotional issue, different work ethics will most likely be cited,"" she said. ""For example, when Christian Bale and Johnny Depp filmed 'Public Enemy' it was said that both men wanted to stay in character even when they weren't shooting. So it was understood why they weren't friendly with one another in between takes -- because they were 'in character.' If two women did that, it would be pitched as a cover-up for a more deep[ly] rooted reason."" The actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft-dirty business. ""The chemistry among the four of us is very strong, [but] ... the press has to put women in these boxes, rather than show them as the movie portrays them: working together and being powerful,"" Cattrall said in the Marie Claire interview. ""Things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people's imaginations."" A likely reason for the media coverage, explained pop culture expert and ""The Cult of Celebrity"" author Cooper Lawrence, is because ""it's much easier to believe that women don't like each other. It's one of the few bastions of sexism that's left in our culture, and we can't imagine that powerful, successful women could ever get along."" It all boils down to the gender norms many of us are raised with, Thompson said. ""One theory we can reject is that the women are fighting with each other more than the men are. ... Anyone who's been in a workplace knows that it's not an inherently gender-specific sort of thing,"" Thompson said. But ""with the gender norms that we've all grown up with, men manifest their 'cattiness' differently than women; we're OK with the idea that women are emotional, and we expect them to be."" But said Ian Drew, senior editor of celebrity magazine Us Weekly, you can't discount the reality of the entertainment industry -- and that's to sell albums and rack up box-office numbers. ""Obviously, this is a competition,"" Drew said. ""People need to be responsible for their own actions -- [Aguilera] did say those words, and she said those things for a reason. Lady Gaga, for example, never says anything negative about anybody."" If these stars wouldn't send the media smoke signals with their words or actions, Drew said, the media wouldn't start yelling fire. ""No one is a victim in the celebrity world,"" he added. ""Very few of those rumors end up not being true."" Regardless of whether they're true or not, Sweeney said she's willing to bet the stories of this starlet being angry at that one aren't likely to let up anytime soon. ""The question isn't why are these stories about women catfights being created,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, the question is why not? People enjoy the drama, and drama and divalike behavior sells.""","There were rumors of rivalries on ""Sex and the City 2"" set; stars say they're untrue .
Generally, such gossip is about women; male stars don't raise same issues, observers say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Survivors of the oil rig explosion April 20 that triggered an underwater oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico, along with the father of a man who died in the blast, urged members of a House committee Thursday to hold Transocean and BP accountable for the incident. ""Please believe me, no amount of money will ever compensate us for Gordon's loss,"" said Keith Jones, a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, attorney whose son, 28-year-old engineer Gordon Jones, died in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon off the coast of Louisiana. ""We know that. But payment of damages by wrongdoers is the only means we have in this country to make things right."" Two employees of rig owner Transocean, meanwhile, accused the company of putting profits above lives and cutting back on safety and employees leading up to the explosion. When workers complained of needing more help, ""They just kept telling us they'd see what they could do,"" said engineer Doug Brown, 50, of Vancouver, Washington. Brown suffered head and leg injuries in the explosion and said he now struggles with short-term memory loss and post-traumatic stress disorder. Employee Stephen Stone told committee members that the explosion ""was hardly the first thing to go wrong"" on the rig. Both men described a horrific scene on board the Deepwater Horizon the night of April 20, with people crying and screaming for help as others scrambled for safety. ""I was pretty certain I was going to die,"" Stone said. After making it onto a lifeboat, being rescued by the Coast Guard and reaching land, some 28 hours after the explosion, survivors ""were lined up and made to take a drug test"" before being allowed to leave or call their families, Stone said. Transocean asked him to a sign a document -- without his attorney present -- saying he was not injured in the blast in exchange for $5,000 for the loss of his personal possessions, he said. He refused to sign the portion saying he was uninjured, he said, because even though he did not require medical treatment at the time, he must see a doctor for effects of smoke inhalation and is also dealing with mental and emotional aftereffects. Legal representatives for both BP and Transocean said the companies are making payment of claims a priority. ""We are going to pay all legitimate claims,"" said Darryl Willis, vice president for resources for BP America, who is handling claims against the company. ""We realize that we're going to be judged by our response to this spill, and we're going to pay for all damage to people, to governments, to the community."" BP has already paid out some $37 million in claims, he said, and has opened claim centers in Gulf Coast states. But Jones argued that the federal Death on the High Seas Act unreasonably limits the damages surviving family members can receive. He said the situation makes even less sense considering it was modified after the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 to help the families of air crash victims recover damages. In one of the last pictures taken of Gordon Jones, he was giving his 2-year-old son, Stafford, his first golf lesson. His second son, Maxwell, was born two weeks ago, with his father represented in the delivery room by a family photo. ""There's nothing in the High Seas Act that can compensate the loss of a golf teacher,"" his father told CNN after the hearing. ""His sons are not going to have someone to teach them to give a man a firm handshake and look them in the eye."" He said his son's wife, Michelle, ""cannot recover for the loss of the love of her life."" ""The loss of Gordon's income is the last thing Michelle grieves for,"" he told Congress. ""When Michelle tells her boys about their dad, she is not going to show them a pay stub."" But under the current law, he said, that is all she and the older son are entitled to, and the baby may be entitled to nothing, because he was born after his father died. Jones said allowing punitive damages against companies like BP and Transocean is ""the only way they may learn."" Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood told committee members that Transocean has already filed a limitation action in preparation for lawsuits, and BP has filed to consolidate such suits. States are concerned they will be pulled into a class-action suit where they will be treated like any other plaintiff. Mississippi wants its legal issue debated in state court, not in courts somewhere else, he said. Transocean attorney Rachel Clingman said the majority of about 120 suits filed against the company thus far are class-action suits. Multiple lawsuits are confusing and can lead to disparate treatment for plaintiffs, she said. The company filed its limitation action for several reasons, she said. ""We believe that it is important to have a central venue for these actions and to maintain a degree of continuity and consistency in awards to plaintiffs that would not be possible if lawsuits go forward in courts throughout five states in various state and federal courts."" Asked by Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, about Stone's claims he was asked to sign a document, Clingman said a man ""who is not a lawyer"" met with Transocean employees in the days after the explosion and gave them a $5,000 check for their possessions. ""No release was signed,"" she said. ""No one has been asked to, or has, signed a release of liability,"" she said. CNN's Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Transocean attorney denies company had employees sign releases .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- The Obama administration needs an air traffic controller to manage its domestic policy agenda. The items are starting to pile up on the runway. Move over, health care. Next up: immigration. It wasn't exactly a graceful transition. In fact, at first, it looked like bad timing that tens of thousands of protesters descended on Washington to demand comprehensive immigration reform on the same day that Congress was voting on a bill that overhauled the health care system. You had to wonder: What if more than 100,000 people marched on Washington, and no one noticed? Actually, even with everything else going on that day, plenty of people noticed the return on the national agenda of one of the most emotional and contentious issues in America. Immigration reform advocates have their eye on the calendar. In October, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, a major proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, said during an interview on National Public Radio that the immigration debate would have to be reopened by March in order to get a bill passed before the November midterm elections. Ironically, the fact that the debates over health care and immigration overlapped actually worked out well for the proponents of immigration reform. It gave members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus additional leverage to pressure President Obama into declaring his support for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that is about to be introduced by Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. The president needed a push. Liberals are loath to admit it, but Obama has been asleep at the switch when it comes to keeping his campaign promise to pursue immigration reform. And it isn't just -- as his defenders say -- because he was preoccupied with the economy and health care. The truth is, Obama never connected with the immigration issue with the same degree of passion with which he connected with other issues like health care reform, education reform, even climate change. If the protesters hadn't gone to Washington and forced his hand, Obama would have simply gone on to education or the economy and put immigration reform on the back burner. Now, thanks to the march, and other rallies planned around the country in April, Obama has gotten the message that immigration reform won't wait any longer. It certainly won't wait until after the November election, as Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, has suggested. Menendez is obviously trying to be a good Democrat, trying to spare his colleagues and his party any more legislative drama. But he's not looking out for the best interests of the immigration reform movement. He must suspect Republicans are likely to make huge gains in November, especially after the health care vote. The time to act is now. The legislative puzzle will only get more complicated when a new Congress is seated. Some liberals want the immigration reform movement to be patient. There is nothing new there. Some on the left said the same thing during the civil rights movement. In this case, those who want to reform the immigration system have been waiting patiently since September 2001, when President George W. Bush first suggested comprehensive immigration reform. And the longer they wait, the more complicated things get. The inaction remains the same. The only thing that changes is the narrative. First they're told that Congress can't fix a system that both sides acknowledge is broken in good economic times because there are too many immigrants here and those kinds of population swings only exacerbate the anxiety that many Americans feel about changing demographics. Then the economy goes sour, and they're told Congress can't act now because unemployment is too high and Americans have developed a new anxiety -- over their own economic instability. Reformers figured out in a hurry that they were being played and that Congress never intended to deal with this issue. It's just too hard. Just like health care reform was too hard? Personally, I believe Democrats made a colossal mistake by approving a radical upheaval of the nation's health care system and then compounded that error with all the shenanigans involved. Nonetheless, I have to admit that it was impressive to see a group of lawmakers in either party work up the passion and courage to disregard the polls and actually do what they thought was right in the face of taunts, slurs, voter contempt and thousands of e-mails and phone calls from angry constituents. Sadly, that kind of leadership is something you don't see much in an institution like Congress, which is usually too risk-averse for its own good. Whether the issue is gay marriage on the left or fixing Social Security on the right, moral courage is scarce on the Potomac. Recently, there was a rare sighting. There needs to be another. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","As Congress voted on health care, tens of thousands marched for immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't a long walk to Lisa Cochran's car in the Costco parking lot, but by the time she got there her infant son was near death. Cochran and her grandmother had just enjoyed a hot dog at the Salem, Oregon, wholesale outlet. She had 7-day-old Derrik out of his baby carrier as she ate and people at nearby tables asked about the infant's age and expressed amazement that Cochran was already out and about after the pregnancy. She put Derrik back in his Infantino ""SlingRider"" and headed out to the parking lot, but something was amiss when she reached the car, she said. ""He was not the right color. He was yellow. He had purple spots from where the sling rubbed marks on his face,"" said Cochran, 27. Cochran called 911. Her fiancé, Jerrid Fowler, administered CPR. An ambulance arrived and paramedics also tried to revive the infant. ""By the time I got to the hospital, they told me they weren't able to save him,"" she said. Cochran filed a lawsuit in January, asking for millions of dollars in damages and alleging that Infantino was negligent and liable for her son's May 7, 2009, death. The death certificate cited compression asphyxia/suffocation as Derrik's cause of death, Cochran said. Infantino issued a recall Wednesday of two baby slings, the ""SlingRider"" and the ""Wendy Bellissimo,"" offering customers replacement slings. The San Diego, California-based company said consumers should stop using the recalled slings immediately but did not take responsibility for any deaths. ""Our company is comprised of moms, dads, sisters, aunts, uncles and grandparents and we care deeply about the quality and safety of our products,"" President Jack Vresics said in a statement. ""All of our products go through rigorous testing and we work closely with governmental agencies as well as other third-party testing organizations continually to ensure the safety of our products."" Earlier this month, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning about the use of certain baby slings, saying it had identified 14 deaths with sling-style carriers, most of them in children younger than 4 months. On Tuesday, Health Canada issued a joint statement with the agency, saying three of the deaths appeared to occur in one of Infantino's slings. About 1 million of the slings were recalled in the United States, and about 15,000 were affected in Canada, according to the joint release. Around 14,000 of the slings have been recalled in Europe. ""In the first few months of life, babies cannot control their heads because of weak neck muscles. The sling's fabric can press against an infant's nose and mouth, blocking the baby's breathing and rapidly suffocating a baby within a minute or two,"" the joint statement said. ""Additionally, where a sling keeps the infant in a curled position bending the chin toward the chest, the airways can be restricted, limiting the oxygen supply. The baby will not be able to cry for help and can slowly suffocate."" Attorneys for Infantino referred requests for comment to a public relations firm that answered questions and sent CNN the statement from the company's president. The company is working with CPSC in its investigation, has alerted retailers and written letters to individual customers, spokeswoman Amy Colton said in an e-mail. The company has not filed any pleadings in the case except for a notice to remove the case from the Marion County Circuit Court in Oregon to the state's U.S. District Court. Cochran isn't the only mother blaming Infantino's ""SlingRider"" for an infant's death. Anthoinette Medley is planning to sue Infantino for the February 20, 2009, death of 3-month-old Nelsir, said her lawyer, Alan Feldman. Watch Medley discuss losing Nelsir . His twin, Timir, was in an identical sling over Medley's other shoulder as she walked through the Gallery at Market East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She saw an old friend who hadn't seen her children yet, Feldman said, and Medley was eager to show them off. ""That's when she discovered a tiny bit of blood on the baby's bib and ran to the bathroom,"" Feldman said. Nelsir was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and pronounced dead later, Feldman said. ""I will never get to hear him call me Mommy. I will never get to see him take a first step,"" Anthoinette Medley told CNN affiliate WPVI. Feldman said he is not satisfied with Infantino's recall. ""If you recognize that your product is not safe, and you realize that babies have died, you should stop babies and moms from using the product,"" he said. Infantino's president said the company's announcement of a free replacement program reflects its commitment to safety as its highest priority. ""As a company, Infantino conducts extensive safety testing internally as well as with third-party experts, regardless of whether official safety standards have been established. We will continue to play a leadership role in the industry and to cooperate closely with CPSC as it continues its investigation of all baby slings,"" Vresics said. Cochran said the sling came highly recommended, especially for breast-feeding mothers. A neighbor had one, she said, as did a friend's cousin. She even carried Derrik to his first doctor's visit in the sling. ""There were a lot of people who had this sling, and it seemed like a great thing,"" she said. Cochran said she broke down after Derrik's death. Simple chores became extremely taxing. She neglected going to the grocery store and bank. She had trouble getting out of bed, showering, even talking on the phone. ""I was kind of hysterical. I was kind of not quite with it for several months, actually. I neglected going to the grocery stores or anywhere I would commonly frequent,"" she said. ""It was just hard to even be in a situation like this because the first thing everyone asks is, 'How's the baby?' "" Cochran, a manager for a housecleaning service in Keizer, lost Derrik's twin in the first trimester of her pregnancy, she said. She is pregnant again with a girl who is due in June. ""I'm doing a lot better, especially now that I have another one on the way,"" she said. ""Hopefully, there won't be any more babies that die and any more families that have to go through what me and my family have gone through.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The word compromise is never music to the ears of passionate advocates for a cause. This is especially true for advocates of overturning the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" law, a law that was supposed to be a suitable compromise itself in 1993. But when idealism collides with political reality, risk avoidance and workable solutions become the goal. The deal that was reached on DADT this week between the White House, the Pentagon, gay rights groups (including my own), and pro-repeal champions on Capitol Hill is that workable solution and will get us where we need to go. More than 14,000 proudly serving men and women have been abruptly fired from the military pursuant to the DADT law, and many more have voluntarily left the military because of the burden of serving under this unnecessary restriction. The DADT law prevents our armed forces from being able to recruit and retain troops from the largest possible pool of talent, and it is a stain on the integrity of our nation. We cannot afford to wait until next year to lock in full legislative repeal. Our country needs this now. The risks of waiting until after the midterm elections to address DADT legislatively were simply too great. It is possible that the pro-repeal majority could lose seats in November, and could even lose control of one chamber of Congress. If it passes, this deal will get the looming legislative battle over with. It will also free up the Pentagon to implement the recommendations of its Comprehensive Review Working Group on DADT when it finally releases its road map for a smooth transition in December. The Pentagon and the president will not have to return to Congress for permission on implementing repeal -- the legislation hammered out in this week's agreement will already have authorized the change. This deal is not perfect, but unlike the 1993 DADT law, which codified a de facto gay ban in the military, this new legislation would firmly establish the mechanisms for ending the gay ban once and for all. More importantly, it would do so in a way that has achieved coveted Pentagon support -- a critical requirement for any DADT repeal legislation. But there were three concessions that repeal supporters reluctantly agreed to in order to pick up White House and Pentagon support. These concessions, however, do not compromise the goal of full legislative repeal of DADT. The first is an option that the progressive community had already resigned itself to: delayed implementation. While my organization has long argued that including a delay provision would be the only politically viable way to secure legislative repeal soon, this model for language only recently caught on in the rest of the pro-repeal community. This part of the deal was a given. The second concession was allowing the president, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to decide together the date on which the new law, once passed, would actually take effect. The three are already public supporters of repeal and can be trusted to act in good faith. They may not certify the implementation plan as quickly as some repeal advocates would like (some have unrealistically suggested a matter of days or weeks after the working group issues its report), but I believe that they will within a reasonable amount of time. After all, even the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway -- the staunchest opponent of this policy change -- testified before the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year that if this change became inevitable, even he would recommend making the change as swiftly as possible just to get it over with. The third and final concession -- and the most controversial -- was the removal of the affirmative non-discrimination provision from the legislative language. This provision would have legally prevented the Department of Defense from ever engaging in discriminatory practices towards gay and lesbian troops again. Although I am not convinced this was necessary to pick up any additional support for repeal, in light of concessions that were already in the works, it is important to keep in mind that statutory non-discrimination language would have been above and beyond what other minority groups have been given through military personnel policy legislation. An administrative or regulatory non-discrimination policy, such as that accorded women and African-Americans, will be more than sufficient to ensure that lesbian, gay and bisexual service members are protected from discriminatory practices or policies. Even if this deal makes it over its biggest hurdles this week -- a Senate Armed Services Committee vote and a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives -- there will still be much work ahead. The president and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates must be pressed to ensure that the Pentagon's working group does not get off track, as shamefully did happen with the Military Working Group on DADT in 1993. And the president should strongly consider creating a civilian oversight and advisory group to help make a smooth transition to a post-DADT military, as was done for ensuring smooth policy changes on women through the creation of the Defense Advisory Commission on Women in the Services. President Obama recently revived this commission for women, and it would behoove the administration to create a similar commission for this policy change. If this legislation clears these two major hurdles this week, it will undoubtedly be the final nail in the coffin of the outdated and onerous DADT law. This policy change is the best thing for our country and for our military, and it should be supported. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Nicholson.","More than 14,000 troops fired because of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" says Alexander Nicholson .

"(CNN) -- For Clem Pellett, tracking down his grandfather's killer was not his original mission. ""I was just putting together an old family story ... and these serendipitous events happened, and we accidentally caught him,"" Pellett, of Bellevue, Washington, told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday. That ""old family story"" focuses on two men: Clarence Pellet -- a grandfather that Clem Pellett never knew -- and a drifter named Frank Dryman. According to the Montana Department of Corrections, on April 4, 1951, Clarence Pellett picked up a hitchhiker near Shelby, Montana. The hitchhiker was Dryman, then a 19-year-old drifter who was carrying a loaded gun that, according to the state, he used to shoot and kill Clarence Pellett on the side of windswept Montana road. Dryman took the car and drove to Canada, where he was later arrested for the murder, according to the Montana Department of Corrections. After several trials and appeals, Dryman was convicted in Montana and sentenced to life in prison, then paroled in 1969, according to state records. Less than two years after his parole, Dryman was listed by the Montana Department of Corrections as ""absconded."" He had disappeared. And that is where the ""old family story"" stopped for nearly 40 years, until last year when Clem Pellett came across some old newspapers clippings of the murder, which had occurred two years before he was born. ""So what I knew of it (was) 'never pick up a hitchhiker,' and 'your grandfather died begging for his life,'"" he said. ""It's hard -- this is someone I never knew, but as I read, I thought, 'You know, this poor man who happens to be my grandfather -- his death just got kicked to the curb,' and that became the issue."" Over the course of a year, Clem Pellett worked closely with the Montana Parole Board and with Department of Corrections officials, who supplied him with an old post office box number in Glendale, Arizona, and details about Dryman's unique knuckle tattoos. That old address was just enough to give private investigators hired by Clem Pellett the lead they needed, and the search for Dryman was on in earnest. Pellett never imagined it would turn out the way it did, though. ""We thought he was going to be dead,"" he said. But 78-year old Frank Dryman proved them wrong. With the help of several private investigators, the search ended when Dryman was found living as a notary public and operating a wedding chapel in Arizona City, Arizona. In the sparsely populated land between Phoenix and Tucson, Dryman had ""flown under the radar for years, but he didn't fool me"" says private investigator Patrick Cote. ""What I really wanted to do (was) check his hands -- for the tattoos. I knew that this fellow was probably the one, because I was looking for the letters L-O-V-E tattooed on his knuckles. And I could see he had old stars tattooed on his fingers to cover 'love.' I called up to the other investigator and said 'I think I got your guy,'"" said Cote. Pellett informed Montana Parole Board officials and they worked quickly, contacting local law enforcement in Arizona. Dryman was arrested on Tuesday and is now awaiting extradition proceedings to Montana. ""Whatever the justice system does I'm happy with it,"" said Clem Pellett. ""Whatever happens, happens.""","Frank Dryman was convicted of killing Clarence Pellett on a roadside in 1951 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum resigned Thursday as head of the Interior Department's scandal-plagued Minerals Management Service, the department's chief said. Two sources told CNN that Birnbaum had been fired. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is involved in federal oversight of offshore oil drilling. Birnbaum's resignation letter cast her decision to leave as a consequence of a decision to reorganize the agency following April's explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion resulted in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are still trying to cap. ""As you move forward with the reorganization of Minerals Management Service, you will be requiring ... new leaders,"" Birnbaum wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. President Barack Obama said Thursday that he didn't know whether Birnbaum had been fired or chose to resign on her own. Speaking before a House subcommittee, Salazar insisted Birnbaum had resigned ""on her own terms and own volition."" She ""is a strong and very effective person who ... helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do,"" Salazar said. ""She helped us with addressing a very broken system. And all I can really [say] is that she is a good public servant."" Birnbaum, a former high level staffer on Capitol Hill, became head of the MMS in July 2009. A recently released federal report highlighted what many observers have characterized as widespread corruption at the agency. Among other things, the report, issued by the Interior Department's inspector general, revealed that federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored. In one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report stated. The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them. Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption ""evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [the agency] and the oil and gas industry."" He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general's recommendations, ""including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution."" MMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009. Salazar recently announced that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have ""conflicting missions"" that needed to be separated. The associate director for the agency's Offshore Minerals Management Program also is leaving at the end of May, a month earlier than planned, in the wake of the Gulf spill. That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued at more than $6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor. As part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate. The bill also would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies, would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies, and would prohibit regulators from part-time employment in the industry.","Obama says he doesn't know if Elizabeth Birnbaum was fired or resigned on her own .

"(CNN) -- The Minerals Management Service, a division within the Interior Department, was a troubled agency long before the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the recent revelations of employee misconduct. The agency -- which oversees U.S. offshore drilling, including the Gulf of Mexico -- has come under fire for mismanagement, questionable conduct and cozy relationships with industry officials. The MMS issued permits for the Deepwater Horizon drill rig -- contracted by BP -- which exploded on April 20. The explosion killed 11 people and resulted in an oil spill that is threatening parts of the Gulf. Interior Department Secretary Ken Salazar, during an appearance Wednesday before the House Committee on Natural Resources, said he was trying to change the agency's culture and its structure, which some critics say leads to mismanagement. ""My belief is that most of the employees of the MMS are good public servants,"" Salazar said. He, however, acknowledged some of the past conduct was ""scandalous"" and ""reprehensible."" Salazar said some people have been fired and others referred for prosecution. Two sources told CNN on Thursday that MMS Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired. At a House subcommittee hearing Thursday, Salazar insisted Birnbaum had resigned ""on her own terms and own volition."" President Obama later said he didn't know whether Birnbaum was fired or resigned on her own. The Obama administration has said in recent weeks that many of the problems within the MMS were inherited from the Bush administration. Salazar, during his testimony and in his answers to members of Congress on Wednesday, also made that point. During the hearing, Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado, asked Salazar why he and other officials were ""harping on what MMS did or didn't do in the previous administration."" ""Why aren't we talking about the here and now?"" Lamborn asked. Salazar was blunt in his response. ""We've done a lot to clean the house at MMS, unlike the previous administration,"" he said. ""This is not the candy store of the oil and gas kingdom which you and others were a part of."" Conflict of interest? The MMS, which has about 1,700 employees, has two responsibilities when it comes to industries such as oil or natural gas. It must act as a regulator while also collecting royalties from the companies. Some critics say those are opposite pulls and make the agency ripe for mismanagement. The U.S. government technically owns resources such as the oil in the Gulf. Companies pay the federal government for the rights to drill in certain areas. The MMS collects and distributes about $13 billion a year, Salazar said. William Galston of the Brookings Institution said there is a built-in conflict of interest, resulting in lax regulation of involved companies. ""The MMS has a lot of incentive to collect as much, in the way of royalty income, as it can. That means pressure to authorize a lot of drilling and then to do everything possible [to make sure] that the flow of production is robust and unimpeded,"" said Galston, who recently wrote a piece critical of the MMS for The New Republic magazine. ""MMS, as it is currently structured, has to simultaneously put one foot down hard on the gas pedal and the other on the brake,"" he said. ""And the imperatives to go fast are a lot stronger than to slow down."" Salazar said organizational change within the MMS and a restructuring of the agency was necessary to deal with such conflicts. Salazar advocated plans to ""remove revenue collectors away from the leasing and policing functions of the MMS."" He then wants to create two bureaus within the MMS. One would be responsible for creating energy resources -- including oil and gas -- in the outer continental shelf. It would issue leases and collect royalties. The other would act as the policing arm of the agency, carrying out inspections and enforcing regulations. 'Misconduct, management and spills' ""MMS used to stand for Minerals Management Service. It now stands for misconduct, management and spills,"" said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, during the House hearing Wednesday. A report released this week from the inspector general's office at the Interior Department revealed federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored. The report said all the events detailed in it occurred before 2007. In one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report said. Others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil, with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in. The report also alleged employees at the same office received tickets to 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl football game from an offshore production company. The report also includes a confidential source informing investigators that a MMS inspector abused drugs, including crystal meth. In 2008, during the waning months of the Bush administration, Earl Devaney, then the Interior Department's inspector general, issued a report condemning the behavior of some of the agency's employees. ""The single-most serious problem our investigations revealed is a pervasive culture of exclusivity, exempt from the rules that govern all other employees of the federal government,"" the report said. The report said, between 2002 and 2006, some of the staff received gifts from oil and gas companies with whom they were conducting business. Some of the more salacious charges in the report included substance abuse and sexual relationships with industry contacts. 'The revolving door' Meanwhile, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, focused on the ""revolving door"" between industry and government. The ""revolving door"" refers to people who work in areas such as the oil industry, move to a government agency such as the MMS and then return to the private sector. Nelson proposed legislation that would have federal oil industry regulators wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate. Among other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies. It also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies, and prohibit them from part-time employment in the industry. It is time, Nelson said Wednesday on the Senate floor, to ""stop this cozy, incestuous relationship between the oil industry and the regulators."" CNN's Drew Griffin, Alan Silverleib, Manav Tanneeru and CNNMoney.com's Annalyn Censky contributed to this report.","Minerals Management Service has a troubled history, government reports say .

"(CNN) -- In a scene from NBC's ""Parenthood,"" two parents are attempting to get their 8-year-old son ready for school. The child insists on wearing a pirate costume to class, again. His father asks him to take it off so he won't get teased. His mother says it's OK, mainly so she can get him out the door on time. It could be a scene from any prime-time comedy. But its context in ""Parenthood"" is unusual. The 8-year-old boy, the son of main characters Adam and Kristina Braverman, has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder. What is Asperger's syndrome? Perhaps because tackling a sensitive issue such as living with a child with special needs can take a deft touch from the writers, producers and actors, a storyline dealing with autism spectrum disorders isn't something that's been portrayed often in Hollywood. The most recent regular prime-time character with Asperger's was Jerry Espenson on ABC's ""Boston Legal."" The character's run lasted from 2005 until the show ended in 2008. Another ABC show, ""Grey's Anatomy,"" introduced a short term character during the 2008-2009 seasons. Dr. Virginia Dixon appeared in a three-episode arc. ""Parenthood"" is one of the few shows that have included a regular character with Asperger's from the beginning. The show has gotten good reviews in general and favorable comments from people affected by the disorder. One CNN.com reader named Dani, who has an 8-year-old with Asperger's, wrote, ""Overall I think it's been really true to the behavior our Aspie kids display -- which is often confused for being naughty or a lack of discipline. Thanks for doing your homework NBC!"" Because the show has received good reviews and positive feedback from families affected by the disorder, it may seem apparent that including a character with Asperger's was a good move. Executive Producer Jason Katims says it wasn't so clear at the beginning. ""I think there were moments everybody had of whether to do it, including myself,"" he said. ""I felt like it was a big thing to take on. It's a very personal thing to me."" He's not exaggerating. He has a son with the disorder, and though he had an intimate knowledge of dealing with Asperger's, he sought out experts to help shape the characters and the stories. ""When I decided to take this on, I felt an enormous responsibility to make this as real as possible,"" he says. The show consults with psychologists, teachers and other parents ""to make the depiction of both this character and his parents as accurate as possible."" A behavioral therapist consultant works with Max Burkholder, the actor who plays Max Braverman, and with Monica Potter and Peter Krause, the actors who play Max's parents, Kristina and Adam Braverman. The consultant also works with other cast members whose characters interact with Max and with the show's directors. NBC has been very supportive, Katims adds. He said there was a conversation with the network, not about whether to introduce the storyline, but how quickly. Peter Bell, the executive vice president of Autism Speaks, the country's largest autism science and advocacy organization, said his group hadn't worked with ""Parenthood"" on scripts, but Bell was on set recently to be a part of the May 18th episode. He had a chance to talk with the actors and production staff. Bell called the cast and crew ""thirsty"" for information about Asperger's and autism. ""I was really struck by how wonderful they all were and how interested in the topic they are."" The work the cast and crew has put into the show seems to have drawn the audience's interest. The day after the episode in which Max was diagnosed, Asperger's was one of the most searched subjects on Google. That pleased Katims. He says a character like Max can help take the mystery out of Asperger's, which is important for people who are dealing with the disorder. Not everyone has been pleased with ""Parenthood's"" treatment of autism. CherieT commented on CNN's Marquee blog that the show ""misses the mark sometimes on Asperger's traits."" She says while she's glad to see a show trying, ""Parenthood"" gets more things wrong than right. Blogher.com writer Angela Timpone, the owner of a business that supports families with autism and the mother of a boy who was diagnosed with autism five years ago, has taken issue with how the writers are handling Max's education. In an early episode, Adam and Kristina meet with a teacher at Max's public school, who says Max doesn't fit there. Max is almost immediately moved to a private school. In her post, Timpone notes laws require public schools to provide an education to all students, even if the schools must make accommodations for special needs students. She said the writers could have drawn some good stories from showing Kristina and Adam advocating for Max in the public school. ""I know the drama of it all was captivating. There's also drama in the fact [parents of autistic kids] have trouble with the public school system,"" she said. She also thinks the show hasn't delved deeply enough into the financial and emotional strains an autism diagnosis can put on a family. She understands the show can only do so much, but ""I wish maybe they had dialogue about how this costs so much money,"" and how making changes in a child's care and education can change the family dynamic. Katims expected criticism. ""I would be critical because I know what it's like,"" he says. ""You want to be truthful to the situation, but you're also storytellers."" Timpone says she enjoys the show, and through her Facebook page, she's heard from other moms of autistic children who liked the depiction of what Kristina Braverman goes through. She says it's great more people are hearing about autism, ""but it's not the regular autism family story.""","NBC's ""Parenthood"" portrays a family in which the son has Asperger's syndrome .

Producers use consultants to keep the storyline as accurate as possible .

"(CNET) -- Investigators for the Department of Justice began asking questions about Apple's business practices involving digital music at least three weeks ago, multiple music industry sources told CNET. DOJ investigators have interviewed numerous executives at record companies and digital music stores and according to those with knowledge of the discussions, it is clear that investigators are interested in learning whether Apple has employed anticompetitive tactics. The sources said that the department's inquiry is just in a fact-finding stage and that there is nothing to indicate investigators have found any wrongdoing or would file a complaint against Apple. Representatives from Apple and the Justice Department did not respond to interview requests. This is what we know about the investigation so far. • DOJ investigators have interviewed executives from the four major music labels and several digital music retailers about how Apple wields its iTunes influence. • Part of what investigators are interested in is whether Apple used its market dominance to discourage two of the top record companies from participating in a special Amazon music promotion called the ""MP3 Daily Deal."" • Apple has a history of throwing its weight around the music sector. Apple's iTunes accounts for 70 percent of all digital song sales and wields huge power. Apple has often used that clout to dictate terms to suppliers -- that is, the major labels. Here are just a few examples: The major labels wanted variable pricing on songs and albums and for years Apple resisted. In 2005, Apple CEO Steve Jobs said the top recording companies were ""getting greedy""after music execs considered a music price hike. Last year, Apple finally gave the labels some additional control over song pricing. The big record companies wanted the ability to sell albums that were unbundled, meaning they wanted Apple to sell hot LPs as a full package and refrain from selling individual songs from these works. Again, on this issue Apple hasn't given much ground. To iTunes' fans, Apple was a freedom fighter. The perception was that Apple was standing up for consumers. Apple's refusal to force customers to buy full albums saved them from having to shell out money for songs they didn't want. To them, Apple's reluctance to raise the 99 cent song price was another way the company kept music costs down. And the government never made a peep about these practices. Deal or no deal? But what may not seem as consumer-friendly is the accusation that Apple tried to squash a competitor's effort to offer discounted music. Amazon's ""MP3 Daily Deal,"" is a promotion that involves slashing prices on specific music titles and pushing them heavily on the day of their release. Amazon sometimes negotiated to get exclusive access to the music for a period of time, and the labels and their artists would often support the Daily Deal by promoting it on their Web sites. Apple managers informed the labels that any music included in Amazon's promotion would receive no promotion at iTunes, music industry sources told CNET in April. In one case, Apple complained to Sony Music Entertainment after seeing material from Alicia Keys touted as part of the Daily Deal. In March, Ed Christman, from Billboard magazine, broke the news about Apple's attempts to make the labels ""rethink"" their support for the Daily Deal. He wrote that Apple contacted EMI executives with similar gripes about such albums as Corinne Bailey Rae's ""The Sea,"" Lady Antebellum's ""Need You Now,"" and Ke$ha's ""Animal."" When it comes to tracing iTunes' potential DOJ troubles, one has to start with Apple's success. During the last decade, with its iPod digital music players and iTunes music store, the company completely remade the way people across the globe listen to, store, and buy music. Apple's iTunes store accounted for 28 percent of all music purchased by U.S. consumers in the first quarter of this year, research firm NPD Group said Wednesday. Two years ago during the same period, iTunes' market share was 19 percent. Companies that dominate a market as much as Apple rules digital music often are accused of anti-trust violations. When companies are up against similar-sized competitors, then aggressive tactics are seen as just good business. But the same practices from players holding hefty market share can raise eyebrows in a hurry. One other thing. During the same period that Apple saw double-digit growth, Amazon also was grabbing greater market share in digital music. Amazon's share grew from 6.8 percent in the first half of 2008 to 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2010. What DOJ investigators must be asking now is how much did the ""Daily Deal"" help propel that growth and did any of Apple's actions slow it down? © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"Washington (CNN) -- Shots fired at a congressman's campaign headquarters. Windows smashed at Democratic offices across the country. A coffin placed on a lawmaker's lawn. Hate-filled voice mail messages left on members of Congress' phone lines. Those are just some of the incidents reported since the House passed historic health care reform legislation Sunday -- a bill that became the law of the land. The issue has unleashed a deep-seated anger from those worried about a government takeover of health care, and what they deem as the process being ""rammed through"" Congress. James Leach, with the National Endowment for the Humanities, said that while many of the acts may be protected under First Amendment rights, ""that doesn't mean that they're morally justified."" ""And we have to think of ourselves as, 'what kind of people are we?' "" Leach said. ""Are we one people working together with rival thoughts, or are we enemies within? And I think there's something that's been let loose in American politics that has to be thought about."" That anger was visible in unruly protests by health care activists at the Capitol over the weekend. Republican House members encouraged protesters outside and inside the House gallery, some of whom carried messages like ""Vote no or else"" or ""If Brown won't stop it, a Browning will"" -- a reference to newly elected Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol. But the anger has boiled over into physical and verbal threats. Windows have been smashed at Democratic offices in at least three states, and federal agents are investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a Virginia congressman's brother was related to the lawmaker's yes vote. Republicans have the right to be angry over the Democrat's health care bill, but ""resorting to violent measures is exactly the wrong way to send a message,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Thursday night. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, confirmed Thursday that his district office in Queens received an envelope containing white powder and a threatening letter. Later Thursday, Weiner told CNN that initial tests indicated the powder was not a biological agent, but that he still was awaiting final word from the New York Police Department. Workers at the office turned over their clothes for testing and were given protective suits before being allowed to go home a few hours later, Weiner said. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are now looking into the threats, and at least 10 House Democrats have been given extra security. The voice mail has been vicious toward Michigan's Bart Stupak, who switched his vote to seal the deal for the bill. He has released one of the voice mails. Listen to the voice mail . ""Stupak, you are a lowlife, baby-murdering scumbag, pile of steaming crap. You're a cowardly punk, Stupak, that's what you are. You and your family are scum,"" an unidentified caller said. ""That's what you are, Stupak. You are a piece of crap."" ""Go to hell, you piece of [expletive deleted]"" another caller said. Read more about Stupak's political future . On Sunday, Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan of Missouri had a coffin placed on his lawn, said his spokeswoman, Sarah Howard. She said Tea Party protesters at his office in St. Louis had a coffin with them and later brought it to his house. The coffin was later removed, she said. Democratic congressional leaders have demanded Republicans join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed Sunday's vote on the health care system overhaul. The top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner, condemned the threats and vandalism, telling reporters Thursday that it ""should not be part of a political debate."" ""There are ways for people to channel their anger, and they should do it in a constructive way,"" he said. Liz Mair, a Republican consultant, said protesters ""are unfortunately crossing a line."" ""When we're talking about violence, vandalism, threats, that crosses a legal line, in addition to being in plain old bad taste,"" Mair said. ""And I think that there's a lot that is in plain old bad taste that is going on."" Democrats aren't the only ones being targeted. Rep. Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, said Thursday that a bullet had been fired through a window at his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. Watch Cantor warn against Democrats ""fanning flames"" A Richmond police spokeswoman confirmed to CNN that a bullet was fired at the congressman's office. ""We are investigating the circumstance surrounding it,"" spokeswoman Karla Peters said. Cantor also said that he had received threatening messages but that he would not publicly release the messages out of concern that doing so would only incite further violence. He also accused Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine and Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland -- a member of the Democratic House leadership -- of ""fanning the flames"" of violence by using threats that have been made against Democratic members ""as political weapons."" iReport: 'Violent Threats after the Healthcare Signing' ""Enough is enough,"" Cantor said. ""It has to stop."" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse hit back against Cantor's claims. ""We disagree with the charge made by Rep. Cantor today that Democrats are using acts of violence for political gain,"" he said. ""Let's be clear: Calling on Republican leaders who have contributed in part to this anger by wildly mischaracterizing the substance and motives of health reform to condemn these acts is entirely appropriate."" Another Republican -- Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida -- said in a news release Thursday that she received what appeared to be a death threat on her district office's voice mail. ""Just wanna let you know I have 27 people that are going to make sure that this b**** does not live to see her next term. Goodbye,"" the voice mail said, according to the release. Brown-Waite said she contacted both the Capitol Police and the Hernando County sheriff, and they are ""looking into the matter and subpoenaing telephone records."" At least one of the threats aimed at lawmakers appears to be racially based. House Democratic Majority Whip James Clyburn, who is African-American, said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home. ""We're giving aid and comfort to these people, and this stuff gets ratcheted up,"" Clyburn told CNN. ""We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down. It doesn't make sense. That's not what a democracy is all about."" Democratic officials and liberal Web sites are also upset that Sarah Palin used an image of crosshairs in a Facebook post this week listing 20 vulnerable Democrats who voted for the legislation. She plans to target them this election year with money from her political action committee. Read more about Palin's targeting effort . Palin's team is fighting claims that she is encouraging threats of violence. One House member mentioned her Facebook posting during a Wednesday meeting on safety concerns, a Democratic source told CNN's Dana Bash. Mention of the map brought audible groans to the room, the source said. An adviser to Palin responded by pointing to several instances in which the former Alaska governor has urged supporters to focus their energies on civil debate and action at the ballot box, not extremist activities. CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Dana Bash, Peter Hamby, Ed Hornick, Lesa Jansen and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","GOP Rep. Cantor says Dems have inflamed violence by using threats against them .
