"By: KATHARINE BARNEY . PUBLISHED: . 21:48 EST, 17 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:48 EST, 18 September 2012 . Chris Evans has flown in by helicopter to view the world famous Dunlop Bridge he paid just £250 for - boasting he had got 'one of the greatest bargains of all time'. BBC Radio 2 DJ Evans - who has an £87million fortune - snapped up the bridge which has been dismantled after 30 years at the Donnington Park circuit in Leicestershire. But he was taken aback today when he saw just how big it actually was exclaiming: 'Sh*t it's massive.' Bargain: DJ Chris Evans checks out his latest purchase after Saturday's auction . Evans, 46, bought the whopping 230ft-long bridge - which resembles a huge car tyre - after it was auctioned by Bonhams at the Goodwood Revival race meeting in Surrey on Saturday. The ginger-haired DJ, who has a fleet of top-of-the-range Ferraris and classic cars, told listeners on his breakfast show he had bought the bridge. All mine: The ginger-haired DJ seemed thrilled with the results of the auction. He joked that he was going to erect it over the top of his neighbour’s house in Berkshire but yesterday vowed to have it re-built in Leicestershire for race fans to enjoy. After touching down on the race track by helicopter, he took a spin in a white Mazda around the course before spending half an hour sitting on one of the 18 large sections of bridge. Touch down: the car enthusiast used an alternative mode of travel to visit Donnington . He said: 'It’s a lot bigger than I thought. Sh*t it’s massive. I didn’t realise how chunky it was. I can’t believe how big it is. 'It’s huge isn’t it? It’s the kind of thing you have on a farm to hold livestock in. Oops: The bridge was a bit bigger than Chris had imagined when he put in his bid . 'We’ve got to erect it somewhere. That’s what we are going to talk about while we are here. 'We were going to take it back to Berkshire and erect parts of it in my garden with my neighbour’s and the local council’s permission but there have been calls this morning to leave it here because this is its home. National landmark: The bridge's new owner has sparked a lot of interest . 'It’s one of the most important pieces of sporting memorabilia in the world so if Donington wants it to stay here then it can. 'We would like to find somewhere to re-erect the bridge and we would like things to happen under that bridge. Flying visit: Chris looked excited but a little overawed with the bridge . 'It was only £250, it was one of the greatest bargains of all time. It’s just over a pound per foot. It’s beyond a bargain, it redefines the term bargain. 'The auction price was a few thousand, then it came down to £1,000, then £500 and I thought I’d bid £250 just to start it off. 'But no-one else bid so I got it. I want to form a society and have an annual meeting at the bridge. 'I think the bridge should have its own Twitter account. It’s big, it’s cumbersome and right now it’s a bit of a problem but we need to get it back up.' Asked if he would sell the bridge to be used at music festivals such as Download, Evans added: 'I don’t want to sell the bridge. I want to retain ownership of the bridge and keep it safe. 'It’s available for hire or to be played under so we will see.' On his show Evans, who also presents The . One Show described his new purchase as a 'national landmark' and . appealed for help getting it from the track to his house. And despite conceding . there could be 'planning issues', Evans, who also presents The One Show, . joked he was going to put up the bridge in his garden over the top of . his neighbour’s house. Landmark: The Dunlop Bridge at Donington Park was placed over the Leicestershire track in 1977 . Car mad: Evans, 46, has a fleet of luxury cars, including a £5.6m Ferrari Spyder . He said: 'All kids listening to this show would say ‘yeah, why would you not buy a bridge?’ 'There will be planning issues of course, with a temporary structure, but if we whittle it away at either end, affectionately and sympathetically, because it is a national landmark, I think I can get it down to four metres?' Evans owns a fleet of luxury cars, including a £5.6m Ferrari Spyder. Tyre company Dunlop originally paid for the bridge to be put over the Leicestershire track in 1977. The structure was based on an identical bridge which has stood over the Circuit De La Sarthe, home of the Le Mans 24 hours, since 1932. In 2009 the bridge was dismantled during planned renovations for the circuit’s former operator’s botched attempts to host the British Grand Prix. When the move collapsed the owners of the circuit were unable to restore the bridge to its position over Starkey’s Straight due to health and safety laws. Auction: Construction workers remove part of the iconic bridge earlier this month . Christopher Tate, managing director at the circuit, said: 'It had just been lying there in twenty pieces in a yard, which needs tidying up - so somebody had the idea of auctioning it off. 'Every now and then you’ve got to make some changes and we’ve got to tidy up the yard.' The lot bought by Evans comprises 16 panel pieces which made the arch that decorated the footbridge.","Car-mad DJ, 46, snapped up landmark at charity auction .

"By . Emily Allen and Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 09:21 EST, 17 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:37 EST, 18 August 2012 . Jailed: Attila Ban, 32, knifed Tibor Vass and . Alice Adams, both 20, to death in a staff flat behind the hotel where . they worked . A double killer who spent two days hiding inside a divan bed at the murder scene was jailed yesterday for 26 years. Hotel receptionist Attila Ban, 32, stabbed colleagues Tibor Vass and Alice Adams in a jealous, drug-fuelled rage. He then had a bath with Mr Vass’s body and lay it on his bed before concealing himself in the hollow base. Armed with a ‘survival kit’ of a knife, mobile phone and bottle of water, Ban cut a peephole to watch police as they searched the flat for clues. He even updated his Facebook page after the killings, writing: ‘I’d like to wake up from this nightmare.’ Police launched a manhunt, but found him only when he emerged after two days and tried to kill himself. Judge Gerald Gordon said Ban was a vain and paranoid man who murdered two ‘innocent and decent’ young people. Sentencing him to 26 years in prison, he said the killer was ‘infatuated’ with Mr Vass and exploded with rage over his friendship with Miss Adams. Ban and his victims worked on reception at the four-star Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow Airport in West London. The killings took place after Ban discovered Mr Vass, 20, was planning to leave and return to university, the Old Bailey heard. He had developed an obsession with his fellow Hungarian and they moved in together when Ban was offered a staff flat as a reward for good work. Miss Adams, 20, had been working at the hotel for only three weeks when she joined the pair for drinking games at the flat on August 9 last year. In the early hours of the next day, Ban launched a frenzied attack on his sleeping friends. Miss Adams, of Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, died from 22 stab wounds and was left lying like a ‘rag doll’ on the floor. Mr Vass died from two knife thrusts that penetrated his heart. Dead: Tibor Vass, left, had been stabbed twice in the heart, while Alice Adams, right, had been knifed 22 times . The judge told Ban: ‘There is no doubt you killed them both extremely violently. ‘Exactly what happened we will probably never know. You said that you cannot remember and that may well be true.’ After his arrest he pretended he had suddenly been struck dumb and communicated in sign language - and he still maintains he cannot remember the massacre. Dressed in the same brown sweater he wore throughout the trial, Ban nodded as sentence was passed and showed no emotion as he was led away to the cells. Ban was a workaholic who had previously worked in similar jobs in the hotel industry in the US and had was named Employee of the Year at the Heathrow hotel six months before he killed his colleagues. He was openly gay and had developed a crush on Mr Vass, a fellow Hungarian, after the younger man started work in August 2010, having moved to the UK after he was turned down for a university place. But Ban was jealous of his relationships with women and had repeatedly launched outbursts at him when he was left out of social events. He was so possessive he manipulated bosses into letting him have one of the sought-after hotel flats and convinced Mr Vass to move in with him. But he was overcome with grief when he learned his friend had finally been offered a university place and was due to go back to Hungary to begin his studies in September last year. Hiding place: Ban took a water bottle and his mobile . phone with him inside the divan bed and used a knife to fashion a spyhole in the bed base, . through which he watched police scouring the scene for clues . Miss Adams was interested in music and performing arts but took a job as a hotel receptionist to help her mother out financially. She had separated from her boyfriend Tad Finney but they had got back together at the time of her death. Miss Adams was looking forward to taking the trip of a lifetime to see her aunt Kathryn get married in Hawaii and was due to fly out a week after the killing. Detectives believe Ban was driven to kill after seeing Mr Vass and Miss Adams kissing at the hotel-owned flat Ban shared with Mr Vass in Harlington, west London. Several friends had been at their flat that night and Ban and others had taken poppers - a well known muscle relaxant. Ban launched his attack after he was left alone with his victims. He told the court that in the room they lay on the bed and both men took it in turns to perform sex acts on Miss Adams. Prosecutors accept there was sexual activity between all three as the DNA from both men was found on Ms Adam’s breasts. Ban said he could remember the threesome but could not recall killing the pair. When he woke up he found the couple dead. 'I accept I killed them. I just can’t remember what happened,' he said. Ban said he tried to kill himself by cutting his wrists and got into the bath with Mr Vass’s body. ‘I did not want to die alone,’ he told the jury. He said he threw a hairdryer in the bath with him to commit suicide - but the appliance simply kept on working under water. The alarm was not raised until around 3pm the next day when all three failed to show up to work the late shift at the hotel. Police forced entry and were confronted with a bloodbath - but Ban was nowhere to be found. They initially believed he could have jumped out of a window or had been hiding in the flat’s loft. Another theory was that he had stashed a clean pair of shoes outside the door and used them to make his getaway without leaving a tell-tale trail of blood. It was only two days later that a forensic examiner noticed the bedroom door, which had previously been left open, was now shut. Detectives found the single bed had been used to wedge it shut and on forcing entry they discovered Ban lying naked and face down on the bed, caked in blood. A craft knife was sticking out of his arm and another was protruding from his buttock. On examining the divan bed, police found Ban had used a knife to open out the inside to allow himself more space to move around. He had spent hours inside and had even defecated inside the divan. Ban claimed he had reached from a hole in the bed to grab a bottle of mineral water when the police were actually in the room. Police said it did not occur to them Ban was still in the room - and they would not have moved the bed for fear of disturbing forensic evidence. Det Insp John Finch, of the Met’s homicide and serious crime command, said: 'The concept of him hiding out in a bed for two days with a dead man he has killed and dumped on top of him is beyond belief.' Police say it is possible Ban was able to rearrange the crime scene - but stressed the public were never at risk. Michael Birnbaum QC, for Ban, said the killer’s actions in bathing Mr Vass before leaving him posed were 'perhaps some kind of homage to Tibor'. Speaking about hiding in the bed, he added: 'I would suggest it’s not a matter to hold against him. He himself said he felt like he wanted to die and if they [the police] came in they would save him. 'On the second night he certainly wasn’t trying to conceal the fact he was there because he came out and changed a large number of things to make clear his presence.' Ban was deeply remorseful and wanted to plead guilty to murder, he told the court. The killer also offered - through Mr Birnbaum - to meet his victim's parents in a bid to help them grieve. 'It might be that in months, or more likely years, to come, if he did remember more of what happened that would be a realistic prospect,' said the lawyer. Ban denied two counts of murder and was convicted. He had already admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility.","Attila Ban knifed Tibor Vass and Alice Adams, both 20, to death in a staff flat behind hotel where they worked .

Tragic: Gloria Knowles, who was savaged to death by her daughter's dogs, pictured at Harrington's pie and mash shop, Tooting, where she worked . The family of a great-grandmother apparently mauled to death by her daughter’s dogs are deciding if they should be put down. The five animals pounced on Gloria Knowles, 71, after she went into the garden to feed them as a favour to her daughter, Beverley Mason on Tuesday night. The widow was found dead at the scene in Morden, South London after the dogs – two 'giant' Bordeaux French mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel – seemed to suddenly turn on her. Now Mrs Knowles’ family must decide the animals’ fate as police investigate. All five dogs, who are said to be 'like family' to relatives, are currently at police-approved kennels. Neighbour Nazir Hussein told the Daily Mirror it would be a difficult decision for the family. He said: ‘The dogs are like family to them. ‘Keeping the dogs would always remind them of what the animals did to their mum, which was horrendous. But they love those dogs and losing them would be very upsetting. Another neighbour said: ‘They can’t understand what has happened and the fact that it is the dogs they loved so much that did this makes it even harder.’ The attack came as further calls were made for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to change the law to allow dog control rules to apply everywhere. Currently, police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack happens in public - and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs. Brutal: Gloria Knowles was mauled to death by her daughter's dogs - two French Mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel (all pictured), who the family must now decide whether to put down or not . The Communications Union CWU, which represents postmen, is campaigning to change the law and said the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is failing to protect both dog owners and attack victims. Mrs Knowles lived next door to her daughter, with her granddaughter, who has a baby of her own. The family has run Harrington's pie and mash shop in nearby Tooting, for several generations. Scene: The back garden of Gloria Knowles' daughter Beverley where it is believed the five dogs attacked her . Mrs Knowles’ daughter, Mrs Mason, lives with her husband, Dylan, and her other three children. The couple own the dogs together. Mr Hussein, 65, said he had long been afraid of the family's dogs, describing them as 'vicious'. Neighbour: Kevin Hamilton said he heard screaming but assumed it was one of Beverley's children . He said: 'I would see the dogs being walked in the park but I didn't want to walk near them. 'They were vicious dogs – you knew by how they pulled on the lead and you could hear them barking from my house. 'There were so many dogs something like this was bound to happen.' Another neighbour, Kevin Hamilton, described hearing screams from Mrs Mason's house at 5:15pm but mistook the noise, thinking it had come from one of Mrs Knowles's grandchildren. Accountant Mr Hamilton, 65, who lives in the other house next door to Mrs Mason, described hearing 'hysterical screaming and barking' as he watched television. He only became aware of the attack when a police officer told him about it, explaining that Mrs Knowles was alone in the house when she went to feed the dogs. He said officers had told him it was Mr Mason who discovered Mrs Knowles's body. Mr Hamilton described the two mastiffs as 'real muscle dogs' with 'enormous chests', and said the animals had a 'pack mentality'. He said: 'If one jumped on you it would certainly knock you over.' He revealed Mrs Mason also owned cats and that one of them was killed a few weeks ago after the dogs began playing with it. He said: 'About two months ago they had this white cat which died. Animals removed: Police have seized the two French Mastiffs, the American bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police-approved kennels pending the post-mortem . Tragedy: Dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where Gloria Knowles may have been mauled to death by the animals . 'The cat used to sleep with the dogs and one of these dogs started to playfully toss it in the air. They have a pack mentality - so the others started doing it too. 'It survived initially and they wrapped it in a blanket, but it later passed away from shock. They are not the sort of dogs you would want to mess with.' Two of the dogs are Bordeaux French mastiffs which is known as a well-natured, docile breed, according to expert Steve Jones. Police are waiting for post-mortem results. A Met spokesman said last night: ‘None of the dogs seized are classified as dangerous dogs. ‘Nothing will be determined until a decision about whether there will be criminal proceedings is taken.’ Dog attack: Mrs Knowles (centre) with daughters Jasmine-Jade Knowles (left), and Beverley Knowles (right) Two years ago Barbara Williams, 52, was mauled to death by an eight stone Neapolitan mastiff in Wallington, south London. The dog had been kept in a cage seven inches shorter than its body. Earlier this year its owner Alex Blackburn-Smith, 35, admitted failing to ensure the dog's welfare and was ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work and pay costs of £3,300 at Croydon Magistrates' Court. In January Leslie Trotman, 83, died after he was mauled by a 'pitbull-type' dog that had broken out of his neighbour's garden in Brentford, West London.","Gloria Knowles, 71, went next door to feed the animals but was apparently mauled to death .

A Colorado man has won $7million after suing a Denver supermarket chain and food manufacturer on the grounds that their microwave popcorn gave him a chronic lung condition known as 'popcorn lung'. Wayne Watson, 59, from Centennial, was diagnosed with respiratory issues in 2007 and was told by doctors that someone who ate as much microwave popcorn as he did might well be in danger of inhaling hazardous vapours from the butter flavouring,  diacetyl. During the trial that began September 4, Mr Watson and his attorney argued that the supermarket that supported his self-confessed three-bag-a-day popcorn habit, should have provided a health warning on the packaging. Scroll Down for Video . Verdict: Wayne Watson of Centennial, Colorado has won a $7 million verdict in the so-called 'popcorn lung' case after he contracted a respiratory condition from the butter flavouring of microwave popcorn . 'Who would ever reasonably think that popping popcorn in your own home, no matter how its packaged or processed would all of a sudden turn into an agent for toxic lung disease,' said Watson. But lawyers for the supermarket chain responded saying they 'might have well have warned that there are aliens popping out of the bags because there’s just as much support for that.' Mr. Watson said he had no idea that his three-a-day consumption of microwaveable popcorn could ever lead to a chronic lung condition . Talking about his love of popcorn before . he became sick and unable to walk long distances over four years ago . and originally filed his suit, Watson was enthusiastic. 'You would get that woof! That little woof when you opened it,' said Watson. 'And you breathe it in.' Indeed, it is that breathing action that Watson claims is the cause of his current illness and is the reason why he is suing King Soopers. Watson alleges that the butter flavouring in the microwave popcorn contains chemicals that vaporise when heated, and that inhaling this causes the severe damage to the respiratory system. He accuses the defendants of making and selling an unsafe product and of failing to warn consumers about the alleged dangers. Mr. Watson walks with his wife outside the federal court in Denver (left) while he is interviewed with Dr. Cecile Rose (right) who is backing up his claims . Wayne Watson claims King Soopers supermarket should have made it clear on their packaging that the butter flavouring of their popcorn contains the compound diacetyl, which in large quantities can be hazardous to a person's health . Watson's doctor at National JEwish Hospital in Denver is a key witness in the case for his legal team. '(I asked) was he exposed to or was he around a lot of popcorn? And his jaw dropped and he asked me how I would possibly know that about him,' Dr. Ceclie Rose said to CBS 4. Countering his claim, lawyers for King Soopers contend that it was in fact Watson's career selling carpet cleaning fluid that led to his lung condition and not the microwaveable popcorn. They even stated that Watson has misled the court on his daily consumption of popcorn. In 2009, Ronald Kuiper, a 69-year-old retired butter flavour mixer was awarded a $7.5 million settlement just prior to dying of heart and lung failure in March of that year. Kuiper worked at the American Pop Corn Co., in the 1990s, mixing artificial flavoring for 'butter flavor' products. In 2006 he was diagnosed with a condition called 'popcorn lung' , after working at the plant for 26 years.","Wayne Watson, 59, said he contracted the chronic condition 'popcorn lung' in 2007 because of the dangerous butter flavouring in microwave popcorn .

Funghi fears: Vast tracts of the New Forest have been stripped of edible mushrooms and the National Trust is blaming 'greedy' commercial pickers . The centuries-old countryside pleasure of foraging for wild mushrooms in the woods has been jeopardised by ‘greedy’ commercial pickers, the National Trust claimed today. In the New Forest, the charity’s Countryside Team has discovered vast tracts of its land have been completely stripped of edible mushrooms. The Trust says commercial picking on a large scale is ruining a family day out and the professional fungi hunters are also damaging the environment. The demand for mushrooms is at a premium after the wettest summer in 100 years left supplies dwindling so professionals are in line for bonanza profits if they can collect enough to sell to top restaurants, hotels and supermarket chains. New Forest is home to thousands of species and is regarded as one of the best areas in the UK for fungi, according to experts. Trust volunteer Roger Newton said: ‘Not only was every single edible mushroom taken or cut, just leaving the stalk, but the ground had been badly trampled. ‘Taking mushrooms like this stops the fruiting body’s ability to release its millions of spores each day and the trampling compresses the ground, damaging the places where they like to grow. ‘There is also the danger that someone gathering mushrooms in this quantity could take poisonous varieties, with dire consequences for those eating them.’ The National Trust is the second largest landowner in the New Forest, with 5,900 acres on five different sites. Many mushies: New Forest is home to thousands of species and is regarded as one of the best areas in the UK for fungi . Lee Hulin, one of the Trust’s outdoor . rangers, said: ‘Our commons are there for everybody so we are . increasingly saddened that large scale harvesting limits the chance of . seeing these lovely mushrooms for regular visitors. ‘This sort of plundering is spoiling enjoyment for everyone.’ The mushrooms shortage across the . British countryside has meant that professionals are flocking to places . like the New Forest where they can still expect to find enough fungi to . make picking commercially worthwhile. The amount paid varies from year to year but experts say commercial pickers can expect to pocket at least £20 per kilo (2.2lbs). Licence to pick: The only person allowed to pick mushrooms commercially in New Forest is Brigitte Tee-Hillman . Commercial mushroom picking is banned . at the New Forest. The only person allowed to pick mushrooms there . commercially is Brigitte Tee-Hillman, 65, who won a landmark ruling . against the Forestry Commission in 2006. A Commission spokeswoman said: ‘People picking mushrooms should only take enough for personal consumption. ‘This means no more than 1.5kg (3.3lbs) per visit and no more than half the fruiting bodies of any one species.’ Ms Tee-Hillman said: ‘Unless we get rain, rain, rain, we are not going to have any mushrooms. ‘We need a lot of penetrating rain to rescue the season but I don’t think we’re going to get it. ‘Since I got my licence to pick mushrooms 33 years ago I have never known it so bad. ‘The dry, warm spring, wet summer and dry autumn have meant a lack of mushrooms and we have had three ground frosts which hasn’t helped. ‘Usually at this time of year everything would be growing but there is just one here, one there. 'We had no St George’s mushrooms at all earlier in the year and the strange seasons have continued. ‘Brown Chanterelles, hedgehog mushrooms and horn of plenty are all missing. ‘The places I supply to are not getting any locally grown ones and the imported mushrooms are also coming in at different times of the year.’ Prices in the shops are soaring because even imports have been hit by this year's unusual weather and mushrooms all over the world growing at the ‘wrong’ time of year. The National Trust says the latest wide scale blitz by professional pickers in the New Forest saw the area around Bramshaw Common cleared of its mushrooms. Shop prices soar: With the mushroom shortage, and even imports hit by this year's unusual weather, commercial pickers can expect to pocket at least £20 per kilo (2.2lbs), experts say . John Wright, a field mycologist who . wrote celebrity chef Hugh Fernley Whittingstall’s River Cottage book on . mushrooms, said the problem was with quantity. He said: ‘There has been a lot of variety, but the quantity has been poor. The problem is that all the rain came in blocks and although the summer rain was good, there was a six or seven week period this autumn without any rain. ‘The mycelium, the long strands that grow underground, need the rain but fungi do not need to produce mushrooms to survive. ‘Like an apple tree doesn’t need to produce apples, fungi don’t need to produce mushrooms and this year they haven’t. ‘Last year was excellent so the fungi might also have used up their resources. The commercial pickers will certainly be struggling.’ The shortage of mushrooms across the British countryside have meant that professionals are flocking to places like the New Forest (pictured) where they can still expect to find enough fungi to make picking commercially worthwhile . Ken Roberts, from the Dorset Fungi Group, agreed that it was a poor season, but said interest remained high among amateur enthusiasts. He said: ‘It has been poor so far but there are signs that it is picking up. However, some varieties have been very thin on the ground. ‘The National Trust is running a survey to log the number of wax cap mushrooms and we haven’t seen many of those about but interest in mycology seems to be growing and for our fungi forays numbers are well up on last year.’","Commercial pickers are in line for massive profits if they can collect enough mushrooms to sell to supermarkets and shops because of the shortage .

For a concerned citizen had dialled officers to report what seemed like a dead pregnant woman, slumped over her steering wheel, and covered in blood. It appeared to the passer-by that she had been shot. But when police arrived at the scene they were shocked to discover the blood-soaked woman was not dead at all – she was only sleeping. She had apparently been sleeping off a nightmare Halloween-induced hangover in the comfort of her car, while still dressed as a zombie. The Birmingham News reported that officers were called to the scene around 8.15am this morning. Police were responding to the call by the panicked citizen who had dialled 911 described seeing the woman covered in white face paint and fake blood and apparently unresponsive at the wheel parked close to a traffic light. They were stunned to discover that the redhead who was drenched in fake blood all over her top and around her mouth was in fact only a woman recovering in her car from Halloween festivities the night before. The pregnancy bump was all part of her costume said officers. She was woken from her slumber by officers who promptly made her hangover a lot worse as they handcuffed her and took her to the local jail. It is unclear who the young woman was.

Tragic: Gloria Knowles, who was savaged to death by her daughter's dogs, pictured at Harrington's pie and mash shop, Tooting, where she worked . A great-grandmother died from shock caused by blood loss after being savaged by her daughter's five dogs, a post-mortem examination has found. Gloria Knowles, 71, suffered a haemorrhage after the dogs - two Bordeaux French Mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a mongrel - pounced when she went to feed them at her daughter's house next door on Tuesday night. Police said: 'A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as shock caused by a haemorrhage as a result of an attack by dogs.' Initial reports suggested Mrs Knowles, a widow, suffered a fatal heart attack after the five animals attacked in Morden, south London. Police said the dogs are still in a kennel while the investigation into the horrific tragedy continues, and do not know whether they will be destroyed. The five animals pounced on Mrs Knowles, after she went into the garden to feed them as a favour to her daughter, Beverley Mason. The widow was found dead at the scene in Morden, South London after the dogs – two 'giant' Bordeaux French mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel – seemed to suddenly turn on her. Now Mrs Knowles’ family must decide the animals’ fate as police investigate. All five dogs, who are said to be 'like family' to relatives, are currently at police-approved kennels. Neighbour Nazir Hussein told the Daily Mirror it would be a difficult decision for the family. He said: ‘The dogs are like family to them. ‘Keeping the dogs would always remind them of what the animals did to their mum, which was horrendous. But they love those dogs and losing them would be very upsetting. Another neighbour said: ‘They can’t understand what has happened and the fact that it is the dogs they loved so much that did this makes it even harder.’ Brutal: Gloria Knowles was mauled to death by her daughter's dogs - two French Mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel (all pictured), who the family must now decide whether to put down or not . The attack came as further calls were . made for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to change the law to allow dog control rules to apply everywhere. Currently, . police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack . happens in public - and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs. The Communications Union CWU, which represents postmen, is campaigning to change the law and said the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is failing to protect both dog owners and attack victims. Mrs Knowles lived next door to her daughter, with her granddaughter, who has a baby of her own. The family has run Harrington's pie and mash shop in nearby Tooting, for several generations. Scene: The back garden of Gloria Knowles' daughter Beverley where it is believed the five dogs attacked her . Mrs Knowles’ daughter, Mrs Mason, lives with her husband, Dylan, and her other three children. The couple own the dogs together. Mr Hussein, 65, said he had long been afraid of the family's dogs, describing them as 'vicious'. Neighbour: Kevin Hamilton said he heard screaming but assumed it was one of Beverley's children . He said: 'I would see the dogs being walked in the park but I didn't want to walk near them. 'They were vicious dogs – you knew by how they pulled on the lead and you could hear them barking from my house. 'There were so many dogs something like this was bound to happen.' Another neighbour, Kevin Hamilton, described hearing screams from Mrs Mason's house at 5:15pm but mistook the noise, thinking it had come from one of Mrs Knowles's grandchildren. Accountant Mr Hamilton, 65, who lives in the other house next door to Mrs Mason, described hearing 'hysterical screaming and barking' as he watched television. He only became aware of the attack when a police officer told him about it, explaining that Mrs Knowles was alone in the house when she went to feed the dogs. He said officers had told him it was Mr Mason who discovered Mrs Knowles's body. Mr Hamilton described the two mastiffs as 'real muscle dogs' with 'enormous chests', and said the animals had a 'pack mentality'. He said: 'If one jumped on you it would certainly knock you over.' He revealed Mrs Mason also owned cats and that one of them was killed a few weeks ago after the dogs began playing with it. He said: 'About two months ago they had this white cat which died. Animals removed: Police have seized the two French Mastiffs, the American bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police-approved kennels pending the post-mortem . Tragedy: Dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where Gloria Knowles may have been mauled to death by the animals . 'The cat used to sleep with the dogs and one of these dogs started to playfully toss it in the air. They have a pack mentality - so the others started doing it too. 'It survived initially and they wrapped it in a blanket, but it later passed away from shock. They are not the sort of dogs you would want to mess with.' Two of the dogs are Bordeaux French mastiffs which is known as a well-natured, docile breed, according to expert Steve Jones. Police are waiting for post-mortem results. A Met spokesman said last night: ‘None of the dogs seized are classified as dangerous dogs. ‘Nothing will be determined until a decision about whether there will be criminal proceedings is taken.’ Dog attack: Mrs Knowles (centre) with daughters Jasmine-Jade Knowles (left), and Beverley Knowles (right) Two years ago Barbara Williams, 52, was mauled to death by an eight stone Neapolitan mastiff in Wallington, south London. The dog had been kept in a cage seven inches shorter than its body. Earlier this year its owner Alex Blackburn-Smith, 35, admitted failing to ensure the dog's welfare and was ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work and pay costs of £3,300 at Croydon Magistrates' Court. In January Leslie Trotman, 83, died after he was mauled by a 'pitbull-type' dog that had broken out of his neighbour's garden in Brentford, West London.","Gloria Knowles, 71, went next door to feed the animals but was apparently mauled to death .

The desk where author Bram Stoker created his immortal 1897 novel Dracula is going up for auction next month after having been restored and turned into a work of art. California company Profiles in History will handle the sale, which will take place on December 15 and 16. The remarkable piece of furniture has had a long history, which, over the past century, has left it battered, with missing drawers and legs sawn short. Lot: The desk on which Bram Stoker wrote his novel Dracula is going up for auction next month after having been restored and turned into a work of art . The Irish-born Stoker, who died in 1912, initially gave the desk to his friend J.S.R. Phillips. The famous writer often stayed with Phillips at his home in the UK. The current owner commissioned British-based furniture maker and designer Mark Brazier-Jones to preserve the desk, but also make it a stand-alone art piece, the auction house said. Brazier-Jones said in a statement that he wanted to preserve the desk's scars and textures, but also pay homage to the man who introduced the vampire Count Dracula to today's pop culture. Author: Stoker, who died in 1912, initially gave the desk to his friend J.S.R. Phillips, with whom he often stayed . His improvements include embroidered imagery ‘appropriate to the great man's inspirations and imagining’, including bats, a savage hound reminiscent of Dracula’s arrival in Whitby Abbey, and scrolling rose thorns and buds. ‘I visualize Stoker sat pen to paper contemplating a moonlit rose garden, breathless milk white cleavage and blood soaked lace,’ Brazier-Jones wrote, according to the East Valley Tribune. The desk’s new fixtures have all been created in bronze and burnished steel, while the drawers have been lined with blood-red velvet. Brazier-Jones also outfitted with leather two secret compartments which will only be revealed to the new owner of the desk. Another hidden chest within the desk has been created in bronze and carved with a rose bas-relief. The auction house expects the desk, along with a matching baroque candelabra designed and crafted by Brazier-Jones, to sell for somewhere between $60,000 and $80,000. Abraham (Bram) Stoker was born November 8, 1847 in Dublin, Ireland, to a family of a civil servant and a charity worker. As a child, Stoker was sickly and spent a lot of time in bed listening to his mother’s horror stories. In 1864, Stoker entered Trinity College Dublin. While attending college he began working as an Irish civil servant. In 1876 he became friends with actor Henry Irving, and soon after, Stoker met an aspiring actress named Florence Balcombe, whom he later married. His first book The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland though written while he was still in Dublin, was published in 1879. Dracula (above left) was Bram Stoker's fifth and by far his most famous novel. It was first published in the UK in 1897. The classic Gothic novel follows the vampire Count Dracula on his journey from his native Transylvania, Romania, to England, where he is finally slain by a small group of men and women led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing. The character of the bloodthirsty nobleman was inspired by Vlad III, a 15th century Wallachian prince known for his excessive cruelty which has earned him the nickname Vlad the Impaler (above right). Although best known for Dracula, Stoker wrote eighteen books before his death in 1912. He died of exhaustion at the age of 64.","Remarkable piece of furniture to be sold by California company .

A Colombian dubbed the 'most dangerous and wanted drugs trafficker in the world' has been arrested at a restaurant in Buenos Aires after police placed satellite tracking devices in his fleet of supercars. Carrying false passports from five countries and posing as a Venezuelan businessman, Henry de Jesus Lopez, nicknamed 'Mi Sangre,' or 'My Blood,' was led away from the Fettuccine Mario restaurant in the Pilar area of the city by armed police on Tuesday evening. The multi-millionaire former foot soldier of notorious drugs baron Pablo Escobar is accused of shipping tons of cocaine to the United States through Central America. Notorious drug trafficker Henry de Jesus Lopez was led away from the Fettuccine Mario restaurant by armed police on Tuesday . He resorted to plastic surgery in a desperate attempt to try and evade capture but was still made to wear a bullet proof vest as he was escorted from his favourite restaurant in order to protect him from assassins. Lopez fled his native city of Medellin in Colombia two years ago after his accountant was arrested. Police said the key to tracking the father of two down was a Colombian . informant who reported his location and movements. The informant, whose . identity is being protected, will be paid a reward worth $660,000. Lopez and a bodyguard were captured without a shot fired said police. Speaking in the Colombian capital of Bogota national police director General Jose Roberto Leon said 41-year-old Lopez ran the 'Urabenos' gang based in northern Colombia after rising through the ranks of right-wing paramilitary groups that doubled as drug trafficking operations. The group takes its name from the Gulf of Uraba on Colombia's Caribbean coast, from which U.S. law enforcement officials say it shipped tons of cocaine northward. Argentine Security Secretary Sergio Berni described Lopez as 'the most dangerous and wanted drugs trafficker in the world'. He is the latest in a series of Colombian traffickers to be arrested at far flung locations - in Venezuela, in Bolivia and now in Argentina - as Colombian authorities and dozens of DEA agents systematically attempt to capture the country's kingpins and begin working their way down the chains of command of the remaining organized crime rings. Police said the key to tracking the father of two down was a Colombian informant who reported his location and movements . 'Colombia now effectively has no more 'capos' of regional or national reach,' said Oscar Naranjo, who retired as Colombia's national police director in July. 'He was one of the few left in Central and South America at that level,' a U.S. law enforcement official said. 'Now you have the second tier.' The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said Lopez was accused in a U.S. criminal complaint of shipping 'multi-ton loads' of cocaine to the United States. Lopez entered Argentina with his wife and child late last year, settling them into a house in the gated community of Nordelta, where many wealthy Argentines and foreigners have waterfront homes. But Berni said he left his family there and moved constantly, jumping from property to property north of the capital, living under assumed names and protected by as many as eight bodyguards. Lopez carried false passports from Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela, and recently traveled through Paraguay and Venezuela in hopes of throwing pursuers off his trail. Lopez's arrest is the latest in a series of stings following arrests in Venezuela, Bolivia and now Argentina - as Colombian authorities and dozens of DEA agents systematically attempt to capture the country's kingpins . In the end, a team of Colombian judicial police installed in Argentina caught him with help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and a small group of Argentine officials. Berni emphasized the Argentine role, attributing the arrest to 'a very thorough investigation' by his agency and federal forces. He said President Cristina Fernandez had personally approved the necessary resources. Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos sent a Twitter message overnight thanking his country's police and Argentine authorities for the arrest. Without offering any details, Berni also said that Lopez trafficked drugs in Argentina during his stay, and that investigations continue. Lopez is accused of organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, and is wanted in Colombia as well as Miami. Authorities are now evaluating which country Argentina should send him to, Gen. Leon said. He could be expelled by Argentina to Colombia, which would in turn extradite him to the United States, whose prisons house scores of Colombian drug traffickers.","Henry de Jesus Lopez had resorted to plastic surgery and five fake passports in attempt to evade police .

In Central Park yesterday... Preparations: Workers yesterday continued to set up the finish line area of the New York City Marathon in Central Park, just hours before the annual event was called off . Ready for action: New York Marathon organisers were preparing for the race right up until yesterday afternoon . Should the New York marathon go ahead, despite thousands still suffering black-outs? 'The Marathon has been an integral part of New York City's life for 40 years and is an event tens of thousands of New Yorkers participate in and millions more watch,' Mayor Bloomberg said in the statement. 'While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division.' He added: 'We would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants, and so we have decided to cancel it. 'We cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event -- even one as meaningful as this -- to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track.' The race is likely to be held at a later date although no details were given as to when this would take place. It is also unclear whether any of the nearly 50,000 runners who were expected to compete in Sunday’s marathon, thousands of whom traveled to New York from other countries, would be compensated in any way. The move to cancel the event is historic as it has been held every year since 1970, including in 2001 when the marathon took place just two months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg toured a storm damaged area of Tottenville in Staten Island before claiming the marathon had become a 'source of controversy and division' Race is off: The Mayor insisted the Marathon would not interfere with the recovery of the city but decided to cancel it after pressure . But the cancellation was almost . inevitable after opposition, from runners as well as politicians and . residents of the worst affected areas, intensified as days wore on . post-storm. At a news . conference on Friday, Mayor Bloomberg defended his initial decision to . go ahead with the marathon as a way to raise money for the city and . boost morale less than a week after Sandy knocked out power and left a . death toll of 109 people. He noted that his predecessor, Rudolph Giuliani, went ahead with the New York Marathon two months after 9/11. ‘If you go back to 9/11, Rudy made . the right decision in those days to run the marathon and pull people . together,' Bloomberg said. The . mayor added that the marathon's organizers are ‘running this race to . help New York City, and the donations from all the runners in the club . will be a great help for our relief efforts.’ Earlier . this week, the mayor said the race wouldn't siphon off resources from . the storm recovery, noting electricity is expected to be restored to all . of Manhattan by race day, freeing up ‘an enormous number of police.’ Lost everything: A woman is helped along by family members in in Breezy Point, Queens, which was ravaged by fire during the storm .

Business owner Paul Wilson agreed . with Bloomberg’s desire to continue with the marathon. Wilson, who owns . Bar East on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, said the weekend after the . superstorm was ‘the perfect time to have it.’ He said: ‘I don’t think the timing could have been better.’ Runners along the 26.2-mile course pass right next to Wilson’s bar. The course runs from the . Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on hard-hit Staten Island to Central Park, . sending runners through all five boroughs. The course of the marathon wasn't going to be changed if it went ahead on Sunday, as there was little damage along the route. Even . before Bloomberg's announcement this evening, as organisers put . finishing touches to the finish line, Staten Island residents were . crying as they saw their . devastated neighborhood.

For days officials in the storm-ravaged . tri-state area insisted that plans to go ahead with the New York Marathon would not affect . recovery efforts, but they were in the minority. Congressman . Michael Grimm, whose district includes the devastated . borough of Staten Island, was one of several prominent politicians who . earlier yesterday voiced his fury that the annual race was going ahead, . even while . many on the island are without water, food, and electricity. ‘There’s no question I’m angry about it,’ the representative said, just hours before the event was called off. ‘The . city of New York is talking about getting water out of the Battery . Tunnel and getting ready for the marathon. We’re pulling bodies out of . the water.’ Speaking on the Today show, Rep Grimm, who represents the 13th . District of New York, said that residents of the borough are barely . coping in the wake of Sandy, and the last thing on their minds is a . race. ‘There are those walking the street and they seem almost hopeless,’ he . said. ‘They’ve lost everything and there’s nowhere for them to go.' More than 100 homes were destroyed in Breezy Point, Queens. Flatbed trucks that originally helped with rescue operations had been diverted to prepare for the marathon, which is now canceled .

Still a long way to go: A woman walks past debris piled in the streets of Hoboken, New Jersey . Postman Mike Conroy delivers the mail to a pharmacy damaged by floodwaters in Hoboken, New Jersey . Nevertheless, the Mayor's office had said: ‘Our recover efforts are ongoing and none of those will . be impacted by the marathon. No resources will be diverted.’ 'There are people right now that have no heat who have no food and are . sitting in the dark. 'To say that we have enough resources just isn’t . accurate. There’s a lot of unanswered questions. We feel that no one . understands us.' Staten Island Councilman James Oddo echoed Rep Grimm’s anger. 'The . notion of diverting even one police officer, one first responder, one . asset away from this carnage, is beyond irrational,’ he told the Daily . News. Earlier, Mayor Bloomberg said he saw none of the damage or power outtages as . insurmountable, and defended the decision to hold the race, insisting . resources wouldn't be diverted from storm victims. He noted at a news conference on Thursday that electricity was expected to . be restored to all of Manhattan by race day, freeing up ‘up an enormous . number of police'. ‘This city is a city where we have to go on,’ he said. But many New Yorkers didn't feel that accurately reflected the current . situation. A petition on Change.org asked Bloomberg and other officials . to postpone the ING Marathon until the spring of next year. ‘Police, fire, and other emergency services should not be diverted to . the Marathon during this time of crisis,’ the petition read. ‘This . event is always a positive event and it should not be turned into a . hugely negative drain on city resources.’ Some critics also questioned whether the marathon should go ahead at all.

According to the Associated Press, authorities took into custody Laurence Alan Stewart II on Thursday after he led them on a 40-mile chase, throwing multiple homemade explosives at his pursuers. Several of the bombs detonated, but no one was seriously injured.

The explosion caused serious damage to the woman’s home, blowing a hole through the roof and several rooms, but she was not injured. The two police officers were also unharmed. It was unclear how Stewart ended up in Montana. Virginia State Police had issued a 'Blue Alert' on Stewart Wednesday, which meant that he intended to harm police officers. This was the first such alert issued in Virginia state history. 'This was an individual that was very dangerous,' said Bradley Beyersdorf, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 'He showed that capacity in Virginia and continued that today in Montana.'

Brutal attack: Jeremy Furchtgott sustained a concussion and was knocked unconscious by the violent attack he sustained . Mr Furchtgott, a Princeton University graduate, was trying to make it home in his darkened city about 6.45pm on Monday before the worst of the storm hit, the New York Daily News reports. Suddenly, he was tripped by one of the thugs. Mr Furchtgott said he didn’t even realize what was happening until it was too late. He thought he tripped over a branch, at first. Then, face-down on the ground, the robbers pummeled him with their fists and kicked him. ‘Give me your phone! Give me your wallet,’ one of the men told him.

On Sunday, Zac Vawter will attempt to make history and climb 103 flights of stairs to the top of one of the world's tallest skyscrapers using a bionic leg that he controls via his thoughts. Vawter, 31, is a software engineer, who signed up to test the trailblazing prosthetic leg after he lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident. He will put the groundbreaking bionic limb to the ultimate test on Sunday when he attempts to climb Chicago's Willis Tower. Biomedical engineer Annie Simon, left, and research prosthetist Elizabeth Halsne fit an experimental 'bionic' prosthetic leg on Zac Vawter at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago . Keep it up: Zac Vawter kicks a soccer ball as biomedical student Aaron Young makes adjustments to the leg at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago . His whirring, robotic leg will respond to electrical impulses from muscles in his hamstring. Vawter will think, ‘Climb stairs,’ and the motors, belts and chains in his leg will synchronize the movements of its ankle and knee. Vawter hopes to make it to the top in an hour, longer than it would've taken before his amputation, less time than it would take with his normal prosthetic leg - or, as he calls it, his ‘dumb’ leg. A team of researchers will be cheering him on and noting the smart leg's performance. When Vawter goes home to Yelm, Washington, where he lives with his wife and two children, the experimental leg will stay behind in Chicago. Researchers will continue to refine its steering. Taking it to the market is still years away. ‘Somewhere down the road, it will benefit me and I hope it will benefit a lot of other people as well,’ Vawter said about the research at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Bionic - or thought-controlled - prosthetic arms have been available for a few years, thanks to pioneering work done at the Rehabilitation Institute. With leg amputees outnumbering people who've lost arms and hands, the Chicago researchers are focusing more on lower limbs. Safety is important. If a bionic hand fails, a person drops a glass of water. If a bionic leg fails, a person falls down stairs. Out on a limb: After losing his right leg in a motorcycle accident, Mr Vawter signed up to become a research subject, helping test a trailblazing prosthetic leg that's controlled by his thoughts . Futuristic: The false limb Mr Vawter will be pushing to the limit when he makes his ascent . The Willis Tower climb will be the bionic leg's first test in the public eye, said lead researcher Levi Hargrove of the institute's Center for Bionic Medicine. The climb, called ‘SkyRise Chicago,’ is a fundraiser for the institute with about 2,700 people climbing. This is the first time the climb has played a role in the facility's research. To prepare, Vawter and the scientists have spent hours adjusting the leg's movements. On one recent day, 11 electrodes placed on the skin of Vawter's thigh fed data to the bionic leg's microcomputer. The researchers turned over the ‘steering’ to Vawter. He kicked a soccer ball, walked around the room and climbed stairs, much to the researchers pleasure. Vawter likes the bionic leg. Compared to his regular prosthetic, it's more responsive and more fluid. As an engineer, he enjoys learning how the leg works. It started with surgery in 2009. When Vawter's leg was amputated, a surgeon repositioned the residual spaghetti-like nerves that normally would carry signals to the lower leg and sewed them to new spots on his hamstring. That would allow Vawter one day to be able to use a bionic leg, even though the technology was years away. Challenge: The Willis tower, where Mr Vawter will put the bionic leg through its paces . The surgery is called ‘targeted muscle reinnervation’ and it's like ‘rewiring the patient,’ Hargrove said. ‘And now when he just thinks about moving his ankle, his hamstring moves and we're able to tell the prosthesis how to move appropriately.’ To one generation it sounds like ‘The Six Million Dollar Man,’ a 1970s TV show featuring a rebuilt hero. A younger generation may think of Luke Skywalker's bionic hand. But Hargrove's inspiration came not from fiction, but from his fellow Canadian Terry Fox, who attempted a cross-country run on a regular artificial leg to raise money for cancer research in 1980. ‘I've run marathons, and when you're in pain, you just think about Terry Fox who did it with a wooden leg and made it halfway across Canada before cancer returned,’ Hargrove said. Experts not involved in the project say the Chicago research is on the leading edge. Most artificial legs are passive. ‘They're basically fancy wooden legs,’ said Daniel Ferris of the University of Michigan. Others have motorized or mechanical components but don't respond to the electrical impulses caused by thought. ‘This is a step beyond the state of the art,’ Ferris said. ‘If they can achieve it, it's very noteworthy and suggests in the next 10 years or so there will be good commercial devices out there.’ The $8 million project is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and involves Vanderbilt University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Rhode Island and the University of New Brunswick.","Zac Vawter lost his leg in a motorcycle accident .

Mutilated bodies can also be seen in a skip awaiting incineration, according to the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. Shocking: Animal rights activists have published pictures of hundreds of monkeys they claim were killed because they were too big for testing in British laboratories . The group claims the unwanted healthy primates were given lethal injections in the heart and then burned on a monkey-breeding farm on the holiday island of Mauritius. British firms are said to pay £260 a time for the animals – but overseas labs are said to only be interested in those weighing less than 3.5kg. BUAV claims pregnant monkeys and babies are also being slaughtered at the Noveprim breeding farm, a major exporter of as many as 10,000 moneys a year to the UK, Spain and the USA. BUAV Director Sarah Kite last night called on the British government to order an immediate ban on the import of monkeys from the Indian Ocean island. ‘This is a cruel and senseless slaughter,’ she said. ‘It is unacceptable that monkeys who have been exploited for years are now simply discarded because they are of no further use to this company. ‘These monkeys should be released into the wild so that they can live out the rest of their lives freely. By importing monkeys from this company, the UK is perpetuating this appalling cruelty,’ she added.

While most couples trot out cliches when it comes to giving tips on a long and successful marriage, this feisty pair have a far more dramatic approach to sticking together. Because while many would say laughter and trust keep them together, pensioners Florence and Harry Lucas say that a daily blazing row is the secret to their relationship. The couple have notched up around 25,550 arguments - one for each day since they tied the knot in October 1942 - but claim the daily squabbles keep their relationship strong. Florence and Harry Lucas fell in love 'at first sight' and have had a tempestuous, but happy, seventy years together . Florence said arguing meant they talked about potential problems and never went to sleep without making up . And Florence - known as Floss - has truly embodied the slang term for wife - 'trouble and strife' - after revealing she had 'lost count of the plates and dishes' she had hurled at hubby Harry, 93, over the years. The 91-year-old said: 'We love each other of course but we’re fighting most of the time - at least one a day for the last 70 years we’ve been married. 'Our squabbles are never over anything important, usually because we just wind each other up. 'The thing about Harry is he winds me up and won’t leave me alone - I’ve lost count of the plates and dishes I’ve thrown at him over the years.' Despite their fiery relationship, the devoted pair also say they always make up before going to sleep and make sure they kiss each other at least once every day. Floss added: 'If any couple tells you they never argue, they’re lying. Arguing is healthy because it means you are talking about things. Harry Lucas, seen here aged 21 in the Royal Artillery, knew that he would be married to Florence for a long time - despite Floss, pictured here aged 19, disagreeing . 'Having said that, I do love him [Harry] to bits. 'It . was love at first sight when I first met him and we have argued, . laughed and loved for 70 years - I wouldn’t have it any other way. 'All our fights have only been over little petty things, it’s never been about either of us running off with other people. 'He was never one for running off down the pub, he’s stuck to me all the time. 'That’s one of the things we’ve fought about, he’s always there, especially these days, he clings to me. 'But my biggest hate is that he is constantly taking his glasses off and cleaning them. He must have the cleanest glasses in the world. 'It’s every couple of minutes they’re off his face and he’s wiping them on his hanky. I wish he’d stop that, it’s so annoying.' Trouble and strife! The couple have notched up around 25,550 arguments - one for each day since they tied the knot in October 1942 . The devoted pair also say they always make up before going to sleep and make sure they kiss each other at least once every day . The couple, who have two children Keith, 65, and Susan, 54, also have five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, first met when they were teenagers during World War Two. They fell for each other after working side-by-side at Perry Cycles in Birmingham but within months Harry was called to fight in the war on the south coast with the Royal Artillery searchlight team. The pair got married while Harry was home on leave and they moved into a house in Balsall Heath, Birmingham. After the war Harry got a job as a quality inspector in a plastics factory while Floss worked for a firm making torpedoes. Floss said: 'We used to meet every day on our lunch breaks. Harry would always, without fail being me an apple and orange. 'If you’d said to me back then ‘you’ll live to be 90 and be married for 70 years’ I’d have laughed and said ‘you’ve got to be joking.’ 'I never thought I’d stay married this long because we’ve had lots and lots of arguments.' Typically, Harry, disagrees with his wife, and said: 'I knew we’d stay married for 70 years, no question. 'We’ve been in Birmingham all our lives, I used to work in factories and that’s where we met. 'I was a bit spoiled back then because I grew up with three sisters and my mother fussing over me, but Flo put me right.'","Wife hates husband's habit of constantly cleaning his glasses .

It's a hobby enjoyed the world over - what could be better than spending a few hours kayaking across a shimmering mountain lake admiring the stunning scenery while keeping fit? Unfortunately, transporting all that bulky equipment around can prove a real headache and then you've got to find somewhere to store it. But now, an enterprising kayak enthusiast from California has come up with an ingenious solution - a 12-foot long kayak that can fold away into a small plastic case. The Origami Kayak: The Oru looks like any normal kayak, but can be folded away into a small plastic case and re-assembled within five minutes . Compact: The plastic case measures 32in by 29in and weighs 25lbs. It can fit in the boot of a car or checked into the hold of an aircraft . Resilient: The fold-up kayak is just as durable as a normal moulded one and has a lifetime guarantee of 20,000 folds . Anton Willis, an architect by trade, has designed the origami boat after being forced to pay for storage when he couldn't fit a conventional kayak into his apartment. The Oru kayak folds into a compact case measuring 32in by 29in and weighing 25lb which can be stored anywhere - even in the luggage hold when flying. When unfolded, Mr Willis, 36, says you can assemble it and be out on the water in five minutes. Fully equipped: A standard fold-away paddle can fit easily inside the kayak when packed into the plastic case . Plenty of space: The Oru is 12ft long and 25 inches wide . Transportable: Inventor Anton Willis says the Oru can be carried anywhere. The architect and kayak enthusiast had not been able to store his boat in his apartment . He said: 'I grew up in rural Northern California, kayaking the rivers and coast. When I moved to the city a few years ago, I had to put my kayak in storage, as it wouldn't fit in my apartment. 'At the same time, I read a magazine article on new advances in the art and science of origami, and started thinking- 'what if a boat could fold up like a piece of paper?' 'The Oru Kayak is made of a single, seamless sheet of corrugated plastic. It's a heavy-duty version of a material often used for packaging and signage. Testing the waters: Kayakers try out the Oru on still waters, but the inventor says it will also withstand extreme conditions . Sense of adventure: The Oru kayak is available later this month and costs £500 . 'It's very tough and durable, as well as lightweight. We have tested it in extreme conditions, including ocean surf, and never had a skin breach. 'The case can hold a breakdown paddle, life jacket, and other accessories too.' What's more, the Oru is fully recyclable and used 70 per cent less petroleum to manufacture than its standard moulded counterparts. Mr Willis claims the kayak is guaranteed for 20,000 folds throughout its lifetime. The Oru Kayak will be available for pre-order Nov 14th from Kickstarter.com, for £500.

Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography . A university football coach facing child pornography charges took the stand yesterday and vehemently denied that cellphone videos he shot of his naked children in the summer were 'inappropriate' and said they were just family fun. Speaking publicly for the first time since his August arrest, Minnesota State University, Mankato coach Todd Hoffner, 46, asked a Blue Earth County district judge to dismiss the charges, arguing that he should have never been arrested. 'There was nothing inappropriate about any of these videos,' he said of footage a technician found on his school-issued cellphone when he took it to the campus IT department after it malfunctioned. The three videos showed his children - aged five to nine years old - dancing around naked and touching their private parts. The coach's testimony came near the end of a three-hour hearing in which his attorney, Jim Fleming, pressed investigators about whether they thought the videos were, in fact, pornographic when they first saw them. Some said they found the images 'disturbing' while others said they needed more context, according to the Star Tribune. Both Fleming and Hoffner's wife have publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous, saying the videos simply captured the family's children being silly. A search of computers taken from the Hoffner home has found 'no additional items that would be considered child pornography,' said Blue Earth County Sheriff's Captain Rich Murry. Hoffner was charged last month with one count of using minors in a sexual performance or pornographic work and one count of possessing child pornography. Both are felonies. He has been the university's head football coach since 2008. Prosecutor Michael Hanson - who was the one to cast the final decision that the images were pornographic and an arrest had to be made - said on Wednesday: 'Adults should not make videos of children in lewd poses -- period.' Search: No child porn was found on the computers taken from the Hoffner family home . Hoffner spoke to the court yesterday to explain the events surrounding the three videos. Two of them - which prosecutors said are the most troubling - show his children fooling around after a whirlpool bubble bath. They drop their towels and run around naked. At one point, the eight-year-old son grabs his genitals and his daughters bend over and spread their buttocks apart. These were shot in June. Hoffner told the court, that after their bath, the children came down to where he was working and asked their father to videotape them because they had made up  skit and wanted their dad to record it - which he did on the work Blackberry, according to the Star Tribune. 'It started with their towels on,' he said. 'They were singing, dancing and laughing. They were doing silly things, having fun.' He said his son seemed determined to 'sabotage' his sisters' routine and jumped in front of them and 'grabbed his private parts' for a few seconds. Controversy: Hoffner was arrested and escorted off a football practice field in August, he remains on leave pending a university investigation . He said he stopped recording at this point but then his daughters, who were upset with their brother, asked them to record it again. This time, the son ran in naked with just a football helmet on. Hoffner said at this point he stopped recording as he knew his son was determined to 'mess everything up'. In an August video, one of the coach's daughters is woken up by her father and told to go to the bathroom. As she is followed to the bathroom, the camera is focused on her underwear. He said he did not show the videos to anyone and did not even view them again after taking them. In fact, he forgot they were even on there when he took his phone to the university's IT department, he told the court. Support: Hoffman's wife Melodee has publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous saying that her husband is innocent and charges against him are 'ridiculous and baseless' But Hanson said it is for this very reason that charges should be withheld. He said: 'You typically have videos made to show to your friends or put on Facebook. That didn't happen here and it didn't happen for a pretty good reason.' Hoffner said he was genuinely shocked when he was arrested on the pornography charges and he had no idea what videos they were talking about. A search of computers and other equipment taken from Hoffner's home when he was arrested turned up no evidence to support the prosecution's case. Social workers who interviewed the children and saw the videos said they found no evidence the couple's children had been abused. Coach Todd Hoffner's attorney Jim Fleming speaks to the media .

Barclays traders toyed with electricity prices at several major power trading hubs in the western U.S. to boost their own profits. The men were caught, and Barclays slapped with a $470million fine, after they bragged about the price rigging in a series of damning, foul-mouthed e-mails. Four traders are accused of conspiring to sell electricity at a loss to drive prices down  between November 2006 and 2008. This enabled simultaneous bets on falling energy prices to reap huge profits, leading to losses of $140million for other investors and pensions funds. Emails and phone messages between foul-mouthed Barclays traders in New York reveal how they bragged about rigging energy prices in America to make huge profits . However, the actions are not believed to have raised energy prices for consumers. Critics yesterday said the . expletive-ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the ‘rotten . culture of casino banking’ that built up under Bob Diamond, the disgraced former CEO of the British bank. The price manipulation took place at . four electricity-trading hubs across the western U.S., according to the . Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The hubs are: Mid-Columbia in . Washington State, Palo Verde in Phoenix, Arizona and South Path 15 and . North Path 15 in California. These hubs are where electricity is channelled, stored and then distributed around the region. Barclays and other banks trade in complicated financial instruments which bet on electricity price movements at these hubs. The bank faces a £270million fine by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for allegedly manipulating the energy market across Western America between November 2006 and 2008 . The accused Barclays traders – Daniel Brin, Scott Connelly, Karen Levine and Ryan Smith – face penalties totalling $18million. Connelly was described as ‘the leader of the manipulative scheme’ and the highest paid. He faces a $15million fine. The bank was also ordered to pay back $35million in profits made from the alleged energy manipulation scam. But, . in arguably a more devastating blow to Barclays, the US regulator . published a series of emails and phone messages sent by the bank’s . traders. In a series of . messages dated November 3, 2006, Ryan Smith bragged to a colleague that . he had managed to manipulate the energy markets. He . said: ‘I totally f****** with the Palo market today,’ adding: ‘I just . started lifting the p*** out of the palo.’ Smith continued: ‘was fun. Need to do that more often.’ In a separate exchange on December 7, 2006, he said: ‘I’m going to c*** on the NP light and it should drive the SP light lower.’ Critics . said the crude messages reinforced the immoral, profit-crazed image . that Barclays has desperately tried to shed since new chief executive . Antony Jenkins took over in August. Critics say the expletive-ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the 'rotten culture of casino banking' that built up under disgraced former boss of Barclays, Bob Diamond, left . John Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee of MPs, said: ‘This just shows how the rotten culture of casino banking that was built up under Bob Diamond went all the way through Barclays. Traders were clearly programmed to do anything to make a profit.’ The emails sent by Barclays’ American traders have echoes of the brash messages sent by their counterparts in London who boasted about rigging key interest rates. These were published in June when Barclays was fined $470million by UK and US regulators over the scandal. This led to the departure of Diamond and several other top executives. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘The American authorities’ allegations of Enron-style rigging of electricity prices shows what a toxic trail Bob Diamond left behind him.’ All four traders accused of rigging the energy markets are thought to have left the bank, although none are understood to have been fired. Barclays has been given 30 days to appeal and said it intends to do so. It said it ‘strongly disagrees with the allegations’, adding: ‘We believe that our trading was legitimate and above board and intend to vigorously defend this matter.’ Barclays is likely to argue that it did not have big enough positions in the energy market to be able to manipulate prices.","Critics said the expletive-ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the 'rotten culture of casino banking' that built up under Bob Diamond .

Former major league pitcher Pascual Perez, who had a troubled 11-season career that included two suspensions for drug use, was killed at his home in the Dominican Republic in an apparent robbery, police said Thursday. Perez, who last played in the majors for the New York Yankees in 1991, was found with a severe head wound in a town west of the capital, Santo Domingo. There was evidence at the scene to suggest that whoever killed him had been searching for money, said Joel Valdemiro, a prosecutor who is involved in the investigation. No one was in custody and authorities did not reveal whether they had any suspects. Police said there were several assailants and that the house in the town of San Gregrorio de Nigua appeared to have been ransacked. ‘It's an act of criminality, unfortunately,’ Valdemiro said. Perez's brother Carlos, a former pitcher for the Dodgers, confirmed his death. Perez's ex-wife Maritza Montero found his body about 8.30am Thursday and investigators said he appeared to have been slain about eight hours earlier. The precise cause of death has not been determined but officials said Perez, who had suffered severe kidney problems in recent years, had a fractured skull from a blow to the head. Perez, 55, played 11 seasons of in the majors and compiled a lifetime record of 67-68 with the Braves, Pirates, Expos and Yankees. But he was in and out of trouble for much of his career. 'We were shocked to hear the news of Pascual Perez' death earlier today,’ said Braves president John Schuerholz in a statement. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during the aftermath of this tragic event. Pascual left his mark with the Braves organization and will always be remembered fondly by Braves fans.’ Perez pitched for Atlanta from 1982-85. He was 15-8 in 1983 and 14-8 in 1984. Pascual Perez was in and out of trouble for much of his career. Here, he is pictured playing for Montreal Expos . The right-hander was first signed by . the Pittsburgh Pirates in January 1976 as an amateur free agent, . according to Baseball-Reference.com, an online sports information site. He . came from a baseball family that included brothers Carlos, a . left-hander with six years in the majors, and Melido, a right-hander . with nine professional seasons, including four with the Yankees. Pascual Perez's career was a rocky one. In 1982, Perez helped Atlanta win the National League West title with a 4-4 record. But in August of that season he missed a start because, as he later explained, he missed a highway exit sign and spent almost two hours circling Atlanta Stadium. While playing for the Braves, he was suspended in April 1984 following his arrest in January of that year in the Dominican Republic on charges of cocaine possession. He spent two months in drug rehabilitation in 1989 while with the Expos, after failing to complete rehab programs twice before, and avoided a suspension only by agreeing to accept a minimum one-year suspension if he tested positive for cocaine again. In March 1992, the commissioner's office suspended him after a failed test the day he arrived for spring training with the Yankees. At the time, he was entering the final season of a three-year, $5.7 million contract. He never returned to major league baseball.","Perez had a troubled 11-season career, including two suspensions for drug abuse .

Figures published yesterday showed the full scale of the fiasco for the first time. Nearly a quarter of schools and . colleges – more than 600 – saw their English results nosedive at least . 10 per cent on the previous year. Almost 1,000 suffered at least a 5 per . cent fall.

Integrity: Chief executive of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said that 'a widespread loss of integrity' has had a snowball effect on teachers . English GCSEs were also poorly . designed in the first place, with 60 per cent of the marks resting on . ‘controlled assessments’ – coursework written under exam conditions but . marked by teachers. As teachers’ leaders lambasted claims . of cheating, anonymous reports quoted by Ofqual showed that staff felt . ‘unhealthy pressures’ to inflate grades in ‘woolly’ assessments. One admitted that grades in controlled . assignments were ‘fiddled’ to make up for poor marks in written exams. Another said pupils’ work was effectively rewritten by teachers. The testimonies emerged  following . interviews with more than 100 schools and postings on the Times . Education Supplement web forum for teachers. Glenys Stacey, chief executive of Ofqual, said: ‘Those postings aren’t limited to English.’ She added that there were ‘special pressures’ on English and that ‘other GCSEs are in the main stronger’. But she believed that evidence of . teaching and marking to target specific grades – mainly Cs – was closely . linked to the importance of a given subject in school performance . tables. Schools are mainly judged on results in English and maths, with . science, languages, history and geography also carrying weight. ‘If we had the resource to map this . out for all 70 subjects, I suspect that the patterns would directly . relate to the place of qualifications in the accountability regime, . subject by subject,’ she said. ‘I’m not expecting to see those patterns . in drama.’ Ofqual denies results were ‘fixed’ but claims ‘tactical’ over- marking by some schools led to the grade boundary changes. A TES survey found that 93 per cent of teachers had lost confidence in Ofqual. Russell Hobby, of the National . Association of Head Teachers, said teachers were ‘not to blame for the . grading shambles surrounding the exam and they should not be made . scapegoats for the system’.

The family of a 27-year-old woman who vanished without a trace in 1975 has finally received some closure after the state medical examiner's office identified her body. Priscilla Blevins’s sister, Cathy Blevins Howe, said Detective Lee Tuttle of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department knocked on her door on October 19 and told her, 'We found your sister'. As it turns out, the remains of the North Carolina woman had spent more than 20 years locked away in a storage facility, with her loved ones left wondering what had happened to her. Scroll down for video . Missing for decades: Priscilla Blevins, a native of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was last seen by her roommate at their home on Tyvola Road on July 7, 1975 . ‘It was equal parts of relief, surprise, sorrow and joy at the opportunity to finally bring my sister home,’ Howe told the Huffington Post. Ms Blevins, a native of Winston-Salem, was last seen by her roommate at their home on Tyvola Road on July 7, 1975. Ten years later, a woman's body was found near Interstate 40 in Haywood County and taken to the Medical Examiner's Office in Chapel Hill. However, the skeletal remains lacked any identifying characteristics and officials did not have the necessary technology at their disposal to make a positive match. And so the victim labeled as Jane Doe had remained locked away for more than 20 years. The search for Ms Blevins got under way immediately after her mysterious disappearance, but the trail had quickly gone cold. Initially, her parents, Bob and Sadie Blevins, led the effort to find and bring their daughter home, but after their deaths in 2001 and 2002, respectively, Ms Howe got involved in the cold case investigation along with Detective Tuttle. ‘As I got older and had a daughter of my own, my curiosity about this continued and it just never let up,’ she said. ‘I just decided that I wanted to see what I could find out.’ In 2009, Ms Howe provided her DNA to investigators, which was matched against samples collected from unidentified bodies by North Carolina officials and entered into the FBI’s national database, the Charlotte Observer reported. Amazed: Priscilla Blevins's sister, Cathy Blevins Howe, said Detective Lee Tuttle of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department knocked on her door on October 19 and told her, 'We found your sister' The mitochondrial evidence combined with dental records confirmed that it was Ms Blevins' body which was found in Haywood County, about 150 miles from her home. Ms Howe declined to comment on the investigation into her sister's death or whether she thinks foul play was involved, but she said she doubts that Blevins allowed herself to be taken to Haywood County, which is on the Tennessee border. ‘I don't think it was her own will that she was found on the side of the road,’ Ms Howe said. 'It was equal parts of relief, surprise, sorrow and joy at the opportunity to finally bring my sister home' Cathy Blevins Howe, Priscilla Blevins's sister . Ms Howe said she was planning a business trip to Namibia when Detective Tuttle told ‘out of the blue’ her that her sister had been positively identified. She decided to go ahead with her trip because ‘I gave myself time to absorb this shocking news.’ Ms Blevins graduated from Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem in 1966, according to her sister. She graduated from Wake Forest University in 1971. Ms Blevins taught English in Bogota, Colombia, and was aspiring to become a translator for the United Nations. She had quit her job at Ivey's department store in Charlotte before she went missing. In the late 1970s, Ms Blevins's disappearance drew the attention of then-U.S. Senator Jesse Helms and U.S. Rep Steve Neal, who put several federal agencies on alert for any sign of her. Ms Howe said she is planning for a ‘memorial homecoming’ for Ms Blevins to be held November 17 in Wait Chapel at Wake Forest. The 27-year-old woman will be laid to rest beside her parents.

With its vivid interplay of emerald and amethyst hues, this remarkable image could almost be a precious stone growing deep within the bowels of the Earth. In fact it shows a virus replicating and spreading through cells, destroying them as it goes. The picture was captured by researchers from the University of Sydney, Australia, using a technique that also helps calculate the level of infectious virus present in cells. Invasion: This remarkable image shows a vaccinia virus spreading from a single infected cell through an entire layer of monkey kidney cells . 'The image shows vaccinia virus, the live-virus vaccine used to eradicate smallpox, spreading from a single infected cell through an entire layer of monkey kidney cells,' said Dr Timothy Newsome. He and Dean Procter, a PhD student from his laboratory at the university's School of Molecular Bioscience, collaborated with scientists from the Australian National University to create the image. It is part of Dr Newsome's research on understanding the role of viral genes in viral biology and the effect that mutating these genes has on the viruses' ability to cause disease. The image, which was featured in the prestigious Cell magazine as part of their Cell Picture Show, is titled 'Eye of the Storm'. Scientists investigating the spread of cancer cells have surgically implanted windows into the bellies of live mice. The glass portholes stitched directly into the rodents' abdominal walls are intended to help researchers track how cancer cells spread to form secondary tumours. This process, known as tumour metastasis, is currently not not well understood, however the lethal dispersal of these cells is the cause of most cancer-related deaths. The gruesome method has been pioneered by Jacco van Rheenen and his colleagues at the Hubrecht Institute for Developmental Biology and Stem Cell Research in Utrecht, the Netherlands. They surgically removed a section of a mouse's abdominal wall and replaced it with a tiny glass pane about half an inch wide surrounded by a biocompatible titanium ring. Tightly stitched to the skin and abdominal wall, the windows reportedly did not impair the rodents' movements and they caused no signs of infection and inflammation. However, in just over one in 50 cases the glass panes did break, with presumably grisly consequences. The name that Dr Newsome and Mr Procter chose is intended to convey the sense of seeing the starting point of the viral activity in the cells. 'The image is actually a composite of several smaller images taken in the microscope facility in the School of Molecular Bioscience,' said Mr Procter. 'To create them we work with the ideal dilution of highly concentrated virus so that only a few cells are infected. That allows us to monitor the spread of the virus through the uninfected cell layer.' Three days after the initial infection, the cells are chemically fixed, creating a snapshot of the infection at this stage, the researchers say. 'We then use fluorescent chemicals to highlight the structures in the cell we want to concentrate on. In this case pink virus-infected cells, yellow DNA and a turquoise skeleton,' Mr Proctor added. Viral plaques are patches of cells infected by viruses that have a distinctly different appearance because of cell death, movement or a change in cell structure. By counting the number of viral plaques in a layer of cells molecular bioscientists can figure out how much virus is circulating in a host or the concentration of viruses they work with in the laboratory. 'The degree to which viruses change the appearance of cells they infect inside a plaque can help us understand how pathogenic the virus is,' said Mr Procter. 'This is a particularly beautiful technique used in our lab to discover whether the mutations we make in the virus affect their ability to cause disease.'",The picture was previously featured in the prestigious Cell magazine .

All the offences were carried out between January 1, 2010, and August 30, 2011. Pearson's girlfriend Cassandra Mennim tried to pay for a luxury hotel stay at the Cedar Court Grand Hotel in York . Mennim also used PayPal details to tell staff she would pay for an expensive stay at Lady Anne Middleton's Hotel, in York . Pearson and Mennim were originally charged with conspiracy to commit fraud between the same dates and conspiracy to supply drugs, but today entered not guilty pleas to the two counts. It was alleged that the couple had plotted with ‘others unknown’ to defraud banks, credit card companies and PayPal by ‘dishonestly obtaining banking details over the internet’. The couple were also said to have been dealing in the drug MDVP, also known as ‘super cocaine’. Pearson pleaded not guilty to a further count of making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in an offence. Prosecutor David Hughes said: ‘Those pleas have been the subject of some discussion and they are acceptable to the Crown. ‘The position is that not guilty pleas have been entered to counts one, two and four and the Crown are content to leave these on the file.’ The pair, who were arrested at the flat they shared by North Yorkshire Police last year, will be sentenced next month.","Edward Pearson accessed credit card numbers of 400 PayPal customers .

Two thieves were jailed today for stealing from an unconscious teenager moments after he fell from a second floor window. Leanne Ryan, 30, and Thomas Knight, 45, took a wallet and an iPhone when they rifled through Daniel Courchee's pockets while he lay on the pavement suffering from multiple fractures to his head, face, pelvis, leg and wrist. They were each jailed for two years by a judge sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, who said they had committed a 'cruel, callous, despicable crime'. 'Despicable': Leanne Ryan (left) and Thomas Knight (right) stole a wallet and an iPhone from teenager Daniel Courchee while he lay unconscious after falling from a second floor window . The court heard that Mr Courchee, 19, fell from a window ledge of Knight's flat in Liverpool city centre on July 6 this year. CCTV footage played at the hearing showed the teenager's fall. Knight and Ryan, who had been a guest at the flat, could then be seen coming out to the scene and crouching over him. Ryan took the items and handed them to Knight, which meant emergency services were unable to identify Mr Courchee when they arrived to treat him. The teenager was taken to hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery for life-threatening injuries. The court heard that it was unclear why he had fallen, but injuries to his neck were consistent with knife wounds. Plunge: The block of flats on London Road in Liverpool city centre, where teenager Daniel Courchee suffered multiple injuries in a fall . Knight, who had 90 previous connections, was arrested along with Ryan and three others on suspicion of attempted murder. All five were later charged with conspiracy to rob, but Knight and Ryan pleaded guilty to a less serious offence of theft. Charges were dropped against the other three defendants. Judge Thomas Teague QC said that Mr Courchee, from Warrington, had had 'his young life wrecked by these events'. The teenager had been due to start a degree course at the University of Liverpool this autumn. The judge told the thieves: 'Shortly . after 4am Mr Courchee fell from the window of the flat to the pavement . outside sustaining dreadful injuries. Remarks: Judge James Teague QC said it was a 'cruel, callous and despicable crime' 'As . I speak he has no recollection of what caused him to fall and the other . occupants of the flat have chosen not to reveal what happened. 'I . sentence you on the basis that you played no part in causing him to . fall from that window......What you did was bad enough because you went . outside to the street where he lay gravely injured and after making only . the most perfunctory attempts to summon help you went through his . clothing and stole his wallet and phone. 'It was a cruel, callous and despicable crime in which you both played an equal part. 'One result was the removal of the only means of identification carried by your victim which meant the police and medical authorities were unable to notify his family. 'His relatives suffered hours of agony and distress and were unable to make contact and having no idea what had happened.' The judge added that, but for the thieves' actions, Mr Courchee's family could have been at his bedside. 'His family may have had the comfort of knowing where he was and that he was in capable hands,' the judge said. 'You caused untold anguish to his family by removing any means of identifying him and that makes it a particularly serious offence.' Neville Biddle, prosecuting, told the . court that Mr Courchee went out on July 5 with two friends and they . spent the evening socialising at various bars in the city centre. He became separated from his friends and when one rang him at 2.24am he said he was with a woman near Lime Street. When contacted again 15 minutes later, he said he was at 'some girl’s house'. CCTV . footage later revealed he had gone into the block of flats with a woman . called Carla Shaw at 2.25am. He fell out of the window at 4.06am. Knight and Ryan appeared within . minutes and, after crouching over his body, Ryan was seen to pass the . victim’s wallet and iPhone to Knight. After . checking through the wallet, Knight went back into the flat with the . items. He disposed of the wallet in a bin area shortly afterwards. 'You caused untold anguish to his family by removing any means of identifying him and that makes it a particularly serious offence.' - Judge Thomas Teague QC . Mr Biddle said that a passer-by who saw Knight standing near Mr Courchee had described the thief as seeming 'not bothered'. Knight later suggested to police that Mr Courchee had jumped from the window of his own accord. While Mr Courchee's family were reporting him missing, police were urging the defendants to tell them who the injured man was. Officers found the teenager's wallet in the bin area and the iPhone hidden in the flat. Rowena . Goode, defending Ryan, told the court that a situation had developed . between the victim and one of the men present - not Knight - and the . teenager had ended up on the window ledge. 'Knight has described to police how . Leanne Ryan had attempted to get hold of Daniel Courchee and bring him . back into the flat and was unfortunately not successful and shortly . after he fell from the window,' Ms Goode said. Raymond . Herman, for Knight, said that his client had been a heroin user but had . kept out of trouble since his last prison sentence in 2009. He . told the hearing that Knight went outside after Mr Courchee fell to see . what had happened and had gone over the road to a cafe to ask for the . emergency services to be called. 'What . happened thereafter was truly appalling,' the barrister continued, 'but . he did not initiate the decision to take the wallet and phone.' Justice: Ryan, 30, and Knight, 45, were each given two-year jail sentences by a judge sitting at Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) In a statement after the sentencing hearing, Mr Courchee's parents Roger and Carol said: 'Daniel was a normal fun loving 19-year-old when this incident occurred and is a very much-loved member of a close family. 'He was looking forward to going to Liverpool University to study biological sciences prior to this incident. 'At the time Daniel was robbed he was in a critical condition on the ground and the people that carried out the theft would have known this. 'At a time when everybody deserves all the help and support possible these individuals were driven by their own greed. 'They would have realised Daniel was seriously injured and needed urgent medical attention. Their act of theft was callous.' The parents said that Mr Courchee had suffered 'life-changing injuries' and now required help to do things that many take for granted. 'His treatment is ongoing and the full extent of his injuries will not be known for sometime,' they said. 'We acknowledge the sentencing today but no sentence will be long enough for these people.' They thanked family, friends, medical staff and police for their support.","Leanne Ryan, 30, and Thomas Knight, 45, were each jailed for two years .

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority agent was forced to open fire on an apparently homeless man who tried to barge into a shuttered station in Brooklyn early Wednesday, authorities told the New York Daily News. The revenue collection agent shot the man, who was wielding a screwdriver, once in the chest during a confrontation at about 2am. A law enforcement source said the agent was standing at the station entrance when the man tried to enter. The agent told him the station was closed and a dispute erupted, the source said. The homeless man 'lunged' at the agent, according to Derrick Echevarria, a divisional chairman with Transport Workers Union Local 100. 'He tried to avoid him,' Echevarria said. 'He tried to walk away, but he kept following him.' The wounded man was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he was in a stable condition, the law enforcement source said. The agent thought the screwdriver was a knife, said Maurice Jenkins, a Local 100 vice president. He positioned himself behind a pole and tried to keep a safe distance from the man, but the intruder kept coming, Jenkins said. 'The agent showed extreme . restraint,but it became life or death,' Jenkins said. 'He tried . everything he could to get away from him.' The guard shot the man, believing a screwdriver he was holding was a knife (stock picture) The agent went to the closed station with a maintenance worker to inspect and check MetroCard vending machines and equipment in the token booth, Jenkins said.

Scotland Yard has launched a high-level investigation after an officer guarding the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge accidentally fired a gun outside their house. The plain-clothed policeman was on duty at the couple’s rented home on Anglesey, North Wales, where Prince William works as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley. William was on base at the time but his wife was believed to be at home, although sources stressed she was not in the vicinity of the shot and therefore had not been in any danger. Protection: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are at home on Anglesey following their recent tour of Asia and the South Pacific . The incident happened at lunchtime on . Wednesday last week when the officer - who has not been named - was in . an unmarked car outside the property. According to the Metropolitan Police he ‘unintentionally discharged a firearm’. The bullet went straight into the . floor of the car - believed to be a Range Rover - but fortunately the . officer and a second colleague who was also in the vehicle were . uninjured. He has, however, been routinely removed from firearm duties pending the outcome of the inquiry. Royal protection officers routinely use the Austrian-made 9mm Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol. It is known as a ‘safe action’ pistol but has been involved in a series of security incidents. In June 2000 a protection officer accidentally fired two rounds while on the Royal Train carrying the Queen and Prince Philip. A 2010 report found that police . marksmen had fired their guns by mistake - known as ‘negligent . discharge’ - more times over the previous three years than when . responding to threats. In one incident a policeman was accidentally shot dead and two others suffered chest and hand injuries. A Scotland Yard spokesman said last . night: ‘Shortly before 13:00hrs on Wednesday, 24 October, an on-duty MPS . (Metropolitan Police Service) police officer unintentionally discharged . a firearm while in an unmarked police vehicle. The round damaged the . floor of the vehicle.

But the rest of the Stephen Lawrence killer gang were warned yesterday that they will not get away with murder. Jailing Gary Dobson and David Norris for the ‘terrible and evil crime which scarred the conscience of the nation’, Mr Justice Treacy dramatically ordered Scotland Yard to hunt down the ‘three or four’ killers still at large. Flashpoint: Neil Acourt (number 1) his brother Jamie (2) and Luke Knight (3) are among the gang who came out fighting after the public inquiry in 1998 . Police, he declared, should not ‘close the file’ on the case. His forthright comments were backed . by Stephen’s parents, Neville and Doreen, and prompted the Metropolitan . Police Commissioner to pledge that the remaining suspects ‘should not . rest easily in their beds’. Significantly, police have already received a number of calls about Stephen’s murder since Tuesday’s convictions. The trio of . men long suspected of joining Dobson and Norris in the ‘racist and . thuggish’ South London lynching in April 1993 are brothers Neil and . Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight. Flashpoint: David Norris, (left to right) Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight, (Gary Dobson obscured) and Neil Acourt leave the Stephen Lawrence public inquiry . Stephen in his favourite T-shirt when he was about 16 years old . Their names were handed to police . within days of Stephen’s murder and all five were named by the Daily . Mail as killers in 1997 and challenged to sue if the newspaper was . wrong. They never did. Outside the Old Bailey Mr Lawrence . said he hoped Dobson and Norris would ‘give up the rest of the people’ involved and effectively handed officers a 12-month deadline to make . fresh progress. ‘One of my greatest hopes is that . these people have now realised that they have been found out, and they . are now going to go and lie down in their beds and think that they were . the ones who were responsible for the death of my son,’ he said. ‘And . they are going to give up the rest of the people so that I (can) come . out here again in a year’s time and talk to you people again.’ Stephen’s mother Doreen told the . Mail: ‘There is no shred of doubt in my mind that all five are guilty. After Stephen’s death we had people we don’t know leaving messages and . giving us their names. We would have had no idea about these young men, . who they were and where they lived, but we were getting these messages . about their behaviour; the way they cleaned knives in front of their . windows, attacks on other people. ‘So with that combination of things, . and then seeing the police surveillance video where it’s clear the . hatred they have for individual races, you think, no, it has to be . them.’ Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe insisted . detectives would go after the remaining suspects. He urged people to . come forward with information which might prompt new charges. Flee: The group run as they are pelted with eggs after leaving the Public Inquiry. Luke Knight (2nd left), Neil Acourt (far left), David Norris (centre), Jamie Acourt (right, with white shirt), had to run the gauntlet of an angry crowd after they had given evidence . The new phase of the marathon . Lawrence investigation is expected to focus on the Acourt brothers and . Knight, who were in hiding last night after apparently fleeing their . homes. It is also likely to include a renewed attempt to identify a . possible sixth member of the gang. The comments of Mr Justice Treacy, in . a packed but silent courtroom at the Old Bailey, will terrify the . Acourts and Knight, who have so far dodged justice over Stephen’s . murder. After jailing Dobson and Norris and praising the detective who . helped put them behind bars, the judge said: ‘At least a measure of . justice has been achieved at last. ‘However, the convictions of Gary . Dobson and David Norris will not, I hope, close the file on this murder. On the evidence before the court, there are still three or four other . killers of Stephen Lawrence at large. ‘Just as advances in science have . brought two people to justice, I hope the Metropolitan Police will be . alert to future lines of inquiry, not only based on developments in . science but perhaps also information from those who have been silent so . far, wherever they may be.’ Neil Acourt and his girlfriend Claire Vose: He . has repeatedly been in trouble with the law. She is expecting their . first child this month . Police plan to meet next week to assess where the case stands. Dobson, 36, and Norris, 35, were . convicted on Tuesday of the racist murder of Stephen. Dobson, who is . already serving a five-year sentence for drug-dealing, was sentenced to . at least 15 years and two months. Norris was given a minimum of 14 years and three months for what the judge described as a ‘terrible and evil crime’. Guilty: Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris went . on trial for the murder of Stephen Lawrence six weeks ago. Both men . denied the charge . In court, Mr Justice Treacy called . forward Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll, who has been the . senior officer in the case for a number of years. He told him that the public inquiry . into the circumstances surrounding Stephen’s death had ‘shamed and . humbled’ the Met, but praised the hard work done in recent years. The evidence in the trial could not . prove who wielded the knife, but he said that whoever used it had done . so with Dobson and Norris’s ‘knowledge and approval’. Neither of them had shown ‘the . slightest regret or remorse’ since the murder and they had both lied to . the court. At Scotland Yard, Mr Hogan-Howe said his officers would . continue their inquiry into Stephen’s murder, adding: ‘We can make a . difference in this case still. ‘The other people involved in the . murder of Stephen Lawrence should not rest easily in their beds.

Even though it’s just a week since Strictly’s rather lack-lustre movie-themed show, on Saturday the celebrities were raiding the dressing-up box again – this time for a Hallowe’en special. Whether you believe in the supernatural or not, anybody watching the show will have to agree there was definitely something mysterious happening in the studio. For starters there was Tess Daly wearing a stylish, modern dress that didn’t look as though it had come from the Littlewoods catalogue circa 1974. Spooky: The cast perform Thriller on Strictly Come Dancing for the Hallowe'en special . Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, wearing a stylish, modern dress . Then a couple of Bruce’s jokes came dangerously close to being funny — and don’t even get me started on the contestants. Michael Vaughan delivering one of the best dances of the night? Victoria Pendleton getting through a whole routine without messing it up and bawling her eyes out? There were dark forces at play all right. But one person who was unaffected by the spooky goings-on was Sid Owen. Having thrown an almighty strop after receiving low marks for his appalling tango last week, he was determined to show the audience what he can do. After watching his cha-cha-cha, performed to the Ghostbusters  soundtrack, it’s clear that what he can do is walk forwards and then backwards (but not in time to the music). When the phone lines were opened the answer to the song’s ‘Who you gonna call?’ refrain was clearly: ‘Anyone but Sid.’ He ended up in the bottom two alongside the gorgeous Colin Salmon, and got the boot after the dance-off. Perhaps it was pity that made Bruno Tonioli tell Sid he believed his poor form was due to him thinking too hard. Now, I’m sure Sid is a lovely bloke but I can’t imagine his mind is ever troubled by too many thoughts. Darcey Bussell tried to cheer up  sulky Sid by assuring him there was at least ‘more dance content’ in his performance than the previous week. What was she watching? It had as much dance content as somebody pushing a trolley around Tesco. Brendan Cole and Victoria Pendleton, who got through a whole round without messing it up . Robin Windsor and Lisa Riley, left, and Sid Owen, right, who was determined to show the audience what he could do . Sexy Colin’s salsa wasn’t his best but I do think he should be given extra marks just to make up for the height discrepancy between him and partner Kristina. How is he meant to dance convincingly with someone who only comes up to his waist? When they’re in hold the cameraman must have to lie on the floor to get them in shot. The biggest surprise of the evening was Michael Vaughan’s dazzling quickstep. For two weeks running he’s danced like a wooden puppet. Then, on Saturday night, he glided across the floor like a gazelle. It was all rather puzzling. How can somebody be so awful one week and so brilliant the next? Has he been raiding Lance Armstrong’s medicine cabinet? Hot on his heels came Victoria Pendleton dancing a tango.

In recent weeks we’ve come to expect 90 seconds of her being dragged around the floor by Brendan Cole followed by her delivering a tearful list of reasons why it all went wrong. But this week it all went so smoothly. Poor Len looked most put out that he couldn’t offer up any of those cheesy ‘back in the saddle’ cycling analogies he’s become so fond of. The best dance of the evening came in the form of a zombie-themed tango from Louis Smith and his partner Flavia. It was good enough for the other three judges to give their nine-score paddles the first outing of the series – and a chance for Darcey, who seems to get a bit hot and bothered every time Louis dances, to fan herself down with hers.",Tess Daly was wearing a stylish dress and Victoria Pendleton didn't cry .

Big mistake: After spending eight years in prison for murder, Lana Canen, 53, has been released after a fingerprint used as crucial evidence against her was found incorrectly matching hers . An Indiana woman who spent eight years behind bars for the killing of a blind 94-year-old woman has been freed, after a fingerprint used in trial against her was found not to be hers, after all. After eight years Lana Canen, 53, was released on Friday from the Elkhart County Jail after a judge overturned her 2005 murder conviction in the 2002 Thanksgiving Day slaying of Helen Sailor and ordered her free. Receiving that 'unbelievable' phone call bearing the news, was Ms Canen's mother. 'She said, "" I got really good news for you,""' Sandra Brinson recalled of her daughter's attorney to WSBT-TV. '""All of the charges have been dropped.'"" Now standing in her home, though still in her prison clothes, Ms Canen said: 'I didn't never think this day was going to come. It's been a long time coming.’ Ms Canen, now a free woman, has long maintained that she had nothing to do with the murder of Ms Sailor in 2002. At her trial, prosecutors said she conspired with her co-defendant, Andrew Royer, to rob Ms Sailor, and that Royer strangled the woman. Both were convicted and given 55-year prison sentences. Ms Canen appealed her conviction and earlier this year, an Arizona fingerprint expert discovered that an Elkhart County sheriff's detective, Dennis Chapman, had misidentified a fingerprint found on a pill bottle in Ms Sailor's apartment as Ms Canen's. Waiting for the day: It was a single fingerprint prosecutors claimed to link Ms Canen to the 2002 slaying of Helen Sailor which she has maintained her innocence in . Convicted: Prosecutors said she conspired with her co-defendant, Andrew Royer, left, to rob Ms Sailor before Royer strangled the woman giving them both 55-year prison sentences . Prosecutor Curtis Hill said the fingerprint was a central part of the case against Ms Canen and that without it, he couldn't prove she was involved. 'There's just not an ability for me in good conscience to go forward and suggest that we have a sufficient amount to support a prosecution,' Mr Hill said. He said the only way Ms Canen could be charged in Ms Sailor's death again is if investigators find other evidence against her. When asked whether he thought Ms Canen was innocent, the prosecutor responded: 'That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I can't prove it.' After her release on Friday Ms Canen said that since her 2004 arrest, she hadn't seen her now 10-year-old grandson, her daughter and other relatives. Now free, she said even car exhaust smelled 'good.' New life: Ms Canen sits at her mother's home, still in her prison clothing, still realizing her newly found freedom . Speaking with WSBT-TV she said she had nothing to do with Ms Sailor's killing. 'That's what's hard to think (is) that people would think I'm that kind of a monster that would do that to a 94-year-old blind woman,' Ms Canen said. Mr Chapman, who admitted that his fingerprint test results were wrong, was disciplined and still works at the sheriff's department.","Lana Canen, 53, was sentenced to 55-years in prison for the murder of a 94-year-old blind woman .

Matthew spent part of his two-week placement at the company's head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, developing and sampling his culinary creation - Beef & Tomato Wedge Bake -so it could be put on shop shelves this month. The youngster said: 'We were trying different types of food and I just thought beef and tomato would be a better combination. 'They came back with a sample to taste and it developed from there. It happened almost by accident but it is very exciting.' His homebake meal, which sells for £5 in a family-sized pack, has been available in select stores for nearly a week.

Peering nervously out of its shell for a first glimpse at the world, this turtle, not much bigger than a 50p piece, is part of a breeding programme that will hopefully help save its species. Once common along the Pacific coast of North America, the Western Pond turtle has all but disappeared from Canada and is threatened in the United States and Mexico by river dams, invasive plants, draining of wetland and its natural predators. But these latest additions, born at Oregon Zoo, give hope that their decline can be reversed. Hello, world: This Western Pond Turtle hatches from his egg at Oregon Zoo, where a two-decade breeding programme is underway to help save the species . Miniscule: This little turtle is barely bigger than a coin. Out in the wild, it would have been extremely vulnerable to predators at this size . They are the result of a 20-year breeding programme aimed at restoring the species to its previous levels. Although the turtles can live until the age of 70, they don't begin to breed until they're 10. But with the turtles endangered in Washington state and threatened in Oregon - and populations greatly reduced and concentrated elsewhere - it can be hard to find a mate. This little turtle measures just a few centimetres and weighs a few ounces but once fully grown, they can reach six to eight inches long and weigh up to 2.4 pounds. Trouble is, they grow very slowly and so are extremely vulnerable to predators out in the wild. But these turtles will be given a fighting chance as they'll be looked after at the zoo until the spring and then tracked by electronic transmitter. Endangered: Western Pond turtle populations on North America's Pacific coast have dwindled to just a few hundred in some areas . Endangered: Western Pond turtle populations on North America's Pacific coast have dwindled to just a few hundred in some areas . The zoo has released 1,500 turtles over the past two decades, with encouraging results - the Columbia River Gorge turtle population rose from a low of 150 in 1990 to approximately 1,500 in 2011. Experts predict that 95 per cent of those turtles released back into the Gorge have survived. The Western Pond Turtle can prove very elusive as they rapidly dive from their basking sites into deep water when approached by humans. They're often found hidden under submerged rocks and logs, in deep silt or in beaver borrows and lodges. Tiny friends: The zoo's previous preservation efforts have been successful, with populations of other turtle species rising ten fold . Helping hand: Once big enough, the zoo will release the little turtles back into the wild. Some will be fitted with electronic trackers to monitor population levels . These omnivores eat insects, crayfish and other aquatic invertebrates, as well as the occasional fish, tadpole or frog. Females deposit clutches of 5-13 eggs once or twice a year and can travel as far as half a mile and up to 300ft above the nearest source of water for egg-laying. The females spend a considerable amount of time covering up their nest and soil with vegetation to make it harder for predators to find the eggs.","Batch of Western Pond Turtles, little bigger than a coin, hatch at Oregon Zoo as part of 20-year programme to save severely endangered species .

Locals in a small Australian town have come up with a novel alternative to installing a toilet in their cemetery - by building an outhouse that looks like an upright coffin. Residents of Millaa Millaa, Queensland, opted to build the macabre toilet after the council put the brakes on moves to build a restroom because it would cost around $82,000. People from the town’s Chamber of Commerce decided to take matters into their own hands and carve out a coffin-shaped pit stop for visitors of the cemetery. Macabre: The Chamber of Commerce in Millaa Millaa, Queensland, decided to build this coffin-shaped toilet to save on buying one for the town's cemetery . The toilet is deliberately constructed to resemble an upright coffin, and even has the haunting letters ‘RIP’ and a crucifix etched into one of the walls, according to the Huffington Post. Chamber president Pat Reynolds built the coffin over the past few months in his garage and it has recently been installed in the cemetery. ‘You have to be careful, not everyone is going to have our macabre sense of humour,’ he told the Herald Sun newspaper. ‘But we did it with good intentions. It's for firstly, the cemetery, and secondly, maybe a few more people will notice Millaa Millaa now.’ The coffin had been meticulously constructed and has sturdy walls and a solid cement foundation, as well as an inbuilt septic system. Small town: Milla Milla only has a modest population of 250 people . But after complaints from some members of the 250-strong community in Millaa Millaa, coupled with the fact it was never approved by the council, whether or not the DIY toilet will stay is in the balance. Its fate will likely be decided within the week. Mayor of the Tablelands Regional Council Rosa Lee Long said whether the toilet will stay in Millaa Millaa will be discussed at the next meeting, according to cairns.com.au. She said: ‘We'll be discussing it in the next week and talking to our staff about what we can do.’ Local Brian Norton believes the toilet may not go down too well with residents, especially mourners at the cemetery. On the map: Although some locals are against the toilet, others believe the quirky restroom has given the town its own identity . He told News.com.au: ‘Imagine if they had a funeral there.’ ‘I don’t think it’s going to go over very well, especially if people are there from out of town.‘They’ll think: “What sort of place is this?”’ But many are keen to keep the toilet, and believe it gives the small town on the east coast of the country an identity of its own. One Cairns Post reader said: ‘People need to lighten up and have a good laugh. Think of it this way – it's put Millaa Millaa on the map.’","Chamber of Commerce in Millaa Millaa, Queensland, opted to build coffin-shaped toilet after being told new toilet would cost $82,000 .

Commons Speaker John Bercow charged taxpayers £624 to have his chauffeur rush him to Devon for a ‘dirty weekend’ with wife Sally before she entered Celebrity Big Brother. His official limo picked him up at Westminster and drove him 224 miles to his favourite seaside resort, Woolacombe, where his wife and family were staying last August. Mrs Bercow has confessed that while there she used sex to persuade her husband to drop his opposition to her appearing on the Channel 5 reality programme. 'Dirty weekend': John Bercow (right) charged the public purse £624 so his chauffeur could rush him 224 miles to Devon for a 'breathless' night with his wife Sally (left) ‘I just used my feminine wiles and took John away for a dirty weekend in Devon,’ she said. ‘I gave him a weekend he wouldn’t forget, which left him happy, if breathless. He eventually gave in.’ She made her comments amid reports that their marriage was on the rocks over her determination to use the programme to become a television star. Now figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that days before Mrs Bercow went on the show, the Speaker spent almost £800 of publicly funded expenses on a round trip between Woolacombe and Westminster. He was on holiday in Devon, but was called back to Westminster to chair a one-day debate on the summer riots. Mr Bercow dashed to meet his wife at Woolacombe, his favourite resort, before she entered the Big Brother house . The trip back to London on August 10 . involved a £95 taxi to Exeter and a £40 rail fare to Paddington, where . his chauffeur was waiting to take him to his official residence at a . cost of £37.20. However, when he returned to Woolacombe the next day, immed-iately after the debate ended at 8pm, he took the official car back at a cost of £624.72. His decision to be driven back meant he could spend the night snuggled up to his wife instead of arriving the next day by train. A spokesman for the Speaker defended the ride, saying: ‘Otherwise it would have taken him an extra 18 hours to get back to his family.’ Mrs Bercow (left), dressed as a mummy on last year's Big Brother, has confessed that while at the resort she used sex to persuade her husband to drop his opposition to her appearing on the Channel 5 reality programme . However, he could have caught the 11.45pm ‘Night Riviera’ sleeper service to Barnstaple, which arrives at 7am (cost £49), jumped in a taxi for the 11-mile ride to Woolacombe (cost £25) and been back in Sally’s arms by 8am, a mere eight hours later than the limo, but saving tax-payers £550. The couple remained in Devon until the end of the weekend, and on August 18 Mrs Bercow went into the Celebrity Big Brother house. The following day she was quoted as having told a friend about the ‘dirty weekend’. Shortly afterwards she became the first contestant to be voted off the show. Mr Bercow flew straight to India – the £6,155 flights were also charged to the taxpayer – on official business, which enabled him to avoid the hullabaloo over Big Brother. His spokesman said: ‘The Speaker and his family only took one week’s holiday last year. This coincided with the recall of Parliament, and by the time the debate finished it was too late to get back to his family other than by official car.’ The documents also revealed that Mr Bercow charged the taxpayer £1,320 for a shower screen and £80 to repair a roller blind in a ‘baby bedroom’ at his grace-and-favour apartment beneath Big Ben. Between September 2010 and March 2012 he spent £45,825 on travel – most of it on international flights – including  £8,429.86 for the Speaker and a member of staff to fly to Washington and Boston. The documents also revealed Mr Bercow spent almost £13,000 over three months on entertaining and hospitality, including £3,599 on a three-night trip to Rome to attend a G8 Speakers’ conference.","He dashed to Devon for a 'dirty weekend' with Sally .

A Secret Service agent brought disgrace to his agency in an argument with a prostitute over just $47, causing the biggest public relations debatable in the security team's history. Eleven  agents were recalled to Washington last week after nearly all of them allegedly brought prostitutes back to their rooms at a luxury hotel in Colombia. The team was in the country to scout out the security situation ahead of President Barack Obama's trip there for the Summit of the Americas this weekend. But the agents - who have now been placed on leave - reportedly capped off a week of heavy drinking at the beachfront Hotel Caribe in Cartagena by cavorting with prostitutes. Luxury retreat: The 11 recalled Secret Service Agents were staying at the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena, Colombia . Security breach: Experts say the agents' behavior could have endangered the president, though the White House says that was never the case . The partying was exposed when one of the . women caused a commotion after an agent refused to pay her. Local . police and hotel security were called, and though the agent in question . initially said that he did not need to pay the woman $47, he eventually . forked it over. Five U.S. military personnel, who were working with the Secret Service, could also . be involved in misconduct and have been confined to their rooms and ordered not to have contact with others. They . face possible disciplinary charges. Rep Peter King, who was briefed on the . incident, said 11 agents, many of them married, were in the team that . was recalled to the U.S. - instead of 12 as originally reported - and . that 'close to' all of them were involved. Mr King said he was told that anyone visiting the hotel overnight was required to leave identification at the front desk and leave the hotel by 7am. When a woman failed to do so, it raised questions among hotel staff and police, who investigated. They found the woman with the agent in the hotel room and a dispute arose over whether the agent should have paid her. Mr King said he was told that the agent did eventually pay the woman. The incident was reported to the U.S. embassy, prompting further investigation. In the field: The agents were in Colombia the week before President Obama's arrival to the Summit of the Americas . Beachfront property: The Hotel Caribe is a luxury resort that costs about $160 to $200 per night . During their week-long stay at the five-star hotel in Cartagena, the agents were seen drinking heavily, according to waiters there. A number of the White House staff and traveling press corps . were also staying at the hotel. The White House said Mr Obama had been briefed about the incidents but would not comment on his reaction. 'The President does have full confidence in the United States Secret Service,' presidential spokesman Jay Carney said when asked. Mr Carney insisted the matter was more a distraction for the media than Mr Obama. But Secret Service assistant director Paul Morrissey said in a statement: 'We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused.' The Washington Post reported that Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said the accusations related to at least one agent having involvement with prostitutes.

The incident threatened to overshadow Mr Obama's economic and trade agenda at the Summit of the Americas and embarrass the U.S. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan would not confirm that prostitution was involved, saying, 'The Secret Service takes all allegations of misconduct seriously.' 'These personnel changes will not affect the comprehensive security plan . that has been prepared in advance of the President’s trip,' said Mr Donovan of the conference in the Colombian port city attended by Obama and more than 30 world leaders. He said the allegations of misconduct were related to activity before the president's arrival on Friday night.

Mr Obama was attending a leaders' dinner on Friday night at Cartagena's historic Spanish fortress. He was due to attend summit meetings with regional leaders on Saturday and Sunday.

The matter was turned over to the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles the agency's internal affairs. On the steamy streets of Cartagena, a resort city with a teeming prostitution trade, there was condemnation for the Secret Service agents for what residents saw as abusing their station and dishonoring their country. Edwin Yepes, a souvenir vendor, said: 'They are supposed to come here and set an example. We are an inferior culture, and so it's better if they don't come than if they damage our image of them.'","Several of the 11 men sent home are married; two are supervisors .

He prides himself on staying abreast of voters' concerns, but Ed Miliband appears to have taken this policy a little too far during a meeting with a group of female students. This is the unfortunate moment the grinning Labour leader was caught posing with the three young women - making . a hand gesture more commonly associated with cheeky builders. Mr Miliband was campaigning in . the village of Thrapston, Northamptonshire, following the shock resignation of . Tory MP Louise Mensch. Staying abreast: Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured striking this strange pose during a meeting with three female students in Northamptonshire . He was meeting voters on Thursday ahead of the by-election for the Corby and East Northamptonshire seat with prospective parliamentary candidate Andy Sawford. But when the students jumped out of their car to greet the Labour leader, he couldn’t resist a chance to engage with them. While he chatted with the two blondes and a brunette, Miliband was snapped caught making the awkward 'boob jiggling' gesture. One onlooker said: 'These students pulled their car over shouting 'it’s Ed Miliband, it’s Ed Miliband.’ 'They jumped out of the car and were having a bit of banter with him - one of the girls had broke her arm on holiday and Miliband was asking about that. 'They posed up for a picture but he pulled this odd kind of boob jiggling gesture just before the photo was taken. 'I’m pretty sure he wasn’t being lecherous, it was just an inadvertent hand movement. 'But it was a really unfortunate time to make such a gesture when there were three pretty students standing next to him. 'I’m sure he meant nothing by it - but he’ll be absolutely mortified when he sees it.' The Corby by-election has been described as Labour’s most significant electoral challenge since he became leader. The party needs to overturn a Conservative majority of just under 2,000 to win.

A seven-month-old baby died after being refused access to a notorious hospital because the A&E department closed at night and the children's ward was dealing with an emergency. Holly Waters lived just two and-a-half miles from Stafford Hospital, but had to be driven 22 miles to a second hospital by paramedics. Yesterday her devastated parents told how the infant died just two minutes before arriving at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent 49 minutes after paramedics had first reached her. Seven-month old Holly Waters died after being refused access to Stafford Hospital because its A&E department is shut at night and the children's ward was full . The family called 999 after Holly's mother, Charlotte Waters, discovered her unconscious in her cot. Up to that point Holly had been a normal, healthy baby. Stafford Hospital's A&E has been shut between 10pm and 8am since December because of staff shortages. It was due to reopen in March, but the closure has been extended to October because Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust still needs to recruit additional staff. Holly's father Sean Birch said this - and an already full children's ward - had led to up to a 20-minute delay in getting Holly to a hospital. Mr Birch said: 'We were actually told that she died two minutes away from North Staffordshire, but if she had gone to Stafford Hospital and they had managed to put a drip in and stabilise her, then send her to North Staffordshire, she would still be here today.' The infant was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Holly Waters lived just two and-a-half miles from Stafford Hospital, but was driven elsewhere . News of the incident came just a day after the Care Quality Commission (CQC) reported the hospital was now 'meeting all the essential standards of quality'. The watchdog's findings came three years after a damning report by its predecessor, the Healthcare Commission, revealed 'appalling standards of care' and higher-than-expected death rates. Last night, the BBC reported how Holly's parents called 999 on the night of June 28, with a paramedic arriving just four minutes later at 22:46 BST. According to the ambulance service, both the officer at the scene and ambulance control contacted Stafford's A&E department but were told the unit could not accept Holly. Holly was instead taken to North Staffordshire Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent 22 miles away . Requests to take the baby to the children's ward at Stafford were also refused, the ambulance service said. A hospital spokesman said the paediatric ward had been full and handling an emergency at the time. It was at 23:37 BST that the baby reached the Stoke-on-Trent hospital. Both West Midlands Ambulance Service and the Mid Staffordshire trust said it was impossible to say whether admitting Holly to Stafford Hospital would have made a difference. Colin Ovington, director of nursing and midwifery at Stafford Hospital, told the BBC it would have been unsafe for the paediatric unit to have accepted Holly. 'The staff were already treating a very seriously ill child who had been brought in as an emergency and they were also caring for a number of other emergency admissions and sick children,' he said. 'The staff correctly followed the joint protocol between the hospital and West Midlands Ambulance Service for these circumstances.' 'The staff were already treating a very . seriously ill child who had been brought in as an emergency and they . were also caring for a number of other emergency admissions and sick . children.' Colin Ovington . In a statement, Mid Staffordshire trust said: 'When contacted by the West Midlands ambulance crew, our paediatric ward told the crew that they were unable to accept the baby because they did not have the capacity in the ward and were already dealing with an emergency. 'As per the agreed protocol, the ambulance crew were directed to take the baby to UHNS. 'The ambulance crew also contacted our A&E department, who repeated the instruction that the baby should be taken to UHNS.' He said an internal investigation had found 'this was not reported as a serious incident'. 'There was no reason to discipline or suspend any member of staff.' A spokeswoman for NHS Midlands and East, the strategic health authority, said it had not been informed about the incident. 'It is disappointing that this incident was not formally reported and we are now seeking assurances from the NHS organisations that this is being investigated, in order to fully understand what took place,' she said. An initial post-mortem examination was unable to find the cause of death and an inquest will be held in due course. On Thursday, the CQC said it was lifting all of its concerns around Stafford Hospital following visits in June to review areas where it had 'previously registered moderate and minor concerns', the trust said. Chief executive Lyn Hill-Tout said: 'We have been confident for some time that we had made all the improvements which were needed. 'We know that we still don't get it right every time for every patient but this report is confirmation that we are definitely well on the way.' The 2009 Healthcare Commission report revealed a catalogue of care failings could have cost up to 1,200 lives at the hospital. A £10million public inquiry into standards at the hospital ended last November after 139 days. Its chairman, Robert Francis QC, is expected to publish his final report - which will contain recommendations to stop the failings at the trust being repeated elsewhere - in October.","Holly Waters lived just two and-a-half miles from Stafford Hospital .

Mr Short's father, David, 46, who had branded his son's murderers ""cowards"", was killed on Friday during a gun and grenade attack on a house in Clayton. Armed police have staged high visibility patrols in the Clayton and Droylsden areas since the attacks took place. GMP Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, said: 'We have dedicated a significant amount of officers to not only identify those involved in the violent attacks which have left one man dead, but also to carry out intensive patrols in the area to reassure people living there. 'We have made significant advances in the police investigation over the past couple of days, and a man was arrested last night in the Salford area.

We are appealing to the public to help us to do this. 'We have released two images of Cregan and are urging anyone who has seen him or who knows of his whereabouts, to please call us immediately. Do not approach him. 'We have specialist officers who continue to support the family of David Short at this difficult time and extra police officers, including specialist firearms officers, remain on patrol in the Clayton and Droylsden areas.' Emergency services, including an Army bomb disposal unit were deployed to two addresses near Manchester after shootings were reported this morning . Police have cordoned off houses at the scenes of both shootings, and some homes have been evacuated due to a gas leak . A Home Office post mortem examination concluded that Mr Short died from multiple gun shot wounds and explosion injury.

The men who would have defended Britain from a Nazi invasion have famously been depicted as a ragtag bunch of elder-statesmen who would have misfired and floundered as they fought. But it appears the real truth about the Home Guard is very different, and this Dad's Army was very much a Lads' Army during the Second World War. New documents released by the National Archive today give us the most detailed picture ever of who joined the world famous volunteer force between 1940 and 1945. By sifting through application forms and . using a representative sample of these people, experts have found that half . of these four million or so British soldiers were under 27, and a third . were under 18. Dad's Army? Forget it, new National Archive documents show around half of volunteers were in their twenties and a third were under 18 . Dad's Army, regarded as one of the . BBC's great sitcoms, was led by people like fastidious old bank manager . Captain Mainwaring and the doddering panic-stricken butcher Lance-Corporal . Jones. It was based on . the premise that the Home Guard was made up of people too old to enlist, . unless you were a 'stupid boy' like Pike, but today this has been . almost completely debunked. As well as age details, archived pictures of Home Front exercises, volunteer posters and some application forms have also been released. Spot the difference: The Home Guard was much more like this troop of young men pictured in 1941 . There is even a signed certificate thanking volunteers for their bravery from King George VI. 'This surprising discovery, revealed by our pilot project, has destroyed the myth that Home Guard volunteers were primarily formed of those too old to serve in the military,' William Spencer, principal military records specialist at The National Archives said. 'Perception of the Home Guard may have . been distorted over the years, perhaps influenced by the popular TV . comedy Dad’s Army, but now for the first time we have access to primary . source material and a more realistic demographic analysis of the Home . Guard has been revealed.' The BBC produced 80 episodes and three specials of Dad's Army . between 1968 and 1977, portraying the accident-prone, disorganised . platoon which protected the fictional South East resort of . Walmington-on-Sea. At its peak, as many as 18.5million viewers tuned in to watch . the latest mishaps of Captain Mainwaring, Sergeant Wilson, . Lance-Corporal Jones and Privates Pike, Godfrey, Walker and . Frazer. Classic episodes include Command Decision, in which the platoon . is offered weapons by Colonel Square. Captain Mainwaring agrees - before discovering the weapons are . muskets and his men are expected to fight on horseback. In the Battle of Godfrey's Cottage, the platoon is ordered to . split into two sections in the event of an invasion. During . exercises, the men scramble to their positions, but begin attacking . each other in the confusion. Mission: This archived image shows a group of Home Guard troops practicing with explosives in the English countryside . On patrol: Millions of men volunteered to protect Britain and it appears that many more were younger than first thought . Royal seal of approval: This is a signed thank you from the King, George VI to those who gave up their time to volunteer . The Home Guard, initially known as the ‘Local Defence Volunteers’, was an arm of the British Army consisting of millions of local volunteers otherwise ineligible for military service, usually owing to age or fitness. It was commonly thought to have comprised mostly of men who were too old to serve in military service, yet, The National Archives pilot project has revealed that 50 per cent of the records selected for the project were of men under the age of 27, with 28 per cent of the men were aged 18 or younger. Although this revelation is a fascinating . discovery from a historical perspective, around half of the records from . the pilot still cannot be released into the public domain because of . data protection and the official secrets act. The National Archive's Home Guard record series contains the enrolment forms for armed service personnel, which were completed when men joined the Home Guard. These digital records typically contain information such as name, date and place of birth, address, date of enlistment, promotions, previous military service, and date on leaving service. The files have been transcribed to allow the records to be searchable by key word, making this initiative a valuable resource to historians online, allowing them to locate key information easily. Incredible: Applications to join the Home Guard also give a fascinating insight into the lives of people, including this one by Henry Watson Johnson who joined up at 53 . Veteran: Decorated soldier Lt Col Hereward Sprot, born in 1877, fought in World War One and then signed up to be in the Home Guard, pictured . Few army service records between 1914 and 1920 exist as many were destroyed by enemy bombing in the Second World War. Only about 40 per cent survive and the condition of these can vary greatly with some being very badly damaged. Therefore these new Second World War records also shed light on the stories of soldiers who survived World War One and joined the Home Guard. But these men were rewarded for their bravery with medals, rather than causing a string of embarrassing mistakes like those in the celebrated television series. One record shows the application of Lt . Col Hereward Sprot, who had previously commanded the 6th Dragoon . Guards, the 9th Durham, and was Colonel of 4th Durham Survey Regiment in . World War One. Powerful: Many who were not able to join the armed forces volunteered for the Home Guard as they desperately wanted to protect Britain in the event of an invasion . Sprot . was highly decorated, being awarded the ‘Croix de Guerre’ for his . previous service in World War 1, and then later an OBE during his time . in the Home Guard. He only served 1 year 130 days in the Home Guard . before being discharged due to reaching the age limit of 65. Sergeant . Henry Watson Johnson enlisted in the Home Guard on 3 June 1940 aged 53. His  file contains his address and names his next of kin as his wife . Elizabeth and on October 7 1949 he received a Defence Medal for his role . in the Home Guard. Sgt Johnson served 4 years and 18 days with the Home Guard before being discharged to join HM Forces aged 57. Sharpening pencils at both ends to improve efficiency, regularly jumping into forward rolls to avoid dizziness in combat situations . and drinking tea to ease the effects of a gas attack - it sounds . like an episode of Dad's Army. But to Private Thomas Harper, pictured right, a member of the Home Guard during . the dark days when a Nazi invasion was a very real threat, anything . that could help repel the enemy was important. Aged 31 when the Second World War broke out and unable to join . the Army, he was determined to still do his bit for King and . Country. His anti-invasion skills were never put to the test, of course. But a detailed, handwritten record of his service showed he was . more than ready if the Germans had ever rolled into his home town . of Derby. The documents had been held by Private Harper's family since . his death in 1999 at the age of 91, but came to light five years ago when they decided to put them up for auction in 2007. After studying Home . Guard manuals, pictured below, and attending lectures, Private Harper would write . down a guide to which he could always refer. Under the heading Summaries of Duties of Sending and Receiving . Signals, he wrote: 'To make sure signals are correctly received, . keep your pencil sharpened at both ends. It will then be correctly . written down.' Describing tactics when on patrol, he said: ""By night be alert, . by day move slowly. 'We can either walk in an alert, erect manner or for sharpness, . roll. Practise rolling to avoid dizziness. 'Movement by night means silence is golden. Be careful of . silhouetting and avoid skylines. On soft ground, place your heels . down first.' Following a lecture on gas in 1942, he noted the effects . included 'gums ache, dentures fall out'. He went on: 'If chlorine gas is used, it will smell like bleach . and will result in choking and coughing. 'Lie flat and take plenty of internal warmth - like drinking . sweet tea.' The father-of-one worked as a bread round driver during the war . and later became an accountant. His wife, Annie, died in 1997, aged . 87.","New National Archive documents show around half of volunteers were under 27 and a third of them were under 18 .

In the six days following his selection by Mitt Romney for his presidential ticket, internet searches on Paul Ryan have focused not on his lean economic policy - but of him shirtless. Thankfully now that search is over for his new legion of fans, excited by rumours the fitness fanatic Wisconsin Congressman is 'totally ripped' and unusually for a career politician was in possession of 'six pack'. In a shirtless picture released today it is clear to see that the GOP vice-presidential nominee is in rude health as he walks hand in hand with his wife of 11 years Janna Little while on vacation in Oklahoma. Paul Ryan and his wife Janna Little walk hand in hand during a family vacation in Oklahoma . In fact this picture was taken six years ago, just before the conservative politician become an obsessive of the P90X workout which apparently has left his midsection more impressive-looking than in the above photograph. A friend who is close to the Ryan family who said that Ryan had 'always led a healthy lifestyle' and that 'He's the nicest guy and has always been fit.' Indeed, the interest in Ryan's levels of fitness carry personal significance for the 42-year-old seven-time Wisconsin representative. When he was 16, Ryan tragically discovered his father had died at home in bed from a heart attack before the age of 60, just like his grandfather and great-grandfather and Ryan vowed to stay as healthy as he possibly could for the rest of his life. Republican vice presidential candidate Representative Paul Ryan speaks at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio August 15, 2012 . Republican vice presidential candidate and fitness fanatic Paul Ryan speaks at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio . It has been reported that he maintains a body fat index of between six and eight percent and compared to the over-worked politicians of Capitol Hill, six-foot-two Ryan strikes as a go-getting picture of health. While Ryan has been picked by Romney to concentrate the election battle against President Obama to the economy, the U.S. media has in some cases simply chosen to ignore Ryan's much heralded 'Path to Prosperity' fiscal plan. TMZ have said he 'may be the hottest vice presidential candidate ever… but we’re not talking policy.'] . Support: Mr Ryan was joined by his wife Janna . (top right), daughter Liza (bottom middle), son Charles (bottom left) and son Sam (bottom right) during the welcome home rally earlier this week . Team: Mr Romney announced his selection at a . campaign rally at the Nauticus Museum (above) after touring the USS . Wisconsin in Norfolk, Virginia . They go onto reveal that Ryan's workout's at the congressional gym are 'fierce' in addition to discussing the impressive body shape he has managed to build up. 'I'm kind of a skinny guy', he told Politico.com in March before revealing that he leads P90X workouts along with fellow politician Bart Stupak every morning on Capitol Hill. He added: 'There's about a dozen of us who do it... It's a fantastic workout.' Founded by Tony Horton, an exercise . instructor from Rhode Island, P90X is a home exercise system that aims . to transform a person's body in just 90 days.

Extreme: Mr Ryan is a big fan of the regime and is said to lead a workout every morning at Capitol Hill . Muscles confusion is said to prevent a person from adapting to exercise, which results in continuous fitness improvement. As the workout changes from day to day, he added that it offers a unique take on regular fitness routines. Mr Ryan wears a heart-rate monitor when he works out and aims to hit a target heart rate of 165 beats per minute. The youngest child of four children, Ryan described the motivation for his obsessive fitness program after discovering his father dead in bed. 'It was just a big punch to the gut,' he told The New Yorker magazine. 'I concluded I've for to either sink or swim in life.' Active: Mr Ryan enjoys staying active and being outdoors. He is also a keen hunter (pictured) and skier and catfish noodler . Even liberal commentators have made comments on Ryan's perceived vitality and good looks. Rachel Maddow of MSNBC has declared Ryan to be 'so handsome and boyish' while the New York magazine said that 'Paul Ryan is your annoying Libertarian ex-boyfriend.' A website called heygirlsitspaulryan.tumblr.com, features pictures of Ryan with humourous and somewhat sexy headlines. The gags combine politics with a seductive 'how you doing' vibe, attempting to make deficit reduction sexy. 'Hey girl... you know I can't inflate out love. And that would just devalue it anyways,' one photo reads, while another states: 'Hey girl... unlike the debt, our love will never hit a ceiling.' Getting a bit saucy, another doctored photo says: 'Hey girl... My fiscal policy is all about contributing to your private sector. No, really.' While another favourite reads: 'Girl, dry your tears. You know I'm-a balance the budget in ten years.' Internet gags: Paul Ryan, pictured, has become the latest target of web jokers . And as Romney and Ryan prepare to take on President Obama and vice-president Joe Biden, even the New York Times has got in on the act labeling the pair 'cute Republican dudes'. Some though, have waded in with an air of caution surrounding the Wisconsin action man who is known to enjoy catfish noodling, hunting and making his own sausages. Psychology Today worried whether 'just because Paul Ryan is hot, does that mean he is also objectified?' Speaking to RawStory.com., political and social analyst Rich Hanley of Quinnipiac University said that the attention being heaped on Ryan is understandable. 'It's more a commentary on how hot-less the Republican Party has been for so many years - that you get a fresh face and you call him a beefcake,' said Hanley. Chosen: Paul Ryan, pictured campaigning this week, was picked as Republican Vice Presidential candidate last Saturday . 'He represents, certainly to the conservative Republican voter, a guy who stays in shape, who has a youthful figure, something that's usually associated with Democrats.' Mr Romney described Mr Ryan at his unveiling as his running mate as a man of integrity and character rooted in his middle-class Midwest upbringing as well as an intellectual leader at a time when the United States was in fiscal crisis. As leader of the free world,  President Obama keeps himself trim (left) as does Mitt Romney (right pictured with two of his sons) who is aiming to oust the Democrat in November . 'Paul is a man of tremendous character, shaped in large part by his early life,' he said. 'Paul's father died when he was in high school. That forced him to grow up earlier than any young man should. 'But Paul did, with the help of his devoted mother, his brothers and sister, and a supportive community. And as he did, he internalized the virtues and hard-working ethic of the Midwest. 'Paul Ryan works in Washington - but his beliefs remain firmly rooted in Janesville, Wisconsin. He is a person of great steadiness, whose integrity is unquestioned and whose word is good.' He praised Ryan's prowess in politics, saying that 'There are people that may disagree with Paul Ryan, but I don't know of anyone that doesn't respect his character and judgement.'","Paul Ryan pictured looking unusually athletic for a politician while on holiday in Oklahoma with his wife Janna .

Two businessmen from Massachusetts narrowly escaped death last month when a giant boulder crashed through the windshield of their rental as they made their way through a narrow canyon in Arizona. Bob Jaczko, 74, of Natick, was behind the wheel of a Dodge SUV enjoying the scenery of Sedona when suddenly he and his passenger heard a rumbling sound. In the next moment, a 150-pound boulder plummeted from a canyon wall and crashed through the glass, according to Jaczko. Rocky road: This 150-pound boulder plunged from a cliff in Arizona's Oak Creek Canyon and smashed into Bob Jaczko's rented SUV . ‘All of a sudden I thought the car exploded,’ he told the Boston Globe. ‘I thought the engine blew up.’ Jaczko, a marketing communications director for Integrated Dynamics Engineering, traveled to Arizona with sales manager Peter Wilson, 45, of Attleboro, for a trade show. After getting their booth ready for the event, Jaczko and his companion decided to do some sightseeing. On the advice of a tour guide, the pair chose to take a ride through the scenic Oak Creek Canyon, putting them on a collision course with the massive rock. The 74-year-old driver said that the windshield shattered into a million razor-sharp pieces and covered them with shards of glass that looked like ‘sprinkles on an ice cream cone,’ WHDH reported. Crystal sprinkles: Jaczko and his co-worker in the passenger seat were covered in glass from the smashed windshield . Luckily for the pair, the two-foot by one-foot boulder fell onto the dashboard first and then tumbled into the space between the driver’s and passenger’s seats. ‘I looked down and we had dials and wires in our laps,’ Jaczko said. ‘We stopped and looked down and I’m wearing a rock on my left side.’ Two nurses who happened to be traveling in cars behind Jaczko and Wilson pulled over and rushed to their aid. Lucky break: The boulder landed first on the dashboard before tumbling into the space between the driver's and passenger's seat . ‘When the rock rolled down my left arm it was like a vegetable peeler, took off all this skin,’ Jaczko said. After realizing he and Wilson were not seriously hurt, Jaczko pulled his camera out and photographed the shattered Dodge with the boulder still resting in the front seat. The two bloodied men were transported to a nearby hospital to be treated for cuts and bruises. Jaczko said he could not believe that he and Wilson walked away without any serious injuries from their harrowing encounter with the giant rock. Scary scene: Two nurses who were in cars behind Jaczko pulled over and rushed to help the two men . ‘I thought, “Oh my God, we survived this,”’ he said. ‘I thought, “this is really a lucky day.”’ Jaczko noted that before the incident, he and his co-worker visited a Catholic chapel, threw pennies into a magic stream and then went to a crystal shop. ‘We had all this mysticism around us so I think we were well protected,’ he told WBZ-TV . Police who arrived on the scene told the lucky pair that a recent rain storm must have loosened the soil under the rock. After their unexpected detour to the hospital, the men returned to Phoenix and finished their trade show on a high note. ‘We . were the talk of the trade show!’ Jaczko said. ‘We had a very crowded . booth which was good for publicity. But I think I’ll do something . different next time!’ Miracle: Jaczko (pictured) said that before the incident, he and his co-worker stopped by a chapel, threw pennies into a magic stream and visited a crystal shop .

Teenagers are being forced to burgle homes in their own neighbourhoods as a gang initiation ritual, a report has revealed. In what used to be a crime more associated with drug addicts bent on feeding their habits, street gangs are increasingly turning their sights on residential break ins as a source of cash. To make matters worse, experts say postcode wars with other gangs mean thugs are forced to commit violent robberies in their own communities rather than encroach on enemy territory, leaving residents in some inner-city areas too afraid to leave their homes. Brent Council, in London, recorded a 12 per cent rise in household robberies last year, while the Metropolitan Police says around 25 per cent of . all violent burglaries in London are now committed by gangs. Shift: In what used to be a crime more associated with drug addicts bent on feeding their habits, street gangs are increasingly turning their sights on residential break ins as a source of cash . 'Initial information suggests . suspects are increasingly young people from the local area associating with . gangs and highly organised and mobile suspects who are operating across a . number of boroughs,' said Brent Council's report. The revelation could signal a move . away from other forms of induction rites that often involve sex or . violence, sometimes against innocent members of public. And it has raised fears that gangs are turning on their own neighbourhoods because they are too afraid to commit crimes in rival postcodes for fear of prompting violence from enemy outfits. Brent councillor Zaffar Van Kalwala, . who commissioned the research,  said: 'This is a worrying trend which I . believe is happening across London. 'Worrying': Brent councillor Zaffar Van Kalwala, who commissioned the research, said gangs were turning to crime on their own doorstep . 'The robberies are affecting people's lives with many feeling vulnerable because of the gangs and their anti-social behaviour. 'What concerns me is that gang members never used to commit crimes on their doorstep but that is what seems to be happening now. 'These . gangs are all about defending their own postcodes, I have two gangs in . my ward who cannot travel between their two estates. Yet, they are now . robbing houses in their own area, it seems to be against what they stand . for.  We seem to be losing a community spirit.' He added: . 'This is happening as safer neighbourhood teams are being cut yet it is . becoming more dangerous particularly for more vulnerable people.' The report said that the trend is 'a . change from the more traditional profile of suspect, who is typically . older, has a history of substance misuse and previous offences.' Community leaders say the surge in . break-ins means many residents on inner city estates are now too . frightened to leave their homes. Brent . borough police commander Matt Gardner said there was intelligence of . gangs using burglaries as an initiation rite to join groups. He said: 'There are gang members who are going out to commit burglaries among other crimes. They are doing it because it is part of organised crime network, an initiation rite or just because they can. 'We have seen a 30 per cent reduction in robbery and a slight rise of about one per cent in burglary. We are now doing a lot of work to try and get kids out of crime. 'We are giving them a chance to opt out of gangs and crime and sending out the message that if they continue they will get a criminal record and screw their life up.' He added: 'Over a third of all burglaries are actually attempts when access was not gained, yet recording standards mean that these are still shown as burglaries. ' Brenda Linton, vice chair of St Raphael’s Residents’ Association in Brent, said: 'Many people are scared to go out because so many houses have been broken in to. We have had about 20 burglaries in the last six to eight months. 'Young people need more to do, they are bored and because of the postcode trouble they cannot move around. They are stuck on their own estates.'","Brent Council, in London, recorded a 12 per cent rise in household robberies last year .

Struck off: Pathologist Dr Freddy Patel has been banned from working as a doctor after making 68 errors on G20 victim Ian Tomlinson's post-mortem . The pathologist who botched the post-mortem examination on G20 protest victim Ian Tomlinson was banned from working as a doctor today. Dr Freddy Patel's actions were found to be 'misleading, dishonest and liable to bring his profession into disrepute' over parts of his handling of the post-mortem on newspaper vendor Mr Tomlinson. A medical tribunal identified 68 failings, including the key fact that Dr Patel did not tell police that 47-year-old Mr Tomlinson suffered injuries that could have been consistent with a baton strike. Dr Patel was found guilty of misconduct at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), sitting in Manchester, and struck off the medical register. The doctor, who qualified at the University of Zambia in 1974 and has practised as a pathologist for 35 years, was excused attendance but listened in on the hearing by conference call from London. The court heard Dr Patel, who was described as being arrogant and having a bad attitude, was previously investigated on numerous occasions and suspended two times over his shoddy work dating back a decade. He had already botched previous post-mortem examinations dating as far back as 2002 by the time Mr Tomlinson died in 2009. Dr Patel was found guilty of serious misconduct and suspended for four months over his post-mortem examination reports in 2002 into the death of a victim of so-called 'Camden Ripper' Anthony Hardy. The naked body of Sally White, 31, was discovered in a room in Hardy’s flat in January 2002. Upset: Ian Tomlinson's son Paul King and Julia Tomlinson have been left distraught by his death and she said today Patel 'misled everyone' Dr . Patel explained away her injuries and ruled she died from natural . causes. In fact she was the first victim of serial killer Hardy and . suspected of having been asphyxiated. Mr . Tomlinson, 47, died on April 1 2009 after he became caught up in the . G20 riots in the City of London as he tried to get home and was forcibly . pushed over by Pc Simon Harwood. Dr . Patel carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr Tomlinson and . concluded that he died from a heart attack, but questions were raised . when an American tourist came forward with a video recording of him . being shoved by the officer. Further . medical reports suggested that Mr Tomlinson died from an injury to his . liver that caused internal bleeding and then cardiac arrest. At . the inquest into Mr Tomlinson’s death, Dr Patel’s claim that he died of . a heart attack was discredited by the jury in favour of the string of . experts who said he died of internal bleeding. Drunk: PC Harwood believed Mr Tomlinson, left, who was drunk at the time, was being deliberately obstructive during the G20 protests in April 2009 . [caption . Fall: After being hit Tomlinson fell to the ground but got up, walked 75 yards before collapsing . Laid out: The 47-year-old later died in hospital from internal injuries . Dr . Patel’s first post-mortem examination also made it all but impossible . to conclude with any certainty how Mr Tomlinson came to die. The inquest jury ruled Mr Tomlinson was unlawfully killed. The police officer who was cleared of . killing Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London will face force . disciplinary proceedings on September 17. Pc . Simon Harwood was acquitted of manslaughter last month, but police . watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ordered . that he should face the internal Metropolitan Police hearing in public. Scotland . Yard confirmed that a gross misconduct hearing in front of a panel of . three people including a senior officer and a lay person. It is expected . to last up to four weeks. Harwood . told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that he had used only reasonable . force, and was cleared of killing the father-of-nine. Jurors in an . inquest into the death had earlier returned a verdict of unlawful . killing. The officer, . 45, from Carshalton in Surrey, had a controversial disciplinary record . before the fateful day when he came across Mr Tomlinson. A . series of allegations were made against him over a 12-year period, and . he was allowed to retire from the Met on medical grounds in 2001 despite . unresolved disciplinary proceedings. Later, . Harwood rejoined the force as a civilian worker, before becoming a . police officer for Surrey. He was then allowed to rejoin the Met in 2004 . as part of its Territorial Support Group, specialising in public order. The . Rev Robert Lloyd-Richards, chairman of the MPTS fitness to practise . panel, told Dr Patel today: 'Your rigid mind-set, illustrated by your . inability to reflect on the case of Mr Tomlinson and your unwarranted . confidence in your own abilities does not convince this panel that it . would be appropriate to impose conditions, even with the most stringent . supervision, on your registration. 'The . panel considers that you have a deep-seated attitudinal problem. You . have twice been suspended for your failings in relation to post-mortem . examinations you have carried out. 'You . have now appeared before a fitness to practise panel three times. The . failings against you both historically and presently involve five . separate post-mortem examinations.' Along . with Mr Tomlinson and the Camden Ripper case, other botched cases . conducted by Dr Patel include those of a four-week-old baby, a . five-year-old girl and an elderly woman. After . the hearing, Mr Tomlinson’s family said Dr Patel should not have been . doing the examination in the first place given his record. Mr . Tomlinson’s widow Julia said: 'We aren’t surprised he has been struck . off. It is more of a surprise that he was able to work as a pathologist . for so long and that he was selected to do the post-mortem on Ian. 'We . are pleased that he will not be able to put any more families through . the ordeal he caused us, but the damage he has done can’t now be . undone.' Last month, Pc Harwood was found not guilty of the manslaughter of Mr Tomlinson following a criminal trial. Evidence . about his chequered disciplinary history as an officer was ruled . inadmissible and the jury was not told about a series of allegations . about his behaviour in the past. The . officer, who serves with the Metropolitan Police, faces an internal . disciplinary hearing being held by his employers next month.","Dr Freddy Patel said the newspaper vendor died of a heart attack .

Tamara Ecclestone says she has been left ‘paranoid’ about her safety after a conman threatened her with kidnap. The socialite’s fears were revealed as dental technician Martin Peckham was yesterday jailed for five years for the ham-fisted plot to blackmail her father, Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone. He claimed that a Bahraini gang would abduct the TV personality and model unless a £200,000 ransom was paid. Crime fail: Martin Peckham, pictured leaving court with his wife, was branded 'hopeless and hapless' compared to seasoned criminals for his failed blackmail plot against Bernie Ecclestone . The penniless fantasist, who pleaded guilty to blackmail, came up with the scheme after reading about a similar plot against the Ecclestones that was foiled earlier this year. In a statement read at court, Miss Ecclestone, 28, said: ‘I do not feel safe when I go out, or even when I’m home. 'I have security around me 24 hours a day. I’ve become paranoid; I have to have all my windows and doors checked twice, and I keep my going out to a bare minimum. I feel trapped.’ Peckham, 41, posed as a security specialist controlling a team of mercenaries watching over Tamara who would withdraw their protection unless cash was handed over. Terrified: In a statement to the court Miss Ecclestone said the threats had left her paranoid and forced to have round-the-clock security follow her . But Southwark Crown Court was told their tormentor was in fact just a fantasist who needed money after losing an £8,500 deposit on a wedding venue and, unknown to his fiancee, being unable to afford the new venue. He was traced by police after failing to withhold his mobile number in a series of calls to Mr Ecclestone’s office between June 20 and July 4 this year, using the false name ‘Marcus Black’. Mr Ecclestone, who was then abroad, delegated the task of dealing with the threats to Tamara’s then boyfriend, Omar Khyami.

'When we’re out, she’s always looking behind her to see if someone is following her. 'We are not sleeping very well as the whole situation is constantly on our minds.’ Police arrested Peckham on July 4 after using phone records to track him down to his work in Colchester. The web history from a laptop in his car included Mr Ecclestone’s Wikipedia page, as well as a newspaper story about the earlier blackmail plot. Also found were text documents apparently drawn up by the father of two as scripts for the threatening phone calls. Prosecutor Peter Zinner said of the plot: ‘It was committed by a fantasist, but it was exacted with planning, persistence, and determination.’ Judge Alistair McCreath told him: ‘These were people already in fear, and you compounded their fear.’ Peckham’s barrister Satyanand Beharrylal said: ‘The actions of Mr Peckham were hopeless and hapless compared to seasoned criminals. ‘It was a complete hoax from start to finish. 'He saw the tabloid story and, in a moment of pure stupidity, came up with this idea.’ In a statement, Mr Ecclestone said: ‘At the time it seemed very serious, but I was pleased to know that it was basically an amateur trying to extract money.’ Southwark Crown Court heard that Tamara Ecclestone was affected 'very badly' by the hoax blackmail .

Unhappy with his life as a Marine stationed in California, Terence Tyler posed a question three years ago on Twitter: 'is it normal to want to kill ALL of ur coworkers?' 'I'm starting to see why plp go on killin sprees,' he wrote in the disturbing message, adding that the people around him were pushing his 'kill everyone I see button.' Scroll Down for Video . Terence S. Tyler, 23, served in the U.S. Marines Corps. from 2008 to 2010, and most recently held the rank of lance corporal and was a rifleman . Additional tweets from Tyler include a gushing post about Adolph Hitler, where he refers to the Nazi leader as 'one of the greatest military minds,' in 2007. He additionally wrote informing his followers in 2009, that he wanted to dress up as OJ Simpson for Halloween, 'get his jersey with the throwback glove,' in a reference to the former NFL player accused of murdering his wife and her lover. Simpson was acquitted of the murder charges in 1995. Tyler's Twitter messages were sent during his time in the military, when police say he struggled with depression - believed to have been brought on by the death of his mother in 2007. His shooting rampage on Friday came three days before what would have been her birthday.

The parents of a 16-year-old girl carried out an elaborate Facebook sting to prove their daughter's new sex offender boyfriend was bad news - by ensnaring him with a fake account. Jesper and Julie Myrfors pretended to be a 15-year-old girl and, within hours, 19-year-old Liam Elms was sending the fake account sexually explicit photos and messages, police said. Horrified, they immediately showed their daughter the sickening messages and alerted police in their hometown of Sedro-Wooley, Washington. Scroll down for video . Concern: Jesper and Julie Myrfors thought their daughter's sex offender boyfriend was bad news so created a fake Facebook account of a teenage girl to show his true colours . The parents had thought Elms charming when they met him, but on discovering he was a registered sex offender, they tried to dissuade their unidentified daughter from continuing the relationship. When she refused, they set up a fake Facebook profile - without any involvement from police - and pretended to be a girl named 'Ashley', complete with photos and friends on the site. 'When we did this, we had rules,' Mr Myrfors told King5. 'We were not trying to entrap him. We were setting him up a situation where, if he was a bad guy, he could act on it.' To start communication between Ashley and Elms, they made up a fight between their daughter and the fake girl and confided in Elms about the . situation, the Skagit Valley Herald reported. Communication: The parents made up a fight between their daughter and the fake girl and pretended to confide in Elms, who began sending the account sexually-explicit photographs and messages . Bad news: He also encouraged the fake girl to sneak out of her house and leave on a camping trip with him . A day after accepted Elms' Facebook friend request, the conversation between he and Mrs Myrfors turned 'dirty, violent and nasty', police records show. Elms then sent sexually explicit photos of himself to Ashley's email address from the mobile phone number that police have as his main contact, according to the police affidavit. He allegedly tried to persuade the fake teen to leave her house to join him on a camping trip, and discussed his planned sexual activity. He added she should claim to be 16 if anyone asks. 'My daughter didn't know we had done this,' Mrs Myrfors said. 'I invited her on to begin watching live.  She started watching conversations. The hardest part as a parent was watching her heart break.' Protective: The parents carried out the sting without any involvement from law enforcement officals .

"By . Marco Pierre White . PUBLISHED: . 18:37 EST, 8 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:38 EST, 8 September 2012 . And so, at last, the voice of reason. Last week, researchers from Stanford University published the results of the most comprehensive study to date on organic and conventional foods. Their conclusion? Organic foods have no more vitamins and nutrients than  traditionally grown produce. I can’t say I’m surprised. Chicken is chicken, with the same nutritional content, whether it is organic, free range or mass-produced. But now  scientists have confirmed it, perhaps we can begin to have a proper conversation about the food we put on our table. Marco Pierre-White expresses his relief that scientific evidence has revealed no nutritional or safety benefits of organic food over non-organic . The Stanford University team reviewed more than 200 studies which compared either the health of those who ate organic and conventional foods, or, more commonly, nutrient and contaminant levels in the foods themselves. It included organic and non-organic fruits, vegetables, grains, meat, poultry, eggs and milk. Not only did the researchers discover organic food is not more nutritious, they also found that, although conventional foods contained more  pesticides, these chemicals were well within permitted limits and not harmful in any way. In one fell swoop they have demolished the two supposedly incontrovertible arguments of the organic lobby – that their produce has more nutrients and is much safer. Whether this will be enough to stop the juggernaut remains to be seen but it’s a start. For too long there has been an unbearable smugness about the ‘organic’ mob – for that is what it is. In certain sections of society, mothers who fail to feed their young organic baby food are looked on with horror. Then there are the chefs who tell us that eating anything less than organic is somehow immoral. I’m sorry but I don’t buy into the Jamie Olivers and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstalls of this world. Sometimes I wonder is there no escape from this pair of over-seasoned, organically correct pancake-tossers. We’d prefer it if their appearances on TV and in our bookshops were medium rare, but they’re not. They are distinctly over-done. Marco criticises chefs Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, left and Jamie Oliver, calling them a 'pair of over-seasoned organically-correct pancake tossers' For imagine if the entire industry . were to go organic or free range? We’d never be able to feed ourselves. What would the price of bread be? Of eggs? And if all eggs were free . range what would happen to the price of biscuits or Hellmann’s . mayonnaise? Don’t tell me these people haven’t all sat around the . business table and eaten those very same biscuits with a cup of tea. It’s . all well and good these campaigners getting on their high horse with . all their ideals but it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. I . don’t like to preach to people. Marco Pierre White defends his backing of food producer Bernard Matthews, which sells wafer thin, value-for-money, Turkey ham slices . Take McDonald’s. If I’m driving down the road and my daughter is tired and hungry,  and it’s gridlocked, what’s wrong with pulling into the forecourt and buying her a box of six chicken McNuggets and a milkshake? If my industry wants to attack me for my views then so be it but I’d rather go into a McDonald’s, pay my money and know what I’m getting than go to a lot of fancy restaurants that all too often offer so much and deliver too little. I’d rather spend 99p on a cheeseburger than £20 on some main course that doesn’t deliver. It’s all about value for money. And how many restaurants serve organic or free range? Are the bones they use for their stock from animals raised on organic farms? Are their sauces made from organic tomatoes? Of course not. Restaurants simply don’t do organic because they can’t justify the price. That is the point. If they banned industrial farming, chicken would become a luxury item. The idea that something as simple – and nutritious – as a chicken should be denied to families on a lower income is frankly appalling. If it wasn’t for commercial farming there wouldn’t be Sunday lunch for millions of families. If you go down to the supermarket and go to the fish counter, how often is the sea bass farmed, the prawns, the salmon, the trout? And there is nothing wrong with that if it is done well. The same goes for meat. It takes the pressure off the wild stock and means the average person can eat well. Marco has little time for 'snobs' who only buy organic food and those who only shop at more pricey stores such as Waitrose . That’s what farming does – it makes food available to everyone. I come from humble beginnings, growing up, one of four boys, on a Leeds council estate. We always ate well because my grandfather and father were both chefs. A journalist once asked me, ‘What was it like growing up poor on tinned food?’ We couldn’t afford tinned food, I hankered after it. When I endorsed Bernard Matthews I was castigated by all and sundry but if it wasn’t for him, we wouldn’t have had turkey on the table at Christmas. A proper meal enriches family life. I would rather have dinner cooked with love – preferably by someone who can cook – than some dried-up old piece of organic chicken. There are certain people who wouldn’t be seen dead in any other supermarket than Waitrose. I abhor that kind of snobbery. Not everyone can afford organic so stop bullying them, stop patronising them, stop dictating to them. And as we now know, it’s not even worth the extra cost. I’ll go further. In some instances, I would argue that non-organic food can be better for you. For example, regular pork loin steak has 6.2g of fat per 80g, while the organic equivalent has 21.4g. Yet we all know that too much fat is bad for us. What’s important is that rich or poor, organic or mass-produced, you are getting the same vitamins. In a strange way, I am more in favour of mass-produced farming than the organic movement. I look at organic as a label, nothing more. And a very expensive one at that. Three out of four households buy organic food, with the market worth more than £1 billion a year. I have a theory that people who aren’t very good cooks buy organic to compensate. Sales of organic food in the UK are the second highest in Europe and at a time when food prices are sky-rocketing. Consumers have seen the price of their weekly food shop increase by 6.4 per cent over the past year, double the EU average. The only thing that should dictate your choice is your palate and your pocket. When I go to the butcher or the grocer I buy what looks good. Provenance is important to me. Would I prefer to have my pork chop locally sourced from a small farmer? Yes. If you can afford to buy pork or beef or lamb reared by an independent farmer, that’s great. You are lucky. But don’t criticise and patronise the people who can’t. Thanks to this report all those, like me, who have never believed the organic hype, don’t have to listen to their dogma any longer.","Marco Pierre White celebrates the results of a large U.S. study that shows no nutritional or safety benefits of organic food .

A stablehand 'who lost all control' was jailed for life yesterday for murdering his friend after he caught him having sex with his girlfriend. Bryan Harris, 45, claimed he had been 'defending his dignity' as he punched and kicked victim Paul Drury over his betrayal. Harris denied using a dented frying pan to carry out the violent attack on his 32-year-old victim before he also left lover Dawn Lewis with severe facial wounds in the house in Newton Abbot, Devon. Love triangle: Bryan Harris beat his friend to death when he caught his friend sleeping with his lover . Mr Justice Evans jailed Harris for life with a minimum term of 18 years to serve behind bars. He said: 'You beat him to death. You assaulted him with such ferocity it caused devastating and fatal injuries. 'Both were naked when the ambulancemen arrived. I therefore have to sentence you on that basis that your account of finding them together is true. Paul Drury died of horrific injuries . 'However I am sure you never lost your self control. 'You decided to administer punishment beatings to seek revenge and to teach him a lesson.' Miss Lewis, 46, said Harris has a strong sex drive but had not had sex with her for more than a month after she had had surgery. She . told the jury at Exeter Crown Court that Harris - whom she had only . been seeing for a few months - 'seemed to want it every day'. Hours before the murder on November 13 last year, Harris had pestered her for sex but she refused despite his repeated attempts. She . told the jury she cannot recall how she got her injuries and was . confused as to whether she had had sex with Harris on that November . night. Initially in police interviews Harris insisted . that two men and two women had burst into the house and launched the attack which he single handedly repelled. But he now admitted that he was responsible for the assaults on his friend and his lover. Harris told the jury in his evidence that he woke to find their room empty and Miss Lewis moaning. He said: 'She was moaning in pleasure downstairs and Paul was naked on top of her and they were having sex on the floor of the living room. 'I said to Paul: ""What are you doing?"" 'I was shouting and swearing at him. He got off her and we exchanged words. 'I was very annoyed and hurt and being betrayed by him and Dawn. He told me he loved her too and said I'd used her for money. I told him I loved the girl.' He admitted fighting Mr Drury and said: 'I was giving him a hiding to say 'keep off my missus'. I had lost all control. I did not realise how badly I had injured him.' Injured: Dawn Lewis says that she is certain she did not have sex with Harris' friend . Harris denied using the bloodied frying pan as a weapon and said he punched and kicked Mr Drury for up to 15 minutes in a brutal beating. Miss Lewis, who had taken a sleeping tablet, told the court that she could not recall having sex with Mr Drury. She said: 'I am almost 100 per cent sure I didn't sleep with Drury, he was not a sexual person.' Harris had denied murdering Mr Drury and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Miss Lewis with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. Prosecutor Michael Fitton QC said Mr Drury died in a 'prolonged and brutal attack' which left him with multiple head and other injuries to his neck, jaw, ribs and ear. He suffered fatal brain wounds. Mr Drury's family said he was a 'sensitive and generous individual' and they were content that Harris was locked up to prevent him unleashing other 'relentless and lethal attacks on other undeserving victims'.","Bryan Harris, 45, said he 'lost all control' when he woke up and found his lover and friend having sex with each other .

Women undergoing IVF are less likely to want sex or be as satisfied in their relationships, a landmark study has found. The research, from Indiana University, confirmed the stress of treatment often has a negative effect on a couple’s sex life. The new trial was the first in America . to assess women’s thoughts and the sexual health of couples going . through assisted reproductive treatments. Women undergoing IVF had a reduced libido and also reported feeling less satisfied in their relationships in general . Women who were going through IVF had a reduced libido and also reported feeling less satisfied in their relationships in general, the researchers found. These women were also less likely to orgasm and experience more discomfort during sex. The longer the IVF process continued, the worse the symptoms became. Study co-author Nicole Smith, a doctoral student in the Centre for Sexual Health Promotion at the university, told the website Medical News Today:‘Sex is for pleasure and for reproduction, but attention to pleasure often goes by the wayside for people struggling to conceive. They were also less likely to orgasm and experience more discomfort during sex . 'With assisted reproduction technologies, couples often report that they feel like a science experiment, as hormones are administered and sex has to be planned and times. It can become stressful and is often very unromantic and regimented; relationships are known to suffer during the process.’ Indeed, many people trying for a baby have no idea the negative effect it can have on their sex life, says fertility expert and midwife Zita West. ‘Rather than trying to enjoy the experience, love making becomes pressured and mechanical because it’s the ‘right’ time of the month.’ And the effects aren’t just bad for women, either. ‘Many men think they are suffering from ED and poor libido - but it’s not that, it’s just performance anxiety,’ she added. ‘The best thing to do is try and employ some stress management techniques, such as meditation.' Ms Smith added that women's hormones change dramatically during IVF treatments, which may be a reason for their change in sexual desires. A recent study said that women’s feelings toward sexual relationships change during different times in their menstrual cycle, probably because of their hormones. Sexual function among women was the same whether they were receiving IVF for infertility relating to the man, woman or both partners. The study concluded that couples involved in IVF processes should be told from the beginning about their risks of sexual side effects and methods to improve them.","Women undergoing IVF had a reduced libido and reported feeling less satisfied in their relationships .

A Georgia teen who was locked up for four years and starved by his cruel parents has been found wandering a Los Angeles weighing just 97 pounds. Retired Los Angeles police Sgt. Joe Gonzalez spotted 18-year-old Mitch Comer, and couldn't believe the stunted and gaunt teenager was really that old when he found him at a downtown bus station on September 11. Comer, whose skin was almost translucent, told Gonzalez his stepfather declared on his 18th birthday that he was now a man and put the teen on a bus across the country with $200 in his pocket. Scroll down for video . Charged: Paul and Sheila Comer face six charges of child abuse and false imprisonment after Mitch Comer, 18, told police his parents abused him for years and kept him locked  in a room for four years . The frail teenager told detectives that his stepfather drove him to a bus station in Jackson, Mississippi on his 18th birthday and gave him the money, as well as a list of homeless shelters. The teen told authorities he had suffered years of abuse after being taken out of school in the eighth grade. The boy told detectives that he was fed small quantities of food and for eight hours every day he was forced to put the top of his head against a wall and stand on his toes with his fingers interlaced behind his head, police said. More... Caregivers 'caught on secret camera beating severely autistic man, who is unable to talk, HUNDREDS of times' Mentally ill Chinese man is locked up in chains for 21 years by his mother . Authorities allege the boy was kept in such seclusion that his two younger sisters in the same house did not know what he looked like, Paulding County sheriff's Cpl. Ashley Henson said. 'The sisters haven't seen the brother in over two years,' Henson said. 'They didn't even know what color his hair was.' Neighbours on the quiet cul-de-sac of two-story brick and vinyl siding homes, about 30 miles outside Atlanta, said the couple kept to themselves and the two girls didn't ride the neighborhood school bus or leave their yard. Neighbours were shocked to discover that the family had a son. The FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation have joined the case, Henson added. Authorities in Los Angeles contacted law enforcement in Georgia, where Paulding County sheriff's deputies had to track down Comer's stepfather and mother because the teen didn't even know his address. Horrifying: Comer, who was found in a Californian bus depot weighing just 97 pounds, told authorities he spent the last four years locked in a room at his parents' Georgia home, pictured. Neighbours were surprised to learn that the family had a son as they'd never seen him . After being interviewed, Paul and Sheila Marie Comer were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment. They were being held without bond and records did not indicate whether the Comers have an attorney. Sheila Comer’s mother, Diana Powell, of Iowa, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she hadn’t spoken to her daughter in more than a decade and hadn’t seen her grandson since he was a toddler. Powell told the station that she had feared her daughter and husband abused their children but had no direct evidence. 'They mistreated him something terrible. I got on her case about it and she disappeared from my life,’ she said crying. Authorities say that they are just at . the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with the case and more charges could be . brought against the parents. Monica Moore, an investigator with the Paulding County District Attorney’s office, described the 18-year-old victim as small, very timid, and extremely polite. Moore confirmed that a local family had agreed to house the teenager, according to Channel 2. A spokesman from Paulding County Public Schools could also not confirm whether the children have ever been enrolled in the school system. State and local officials prepare to search Paul and Shelia Comer's Dallas home . Records show the Comers have lived in almost two dozen different homes during the past two decades. Neighbours said the family had lived at their large Dallas home for at least a few years. Neighbours Dion Walker and Mea Smith told AJC that their children had played with the Comers’ daughters over the years but that they had never even seen Mitch Comer. They said they were surprised to learn the family had a son. 'Maybe, when the young girls would stare at us, were they trying to say something?' Walker said. 'Should we have noticed?' Comer was flown back to Dallas on Wednesday to participate in the investigation and legal proceedings. His younger sisters, aged 11 and 13-years-old, were taken into protective custody by Paulding County Children's Services. Paul Comer had his own business repairing home appliances, said next-door neighbor John White. They rarely spoke. Comer's wife never left the house unless she was with her husband, . not even to check the mail, White said. Their two daughters would . sometimes come outside and play, but only in the back yard.

There were no signs of a son at all,' said Walker, who's lived next to the Comers for two years. 'The few . occasions we would see them go to the van, it was always the parents and . the two girls.'

'Abusive': Margaret Walker, 73, is alleged to have targeted Muslims, the Chinese, Jews and the Scottish in letters sent across the UK . An elderly woman accused of sending hundreds of racist letters has told a court that she wanted to raise issues she feels 'the establishment' are ignoring. Margaret Walker, 73, is alleged to have targeted Muslims, the Chinese, Jews and the Scottish in abusive correspondence sent across the UK. She claims the letters are necessary because police in Britain are 'not doing their job properly'. Walker is contesting an attempt by police to give her an anti-social behaviour order, banning her from sending any more offensive letters. Police say that Walker told them she will continue to send the handwritten 'campaign leaflets' until she is ordered to stop by a court. The pensioner began sending letters across the country in 2007, to hospitals, businesses and local politicians. By her own admission she has sent about 500 of her handwritten letters, with many complaining about immigration and calling for Britain to pull out of the EU. The letters were reported to police, who were able to trace them back to Walker in 2009 through DNA and fingerprint evidence. Walker was then arrested at her home in Fareham, near Portsmouth, Hampshire. Julian Knowles QC, prosecuting, told Fareham Magistrates' Court: 'The letters Mrs Walker sent can be deemed as abusive, offensive, racist, obscene, distressing and harassing. 'The letters had a poisonous and corrosive effect on the recipients because they naturally thought they came from someone they knew.' Mr Knowles added: 'Mrs Walker’s attitude expressed to the police that she will continue to do this unless ordered to stop by the courts. 'She is on a crusade, for want of a better expression.' Giving evidence, Walker denied the terms she used to describe different ethnic groups are offensive. She said: 'I’m English and if you are English today with a voice, you are called racist.' Trial: Margaret Walker is said to have told police that she will continue to send her 'campaign leaflets' until she is ordered to stop by a court . Tim Rait, regional press officer for the BNP, gave evidence for the defence during the trial. The party were mentioned in several of Mrs Walker’s letters but under cross-examination Rait admitted the party did not support her campaign. He said: 'I cannot associate ourselves with it.' Walker had previously said in evidence: 'I am not a member of the BNP, but I admire and support them.' The trial continues.

Suspect: Dale Cregan is being questioned in connection with the killing of PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone . Residents living on the estate where double murder suspect Dale Cregan was arrested claim he was spotted in the community several times as he apparently hid from police for a month. The 29-year-old was seen drinking in pubs and walking around as 'bold as brass' in Hattersley, Tameside, Greater Manchester, witnesses said. He was arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday after policewomen PC Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, were killed on the estate. The policewomen were attacked with a gun and a grenade as they went to investigate a report of a burglary. Today questions remained about why, despite the sightings, police were not alerted to Cregan's presence. Police had offered a £50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest in connection with alleged crimes. A middle-aged man, who would only give his name as Tom, told the Daily Mirror that he had seen Cregan 'a few times'. 'I saw him in the local a few weeks back,' he said. 'Didn’t say anything obviously. You assume the police are on to it, or it’s been straightened.' Another resident, aged in her thirties, claimed that Cregan had been seen walking about the estate 'bold as brass'. An officer weeps at the scene where the two policewomen died after being attacked with a gun and a grenade . The revelations come a day after one of Britain's top police officers condemned a 'worrying' conspiracy by a minority in Manchester who aided and protected Cregan. Sir Hugh Orde, the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the situation mirrored what he experienced in Northern Ireland, where he ran policing for seven years, whose communities had in the past protected suspected terrorists and criminals. A culture of fear was used to stop people with information speaking to police, no matter how high the cash rewards for information were, he said.

A judge has condemned a crowd of onlookers for gleefully filming a foul-mouthed yob trashing a mobile phone shop in an 'explosive rage'. Judge Charles Bloom QC said the crowd seemed to ‘enjoy’ watching 42-year old Jason Codner causing £20,000 of damage in front of other customers following a row over a refund. Codner shouted: ‘robbing b*******’ at staff at the T-Mobile shop in Manchester then embarked on a three minute rampage as one terrified six-year-old disabled girl in a wheelchair looked on . In a shocking display of rage he let off fire extinguishers, pulled stock of the walls and overturned tables - whilst staff members took cover in the corner of the store. But when passersby spotted Codner’s trail of destruction they whipped out their mobile phones - not to dial 999 but to take moving footage of him instead. They carried on filming as Codner was arrested after one of the staff members alerted police. It is thought at one point up to 1,500 people were stood outside watching the rampage. As they handcuffed him, Codner shouted at the five officers: ‘You f****** d********, do you think I give a f***? Have you seen what I’m capable of? You are a f****** c***, you p****, f*** you, you c***.’ The footage was later posted on YouTube and was watched by over 64,000 people. At Manchester Crown Court, Codner, of Salford, said sorry for his conduct as he pleaded guilty to causing £20,000 worth of criminal damage and using threatening behaviour. He was ordered to complete a 12-month community order, with 200 hours of unpaid work. Referring to the crowd outside Judge Bloom said: ‘They seemed to be enjoying the situation.’ He told Codner: ‘This is an extraordinary case with a huge amount of violence to property. ‘You virtually demolished the interior of T-Mobile.

Manchester Crown Court was told there were several customers in the premises and one single customer had a young child, six, who needed an oxygen tank to help her breathe. They fled as Codner flew into a rage. The manager pressed the panic button to get help but Codner ripped three desk phones from the counter and threw them outside.

Codner was later subdued and taken to a nearby police station where a small amount of cannabis was found in his possession.

Worth the wait: Sarah, right, had secretly been in love with Kerry for two years before finding the courage to tell her . 'My brother even threatened to drag me down the aisle if I didn’t show up. 'Luckily I did and now I’m finally married and it’s amazing.' Kerry from from Southend, Essex, grew up always believing she would settle down with a man and have a family. After she met her first would-be husband, cable installer Craig Smith, the couple settled down together for 11 years and had children Ellie, 10, and George, four. But only months before they were due to get on a plane and fly to Florida, USA, to marry at Cypres Gardens theme park, Kerry backed out. She moved out and became romantically involved with school pal Dave Futter, a shop assistant, who she believed was ‘the one’. But after two-and-a-half-years together Dave started talking about marriage and Kerry dumped him. Kerry says the pair clicked and instantly knew they wanted to be together for the rest of their lives - a feeling of certainty she had never had with a man . Still believing she was meant for a man, Kerry fell for Nick Farmer, a musician, who she agreed to marry after they had been together for two years. The pair had set a date to marry at Langtons House registry office, in Hornchurch, Essex, and more than 100 invitations. But six weeks before the wedding day Sarah asked Kerry to have an important talk with her. Her maid of honour then dropped the bombshell she was smitten with her and begged her not to marry Nick. Kerry says the pair clicked and instantly knew they wanted to be together for the rest of their lives - a feeling of certainty she had never had with a man. After three failed attempts the runaway bride finally married on September 15 at Langtons House registry office in Hornchurch, Essex, watched by 140 guests. Kerry wore a white dress with pink accessories while Sarah wore a pink suit at the native American-themed ceremony. Sarah, who was secretly in love with Kerry for two years before finding the courage to tell her, said: 'I never thought I would get the reaction I did. But now I am so glad I stopped the wedding.'

David Cameron arrived in Brazil today on a trip aimed at boosting the British economy – and was immediately asked about Boris Johnson. The Prime Minister has taken a 40-strong trade delegation to Sao Paulo in the hope of drumming up business while holding talks with president Dilma Rousseff. But all the Brazilian media want to discuss is the PM’s rivalry with the Mayor of London, who was beamed into millions of Brazilian homes when he handed over the Olympic and Paralympic flags ahead of the Rio Games in 2016. Entourage: Prime Minister David Cameron arrives at the State of Sao Paulo's Federation of Industries today with a delegation of British business men and women . Interviewed for newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, Mr Cameron was asked: ‘With the economy in crisis, we see mayor Boris Johnson, also of your party, with greater popularity than you to the point there are rumours that he might be the Conservative candidate for the next general election. 'Do you feel your post is threatened?’ However, the Prime Minister did his best to heap praise on his much-hyped leadership rival, insisting he did not feel the pressure. ‘Not at all. Boris has been a great friend of mine for a long time and a first-class mayor of London. ‘We're very lucky to have many big hitters in our party, but Boris still has much work to do as mayor, and so do I as Prime Minister.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson became a global star after handing over the Olympic and Paralympic flags to Mayor of Rio Eduardo Paes, leading Brazilian media to wonder if David Cameron felt threatened by his Tory rival . The two-day visit to Brazil is aimed at capitalising on the Olympic connection to foster trade links with one of the world’s emerging economic powerhouses. It comes after his appearance on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman in which his knowledge of British history- including the meaning of the Magna Carta and who composed Rule Brittania – was shown to be lacking. But he raised applause from the audience when he hailed the successful hosting of the Olympics and Paralympics this summer. David Cameron tours a new JCB factory in Sao Paulo as part of a two-day visit to Brazil to drum up business . Today Mr Cameron officially opened a new £60million digger factory at Sorocaba, near Sao Paulo. The 350,000 square foot JCB factory will assemble the yellow excavators and diggers for the Brazilian market, providing £100 million a year in orders for components from JCB plants in Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Wales. The PM eyes up some digger parts at JCB's new plant in Sorocaba . Mr Cameron said: ‘This visit is about British jobs, British growth and the British economy, because I want Britain to be tied up to the fastest growing economies on the planet. ‘Brazil is now a top six economy and this visit is about safeguarding and creating 3,000 jobs back at home. ‘Here we are in JCB, a great British brand now expanding in Brazil. That's going to mean £100 million of extra orders from the UK and that's good for British jobs, tying us to the fast growing economies of the future.’ Mr Cameron was welcomed by Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, who offered him a coveted invitation to the opening match of the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil, . Mr Cameron joked noted that football was 'a sport invented in Britain but perhaps perfected in Brazil'.","The Prime Minister is on a two-day trade visit to Sao Paulo, including a tour of a digger factory .

Christine Hall, pictured, has been slapped with an Asbo after terrorising the quiet cul-de-sac where she lives in in Lancashire . A former nurse labelled ‘The Witch of Kittiwake Close’ was warned she could end up in prison after waging a terrifying and bizarre campaign against her neighbours in a quiet seaside street. Spinster Christine Hall, 54, wrote poison pen letters, used her Highland terrier to menace children, banged on windows and roamed the street wearing a hangman’s noose. She even attempted to commit suicide in front of horrified neighbours and their children after they complained about her frightening behaviour. Today she was issued with a two-year anti-social behaviour order at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court, banning her from making or wearing hangman’s nooses in public view or from speaking to any child unless they are in danger. Hall was told if she breaks the conditions of the Asbo she could face up to five years in prison. The court heard how police repeatedly arrested her and built up a dossier of 40 complaints before she was deemed mentally fit enough to be hauled into court. Hall would put a noose around her neck and stand in her porch on a set of ladders, waiting for her neighbours to arrive home in Kittiwake Close in Cleveleys, Lancashire. On one occasion neighbour Rachel Walker, 32, returned home to see Hall kick away the ladder and drop to the floor - as her son screamed in terror. She only survived after heavily pregnant Mrs Walker cut her down and had her taken to hospital. Hall, who would creep up on drivers and scream through the car window ‘I’m coming to get you’, also falsely accused one couple of child abuse and poisoning her dog Meg. One boy was so scared of Hall he suffered regular nightmares, believing she would walk through walls at night. Neighbours wrote to hospital bosses and then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley about their problems to try and get help for Hall, but were told doctors could not discuss the matter due to patient confidentiality. Police have built up a file of more than 40 complaints against Christine Hall, pictured here after moving a wheelie bin into the middle of the street . A number of house are up for sale on Kittiwake Close following the upsetting behaviour of Christine Hall, who frequently blocked off the road with wheelie bins . Pictures taken by a neighbour show the odd actions of the former nurse, pictured with her dog Meg which neighbours say she used to terrorise children . After the court hearing housewife Rachel Walker, 32, spoke of the nightmare of living next to the woman, who accused her and her husband, college lecturer Mark, 33, of abusing one of their two sons; Isaac, four and Alex, two. Mrs Walker said: ‘This lady has been an absolute nightmare - especially after what she has put the kids through. ‘She started putting letters though our door, things like what ‘the definition of consideration’ was and that we were making too much noise and falsely accusing us of abusing our son. ‘But she also accused us of poisoning her dog, things escalated to the point where one day I went to pick up my husband from work and when I came back she was hanging from the front porch. ‘Neighbours said she was standing there waiting and when she saw us coming round the corner she kicked the ladders away, I had to cut her down, I was heavily pregnant at the time - it was awful. ‘She would bang on the outside window with her keys and she stands and stares into the living room. Isaac is terrified of her and he wouldn’t go to the toilet because he would have to pass the front door and thinks she might be there. A diary kept by a neighbour documents details including a hanging attempt and shows a picture of bins and plant pots moved into the middle of the road blocking car parking spaces . Another extract has notes about her shouting at children and photos of a wheelie bin obstructing the pavement . ‘He has nightmares that she will come . through the walls at night. She walks her dog on an extendable lead and . lets it run up to them and then pulls it back. ‘She is clearly not getting the support she needs, but the mental health service say she is capable of facing criminal charges. ‘She . hangs nooses outside her house all the time usually after police have . spoken to her and my children should not be subjected to seeing . something like that, I can’t let them play out without being sat at the . front watching them. ‘My house has been up for sale for two years but I’ve had people cancel viewings because they keep seeing nooses outside next door. ‘We even reduced the value by £10,000 just to get a quick sale but we still haven’t been successful. All we want is for Christine to leave us alone and get on with her own life so that we can get on with ours.’ Hall began terrorising her neighbours after losing her job at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. In 2006 she was convicted of breaching a restraining order after bombarding a former colleague with 88 phone calls – including her cackling down the phone. She was also convicted of three charges of assault on neighbours. Another extract from earlier this year show Hall washing her car while her dog sits in the boot, although neighbours said she never used any water . During her campaign she would accuse neighbours of being too noisy then play loud music herself, block pathways outside her £112,000 terraced house with wheelie bins and plant pots and injure herself to get attention. Neighbour Sandra Ronson 69, said: ‘Children will come out and walk a different way just to avoid her house and seeing her, she follows the children and I’ve seen her pick the dog up and point it in the direction of the children. ‘One day when I was watching TV she came to the window and stood there and her arms were pouring with blood and she was saying ""you have done this"". ‘She’ll stand with the noose around her neck until she gets the right audience then jumps. Nobody in this day in age should have to witness that on their street.’ Hall’s lawyer Neil Cheesbrough said: ‘My client accepts this order rather against advice. I am not sure if ASBOs were created for this type of behaviour. But Miss Hall does not have the will for a fight. She is desperate to move from this area and her home is up for sale.’ Hall said at her home: ‘The neighbours have a vendetta and are just ganging up on me. Is it any wonder I have tried to hang myself.’","Christine Hall, 54, blocked pavement and road with debris .

'It was great to get away and forget about a few things. I can’t thank Simon or A Ray Of Sunshine enough. 'I think he is an outstanding man, it is nice there are people out there like him.' Simon said: 'A lot of the general public forget that we’re still at war and some armed forces personnel are forgotten about when they return to the UK.

An 18-year-old woman has been arrested after she slipped free of handcuffs, stole a police car, and lead officers on a drunken high speed chase through the mountains. Shelby Figeroa was pulled over near Georgetown, Colorado, at 10am on Sunday after she rammed her red pick up into a Clear Creek Sheriff deputy's vehicle. When she failed to cooperate, the officer handcuffed her and put her in the back of his SUV. But within minutes, the teen had managed to escape the cuffs, jump behind the wheel and zoom off in the patrol car, with the lights on and sirens blaring. 'We're westbound 224. Speeds are 100,' a state trooper told dispatchers. 'She's got lights and sirens on in the deputy's car. It's an unmarked white Expedition, Excursion.'

Police officers involved in the shooting of Mark Duggan, pictured, sat in a room together for eight hours to write their statements . Eleven members of the twelve man team which gunned down Mark Duggan sat in a room together to write their accounts of the shooting, a court heard. But their boss denied that he feared this would have allowed them to ‘put their heads together’ and cover for the shooter. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that eleven of the CO19 officers who were at Ferry Lane, in Tottenham, on August 4 last year when Duggan was shot dead sat in a room together and took eight hours to write a full account of events. Those called to give evidence in the trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, accused of giving Duggan the gun, have admitted conferring on operational matters but deny discussing the actual shooting or their state of mind. Before they made their first notes the team saw legal representatives and members of the police federation and were read the ACPO guidance on statements, which allows conferring on issues other than their 'honestly held belief' of the situation. Stuart Denney QC, defending, quizzed Superintendent Neil Evans who was then the post incident manager at CO19 and called in after the shooting. Mr Denney said: 'These police officers are friends and colleagues. Did it occur to you that in those circumstances if you put all 11 in a room they might not seek to ensure they protected their friend and colleague who had used the gun?' Superintendent Evans replied: 'I did not see that then or now as a potential problem.' When asked to clarify Mr Denney said: 'What I am suggesting is whether he thought about the possibility that officers might have put their heads together to help V53.' Superintendent Evans replied: 'No, I did not think that.' Mr Denney asked Colin Sparrow, the IPCC’s lead investigator in the case, whether the police making statements together was 'with a view to ensuring there were no unfortunate occurrences where two officers didn’t say the same thing.' Mr Sparrow replied: 'Not at all. My concerns were that we got detailed initial accounts in order that I could then focus the investigation on challenging those accounts.' No member of the IPCC was present at the statement writing because there were 'no resources' available, he said. Paramedics attended to Duggan after he was shot by police . Hutchinson-Foster denies selling or transferring the BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun to Duggan. The court also heart from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, the man accused of giving him a pistol told police. He said Mark Duggan’s death was 'karma' because 'you live by the gun, you die by the bullet'.  Hutchinson-Foster, 30, who is alleged to have given Duggan the gun shortly before he was shot by police, said he was attacked by a gang including Duggan the month before his death. Referring to Duggan’s death, he told police in interview: 'They say karma is a bitch.' Duggan, 29, was shot twice by a police marksman as he ran from a taxi he had been travelling in and pulled a gun from his waistband and started to aim it at cops, the CO19 team who gunned him down have claimed. A BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun, wrapped in a sock, was found roughly five metres from Duggan’s body in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, the court has heard. His death August 4 last year sparked the riots in Tottenham which rocked the nation. Hutchinson-Foster, 30, was arrested in October after forensic tests linked him to the pistol Duggan was allegedly holding when he was killed. Hutchinson-Foster is said to have handed the weapon hidden in a shoe box to Duggan outside his girlfriend Desire Cox’s home in Leyton, east London just 15 minutes before he was gunned down. When he was arrested Hutchinson-Foster told police that he had bled on a gun he was beaten with when ten gang members, including Mark Duggan, attacked him as he was on his way to meet a girl on their patch, a court heard today. Superintendent Neil Evans who was then the post incident manager said he did not think the officers put their heads together when recalling the events, Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, heard . He told police in interview he recognised one of the men but said he didn’t want to name him for fear of reprisals. He said: 'At the same time, like I said, a lot of stuff has happened since then, and they say that karma is a bitch. 'They say you live by the gun and you die by the bullet. So you know from what I have heard if it is the person who did whatever to me then he is not living anymore, I am taking about June, July, August still.' He added: 'If I say something now and the wrong set of people hear about it I would rather be in prison than out here with people wanting to do me something.' He told police that he had family in Hackney and Tottenham and he didn’t want to be 'wandering around scared'. But once he was reassured the interview was private he said 'a lot of things have happened because of, this you know, his name is Mark'. He confirmed that it was Duggan and said that they knew some of the same people and that he had been sleeping with the same South African woman as the father-of-four. He told the officers that members of the Holly Street And London Fields gang did not like him because he had been sleeping with their 'baby mama'. Then, days after the birth of his daughter, Hutchinson-Foster, a self proclaimed womaniser who said he sometimes sleeps with four women a day, was on his way to see a girl in the Holly Street Estate when he was attacked by the gang including Duggan. Hutchinson-Foster said he was 'not used to seeing (Duggan) in that neck of the woods'. In his interview, read to the jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court today, he said: 'I got battered by about eight or 10 boys.' The shooting of Mark Duggan was the catalyst for some of the worst riots in UK living history . Pockets of rioting and looting broke out in various boroughs of London, and other English cities following the shooting of Mark Duggan . He said: 'I will be honest, I thought I was going to get shot, just like today all those guns butting my face. I just heard them say “burn him”. I just curled up and hoped for the best.' He said he was scared of reprisal, telling police: 'I don’t want to be constantly looking over my shoulder, I got a three month old girl.' When he was first arrested he complained: 'If someone hits me with something and I bleed on it I get into trouble.' But his claims in interview about the attack were proven to be 'lies', the prosecution have said. He has since pleaded guilty to possessing the firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and assaulting Hackney barber Peter Osadebay causing him actual bodily harm on July 29. The pistol-whipping attack, which linked him forensically to the gun, was after he said he was attacked by Duggan and the gang. He denies selling or transferring the prohibited firearm to Duggan. The trial continues.","Eleven of the 12-man team of officers spent eight hours in the same room writing statements .

It was a truly mammoth undertaking, but Duchess the blind elephant will finally be able to see again after receiving what was quite possibly the world's largest ever cataract operation. The 43-year-old Asian elephant, who only has the one eye left, had been able to do little more than distinguish between light and dark for years. But thanks to surgeons at Paignton Zoo, Devon, she should soon be able to see clearly once again. The huge creature was put under by . anaesthetists David Burton and Jo Jago for around three hours, while the . delicate operation was carried out by consultant opthamologist Jim . Carter and assistant John Lewis. After she came round Duchess seemed to be fine and was tenderly rubbing the sore eye with her trunk. The first ever elephant cataract operation in the UK: Duchess prepares for her treatment for a cataract, to hopefully regain sight in one eye . A delicate tusk: Duchess's trunks rest on sand-bags as the groundbreaking operation is carried out . Before and during: The vets prepare to operate, and then start removing the damaged parts of the eye . Jim Carter, a specialist in veterinary ophthalmology, takes charge of the operation to remove the cataract, eventually clearing out the damage . The zoo’s curator of mammals, Neil Bemment, said although Duchess was groggy after the operation, the signs were looking good. He said: 'She’s up and about but like anyone who’s had a major operation it will take some time for her to fully recover. 'She’s been making her usual bellowing sounds which is a good sign. But it will be some time before we are able to tell if we’ve saved her sight.' He added she may have another ten years of life if things go well. It’s not the first time Duchess has had groundbreaking surgery. She was the first elephant to have an eye removed last year because of glaucoma.

When going out for a gourmet meal, you might expect to dine on caviar, fillet steak or succulent sea bass. Now, however, you could turn up to a restaurant with two Michelin stars to be served that beloved British classic, bangers and mash - priced at a staggering £75. Olivier Limousin, head chef at L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon, has produced the world’s most expensive sausages and mash, featuring ‘deconstructed’ gourmet sausages served on a bed of pureed Desiree potatoes and butter, mixed with 10 grams of black truffle. Gourmet grub: Chef Olivier Limousin shows off the world's most expensive version of the classic pub dish . Expensive tastes? The Michelin-starred L'Atelier de JoÎl Robuchon, in London, is serving up 'deconstructed' Iberico pork sausages braised in a 16-year-old vintage Bordeaux . The sausages are made with pork from Iberico pigs fed on a diet of acorns, wild thyme, rosemary and mushrooms. They are gently braised in a 16-year-old vintage Bordeaux, worth more than £75 a bottle, to bring out the meat’s sweetness. The pricetag for the dish, named ‘Ivre de genereux Bordeaux, mousseline de pomme de terre avec truffe', may be hard for some to swallow, however. It’s an eyewatering 839 per cent more expensive than the average £7.99 meal. The dish - which is devoured more than 10million times a week across the UK - has been placed on the menu to celebrate Potato Week, led by the Potato Council. 'Signature' mash: The bangers rest on a bed of pureed Desiree potatoes and butter, mixed with 10 grams of black truffle . But Chef Limousin is one of only 20 protegees in the world trained to make Mr Robuchon’s signature mash. Mr Limousin said: 'It’s a dream come true for any chef to simply have the opportunity to work with ingredients of such sublime quality. 'Putting my own stamp on sausage and mash was an added delight. 'You can only make our signature of mouselline de pommes de terre by selecting the right potato variety. Texture is key to getting results. 'Our tasting menu shows just a fraction of the ways you can cook with potatoes, and for most of them you don’t need a professional kitchen.' A smaller version of the dish will be available as part of a £152 tasting menu at L’Atelier until Sunday, October 7. To celebrate Potato Week, each of the eight courses will be made with potatoes. No-so-posh nosh: Ivre de genereux Bordeaux, mousseline de pomme de . terre avec truffe' is a world away from the more common, low-budget . version of the dish . Delights include a salt and vinegar martini, vichyssoise, caramelised potato picolini in orange liqueur and almond and potato petit fours. The menu, created with www.manyfacesofpotatoes.co.uk, is designed to showcase a new potato classification system. Varieties will be grouped together in three classifications - Fluffy, Salad and Smooth - in a bid to make cooking the root vegetable easier for people. Caroline Evans, of the Potato Council, said: 'This dish is a true taste sensation and gives a gastronomic twist on a meal most of us enjoy once a fortnight at home. 'As a nation, mash is one of our favourite ways to cook with potatoes but, of course, you don’t need to add expensive truffle to enjoy this classic.' A smooth variety of potato, like the Desiree, produces the best, lump-free mash, she added.","Dish features 'deconstructed' Iberico pork sausages .

In August 1976, a Soviet rocket landed on the moon, drilled six feet into the surface, extracted about half a pound of rock and flew back. In the rocks that it brought back, water made up around 0.1%. It was the first time any spacecraft had found conclusive evidence of water on the moon. The American Apollo landings had brought back moon rocks, but the samples were thought to have been contaminated with water from Earth.

The paper, published in the Soviet journal Geokhimiia, which had an English version, has never been cited by any Western scientist - despite the fact that in one small sample it found something that eluded the West's best efforts. The Apollo missions brought back 300 kilos of moon rock to Earth. Nasa's Clementine mission bounced radio waves off the surface of the moon in 1994, and found evidence of water.

A teenage driver who killed his best friend in a car crash just two weeks after passing his test has been jailed for two years. Jay Haines, 18, was today locked up for two years after giving five of his friends a lift home in his small Suzuki car. 'Show off' Haines hit a parked car while speeding which led to his friend Morgan Hackling, 19, dying as a result of his injuries. Show off: Jay Haines (left) 18, has been jailed for two years after his reckless driving caused the death of his best friend, Morgan Hackling, 19, (right) A court heard that McDonald’s worker Haines, of Risca, Newport, 17 at the time, had passed his driving test just two weeks before. It has also emerged that the youth was stopped by police just four days earlier to the incident, for speeding and warned the teenager for 'showing off to his friends'. Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said that Haines had offered the five teenagers a lift home after finishing his late shift in McDonald’s. Jailed: Cardiff Crown Court heard that the music from the car's stereo was 'excessively loud' and none of the five passengers were wearing seatbelts . With a total of six people travelling in the car, Morgan was in the front seat of the Suzuki Alto while another friend lay across the laps of three others sitting in the back. Cardiff Crown Court heard that the music from the car’s stereo was 'excessively loud' and none of the five passengers were wearing seatbelts. Haines hit a parked Renault at 1.35am while traveling at up to 48mph in a 30mph zone in Risca, near Newport, South Wales. Passenger Morgan was trapped for 30 minutes before being cut free, but died from his sustained neck injuries in hospital. Haines pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. Harry Baker, defending Jay Haines, said: 'His lack of driving experience contributed to the accident. 'He is remorseful and has struggled to come to terms with what happened.' Haines was sentenced to two years and three months in a young offender’s institution and banned from driving for three years. Judge Eleri Rees QC told him: 'The consequences for you and your family are serious and life changing but that cannot be compared with the loss for Morgan Hackling’s family - theirs is significantly worse. “When you have served your sentence you can, with your family and friends, rebuild your life. 'The guilt and feeling of responsibility for having taken another life will always be with you and will be a punishment you will always bear. 'For Morgan’s family there is no way of finding comfort - your sentence will not diminish their sense of loss.'","Jay Haines, 18, locked up for two years after giving FIVE of his friends a lift home in his Suzuki car .

MPs last night called for an urgent investigation into the Tony Blair spy chief who stands to gain from Britain’s biggest ever defence deal. Sir John Scarlett, who played a key role in the dodgy dossier on Saddam Hussein’s weapons, is lobbying the Government in support of the  £28billion merger. He now works for Morgan Stanley, which is advising BAE Systems on its proposed merger with European rival EADS. Sir John Scarlett, pictured, now works for Morgan Stanley, which is advising BAE Systems on its proposed merger with European rival EADS . The investment bank is in line to make millions if the deal goes ahead and MPs want to know how much Sir John, who left MI6 in October 2009, will gain personally from lobbying his former colleagues. Insiders say the 64 year old is ‘liaising’ between the bank and the Government to help ‘soothe concerns’ in No 10 about the deal. Critics of the tie-up say handing control of BAE to a company in part controlled by the French and German governments will undermine national security, lead to the closure of key defence facilities in the UK and destroy Britain’s military and intelligence relationship with the US. Details of Sir John’s involvement have reinforced the notion that the deal – which has David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s support – is being stitched together by the Whitehall establishment. MPs have already demanded the chance to question Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, who has been pushing the deal with the Prime Minister and has had a series of meetings with BAE and the bank. He worked for four years at Morgan Stanley and MPs are concerned he has a conflict of interest by promoting the deal in Downing Street. The Cabinet Office confirmed yesterday that Sir John was banned from lobbying government for a period of a year following his last day of his service. But now that has expired he is clear to call his old contacts. He and Sir Jeremy face being dragged before the Commons defence select committee, which is investigating the BAE deal. Sir Bob Russell, the senior Liberal Democrat on the committee, said Sir John should be called to give evidence and forced to answer questions about how much he will personally profit from the deal. ‘I have serious concerns about the merger, both from a defence point of view and for job reasons,’ he said. ‘I am of the view that there’s too cosy an arrangement between former ministers and civil servants becoming consultants when they leave government. ‘I’d prefer it if the time limit on them going into lobbying was ten years, not one. The public perception is that people like this are using the contacts they gained as ministers and civil servants. ‘If Sir John is trying to use the influence he has to skew a decision he ought to come before us so someone can ask who much he is being paid and whether he stands to get a personal bonus if the deal goes through.’ Ben Wallace, the Tory MP who is coordinating Commons opposition to the deal, said Sir John was a poor choice for BAE. ‘The last thing the defence industry needs is the overseer of the dodgy dossier to be lobbying on your behalf,’ he said. He said Sir John had no track record in the aerospace industry and ‘wasn’t a particularly stunning success as a civil servant’. A senior civil servant also expressed doubts, saying: ‘There are lots of people prepared to offer former ministers and mandarins large sums of money because they think they know how to open doors. I’m not sure they always represent very good value for money. Every day that passes after they leave, they are a day less plugged in to the people and the way things are done.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said Sir John had complied fully with the Business Appointment Rules. His appointment with Morgan Stanley in March 2010 was approved on the advice of the independent advisory committee.’ By JAMES SLACK . Sir Jeremy Heywood, who holds extraordinary influence inside No 10, finds himself dragged into controversy over his former business interests for the second time in barely a year. The cause of his trouble last year was the disaster which stuck the Southern Cross care homes group. And, as with the latest row over defence giant BAE, it concerned his time spent as a senior manager at the investment bank Morgan Stanley. Southern Cross, which looked after 31,000 frail elderly people at the height of its success, was bought by the US private equity firm Blackstone in 2004. Influence: Sir Jeremy finds himself dragged into controversy over his former business interests for the second time in barely a year . Blackstone floated it on the stock market two years later and sold all its shares in 2007 – taking a huge profit. But the flotation, which had been based upon the sale and lease-back of the company’s homes, left Southern Cross in a hugely precarious state by saddling it with expensive long-term rent commitments. When the economy downturn came, it could no longer afford to pay many of its bills – leaving the elderly and their relatives fearing they would be evicted. Sir Jeremy was safely inside Downing Street as ministers wrestled with trying to find a solution to this mess in the summer of 2011. But, in a huge personal embarrassment to the mandarin, a report by the GMB union revealed the controversial stock market flotation had been guided by Morgan Stanley, at a time when he was co-head of UK investment banking between 2004 and 2007, during a break from the civil service. The bank advised Blackstone on the float, informing it of stock exchange rules, helping draw up a prospectus, setting the share sale price and attracting investors. Morgan Stanley is believed to have shared in a £10million fee with other advisers, including Swiss bank UBS. Although Mr Heywood did not work directly on the Southern Cross deal, he was the ultimate boss of the team that managed it. It was never made clear how much, if any, of a personal bonus Sir Jeremy was paid for overseeing the Southern Cross float in 2006. However banking sources said he would have been handsomely rewarded. Justin Bowden, a national officer at the GMB, said the civil servant was in the Southern Cross scandal ‘up to his neck’. Ros Altmann of over-50s group Saga said: ‘I am absolutely staggered someone involved in this can be so influential in No 10.’ Sir Jeremy was brought back to government by Gordon Brown in 2007. He became involved in rumours that he was the source for journalist Andrew Rawnsley’s claims that Mr Brown bullied his staff. It was he who apparently emailed No 10 workers to inform them of their rights if they were treated badly. Since Mr Brown’s departure from  No 10, the father-of-three’s career has flourished. He is said to have a very close working relationship with David Cameron – with some Tory MPs being concerned that he has far too much sway. In particular, he has been embroiled in a series of rows over Iain Duncan Smith’s plan to ‘make work pay’ by shaking up the benefits system. Sir Jeremy is reported to have said he was ‘sceptical’ about the plan for a universal benefit – language which was seen as an attempt by the civil service to derail the flagship policy. He is also understood to be part of a cabal of Downing Street and Treasury advisers which has been pressing Mr Cameron to water down his commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands a year.","Sir John Scarlett works for Morgan Stanley, which is advising BAE systems on its proposed merger with European rivals EADS ."

The U.S. Marshals have identified an accused fraudster, that allegedly scammed donors out of $100 million through a fake veterans' charity, as a fugitive who has been evading the FBI since 1987. Law enforcement officials said on Monday that the alleged charity scam artist known as Bobby Thompson has been positively identified as John Donald Cody, a fugitive who is wanted on previous fraud charges and as part of an espionage investigation. In a case filled with intrigue and . infiltration of powerful political circles, Cody has been dubbed a con . man extraordinaire who will finally be prosecuted for his decades-old crimes. Fraud: Police believe 'Bobby Thompson' (left) swindled more than $100 million of donations from a fake veterans' charity. He is pictured with former U.S. President George W.

It is now known that the man who evaded . the FBI for decades had a prestigious educational background, with a . degree from the University of Virginia (UVA) and a law degree from . Harvard. He . had been a U.S. Army Captain in Military Intelligence and previously . practiced law in Sierra Vista, Arizona from 1980 to 1984. During his law career in Arizona, he became the subject of an investigation over claims he was stealing money from his clients but Cody skipped town before he could be apprehended and since 1987 has been a fugitive from the FBI. According to a federal warrant, dated May 4, 1987 out of the Eastern . District of Virginia, Cody is charged with interstate transportation of . fraudulent traveler’s checks from probate estates’ bank accounts, false . statements to an investment brokerage firm, and false statements on loan . applications. A . former colleague, Dennis Lusk, now chief judge of the Arizona Motor . Vehicle Division, had worked with Cody in Arizona and remembered him as . bizarre.

As part of his life on the run, he . assumed a number of aliases, the most publicized being Bobby Thompson - . the high profile head of the U.S. Navy Veterans Association - a fake veterans' charity that took in $100 million in donations. 'The USNVA claimed to have a national headquarters in Washington D.C., but its base of operations was the Tampa, FL, area,' according to a FBI statement. 'From . its inception [in the early 2000s] to the summer of 2010, it is . estimated the USNVA received close to $100 million dollars in nationwide . donations.'

The non profit group boasted a membership of over . 66,000 members in 40 states but little of the money raised ever made its . way to assist military service members. Wanted: The FBI has been searching for John Donald Cody since 1987 . Law enforcement officials began investigating Thompson and he was charged with multiple counts of fraud in 2010. Once again, the man, known as Thompson, abandoned his identity and set off on a cross-country . journey using numerous aliases to evade police. From June 2010 to May 2012, investigators believe he hid out in Massachusetts, Arizona, New . Mexico Rhode Island, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Washington and ultimately Portland, Oregon - where he was finally caught. Caught: John Donald Cody, aka Bobby Thompson, at a court hearing in May, after his arrest . He . was arrested at a boarding house where he had rented a room, and . investigators say one of the few belongings they found was a DVD of . Catch Me If You Can, the Leonardo DiCaprio drama chronicling the wild . history of convicted conman Frank Abagnale. Investigators . also discovered his storage unit, where he had suitcases full of cash, . totaling $981,000 - a far cry from the $100 million that is unaccounted . for. 'This was one of our most challenging fugitive . investigations to date,' U.S. Marshal Peter Elliott stated at the time of Thompson's arrest, according to a statement. 'Our investigators followed up leads all over the nation. Their diligence and dedication directly led to the arrest in Portland. I am . proud of everyone that worked on this investigation and their efforts have . brought this scam artist to justice,' he added. But the elusive suspect remained shrouded in mystery even after his arrest. He wanted only to be referred to as Mr. X, leaving investigators baffled as to his true identity. He also showed off his legal prowess in the courtroom, daring officials to try and discover who he truly was. Elliott, the agent who was key in apprehending Thompson, began to research Thompson - conducting simple Google searches of cold case fraud fugitives and looking for any connections to the man that had been arrested. He spotted the FBI photos of Cody, from the 1987 charges, and noticed a physical resemblance to Thompson, in addition to striking similarities in their MOs. A positive fingerprint match confirmed that Thompson was in fact Cody. Now that it has been established that Cody and Thompson are indeed one and the same, the 65-year-old will now face the 1987 charges, combined with the 2010 charges from the charity scam and he is also wanted for questioning in connection with a FBI espionage investigation. The FBI has not yet provided more . details into the espionage case but it's believed Cody's former career as an intelligence officer could be involved. Additionally, he had lived in Sierra Vista, Arizona  - which is located next to Fort Huachuca, a major intelligence hub for the military.","Accused conman, Bobby Thompson, is actually fugitive John Donald Cody, who has been wanted by the FBI since 1987 .

The Nintendo Wii U will go on sale in Japan on December 8th, the gaming firm announced today. Nintendo's president announced the prices on Thursday. The creator of Super Mario is fielding the successor to its hit Wii console in the run-up to the busy year-end shopping season and is battling to woo gamers with Microsoft Corp , Sony Corp and more recently tablet and smartphone makers including Apple Inc. Supporting two 'GamePad' controllers designed to look and function like tablets, the first new console from Nintendo in six years will come with a social-gaming network function dubbed 'Miiverse' installed and will be its first machine in 16 years to launch with a dedicated Super Mario game title. The addition of Miiverse, a 'facebook for gamers' suggests Nintendo - which started out in 1889 making playing cards in the back streets of Kyoto before gaining prominence as the creator of the ‘Super Mario’ franchise - may be relying on online content delivery to underpin hardware sales through its new Nintendo Network, a similar strategy to Sony and Apple. However, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata has been slower than others to take on online social and content delivery platforms, and has a lot of ground to make up to catch up with the millions of subscribers plugged into PlayStation 3's network, iTunes and Microsoft's Xbox.

A female Mayor who dressed up as a sausage to welcome the Olympic torch into her town has been mocked by its residents for her unsavoury 8ft costume which resembled 'something from a stag-do'. Louth Mayoress Jill Makinson-Sanders donned the giant pink novelty outfit in an effort to promote Lincolnshire's famous sausages, but ended up being ridiculed for its distinctly suggestive appearance. Residents in the Lincolnshire town branded the costume 'obscene' after the 8ft pink outfit was spotted bobbing along Louth's High Street to greet the torch. Obscene: The costume worn by Louth's female town Mayor, Jill Makinson-Sanders raised more than a few chuckles when she wore it to greet the Olympic torch recently . Cllr Makinson-Sanders chose her unique sausage role to promote Louth's finest and most popular export. The Lincolnshire market town and its residents are proud of their produce, with Lincolnshire sausages often winning national awards. Earlier this month Louth had campaigned for Lincolnshire sausages to be given designated protective status, so that only sausages produced in Lincolnshire could bear the county's name. However, when government officials turned down the request, Cllr Makinson-Sanders took drastic action to promote the town's image - a stunt which appears to have backfired. Special occasion: Michelle Brown carried the torch through the Lincolnshire town in Wednesday . Mother-of-two Sandra Ellington, 38, said: 'She probably thought she was being quite fun and quirky. 'People couldn’t take their eyes off her because it looks so rude - her outfit certainly gained a few titters among the crowd. 'It’s something you’d expect to see on a stag-do - not being worn by a respectable mayor. 'She didn’t carry the torch but when you saw her running down the street by the torch relay team nearby it really looked like she was wearing something obscene.' Another Louth resident added: 'I can't believe she could have been so stupid - she's made the town a laughing stock.' Resident Bill Nicholson added: 'The council chamber must put a stop to this embarrassment, and restore some dignity to the people of Louth who do not want the local Olympic event high-jacked for commercial reasons. 'To insult the whole spirit of the Olympic movement and the modest people who have carried the torch is not in Louth’s interest.' Describing her choice of costume before the torch appeared in Louth, Cllr Makinson-Sanders said: 'It took me quite a long time to track down a costume but happily managed it eventually. I just hope it won’t be too hot that morning! 'We have the opportunity to tell the world that we have brilliant multi-award winning independent butchers in our ancient market town and that Lincolnshire sausages are very, very special.' Cllr Makinson-Sanders yesterday defended her choice of costume. She said: 'Louth Town Council has not been officially invited to have anything to do with the Olympic torch or to meet the torch and welcome it in to the town.

A brave grandfather has spoken of the horrific moment he saw his blood-soaked two-year-old grandson being 'ripped to pieces' by a crazed dog. Dave Guess, 49, was bitten on the arm as he stepped in to rescue the boy from the jaws of a Staffordshire bull terrier. The injured toddler, Kieron Guess, is critically ill in an induced coma after undergoing surgery for seven hours. Rescuer: Dave Guess said his grandson Kieron was being ripped to pieces by the dog . It emerged tonight that the dog owner, Garfield King, will not be charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Wiltshire Police said that because the dog was in a privately owned garden at the time of the incident, the Act does not apply. Kieron's family are now feeling more optimistic for his recovery after doctors told them the boy has started to breath unaided. Mr Guess said: 'He is breathing on his own now. The ventilator kicks in if he misses a breath, but for the most part he is doing it independently. 'Doctors have started to reduce his coma and he was moving his hands around last night. The nurse has said everything is looking positive at the moment. 'They have said he has lost vision in his left eye but they are going to take a better look at it on Friday. His right one seems fine. 'Luckily they reckon his hearing organs are fine - despite most of his outer ear being ripped off. 'There is still a long way to go, but we are optimistic.' Keiron had been playing outside his . house in Swindon, Wiltshire, when his neighbour's dog mauled him, . tearing at his nose, an ear and an eye. Victim: Kieren Guess suffered horrific facial injuries in the attack . Describing the attack, Mr Guess said: ‘He was ripping him to pieces - Keiron was a mess. ‘The dog owner was holding Keiron up but the dog was just jumping up and biting him. ‘I took Keiron off him, put him on my shoulders, and ran back into the alleyway. 'I was getting bitten by the dog but eventually managed to get Keiron safe.’ Mr . Guess became involved in a heated exchange yesterday after the dog's . owner Garfield King blamed the boy's parents for not keeping a closer . eye on him. He went face-to-face with Mr King's son Jonathan in a confrontation near their homes. Mr Guess said said the family were too frightened to return home. The out-of-control dog, named 'Ratty' has been destroyed, but there is still another one living at Mr King's house. Confrontation: Jonathan King, (left) the eldest son of dog owner . Garfield King clashes with Dave Guess, grandfather of dog attack victim . Kieron Guess . ‘It would be hard for Keiron to come back here after what has gone on - he would be terrified,' said Dave. ‘Something needs to be done. We still don’t know whether the owner will be allowed to keep his other dog yet. ‘But this should never have happened in the first place - the dog had bitten people, including a police officer, and other dogs before. ‘It just does not seem right that no-one will be prosecuted - I saw my grandson get ripped to pieces by that dog. He has massive scars across his face.’ Kieron's other grandfather Shaun Leonard, 46, said the boy looked like he had been 'thrown to a pack of wolves'. Mauled: Kieron Guess is critically ill in an induced coma after undergoing surgery for seven hours . He said: ‘The dog took his left ear off and bit off most of his nose. His left eye was hanging out. ‘He has injuries from his forehead . right down to his chin. There were holes in his face. The dog also took a . chunk out of the back of his head.’ Speaking today, Chief Inspector Keith Ewart, of Wiltshire Police, . based in Swindon, explained why the dog's owner would not be charged. He said: 'Our thoughts are with Keiron and his family at . what must be a particularly traumatic time and everyone at Wiltshire . Police wishes Keiron a speedy recovery. 'We can confirm that this incident happened in a privately owned garden in Swanage Walk in the Moredon area of the town. 'Any investigation must remain within the framework of the law and in . this case the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 does not apply because the dog was . on private premises at the time of the incident. 'In this case the animal was voluntarily surrendered to the police and . was examined and found to be a Staffordshire bull terrier. 'It is not illegal to own a Staffordshire bull terrier. However the dog was destroyed with the full consent of the owner. 'Wiltshire Police continue to make enquiries into all aspects of this incident. Mr Leonard said yesterday that Kieron was 'on the mend' in Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, where Keiron's parents,  Stacey, 22, and . Anthony, 23, have been at his bedside. Medics have been tentatively waking the youngster and letting him move around . before returning him to sleep. Mr Leonard said: 'He’s on the mend I think and he’s starting to move. They are waking him up, letting him move and putting him back down. 'Keiron’s . got swelling on his face but its starting to go down. The doctors are . saying they don’t want him to get an infection. Owner: Neighbour Garfield King outside his home . 'They are also saying . he’s got fluid on his lungs - it’s a bit of blood but that’s . understandable after what he’s been through. 'Everything we hear now is just a worry.' Keiron’s family believe the youngster may have wandered through an open gate into Mr King's property, from an alleyway next to their home. Mr King said: ‘If you’re a parent you have to look after your children 24 hours a day. 'If it wasn’t a dog it could have been a paedophile.’ Mr King's son Jonathan said as he clashed with Dave Guess: ‘I have come up from London to defend my dad. 'He is in a bad way at the moment - he has grandkids himself. ‘We are very apologetic to the family of the child - he is the most important thing right now. 'But the dogs were in the garden and the child has strayed into the garden.’ Wiltshire Police said no arrests had been made. In September . last year, a police team raided Mr King’s address, and an officer was . bitten by a dog after the animal had been Tasered. It is believed that the police officer who went to the house after the . mauling of Keiron was the same police officer who was bitten on the hand by the dog last year. During the raid a local newspaper . photographer took a photograph of two dogs jumping at the glass door. It . is not known if the picture features the dog which attacked Keiron. Dangerous: One of the two Staffordshire bull terriers kept by the Guess family's neighbours is to be destroyed after Kieron was attacked . After the raid, Police Constable Mark Giles from . Wiltshire Police said: ‘The owner was trying to  control the two of them . but they were trying to fight each other and get at us. ‘I had to deploy my Taser to try to prevent them from attacking but one leapt up and bit me even after I hit it in the mouth.’ Speaking about this incident, Chief Inspector Ewart, of Wiltshire Police, added: 'We can confirm that we attended the address where the incident happened . in September 2011 and two dogs were subsequently examined to determine . whether they were illegally bred. 'A qualified expert examined both dogs and found that they were . Staffordshire bull terriers and that the owners were lawfully in . possession. 'No offences were revealed in relation to these dogs.' Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, if a . dog bites someone while on its owner’s property, police are not . required to take action unless the injury is severe or the dog is . thought to be a danger to others.

Yesterday’s vicious storms may have wiped out some of the unbearable heat, but it also took something else with it – Amazon’s Cloud Service. The Elastic Compute Cloud in Northern Virginia, which hosts several popular services including Netflix streaming movies, social photo app Instagram, and virtual pinboard Pinterest, succumbed to the storm last night, leaving thousands without their services. With winds of up to 90mph, millions of homes across Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. were without power, dealing with scorching temperatures, torrential rain, and few social media applications with which to pass the time. No movies: Netflix users were unable to stream TV shows and movies while the popular internet service was down following a power outage in Northern Virginia . Quirky problem: 'Fun and quirky' photo sharing site Instagram was also down, and tweted apologies for the technical difficulties . Down and out: Social pinboard site Pinterest was also down because of Amazon's Cloud outage . Severe thunder and lightning also had a role in taking away high-tech entertainment for D.C.-area residents. All three companies posted messages to their official Twitter feeds after the outage. VentureBeat reported that the Netflix technical support handle tweeted: ‘We’re aware that some members are experiencing issues streaming movies and TV shows. We’re working to resolve the problem.’ Instragram Support also noted: ‘We’re currently experiencing technical difficulties and we’re working to correct the issues. Thanks for your patience.’ Around 8:40pm last night, engineers said they had restored power to the Amazon dashboard, but continued to post throughout the night that they were making slow headway into restoring the three services. As of Saturday morning, service to Netflix and Pinterest had been restored, but Instagram was still down. A capitol mess: Storm-damaged trees litter the east lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington June 30 after wind gusts clocked at speeds of up to 79 mph . Uprooted: The high winds uprooted several trees in the American University neighborhood of Washington, DC, after the violent storm swept though the area . Massive clean-up: Tree branches lie near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Dupont Circle in D.C. following the storm; as many as four people are dead and 1.5million without power . Disappointed users took to social media to express their often hyperbolic outrage. One Twitter user wrote: ‘No instagram and no Netflix. I’m having a panic attack.’ Another cheeky user wrote: ‘My thoughts and prayers are with @Instagram, @Netflix, and @Pinterest. #RIP #NeverForget. By Saturday morning, however, the three services had been restored to normal. However, residents along the Eastern Seaboard aren’t in the clear yet. According to NBC Washington, four people were killed – two from fallen trees and another two by severe heat. And the mercury is expected to climb to the triple-digits again today. Officials continue to warning residents over the extreme danger that high temperatures post. During heat waves, it is highly recommend to drink plenty of water, stay indoors with the air conditioning or fan on if possible, wear cool, loose, clothing, and watch for signs of heat stroke.

The FBI has publicly admitted that they had radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in custody when he returned to America in 2002 but let him go. An American-born al Qaeda cleric, second only to Osama bin Laden on the world's most-wanted list, al-Awlaki was eventually killed in Yemen last September during a US drone strike. Despite being named a major threat by the head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service and the first American to become one of the CIA’s top targets, the FBI released him from custody after detaining him at JFK Airport in October 2002. CIA top target: Radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was in US custody in 2002 but was allowed to walk free but the FBI have offered no explanation why . al-Awlaki, who had lived in London and thought to be behind several al Qaeda terrorist plots, had become the public face of the Islamic terrorist organisation in the wake of bin Laden's death. Former FBI agents said there are two . possible explanations for al-Awlaki’s abrupt release in 2002. That the FBI . wanted to track him for intelligence or that the bureau wanted to work . with him as a contact. The . ‘global terrorist’ was detained at JFK Airport in New York City after . the customs database identified an outstanding arrest warrant. Detained but let go: The 'global terrorist' al-Awlaki was detained at JFK Airport in New York in 2002 . Mark . Giuliano, the FBI’s assistant director for national security told an . enquiry yesterday that there had been conversations between an FBI agent . and the US attorney in Colorado about al-Awlaki’s re-entry into the . country and the warrant. He said: ‘Yes, sir, there was a dialogue, as there always will be. ‘If . a case agent has a case on somebody that is coming into the country, . the system is triggered and set up so that there will be a call to that . case agent.’ But Mr Giulano . could not explain how the FBI knew of the terrorist’s return to America . nor the reasons why he was allowed to walk free from custody. No explanation: Mark Giuliano, the FBI's assistant director for national security could not explain how the FBI knew al-Awlaki was returning to the US or why he was allowed to walk free from custody . At a hearing yesterday into the Webster report into the bureau’s intelligence failures leading up to the Fort Hood massacre, in which Major Nidal Hasan was accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in Texas, links were made between Hasan and Al-Awlaki. In an exchange of 19 emails Hasan told al-Awlaki . that he advocated using suicide bombers and that he believed it was OK . to kill civilians to which al-Awlaki replied that Hasan should keep his . contact details handy. Republican . Rep Frank Wolf, chairman of the committee that oversees the FBI said at . a hearing: ‘I really want to get to the bottom (of this)’ according to Fox News. ‘We’re . going to send a letter on this. If we can, we’re going to get a . hearing, and if we have to, we may even subpoena the thing.’ Terrorist links: al-Awlaki (left) was thought to be behind several al Qaeda terrorist plots and was linked to other terrorist such as Major Nidal Hasan (right) who is accused of killing 13 in the Fort Hood massacre . al-Awlaki was being held when FBI agent Wade Ammerman told customs agents that ‘the warrant…had been pulled back’ but documents show that the warrant was still active at that time and was only relinquished later that day. The bureau has always maintained that . the case against al-Awlaki was weak and the pulling back of his arrest . warrant was coincidental with the day he returned to America. 9/11: al-Awlaki was linked to the some of the September 11 hijackers and became the public face of al Qaeda in the wake of bin Laden's death . Why he was able to walk free when scores of Muslim men were held in detention centres on material witness warrants in the wake of September 11 attacks has never been explained by the FBI. The terrorist has also been linked to September 11 hijackers, and was widely believed to be the mastermind behind a number of terror atrocities, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and inspired attacks by Muslims inside the United States including the Fort Hood massacre. Mr Giuliano said: ‘If a prosecutor at that time, regardless of whether a call was made or not, looks at the evidence and decided there was not enough to be able to arrest that individual, the warrant would be dropped. ‘I assure you ... if we could have incarcerated al-Awlaki, we would have.’ But past and present investigators have said that once a warrant is signed off by a federal judge, it is not routine to review it. They have also questioned why an exemption was made for a person who under an FBI investigation because of his links to September 11 hijackers. Mr Giuliano said the FBI will make a decision within 60 to 90 days, based on the findings of the report by former FBI and CIA director William Webster.","Global terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki was detained but let go in 2002 the FBI have publicly admitted .

But exam board AQA insists the guidelines were clear and it had . no choice but to disqualify all the participants. Mr Pearmain said: ‘It was a bad mistake and I have . personally apologised to the students affected by it and also to their parents. ‘The school, very unusually, made a mistake and it is a . terrible mistake on exam entries. ‘But one thing to understand - and I will keep apologising . to school pupils and parents - as it happens it will not disadvantage any of . those students in their future. ‘That is a bit of good news.’ Students were told they were allowed to refer to their copy of Eden Close by Anita Shreve during their English exam .

In a letter sent out to parents, Mr Pearmain, said: ‘I am . very sorry to report that a serious mistake was made by the English department . and the students were led to believe they were allowed to take their texts into . the exam. ‘This was not the case and as a result AQA took the decision . to disqualify all candidates who were entered for Unit 2. ‘This means the students will be awarded a grade for their .

Anxious: Tomos James, 11, has been refused a free bus pass even though police say it is unsafe for him to walk to school . A young boy faces a daily three-mile walk through drug dens after being refused a bus pass as he lives just 80 yards too close to his school. Tomos James, 11, has been refused the free  pass even though police say it is unsafe for him to walk to school. Instead, his daily trek will take him through a forest, drug dens, a waste-ground full of burned-out cars and areas classified as 'anti-social'. His anxious mother Ruth, 41, is campaigning for education chiefs to give Tomos free transport when he starts at high school in September. A confidential letter from police spelling out the dangers to council transport chiefs has been leaked by campaigners. A senior officer said in the letter: 'I have advised Mrs James that this is not a safe route for her child to walk. 'This section is one in which we deal with a number of anti-social problems including cars being burnt out, drug misuse, motor cycle annoyance and assaults. 'During the winter months children would have to walk along the forest path in darkness at times when there are not many people around.' Tomos, of Bonymaen, Swansea, lives too close to Bryntawe School to qualify for the school bus. Swansea Council said children qualified for free transport if they live more than three miles along an available walking route to their school of choice. But Tomos’s house is exactly 260ft inside the three-mile boundary. His father Peter, 43, said: 'We are outside the area by about 80 yards but to get to school it means Tomos will have to walk through a forest. 'Another part of the route takes him through a very rough area where all the street lights have been smashed and there’s drug paraphernalia all around. 'It is dangerous - I’m scared he may get mugged for his mobile phone. 'The council thinks its alright for a boy of 11 to walk all that way through an unsafe area - I say it’s not acceptable. Unsafe: Tomos's daily three mile trek will take him through a . forest, drug dens, a waste-ground full of burned-out cars and areas . classified as 'anti-social' by police who say it's not safe for him to walk alone . 'They are not concerned about the children’s personal safety, just road safety, as long as they are not walking near traffic they don’t care.' The James’s have four children with another one due in October. A Swansea Council spokesman said: 'We understand the frustration of parents whose homes fall outside of the qualifying boundary for free transport to school. Route: Tomos's route to school is three miles long and has been deemed 'unsafe' by police but the council say he still doesn't qualify for free home to school transport which has frustrated his parents . 'Following the concerns raised by Tomos’ parents, council officers have been on site and carried out a full review of the walking route. 'The assessment is based on a child being accompanied as appropriate by an adult, not a lone child. 'As a result the route does meet the criteria as an available route which means Tomos does not qualify for free home to school transport.'","Tomos James will have to walk through a forest, drug dens and a waste-ground full of burned out cars to school .

European Central Bank head Mario Draghi says the bank is ready to intervene in the bond market to drive down countries' high borrowing rates, and urged European leaders to get their bailout fund ready to intervene as well. Draghi said today the bank could buy bonds if the borrowing rates stop the ECB in its efforts to spread its low interest rates throughout the 17 countries that use the currency. Such a move could, crucially, lower the borrowing rates that are threatening to push Spain and Italy into financial disaster. Mario Draghi said today the bank could buy bonds if the borrowing rates stop the ECB in its efforts to spread its low interest rates throughout the 17 countries that use the currency . At a meeting earlier today Draghi . indicated that any ECB intervention would start at the earliest in . September and would depend on countries in trouble on bond markets . making a request and accepting strict conditions and supervision. He also indicated that German central . bank chief Jens Weidmann had expressed reservations about bond-buying . and further efforts would be needed to persuade the Bundesbank before a . final vote to take action. At a news conference following the . central bank's monthly meeting, Draghi said the bank would consider . other 'non-standard' measures to rein in the euro zone crisis. 'The Governing Council, within its . mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in . observance of its independence in determining monetary policy, may . undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach . its objective,' Draghi said after the bank kept euro zone interest rates . at a record low 0.75 percent. The bank has already spent 210 billion . euros buying bonds under its now dormant Securities Markets Programme . (SMP) since May 2010, with limited impact, but Draghi said the new . effort would be different in scope and conditionality. Any new ECB action was conditional on euro zone governments using their EFSF and ESM bail out funds first, he said. Calling for action: U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the euro zone must cut borrowing costs . 'Governments must stand ready to . activate the ESM/EFSF in the bond market when exceptional financial . market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist,' he said. Financial markets seemed underwhelmed . by the announcements, with some investors having interpreted Draghi's . comments last week as a sign of imminent rather than future and . conditional action. Draghi said all members of the Governing Council endorsed today's statement with one exception - a reference to Bundsbank president Jens Weidmann . 'It is quite disappointing ... There . is a lack of any action so he has basically passed the buck back on to . politicians,' said Ioan Smith, strategist at Knight Capital. German bund futures extended gains, a . sign of investors seeking safety, and the euro fell by more than one . cent to below $1.22 at 1330 GMT. Other countries, especially the United States, have sought to raise pressure on the ECB to act over the Euro crisis. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the euro zone must take steps to bring down borrowing costs in troubled member states. His comments in London last Thursday . that the ECB would do whatever it takes within its mandate to protect . the currency bloc from collapse - 'and believe me, it will be enough' - . had already eased tensions on the debt markets. Other countries, especially the . United States, have raised pressure on the ECB to act as the . two-and-a-half year old euro zone crisis weighs on global growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve dashed . expectations among some investors on Wednesday by taking no immediate . new measures to revive the economy. The Fed stopped short of offering new . monetary stimulus, though it signalled more strongly that further bond . buying could be in store to help a U.S. economic recovery that it said . had lost momentum this year. The future is bleak: Experts warn of months of uncertainty for the euro zone . ECB action, meanwhile, is hamstrung by . EU rules forbidding it from financing governments. The ECB issued a . legal opinion in March 2011 ruling out perhaps the biggest gun, giving . the ESM bailout fund rights to tap the ECB for funds to increase its . firepower. The ECB also has to find a way to get . any measures past Germany, the euro zone's largest economy and its . principal paymaster. The Bundesbank issues regular reminders of . inflationary dangers stemming from non-standard measures such as bond . purchases and the limits central banks face. Draghi said all members of the . Governing Council endorsed Thursday's statement with one exception - a . reference to Bundsbank president Jens Weidmann. 'The decision to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro as a stable currency has been unanimous,' Draghi said. 'It's clear and it's known that . (Germany's) Bundesbank have their reservations about the programme of . buying bonds. The idea is we now have the guidance, the monetary policy . committee, the risk committee and the markets committee will work on . this guidance and then (we) will take a final decision and the votes . will be counted.' His wording suggested he was prepared to outvote the German central banker if necessary.","Mario Draghi: ECB could buy bonds if the borrowing rates stop its efforts to spread its low interest rates throughout the 17 countries that use the currency .

The widow of a businessman gunned down outside a suburban preschool in Atlanta, Georgia was charged in the slaying Thursday, accused of conspiring with the gunman who was convicted four months ago. Andrea Sneiderman, 36, was charged with malice murder, criminal attempt to commit murder, racketeering, perjury and insurance fraud. The case has captured a national audience ever since the woman's lover, Hemy Neuman, told jurors at the time of his trial that he was convinced that he should kill his lover's husband Russell Sneiderman by an angel in a dream who supposedly looked like actress Olivia Newton John. Charged: Andrea Sneiderman, 36, was faces counts of malice murder, criminal attempt to commit murder, racketeering, perjury and insurance fraud relating to the murder of her husband Russell . The prosecutor declined to answer questions about the evidence against Sneiderman, but the 19-page indictment alleged that she conspired with Neuman, who was her boss at the time of the slaying. 'Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman conspired together to murder Rusty Sneiderman so that they could enjoy a life together, eliminate Neuman's debt problems and fully benefit from the assets the Sneidermans had acquired as well as the proceeds of Rusty Sneiderman's life insurance policies,' the indictment said. The indictment also alleged Andrea Sneiderman gave Neuman her husband's schedule 'so that Neuman could kill Rusty Sneiderman.' Sneiderman's attorneys issued a statement reiterating her innocence and promising a vigorous defense 'to ensure that Andrea is fully exonerated of these false accusations.' Lovers turned fighters: Andrea Sneiderman (left) was apparently having an affair with her then-boss Hemy Neuman (right) when he shot and killed her husband Rusty . Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare. His wife, Andrea, right, was just arrested for her alleged part in the murder . Her attorneys include J. Tom Morgan, who spent 12 years as the DeKalb County district attorney. The Sneiderman family said in a statement that Thursday's arrest brought no joy but called it 'another important step in pursuit of justice for Rusty.' Prosecutors said they presented a case to a grand jury Thursday morning, and jurors returned the indictment less than two hours later. When asked why prosecutors were pursuing the case now, the district attorney said: 'Now is because we are ready now. If we were ready three months ago, it would have been three months ago. If it was last year when we charged Mr. Neuman, it would have been then.' Unusual urgings: During his trial, Neuman said that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it, as did a demon who sounded like Barry White . Happier times: Relatives of Rusty Sneiderman (right) said that they long-suspected Andrea (left) was involved with his murder . Sneiderman was arrested at a home in . Putnam County and was being held without bond. Details of an initial . court appearance were not immediately available. Earlier, WSB-TV aired footage of Sneiderman dressed in khaki shorts and a long-sleeve shirt surrounded by law enforcement officials as she left the house, was handcuffed and placed in a patrol car. During Neuman's trial, prosecutors suggested Andrea Sneiderman was a 'co-conspirator' in the slaying, goading a love-struck Neuman into killing her husband, perhaps for a $2million life insurance policy. Neuman also told mental health examiners he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John. The angel ordered him to fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview. Andrea Sneiderman repeatedly denied an affair and denied knowing anything about the shooting. After the trial, Neuman's defense attorneys and Russell Sneiderman's family said they hoped that prosecutors would investigate Andrea Sneiderman in the killing. At the time, Russell Sneiderman's brother, Steve, said the family long suspected Andrea was involved in his death, and the trial only confirmed their suspicions.","Andrea Sneiderman is charged with helping her lover murder her husband .

A narcotics squad on a drugs bust . found the woman locked in a room where they believe she may have been . kept for up to ten years. The third-floor apartment of Michael Mendez, 41, was being searched because he has strong links to the violent Latin Kings street gang. A police spokesman told MailOnline that based on evidence at the scene, detectives believed that the woman had been locked in the room on and off for at least two years -  and potentially up to a decade.

Primary sources of income include street dealing of cocaine, heroin and marijuana. The gang's colours are black/gold with tattoos and graffiti consisting of five or three-point crowns. Last year, 15 gang members or associates of the Latin Kings - including two Chicago police officers - were indicted in an alleged racketeering conspiracy that resulted in 19 murders. Mendez was charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and other counts related to drugs. He pleaded not guilty in court today and remains held on $1 million bail.

Britain's Paralympic poster girls are already being lined up for lucrative sponsorship contracts ahead of the London 2012 Games. Female athletes could earn up to £100,000 in sponsorship and media deals, echoing the success of Olympians such as Jessica Ennis and Victoria Pendleton. During previous Games, less than a dozen of the most successful Paralympians are thought to have landed deals with major sponsors. But experts said the London 2012 Paralympics, which begins on Wednesday, is about to change all that. High hopes: Sprinter and long jumper Stefanie Reid (left) and track and road cyclist Sarah Storey . Golden moments: Torchbearer Simon Richardson lights the Paralympics Cauldron outside City Hall in Cardiff, left, and wheelchair basketball player Amy Conroy warms up for the Games on the court, right . Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, said he expected up to a dozen British Paralympians to reach £100,000 in revenue, if they achieved gold medal success in the next two weeks. While it is still a long way off the £5million that heptathlete Ennis is anticipated to earn over the next few months, it does reflect the surging level of interest in the Paralympics. Mr Currie said: ‘Paralympians will benefit hugely from the success of the Olympics. ‘For many, it will be the first time they have experienced such high media coverage or been offered big sponsorship deals. ‘In previous Paralympics Games, only a . handful have attracted high levels of sponsorship, but now quite a few . have the chance to make a lot of money.’ Track cyclist and seven-times Paralympic gold medallist Sarah Storey, 34, is said to be top of the list. Spirit of champions: The official Paralympics GB team photo, featuring all 600 athletes and staff . Another athlete expected to do well is ‘blade runner’ Stefanie Reid, 27, who lost part of a leg in a speedboat accident. Mr . Currie said: ‘Sponsors will always look for the glamorous competitors, . but they will also look for those who have faced the hardest challenges . to get to the Paralympics or for the biggest personalities. 'As with the . Olympics, it is not just about medals, it is about the story behind the . athletes and stand-out characters. ‘But . unlike the Olympics, where the big names were already known, the . sponsors may sit back and wait to see who does well or who captures the . public’s imagination before they offer the big sponsorship deals.’ Here, the Daily Mail profiles the athletes who are likely to become the British golden girls of the 2012 Paralympics: . Rowers Pamela Relph and Naomi Riches – nicknamed the 'two blondes in a boat' – will compete in the mixed coxed fours and are strong medal contenders. Relph, 22, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, started rowing after her career in the Army was cut short by worsening arthritis which had affected her from the age of seven. Her 24-year-old sister Monica, a British rower, encouraged her to try out for the Paralympics rowing squad. Write caption here . Teamwork: The pair rowing in the mixed coxed fours. Relph says she 'cannot wait' for the Games to begin . She said: 'It was really strange for me when they said I classified for the Paralympics. I didn't really feel like I was disabled, because I had probably made the assumption that you need to be in a wheelchair or have had a limb amputated. 'Within a week of being discharged from the military I was qualified as a Paralympic athlete.' Relph, who is in the minimal disability boat, said she 'cannot wait' for the Games to begin. But she added: 'As a rower, you don't drink, you go to bed early and you have to eat really cleanly. 'I have been teetotal for five months and have about three bottles of champagne in my fridge waiting to be cracked open after the Games, whatever the outcome.' Riches, 29, a partially sighted jewellery designer, said: 'In 2004 GB needed girls in the Paralympics crew and I ticked all the boxes – I was quite tall, I had tried rowing at college and I was visually impaired. 'Four months later I went to my first world championship. I absolutely took to it and got hooked on the sport.' Wheelchair basketball player Amy Conroy, 19, had her leg amputated after she was diagnosed with cancer at 13. Conroy, . whose mother Ann died from cancer aged 40, was given a 50/50 chance of . survival and, after her leg was amputated, had gruelling chemotherapy. Her teacher father Chris stayed . with her every day for a year at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.

But then I saw it and loved it. It was fast and vicious!’ Survivor: Wheelchair basketball player Amy Conroy, who lost a leg after contracting cancer as a child . 'I'm going to keep pushing myself': Sarah Storey, who has won Paralympic gold in both swimming and cycling . Track and road cyclist Sarah Storey, 34, who was born with no left hand, has won seven gold medals across both swimming and cycling. She first competed in the Paralympics in swimming aged only 14, winning two golds, three silvers and a bronze medal on her debut. Over the next 12 years she won hordes of medals at every single Games. She was always curious about cycling and, after developing an ear infection in 2005, used the break from swimming to try out the velodrome. Her husband, track cyclist Barney Storey, encouraged her when he noticed she had a natural talent for the sport. She loved it and dropped swimming, going on to win two more golds at the 2008 Beijing Games. She said: 'I officially switched to cycling at the end of 2005 and as Barney is such an expert, it helped me become better quickly because he could tell me straight away if I was doing something wrong. His advice and support were crucial.' At this Paralympics she will compete in four events – two on the road and two on the track – and is expected to win medals in all of them. She and her 34-year-old husband, an able-bodied cyclist who will be a pilot rider for partially sighted Neil Fachie in the Paralympics, admit they are 'sporting anoraks'. They spend their days off watching Manchester United or going for long walks at their home in Disley, near Manchester. Storey narrowly missed out on competing in the women's team pursuit during the Olympics, in which Dani King, Jo Rowsell and Laura Trott won gold, but has not given up hope of making it into the Olympic squad for the Rio 2016 games. She said: 'I'm just going to keep pushing myself as an athlete. If I'm good enough and I get selected, that will be fantastic.' The cyclist already has four major sponsors and 13 corporate 'partners'. Sprinter and long jumper Stefanie .

A 'pastor' who took up to $1,000 from trusting parents for the promise of activity-filled holiday camps for their children allegedly concocted the bogus service. Dejean Gathers is alleged to have duped as many as 40 unsuspecting parents who arrived at one of seven centres across New York and New Jersey to drop off their children safe in the knowledge they would be enjoying themselves in the capable hands of the pastor and his teams. But they found no one waiting for them and nothing organised, while at the same time being out of pocket and with teary-eyed children to look after during the school holidays. The children and their parents had been promised trips to theme parks like Six Flags, which has water rides, pictured, and entertainment . According to the New York Post, Gathers, from Atlanta, claims to be a pastor at the Prophetic Promise Cathedral Church in Atlanta. The Brooklyn District Attorney's Office is now investigating a flood of complaints from angry parents. The parents said they found and paid for the service, branded as 'Camp Vision Now', via an online coupon website called Living Social. More... Doctor who?

They enroled their children to one of five camps which promised trips to theme parks, including Six Flags, which has water-parks, amusement centres and rides, and Chuck E Cheese, a pizza chain with kids games and entertainment. They were directed to drop off their children on the first day at a specified nearby centre, which included three churches, two schools, a hotel and a ballroom in locations in Brooklyn, The Bronx and New Jersey. It wasn't until that moment that they discovered they had been allegedly scammed. The summer camp also said the children would be dining at family entertainment restaurants like Chuck E Cheese . 'I felt so bad because they said they paid $800 or $1,000 for their children to be here all summer and there was no camp,' said an employee at one of the bogus drop-off sites, St. Anthony’s Baptist Church in Crown Heights, quoted in the NY Post. However, the report says Gather did staff one centre, the ballroom in Crown Heights, with three counsellors — but the city Health Department eventually issued him with a cease-and-desist order because he didn’t have any permits for the disorganised gathering. Prior to the City's intervention, somewhat confused and bewildered kids were herded into libraries or led on aimless walks around Brooklyn to kill time. According to the NY Post, Gathers pleaded guilty in 2010 to advertising occupied apartments for rent in The Bronx and keeping deposit money from unsuspecting victims. He also pleaded guilty to larceny charges in Georgia in June 2011 and was sentenced to a year of probation. He did not respond to repeated calls for comment.

Willie 'Slick' Parks, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, has now handed himself into the authorities and is being held in custody on aggravated assault charges. Police say 28-year-old Parks beat up his girlfriend after an argument over the clothes she was wearing to a Downtown bar and the fact that men had been complimenting her appearance. 'Aggravated assault': Willie 'Slick' Parks allegedly refused to let his girlfriend see a doctor after the alleged attack . She said he then refused to let her visit a doctor for days.

A brave homeowner hit a late night intruder over the head with a hammer as he faced 'every householder’s worst nightmare'. Darren McGirr, from Stockton, in Teeside, took the extreme measure to defend his property when burglar Mark Chesney threatened to stab him with a knife. After confronting the Chesney in the hallway, fast-thinking Mr McGirr managed to apprehend the intruder and hold him at the property until the police arrived. Teeside Crown Court had heard that Mr . McGirr's girlfriend Kirsty Lowery screamed as she was awoken by a noise . in the early hours of November 9 last year. Mr McGirr then grabbed a hammer, which he kept by his bed. He challenged the hoodie-wearing criminal and the court was told that Chesney, 30, told him 'I'm not here for you. I'm in the wrong house.' Chesney later told police he had not entered Mr . McGirr's flat with the intention to steal, but because he wrongly . thought it was his friend’s home where he’d been drinking that evening. Mr McGirr said Chesney claimed he was carrying a knife in a hand he had hidden behind his back and threatened to stab him. In response, Mr McGirr said he told Ms Lowery to get a hunting knife, but the burglar tried to escape by darting into the kitchen before kicking out a window and trying to escape. Determined not to see the assailant get away Mr McGirr and Ms Lowery managed to grab him, but when Chesney lunged at Mr McGirr with a knife Mr McGirr struck him over the head with the hammer. The court heard that Ms Lowery also hit the burglar with a piece of wood and when police arrived at the flat they found Chesney dangling half way out of the window, still struggling to break free. Teeside Crown Court heard that after confronting Chesney in the hallway fast-thinking Mr McGirr managed to apprehend the intruder and hold him at the property until the police arrived . After he was finally arrest he was . taken to hospital under police escort and was found to have suffered a . depressed skull fracture. Prosecutor Michael Bosomworth told the Court that Mr McGirr suffered 'every householder’s worst nightmare'. Referring . to his actions Mr McGirr told jurors: 'I didn’t want it to escalate any . further. I made him aware if I wanted to hurt him I could already have . done. Chesney is now serving a six-and-a-half-year sentence for the raid on Mr McGirr’s home and two other burglaries. The jury heard Ms Lowery’s three-minute 999 call where the men argued in the background. Mr McGirr was heard saying: 'Put the knife down... Put it down or you’re going to get it again. Stay down.' He said he was never armed with a knife but pretended to have one and threatened to stab Mr McGirr if he swung the hammer and he showed the jury the 'dent' in his head. A jury convicted him of burglary, but cleared him of perverting the course of justice after he had given a false name. He was also cleared of attempting to wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Five days before this burglary, he stole items from a shed from a shed and a house in Billingham. He was convicted of these burglaries after a separate trial in June. Tom Mitchell, defending, said: 'It’s rare to see a burglar get a degree of rough justice meted out to him.' The judge, Recorder Henry Prosser, said the burglary at Mr McGirr’s home must have been 'terrifying and appalling' for the victims.","Burglar Mark Chesney had threatened to stab Darren McGirr with a knife .

When you consider the likes of Dirty Den, Pat Butcher and the Mitchell brothers, the Bible isn’t quite the first thing that springs to mind. But according to one of the producers on EastEnders, that’s exactly where the gritty soap gets many of its storylines from. Jenny Robins, who oversees future plots on the long-running drama, yesterday revealed it is regularly inspired by the Bible, citing the stories of David and Goliath, Sodom and Gomorrah and Samson and Delilah as prototypes for the show. From the Bible: Angie and 'Dirty' Den Watts in EastEnders which programme-maker Jenny Robins admitted uses stories from the Bible . She admitted the BBC show’s creators scoured the holy book for ‘amazing stories’ which were used as ‘source material, the whole time’. Long-serving – and long-suffering – characters such as Dot Cotton or Pat Butcher, it was implied, were likely to bear a resemblance to Moses or Job. Perhaps more astonishingly, Miss Robins claimed it was used like the Bible to ‘look for lessons in how to live’. And, in a rather odd comment given that the show is well-known for its violent plots, she said soaps ‘founder’ when they try to introduce murder, mayhem and violence into a domestic setting. The claims will provoke critics of the . BBC, who have in the past expressed annoyance at its negative portrayal . of Christian characters. Moses or Job: Long-serving characters such as Dot Cotton, right, and Pat Butcher, left, were implied to resemble Moses or Job from the Bible . In 2010, the corporation was hit with complaints of bias over the portrayal of EastEnders’ murderous pastor Lucas Johnson, who was obsessed with the Bible. Yet Miss Robins likened the soap’s plots to ‘parables’ offering ‘hope and morality’ and said: ‘EastEnders slays all before it when it is moral to its core. The good are rewarded, the bad are punished, plausibly. A hero is cruelly, arbitrarily tested but refuses to give in or surrender. ‘That could be a description of EastEnders or the book of Job.’ Speaking at the BBC’s Re:Think festival in Salford she said: ‘The prototype of every EastEnders story can be traced back to one source. ‘The same story shapes, all of them present in the Bible, occur again and again and again.’ She said viewers wanted to see the archetypes of biblical stories presented ‘in a manner we understand’ which was ‘easily digestible’ and ‘relevant’. ‘In EastEnders alone the biblical parallels are almost too numerous to mention,’ she said.

Hit out: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has hit out at discrimination against older women . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has hit out at discrimination against older women, warning it was leading to a generation of ‘passive participants’ in public life. Miss Harman, who is also shadow culture secretary, said many viewers were females of a certain age who themselves ‘don’t want to be written out of the public domain’. Speaking at Edinburgh Television Festival at the weekend she said it was ‘offensive and wrong’ that women were made invisible ‘because you are past your reproductive age’. She said the treatment of Arlene Phillips, the former Strictly Come Dancing judge, who was dumped off the show, was ‘symbolic’, adding ‘something needs to be done about it’. The Labour MP said the ‘discrimination’ against older women did not apply to older men who kept working and were treated as ‘venerable, experienced and sage’. The BBC has been the focus of controversy about the treatment of older women in broadcasting in recent years, with former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly winning an ageism case against the corporation last year and the earlier row over ditching Miss Phillips from Strictly. Earlier this year BBC director general Mark Thompson admitted there were not enough older women on television. The soon-to-leave chief admitted the corporation had a ‘case to answer’ over the lack of female presenters - especially in ‘iconic roles’ and there were ‘manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the BBC’. Broadcasting veterans such as Anna Ford, Selina Scott and Joan Bakewell have been among many female voices who have attacked the treatment of women on TV. Criticism has included the fact that older male performers such as David Dimbleby are allowed to carry on into their later year, unlike many of their female counterparts. Tackling inequality: Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly (left) with Camilla Palmer, a discrimination expert who won an ageism case against the BBC . Miss Harman’s comments came as she appeared at a ‘Question Time’ session at the TV festival. A member of the audience asked if in the wake of the Miriam O’Reilly case whether people were ‘too obsessed’ about gender and age on TV. The long-serving politician said ‘no’ and replied: ‘The reality is that there is a particular form of discrimination against older women which doesn’t apply to older men who are regarded as venerable, experienced, sage and doesn’t apply to younger women but uniquely applies to older women. ‘I think that what we have got in this country is a new generation of older women who have done things very differently from their mothers, played a different role in the family, played a different role in the workplace, have had different educational aspirations. Women in broadcasting: The sacking of women such as Arlene Phillips (pictured with other judges on Strictly Come Dancing) was 'symbolic' of the discrimination Harman said . ‘The idea that you have to be written out of the public domain because you are past your reproductive age is really offensive and wrong. The whole thing about Arlene Phillips as well was very symbolic and actually it needs to be addressed.’ She added: ‘A lot of people watching the BBC are older women themselves who don’t want to be written out of the public domain and if you look across the senior positions the idea that you have got a country where you have got younger women and older men, but otherwise older women have just got to be passive participants, it is not the reality and something needs to be done about it definitely.’ At the same event she attacked Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond for unrealistic proposals to split up the BBC.","Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman warns that discrimination against older women leads to a generation of 'passive participants' in public life .

It was around 8pm British time on Thursday that news broke of French magazine Closer's decision to publish topless pictures of Kate on holiday in Provence. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge smiles as she visits the Assyakirin Mosque in Kuala Lumpur today after news broke of French magazine Closer's decision to publish topless pictures of her on holiday in Provence . In Kuala Lumpur, where the Duke and Duchess were sleeping after a glittering royal banquet thrown in their honour, it was 3am. The initial reaction from royal aides at St James's Palace was cautious. Could the magazine be bluffing to beef up its readership? Were the pictures even real? When William and Kate rose around 6am in their suite at the High Commissioner's residence, it was up to their private secretary, former SAS officer Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton (backed up by Kate's Girl Friday, Rebecca Deacon, and their press secretary Miguel Head) to break the distressing news over breakfast of coffee and fresh fruit. The couple were shocked, horrified even, but remarkably calm. They agreed with their private office's suggestion to wait and see what the magazine had actually done. Even at this early stage, however, the similarities to the life of his late mother were almost too much to bear for William. 'This incident turns the clock back 15 years,' said a source close to the future king. Following the initial discussions there was little time for the royal party to dwell on the pictures. This was one of the busiest days of their nine-day tour on behalf of the Queen, with a visit to the As Syakirin Mosque in the centre of the Malaysian capital. They had obligations to fulfil. Looking eerily reminiscent of her husband's late mother, whom she has always spoken regretfully of never having had a chance to meet, the Duchess stepped out of her official car dressed in a pale grey dress and matching scarf by ethical label Belulah, run by the couple's great friend Lady Natasha Rufus Issacs.

There was time for a giggle together as the royal couple sat down on chairs to remove their shoes . By the time the couple made their way to a colourful cultural display at a central city park it was becoming clear the pictures did indeed appear to be genuine . There was even time for a laugh and giggle together as the royal couple sat down on chairs to remove their shoes, William struggling with his hand-made brogues as Kate kicked off her favourite LK Bennett nude heels and sat waiting in her stockinged feet. It was the first time that either of them had visited a mosque and they appeared genuinely interested in what they were being shown. Kate even let slip that her father-in-law, Prince Charles, who takes a particular interest in the Islamic faith, had given then something of a crash course. Behind the scenes, however, talks were already beginning between London and Paris as to how to tackle the scandal best. By the time the couple made their way to their next appointment, viewing a colourful cultural display at a nearby park to the cheers and screams of thousands of well-wishers, it was becoming clear the pictures did indeed appear to be genuine. Yet still Kate remained calm. Having by now shed her veil – displaying an intricate bun dotted with pearl-headed pins – she threw her head back and plunged into the crowds, shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries and accepting flowers. The couple went to a tea party at the British High Commission where among the celebrated guests were Malaysian-born shoe designer Jimmy Choo . And she failed to bat even an eyelid when, as they left, an overenthusiastic fan lunged in through the open door of their car to take a picture before being dragged off and handcuffed by police. Even when the pair went on to a business lunch, where William gave a speech, they appeared to be a couple without a care in the world. It was only in the privacy of their suite, as they changed afterwards in preparation for their fourth engagement of the day, that Kate's composure momentarily crumbled as she was shown the pictures that had by now hit the streets of Paris. William was said to be equally shaken. The intrusion quickly brought home the worst excesses of the paparazzi when his mother was alive. The Prince has done everything in his power to protect Kate from the same form of scrutiny and he quickly instructed his spokesman to make clear that their initial sadness had turned to anger and disbelief. 'We believe a red line has been crossed and we are consulting with French lawyers to see what, if any, action can be taken,' the aide said. Arriving at the city's airport a few minutes later for a flight to Borneo ¿ where they still had two more scheduled engagements before the end of the day ¿ the pair were struggling to hide their anger . With the support of his wife, father and the Queen William issued a statement condemning the photographer and magazine's 'grotesque and totally unjustifiable' invasion of their privacy . Keen not to disappoint their hosts, the couple went on to their next engagement, a tea party at the British High Commission where among the celebrated guests were Malaysian-born shoe designer Jimmy Choo, who waxed lyrical about the Duchess's beauty 'both inside and out'. Dressed in an ice blue lace dress by Alice Temperley, Kate's performance was as engaging as ever. In fact it was William – glowering every time he saw a photographer and constantly chewing his lip – who appeared to be feeling the strain. Within minutes of their departure he instructed his press team – with the support of his wife, father and the Queen – to issue a statement condemning the photographer and magazine's 'grotesque and totally unjustifiable' invasion of their privacy and indicating they would leave no stone unturned in seeking redress. Arriving at the city's airport a few minutes later for a flight to Borneo – where they still had two more scheduled engagements before the end of the day – the pair were struggling to hide their anger. Yet again, however, Kate's composure still shone through. She offered a small smile to waiting newsmen and, as the couple boarded their Boeing 737-800 jet, she reassuringly placed her hand on the small of her husband's back.

A Florida man’s love of social media has landed him behind bars after he bragged on Twitter about punching his neighbour. According to an arrest report, Brandon Michael Perry, of Naples, got into an argument with a neighbour about Perry's sister on October 25.

Lawyers acting on behalf of families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster will today write to the Attorney General demanding that new inquests be held in Liverpool. The Hillsborough Families Support Group (HFSG) met at Anfield yesterday to discuss the next step in its campaign for justice for the 96 victims of the 1989 disaster. High-profile lawyers for the campaign, Michael Mansfield QC and Lord Falconer, appeared via an internet videolink. Disaster: An injured fan is carried on a stretcher during the tragedy at Hillsborough in 1989. Families of the victims have demanded fresh inquests for their loved ones . The HFSG said it had instructed its . lawyers to send letters out to 'relevant parties', including the . Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, to 'ensure . that the machinery of the justice system is put into motion and the . families receive a fair hearing'. Following the three-and-a-half hour . meeting, Trevor Hicks and Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the HFSG, who . lost her son James, 18, in the tragedy, gave a statement to the media . in which they expressed their desire for the inquest verdicts to be . overturned and new inquests to be held in Liverpool. Mr Hicks, from Keighley, West . Yorkshire, who lost daughters Vicky, 15, and Sarah, 19, in the disaster, . said: 'This goes beyond Hillsborough. 'What was exposed on Wednesday was a . disgrace to the nation, not just the families...This goes across society . and it’s important for society at large not to let this rest.' Determined: Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters in the disaster, said it was 'important for society at large not to let this rest' The statement on behalf of the HFSG, . reads: 'The findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel have finally . vindicated the families in their 23-year struggle to establish the . truth. 'However, after truth must come justice. We have spoken today to our lawyers and taken initial advice. 'As the families have always believed . and insisted, it was the actions and inaction of those in authority . that caused the deaths at Hillsborough on April 15, 1989. 'The fans did not contribute to the . tragedy. Any blame previously laid at their door has been shown to be . part of a despicable conspiracy by those in authority to tarnish the . reputations of the dead, the survivors of the disaster and the people of . Liverpool. 'This conspiracy has been revealed for what it is; a bid to avoid accountability. 'Those responsible can avoid accountability no longer.' The HFSG says there are now three avenues which it will 'rigorously follow' in the search for justice: . new inquests to be held in Liverpool and not Sheffield; a 'full and . immediate' investigation into criminal prosecutions to be brought . against those responsible; and, where appropriate, families will apply . for civil proceedings to be re-opened where they may have been dismissed . or settled 'on a false basis'. The damning Hillsborough Independent . Panel report revealed a cover-up took place to shift the blame on to the . victims and that 41 of the 96 lives lost at Sheffield Wednesday’s . stadium could have been saved. The panel found that 164 police . statements were altered, 116 of them to remove or alter 'unfavourable' comments about the policing of the match and the unfolding disaster. Reviews have been ordered by police . authorities in West Yorkshire into the actions of Sir Norman Bettison, . West Yorkshire Police’s current chief constable, who was an off-duty . inspector with the South Yorkshire force when he attended the game in . 1989, and was involved in an internal inquiry held by the force in its . aftermath. 'Double standards': The average compensation payout for police officers traumatised by the disaster was £93,000 - 30 times the statutory level of compensation received by parents whose children were crushed . West Midlands Police, which also conducted an investigation into the disaster, will also carry out a review. South Yorkshire Police, which still . employs 195 officers who were on duty at the ground on the day of the . tragedy, said the force would refer itself to the IPCC. Chief constable David Crompton said . South Yorkshire Police would consider asking the IPCC whether those . involved in the Hillsborough tragedy should face manslaughter . investigations. Meanwhile, South Yorkshire Police . Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has apparently . defended its former secretary, Paul Middup, who was named by the panel . as having briefed the media that fans were drunken and violent as the . disaster unfolded. Mr Middup told a federation meeting . in April 1989 that he had been given a 'free hand' to push the police’s . version of events, and spoke of his 'pride' at the media briefings he . had given. He has refused to apologise and, . although he retired from South Yorkshire Police in the late 1990s, he . still works at the force's headquarters as chief executive of the South . Yorkshire Police Credit Union. The federation's current chairman, Neil Bowles, said: 'We are not going to comment on anything our predecessors did. 'We co-operated with the panel and allowed our minutes to be published - and that was with the co-operation of Paul. Remembered: The names of all the 96 Hillsborough victims are displayed at St George's Place in Liverpool city centre following the publication of the panel's report . 'Just because the report has made . those comments does not mean that he has done anything wrong. That is . for an investigation and court of law to decide.' Responding to suggestions that Mr . Middup’s criticism of the victims had been immoral, Mr Bowles said: 'We . represent officers’ views. 'If officers told me something that . was contrary to what was happening in the Press at the time, then I . might want to put that view across.' It emerged yesterday that police . officers who claimed trauma after Hillsborough were given more than . £90,000 in compensation on average, while families of children killed in . the tragedy typically received only £3,500. Sixteen officers received payments totalling £1.5million in the aftermath of the event. The . average payout for officers was £93,000 - 30 times the statutory level . of compensation received by parents whose children were among the 96 . Liverpool supporters crushed to death at the football stadium in . Sheffield in 1989. Some of the bereaved claim they received as little as £1,000. The . shocking imbalance - revealed in papers published this week by the . panel - has caused more upset to families who waited 23 years for . justice after details of the disaster were covered up by police. Mr . Hicks said he received a fraction of the amount received by some of the . police officers who were on duty on the day of the disaster. He told the People: 'Many who . lost family members have received nothing. Yet we are seeing large . amounts awarded to people who perhaps shouldn't have taken jobs in the . first place. 'It should be fair and equitable for all. This is double standards.' Findings: Hillsborough Independent Panel members (from left to right) Peter Sissons, Bishop of Liverpool The Right Reverend James Jones and Professor Phil Scraton present their report . Mrs Aspinall said she received only £1,200. 'There are people who think we got millions,' she said. 'That couldn't be further from the truth.' The . panel's report stated: 'In cases that concerned the death of children, . their parents received no more than the statutory bereavement allowance . of £3,500 and funeral expenses. 'Cases that concerned the death of adults survived by dependants resulted in higher payments. 'Compensation . for those who endured physical or psychological injury was assessed on . the nature and extent of the injury, resulting loss of earnings or any . ongoing medical costs.' The . panel found that compensation claims from South Yorkshire Police (SYP) officers 'caused considerable tension within the force'. It . states: 'Senior officers viewed the claims with ""great concern"" and . junior officers felt ""immense pressure"" from the force to withdraw . them.' The report continues: '£1.5million was ultimately paid out by SYP to 16 officers. 'The costs were met from the force's employers' insurance cover.' A spokesman for South Yorkshire . Police said: 'Compensation tariffs for personal injury or conditions . such as post traumatic stress disorder are defined by law. 'The . payments received by officers, victims and families of victims . following the Hillsborough Disaster were not determined by South . Yorkshire Police.'","Lawyers for families request for new hearing to be held in Liverpool .

Iran's nuclear chief has claimed the country's nuclear programme has been hit by two attempts of sabotage as sources claim the attacks could be linked to the U.S. military. Iran’s vice president and the chief of its nuclear-energy agency Fereydoun Abbasi claimed power lines between the holy city of Qom and the underground Fordow nuclear centrifuge facility and others leading to Iran’s Natanz facilities were blown up with explosives in August. He alleges that 'terrorists and saboteurs' might have infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency in an effort to derail his nation's atomic program. Conspiracy: Iran's head of Atomic Energy Organisation Fereydoon Abbasi Davani alleges that the International Atomic Energy Agency has been infiltrates by 'terrorists and saboteurs' Speaking at the IAEA's 155-nation general conference, Abbasi challenged the perpetrators to launch new attacks - stating his country is determined to learn how to protect its interests through such assaults. He then suggested that IAEA might have been connected to the blasts, stating: 'Terrorists and saboteurs might have intruded the agency and might be making decisions covertly.' Abbasi then added that IAEA inspectors turned up to inspect an underground enrichment plant soon after its powerlines had been blown up, asking: 'Does this visit have any connection to that detonation?' It comes as American sources have claimed there is a possibility that the U.S military may be connected to the attacks. A threat: Footage from the Iranian state TV channel IRIB, purporting to show a successful test-fire launch of a short range missile . The once-secret Natanz nuclear complex in Natanz, Iran, about 150 miles south of Tehran . A retired U.S. intelligence officer who . still works as a contractor with the U.S. military told The Daily Beast . that U.S. Special Forces have trained for sabotage missions inside Iran . for years. He said: 'From the first reports, this attack looks like something from our guys.' Patrick Clawson, the director of research for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told Yahoo: 'Covert American operations against the Iranian program is a good way to persuade the Israelis that the United States will back up its words with deeds.' The plant at Fordo, about 40 miles south of Tehran is buried deep in a mountainside to protect it from assault. Ongoing testing: Iran's Revolutionary Guards test missiles in the desert . It also is being used to enrich . uranium closer to the level needed for a nuclear warhead than what is . used to power most industrial reactors. Abbasi . added the sabotage was foiled 'by using backup batteries and diesel . generators' that prevented any disruption to centrifuges used to spin . uranium to enriched levels. He also said a separate attack on the . country's centrifuges - through tiny explosions meant to disable key . parts of the machines - was discovered before the timed blasts could go . off. Iran leader: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Abbasi did not elaborate on the date or other details of that alleged assault attempt. Dozens of unexplained explosions have . hit the country's gas pipelines and Iran's first nuclear power plant . suffered major equipment failures delaying its operations for decades . before going on line this year - delays that some experts attribute to . acts of sabotage. But . Abbasi insisted: 'We are a powerful country. We can confront any kind . of industrial espionage whether it is an explosive or a virus. 'We are eager and interested to ask the other side to have more (attacks) because having more we would be more experienced.' He then attacked America - claiming U.S. pressure on Iran is the equivalent of an attack on all developing nations' nuclear rights. He called U.S.-led sanctions on Iran's oil exports and financial transactions 'the ugly face of colonization and modern slavery'. The speech caused hardline Israeli leaders to call for military strikes on Iran - arguing that diplomatic efforts and economic penalties have had no effect. Iran has warned that any Israeli attack would trigger a devastating response and Abbasi suggested that such strikes would not succeed in slowing down his country's nuclear program. He said without elaboration that experts have 'devised certain ways through which nuclear facilities remain intact under missile attacks and raids'. But Abbasi insisted that his country's nuclear program is aimed only at making reactor fuel and doing medical research. He said: 'The Islamic Republic of Iran ... has always opposed and will always denounce the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction.'","Iran's nuclear energy chief Fereydoun Abbasi claims power lines linking nuclear facilities have been targeted twice .

Britain’s most expensive registration plate has been put up for sale for a record-breaking £1MILLION. The plate ‘X1’ has been described as 'exceptional and historical' and was originally issued by Northumberland County Council in December 1903. It is being advertised by Regtransfers.co.uk which have given it a £1 million asking price. Pricey: The X1 number plate - the most expensive in the world - as advertised on the website . This would make it £560,000 more expensive than the plate ‘F1’ which was bought by Bradford-based businessman Afzal Kahn in 2008. It is also 43 TIMES more expensive than the car it is ideally suited for - the BMW X1. The plate would also be perfect for McLaren’s multi-million pound one-off X-1 model. And anyone who forks out the potential seven-figure sum would have to stump up a further £26.50 to have a new set made up and £126 transfer fee. It is thought the plate once belonged to the chairman of a committee in Tynemouth which campaigned for the abolition of the ‘red flag’ legislation. Under the provisions of the Locomotive Act, 1865, the first motor cars were limited to a speed of 4mph in the country and just 2mph in town. Additionally, three people were required to take charge of the vehicle and one of the crew would have to walk 60 yards (55 m) ahead carrying a red flag. The number plate is 43 times more expensive than the car it is ideally suited for - the BMW X1 (pictured) When the committee’s cause was successful, other members were said to have acquired the X numbers 2 to 5. Angela Banh, from Regtransfers.co.uk, believes the plate will sell quickly but revealed it was hard to predict who the buyer would be. She said: 'It could be someone who thinks they have the X-factor, someone with the Chinese surname Xi, or a company with a name beginning with X - like Xerox.' If Regtransfers doesn’t sell the plate over the next two weeks then they will advertise it in an online auction.","The plate has been described as 'exceptional and historical'

Threatened: Cindy Lee Garcia was the first actress to speak out against the film after it caused deadly protests in the Middle East . The first actress to speak out against the director of the incendiary anti-Islam film that prompted global protests is now fearful for her life after receiving multiple death threats. Cindy Lee Garcia was quick to announce that she and the other actors had no idea that the film's producer, who they knew at Sam Bacile but who is now known by his true name of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, wanted to use their acting to create an anti-Islam film but now she is being threatened. 'I’m getting horrible death threats over the Internet, people saying they’re going to cut me up, chop me up and kill me and my family,' Ms Garcia said on Tuesday. Her personal Facebook page, her . professional modeling page, and the page of the Flame of Fire Outreach . Church where she serves as an ordained minister have all been inundated . with threats from individuals angered by the movie. One such threat highlighted by The New York Daily News . reads that a man named Ahmad Nazir Bashiri said the actress is lucky . that he is nowhere near her because 'otherwise I would have cut your . head no matter what your country or lawmakers would have done to me'. In her first interview, when she spoke to Gawker and . explained that she never saw any references to the prophet Mohammed or . Islam, Ms Garcia thought that she was actin in a film called Desert . Warriors. ‘It was going to . be a film based on how things were 2,000 years ago. It wasn't based on . anything to do with religion, it was just on how things were run in . Egypt. There wasn't anything about Muhammed or Muslims or anything,’ she . told Gawker. Outraged: Actress Cindy Lee Garcia said that she never knew that the movie, which she thought was titled Desert Warriors, was intended to be an anti-Islam film . Her Facebook page echoes that, as she proudly touts her participation in the film. 'I . have been doing feature films, just finished Broken Roads with Crevice . Entertainment, also just wrapped up Dessert Warriors/ played a . supporting role,' she wrote. Hiding: She has received repeated death threats over her involvement with the film . She lists shooting as one of her hobbies, saying she is 'very good with guns, love shooting am A Member Of Kern County Gun Club. Spend as much time as I can on the gun range'. After a 14-minute trailer of the film was posted online, protests broke out throughout the Middle East and U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was killed inside the Libyan embassy last week. The next day, Ms Garcia called the producer- who she still thought was named Sam Bacile- in a panic. 'I called Sam and said, ""Why did you do this?"" and he said, ""I'm tired of radical Islamists killing each other. Let other actors know it's not their fault,""' Garcia said. She is furious about the changes that were made after filming, as the final product refers to Mohammed as a pedophile and child molester. ‘I had nothing to do really with anything. Now we have people dead because of a movie I was in. It makes me sick,’ she said. Though she spoke to ‘Sam’ and he acknowledged that none of the actors knew what was going on, that is not enough for her. ‘I’m going to sue his butt off,’ she said. In . her latest interview, Ms Garcia told The New York Daily News that she . and her family are beign forced to go into hiding and she will be taking . an assumed name. 'We're . looking for a new place to live right now. My husband is really worried. All my family is in hysterics,' she told the paper. She . said that she called the FBI and left messages reporting the threats . she has been receiving but she has yet to hear back from the agency. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is escorted out of his home by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers in Cerritos, California . A TV reporter is pictured outside the home of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula in Cerritos, California . In the days following the protests, the true identity and criminal background of the film's producer Nakoula Basseley Nakoula has been revealed. Nakoula is an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian. Now living in California, he is a convicted drug dealer and conman who was last released from jail in June last year. Ms Garcia was the first but not the only actress involved in the project who has expressed her outrage at the final version of the film. Anna Gurji, 21, who plays Muhammad’s . child bride, spoke yesterday of her fear of reprisals and how she was . ‘betrayed’ by Nakoula. ‘I . was playing the youngest bride of a character named George,’ she said. ‘I had no idea George would be changed to Muhammad. I’m locked up in my . house. I’m terrified people in the Middle East will blame me. ‘I’m Catholic so they might think I . have something against Muslims. I’m taking pills to sleep. I’ve been . crying for days. I feel betrayed. My face is stuck on the movie clip. People see that awful film and they see me.’ Conman: Nakoula Basseley Nakoula on the set of the film with Ms Gurji in a red wig . An . unnamed representative for the 80-person cast released a statement to . CNN, condemning the incendiary changes made in post-production that . portrayed the prophet Muhammed as a pedophile and child molester. ‘We . are shocked by the drastic re-writes of the script and lies that were . told to all involved. We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have . occurred,’ the cast said in their statement. 'Betrayed': Anna Gurji said she was misled over the film's true contents . The . film sparked a violent protest at the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city . of Benghazi during which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans . were killed on Tuesday. Protests have spread to other countries across . the Muslim world. For . many Muslims, any depiction of the prophet is blasphemous. Caricatures . deemed insulting in the past have provoked protests and drawn . condemnations from officials, preachers, ordinary Muslims and many . Christians. U.S. officials have said authorities were not investigating the film project . itself, and that even if it was inflammatory or led to violence, simply . producing it cannot be considered a crime in the United States, which . has strong free speech laws. Two . attorneys visited Nakoula's home hours before he was taken in for . questioning. They said they were there to consult with him. The . violent protests over the film in Libya caused mob attacks in Benghazi . that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American . officials.

A contractor cleaning up a foreclosed home got the surprise of a lifetime when he made a shocking discovery - 56 boxes of cremated remains. Each of the plastic boxes found in the Dayton, Ohio, home on Tuesday each contained the ashes of one person - and they date back as far as 1982. Authorities said that the remains were the same ones that a state agency found earlier at a now-closed funeral home owned by the same woman who owns the home, Scherrie McLin. Scroll down for video . Discovery: A contractor cleaning up the foreclosed home located at 2121 Philadelphia Street found the 56 boxes of cremated remains in a closet on Tuesday . The house, located at 2121 Philadelphia Street, was purchased several days ago after it had fallen into foreclosure. The contractor who was hired by the buyer to clean up the place, found the boxes in a closet, labeled with the names and dates of deceased individuals. Montgomery County Coroner's Office director Ken Betz told MailOnline that the information has helped them in the next step of the investigation - notifying next of kin. He said that in one case, a body was cremated, but the family was not given the remains because they owed money to the funeral home. Investigation: The cremated remains were in the same 56 boxes that were found by authorities at the McLin funeral home last year . In another, there appeared to be confusion over which family member had the remains, when they had been in the funeral home’s possession the whole time. Betz said he’s confident that media attention on the case will cause some families to come forward. He said: 'I anticipate that we’ll have a number of folks calling in to find out if we have their remains.' The Dayton Daily News reported that McLin’s mortuary license was revoked in January amid accusations that she held a body for ransom. Mystery: It is not clear when the remains were moved to the residence on Philadelphia Street . Executive director of Ohio's Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors, Vanessa Kiekamp, said that investigators found the same 56 boxes last October at the McLin Funeral Home. Kiekamp said that investigators then notified the county prosecutor, who didn't immediately return calls on Wednesday. It is not clear when the remains were moved to the residence on Philadelphia Street. McLin couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. She is the half-sister of Dayton’s former Mayor Rhine McLin, who served from 2002 to 2010.

But the pub where Adolf Hitler was born in the Austrian town of Branau-am-Inn could now be turned into flats after developers submitted plans to the local council. The mayor of Braunau, Hannes Waidbacher, who opposes  alternative proposals for a Holocaust museum at the site, believes turning the Gasthaus zum Pommer into family homes would be one way of 'destigmatising' the town. Plans: Developers want to turn the former Gasthaus zum Pommer where Hitler was born (pictured) into apartments . As it was: Pictured in 1966, the building had been, variously, a girl's school and a public library, after World War II. Most recently it has been used as a centre for disabled people . Nationality: Hitler's birthplace is just a short distance from the German border. The Nazi leader returned to annex and occupy his homeland during the 'Anschluss' in 1938 . If the plan- approved by the mayor and proposed by a local building consortium - was accepted it would mean the room where Hitler was born would become a bedroom in self-contained apartments with state-of-the-art kitchens and bathrooms. The apartments would go on the market for an estimated 400,000 pounds each. Such a plan, say experts, would require vigorous vetting of prospective buyers to ensure that a single flat - or indeed the entire property - did not fall into the hands of neo-Nazis masking their real identities. The little Austrian town separated from Germany by a short bridge over the River Inn, is still visited by hordes of far-right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future Fuhrer was born on April 20 1889. It was until recently used as a workshop for the mentally and physically disabled; the sort of people Hitler deemed as 'useless eaters' and the first to die in the Third Reich's secret euthanasia campaign before WWII. But it has been empty for a year now with the state picking up the bill for the lease and a debate raging about what to do with the two-storey listed building. Mayor Waidbacher said: 'Braunau has done much to process its history over the years. 'It is not necessary to build a Holocaust museum in the house as some have suggested. 'Braunau as a town is already stigmatised enough. 'Hitler spent only three years of his life here, and they were certainly not the most formative years of his life. 'Why should I or others take responsibility for him? I was born 21 years after the end of the war.' The mayor said he was open to all suggestions, saying Braunau wants an 'affordable solution for all.' 'I can imagine all possibilities for the house,' he said. Marker: A memorial stone (pictured) was placed outside the building in 1989 as a reminder of its history. In English the inscription reads 'For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Remind [us]' Past: Mayor Hannes Waidbacher supports the plan for apartments - saying it would help 'de-stigmatise' the town . However, Mayor Waidbacjer is against turning the building into a 'House of Peace' or a 'House of Responsibility' as Green Party members have advocated - believing the town has done enough atoning over the years for its most infamous son. Already the newspapers in Austria and Germany are having a field day at the prospect of flats in Hitler's house. 'In the future you can live like Adolf Hitler,' said the Austrian newspaper Heute while the salzburger Nachrichten said; 'Hitler's home to become apartment block.' The house at Salzburger Vorstadt 15 is estimated to be worth about £2.5 million to £3 million. It was in a room on the first floor of the three-storey, 2,000 square foot premises that Hitler’s mother Klara gave birth to the future Nazi leader. She and her husband Alois, a stern local customs official, rented a suite of rooms above the pub and continued to live in it until 1892 when they moved to Linz. Alois, a drunkard, often availed himself of the beer on sale in the saloon downstairs before returning to the family home to abuse his timid wife who was 24 years his junior. The house is still owned by the family after which the pub took its name. Braunau LOCATOR.jpg . Owner Gelinde Pommer says she wants to sell because she no longer wants to have responsibility for it. Nothing remains inside the building to indicate its link with Hitler, not even the bedroom where he was born. The only Nazi-era relic is on an iron gate outside, the initials MB for Hitler’s party secretary Martin Bormann, who had them placed there when he declared the house a national monument after Hitler took over Austria in 1938. During the 12 year lifespan of the Third Reich it was a must-see place of pilgrimage for loyal Nazis. Bormann bought the house with Nazi funds and made it a cultural centre which displayed Nazi-approved art. It was given back to the Pommer family in 1952 and served as the town’s public library until 1965 before becoming, in turns, a school, a bank, a technical institute and finally the home and workshop for disabled people. Those who want it turned into a site of remembrance for Hitler's crimes are pressing central government in Vienna to compulsorily purchase the property.","Nazi leader was born in the pub in Braunau-am-Inn in Austria in 1889 .

Rafal Ciesielski, 35, was arrested in broad daylight after he was seen in the car park where he got ‘excited’ outside Spalding police station in Lincolnshire on August 12. He claimed that someone may have spiked his drink and he was ‘ashamed and embarrassed’ by his actions. 'Ashamed': Rafal Ciesielski faced Spalding Magistrates Court, pictured, after he was caught performing a sex act on himself outside Spalding police station . Spalding Magistrates Court heard how a police officer saw Ciesielski wearing a pair of women's stockings pulled down over his face while ‘committing a sex act on himself’. Edward Johnson, prosecuting said: ‘Another officer also saw what was going on. ‘Both officers were shocked and disgusted by what they saw and found the behaviour outrageous and totally unacceptable.’ The court also heard that the man from Spalding, Lincolnshire, who works in a local fruit factory, had suffered sight problems since the incident. Rachel Stevens, defending, said: ‘The defendant is completely unable to explain his bizarre behaviour. Over his face: Ciesielski was seen wearing a pair of women's stockings, file picture, pulled down over his face . ‘He was substantially under the influence of alcohol. ‘He wonders whether someone spiked his drinks - this actually happened in the middle of the day and the last thing he could remember the night before was being in a club. ‘He is incredibly ashamed and embarrassed.’ Miss Stevens said Ciesielski has suffered ‘a severe loss of vision’ in the last month and been referred for an MRI scan. The sight problem means he cannot drive or operate forklift trucks at work although he still works in the factory. Ciesielski admitted outraging public decency when he appeared in front of JPs on August 30 and was sentenced to a 130 hour work order along with 12 months’ supervision by probation and ordered to pay £85 costs. Earlier this year, a father-of-two admitted one count of outraging public decency when he used a small voice-activated camera to make secret upskirt videos of them. James Manchand, 48, who just hours before had been at a sex offenders course for an almost identical crime, was caught after suspicious security guards at Manchester's Market Street Boots realised he was following women around their store.","Rafal Ciesielski was arrested after a police officer saw him performing a sex act on himself outside Spalding police station .

Wandering moggy: Gypsy the stray cat was rescued in Glasgow almost 1,000 miles from his home in Germany . Animal welfare experts from the Scottish SPCA believe his owners have recently moved from Germany to Britain and the poor moggy simply got lost. Vicky Roy, animal rescue officer at the Scottish SPCA, said: 'As well as being microchipped. Gypsy has identification tattoos made up of small dots in both ears. 'One ear has the number ‘96’ inside, which we believe could be the year he was born. 'This would mean he is around sixteen years old, which we think would be about right as he is definitely an older cat. 'His other ear has initials inside, which we think may be his owner’s. 'However, we are not going to reveal what these are as these will help us confirm that Gypsy belongs to anyone who does come forward.'

Gaunt Gypsy was picked up by the animal charity after being reported to them by a concerned resident in Glasgow’s west end on September 18.

'It may be that his owner brought him to Scotland when they moved here and he has gone missing recently. 'We also can’t rule out the possibility he has come over on holiday with his owner and has been left behind. 'If he has been an outdoor cat in Germany and his owner has given him outside access here too, he could easily have lost his way if he is new to the area. 'He is underweight, which could be because he’s been straying for a while but it could also be a result of him being an elderly cat.

Prof Nicholas Roe claims the poet continued to use the drug after he took it to relieve a chronic sore throat . John Keats was an opium addict while he wrote some of his most famous poems, a contentious new biography claims. Dismissing other experts who believe that the English Romantic poet experimented with the drug only briefly, author Prof Nicholas Roe claims that after using the drug to relieve a chronic sore throat, he continued dosing himself to ‘keep up his spirits’. Prof Roe admits his findings in the biography John Keats – A New Life, to be published in October will be contentious. ‘This has never been said before: Keats as an opium addict is new,’ he told The Guardian. The professor of English literature at the University of St Andrews in Scotland said: ‘My biography takes the contrary view that the spring of 1819 was not only one of Keats' most productive periods but also his most heavily opiated. ‘He continued dosing himself to relieve his chronically sore throat; and that opium-induced mental instability helps to explain his jealous and vindictive mood swings regarding (his financee) Fanny Brawne. Keats’ famous poems Ode on Indolence and Ode to a Nightingale were inspired while the poet was under the influence of opium, Prof Roe said. He said: This explodes entrenched conceptions of him as a delicate, overly sensitive, tragic figure. ‘That Keats was using opium to enhance what it meant to “fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget” the world gives us a different Keats: a Keats whose struggle with life was more complex, and darker than we have previously thought.’ ‘Keats's odes of spring 1819 have often been read as his most “philosophical” engagement with the intractable contraries of beauty and mortality, time and eternity. ‘To find those two odes and, I suspect, La Belle Dame sans Merci, arose from opium reveries gives us a less intellectual or “philosophical” Keats, and a poet who is closer to the mystical aspects of Romantic tradition associated with Blake, Baudelaire, Coleridge, De Quincey, Yeats, Huxley and Bob Dylan. Professor's claims: The biography, left, by author Nicholas Roe, right, of the University of St Andrews claims that the spring of 1819 was one of Keats' most productive periods but also his most heavily opiated' ‘Like Coleridge's Kubla Khan and like Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, Ode to a Nightingale is one of the greatest re-creations of a drug-inspired dream-vision in English literature – a poem that frankly admits his own opium habit.’ According to Prof Roe, the poet - who was also a trained physician - had access to laudanum to administer it to his sick brother Tom in 1818 who was dying of TB. After Tom died of the disease which he gave to Keats, who would eventually die from it three years later, started using the drug regularly ‘to keep up his spirits’ according to his close friend Charles Brown. Brown, a writer, is said to have warned Keats of the ‘danger of such a habit’ which Prof Roe believes ‘suggests Keats was indeed an “habitual” user of opium and had been dosing himself for a considerable time’. Keats first showed symptoms of TB in 1820, after losing Tom as well as his mother to the illness. 'Vindictive': Keats' jealousy and mood swings regarding financee Fanny Brawne, pictured, can be attributed to his drug addiction, the biography claims . Poem Ode on Indolence was inspired by ‘a reverie induced by taking laudanum to ease the pain of a black eye, got while playing cricket on Hampstead Heath in March 1819’. Prof Roe said: ‘Apparent from his up and down moods, and the increasing turmoil of his relationship with Fanny Brawne in 1820, a phase of his life that resembles Coleridge's opiated anguish over his unrequited passion for Wordsworth's sister-in-law, Sara Hutchinson, in the years 1802 to 1804.’ ‘The final, tragic twist of this story (comes) when Keats and the young painter Joseph Severn were voyaging to Naples, en route, they hoped, to find a cure for Keats's TB. Keats was ordered by his doctors to flee the English winter and move to Italy so he went to Naples and Rome accompanied by friend, Severn. Prof Roe claims that Severn stopped Keats taking laudanum by hiding the bottle in 1820. Prof Roe said: ‘As a result, Keats endured the protracted suffering of pulmonary consumption and faced his death without the panacea that had helped his brother and called into being some of the greatest poetry in the language.’ Although the move improved his health at first, he collapsed and died on February 23, 1821. TB is a bacterial infection which . commonly attacks the lungs and can be passed to others through kissing, . sneezing, spitting or breathing. While it is now curable, it was responsible for one in four deaths in England in 1815. Andrew Motion, who won the Whitbread prize for biography and wrote a biography of the poet said of Prof Roe’s book: ‘It's not beyond the bounds of possibility that he explored (the effect of the drug in his poems) from these remembered experiences rather than from a full-on vantage point. ‘Nick is making assumptions, just as I made assumptions - that's all we can do, because there is no hard evidence either way.’ The Romantic poet fell in love with the teenage Miss Brawne when she moved in next door to his home in Hampstead, north London but their relationship was never consummated because of his highly contagious illness.","A controversial biography claims John Keats was an opium addict .

Female soldiers should face compulsory pregnancy tests before deploying to Afghanistan, say military chiefs. Commanders said it was ‘unacceptable’ that service personnel should be placed at risk of Taliban attack while evacuating pregnant women from the front line. The strong reaction came after the Daily Mail revealed a British soldier had given birth to a son in Camp Bastion. Sisters in arms: Women soldiers in training - hundreds are fighting the Taliban . The junior non-commissioned officer in the Royal Artillery had a healthy boy five weeks prematurely on Tuesday. Both mother and child are doing well. The woman – the first UK soldier to have a baby on the battlefield – had been unaware she was pregnant. The birth astonished military chiefs. Strict military rules already ban pregnant women from deploying on operations and troops are repeatedly reminded by top brass to check they are not before they fly to the front line. But servicewomen are not forced to take a urine test before deploying because top brass consider it would be an ‘invasion of privacy’. Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, said: ‘This soldier was extremely lucky to have given birth in Camp Bastion where there are excellent medical facilities. ‘But if she had been out on patrol or in a forward operating base the outcome might have been tragically different – resulting in harm to mother and child. ‘If she had to be evacuated from a forward position then her fellow soldiers might have had to carry her and her equipment over long distances in sweltering heat and under Taliban attack. ‘Aircrew and helicopters could have been endangered if she had to be flown out in hazardous circumstances. ‘These added dangers are clearly acceptable as a result of unpredictable injury or medical condition. But they are not acceptable in these circumstances. ‘For these reasons there should be compulsory pregnancy testing prior to any operational deployment.’ The Fiji-born mother, a gunner who . helped provide covering fire for troops in combat, had been deployed . with the 12th Mechanised Brigade since March. Two days ago she complained of severe stomach pains. To her amazement, medics told her that she was about to give birth. Camp Bastion, Afghanistan: A Fijian woman . soldier stationed at the British base in Helmand gave birth on Tuesday. The super fit squaddie did not even realise she was pregnant . Unexpected task: The soldier, who has not been . named, was taken to Camp Bastion's £10million field hospital where Army . medics delivered her baby . She was thought to be in about the . 34th week of her pregnancy – meaning she conceived before flying to . Afghanistan for her six-month tour of duty. She . was taken to Camp Bastion’s £10million state-of-the-art field hospital. Its staff are world leaders in treating injuries from bomb blasts and . gunshot wounds, but do not have specialist midwifery or paediatric . skills. A midwife and . neo-natal nurse from the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford are travelling . to the British base in Helmand with an incubator to provide care for the . soldier and her son on the flight home. The cost is not being . disclosed. Major General Julian Thompson, the ex-commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and a Falklands land commander, said: ‘I would have thought insisting on compulsory pregnancy tests would make sense.’ But the Ministry of Defence dismissed the risk. A spokesman said: ‘There are a huge number of medical circumstances that could be faced. Aircraft and vehicles are on standby to respond to them. ‘Troops are prepared for a whole host of different missions. 'There is no extra cost and travelling anywhere in a warzone has its own dangers. 'Less than 1 per cent of all servicewomen who have deployed on operations since 2006 have had to return from Afghanistan due to pregnancy. 'Only one has ever given birth. The health and safety of our troops is always our top priority.’ Soldiers heading for Afghanistan . undergo stringent medical checks to make sure they can cope with the . rigours of combat – but not pregnancy tests. Servicemen and women take part in pre-deployment training for about six months before they fly to the war zone. It includes arduous physical tests, . such as an eight-mile march carrying a 40lb backpack, press-ups, sit-ups . and a 1.5-mile run against the clock. Then there are a number of routine . medical examinations depending on their roles, including hearing, . eyesight and dental checks, and tests of body mass index. They also have blood pressure, heart . rate and lung capacity monitored and recorded. ‘We need to know people . are fit enough to leg it to a helicopter, for instance, if there is an . attack,’ said a Ministry of Defence spokesman. Personnel are also given any vaccinations they need to ward off tropical diseases and a course of anti-malaria tablets. Female soldiers are asked whether they . are – or suspect they are – pregnant. This is routine so medical staff . can ensure the inoculation does not damage an unborn baby. If they answer ‘yes’, then they will . not be allowed to deploy. But if the response is ‘no’, it serves to . remind sexually active servicewomen that it might be wise to take a . pregnancy test. Pre-deployment guidelines and advice . issued to every soldier make clear that women troops should not deploy . if they are pregnant but at no time are women given a pregnancy test by . the MoD. Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust, said it was unusual for a woman not to know she was pregnant until the last minute. But she said that symptoms might be overlooked under stressful circumstances such as a tour of duty in Afghanistan. ‘If you don’t expect to be pregnant, are busy and stressful or in a life-or-death situation, you may be so focused on what is happening in your life that you don’t spot or put to the back of your mind the signs of pregnancy you may be experiencing.’ Pregnancy tests can be bought from high street chemists for  less than £10 and can give a  result as soon as seven days after conception. Because troops are not used to the conditions of deployment, including different diet, extreme heat or cold and sporadic working hours, many soldiers put physical changes down their environment.","Commanders concerned troops could be put at risk .

Former Olympic star and BBC commentator Gillian Clark was stalked and received death threats by another woman for 11 years. Susan Maynard, 51, only met the former badminton star once before she started stalking her and threatening to kill her. Maynard has been jailed for two years for breaching a restraining order nine times after a judge ruled her victim deserved some respite from the misery inflicted upon her. Hull Crown Court heard Miss Clark, a . former Great Britain badminton player and Olympic quarter-finalist, only . briefly met Maynard once in 2001. The BBC commentator had employed a gardener and Maynard had accompanied him to Miss Clark's home in Kent. The next day, Maynard began bombarding her with abusive calls, eventually threatening to kill her. Maynard told her victim she would 'haunt' her and call every phone box she ever walked past. Despite . being given a restraining order in 2002, banning her from Kent and . being jailed for 12 months in 2010, Maynard has continued to breach the . order, plaguing Miss Clark, 51, with calls from her home in Hornsea. This . year, she breached the restraining order three times by calling Miss . Clark and leaving silent messages on her answer phone. In one message, . she sighed and said 'Oh God'. In a victim statement read to the court, Miss Clark says she felt vulnerable. She . said: 'The comments made by Maynard at previous hearings saying she . will abide by the restraining order have been hollow and meaningless. 'I have never known her and she is not my friend. 'I feel I am being stalked and I feel vulnerable and frustrated by the way the authorities have dealt with her case previously. Gillian Clark competed at the 1992 Olympics in women's doubles badminton with Julie Bradbury. The pair were knocked out in the quarter finals . 'It has gone on for 11 years. The calls are deeply distressing.' Judge Mark Bury told Maynard: 'You are making her life a complete misery. She regards herself as being stalked and let down by the authorities. 'It is easy to see why she might well think that given the orders imposed on you in the past. This has gone on for 11 years and it has got to stop.

The two giants of European football will go head to head in the group stages, which kick off next month. They will also take on Ajax and Borussia Dortmund in a difficult group. Chelsea, who won the tournament in May, face a tough test after being drawn in the same group as Italian giants Juventus, plus Shakhtar Donetsk and Nordsjaelland. Manchester United will be happy to go up against Braga, Galatasaray and Cluj, while Arsenal will be confident of progressing from a group with Schalke, Olympiakos and Montpellier. Celtic, however, face daunting matches against Spanish giants Barcelona, as well as games against Spartak Moscow and Benfica. Scroll down for video . Porto . Dynamo Kiev . Paris St Germain .

City, who look certain to strengthen before the transfer window closes on Friday night, will come up against a Real Madrid side who beat Barcelona over two legs in the Spanish Super Cup. Jose Mourinho's side have not been particularly active in the transfer market but have added Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric to an already exciting side. He joins the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria in the Spanish capital. Ronaldo admitted that Group D was the toughest: 'It is the most difficult group in my opinion and I think that's the same for most people,' he said.'But we are champions of Spain and we are ready to compete with everybody.' Borussia Dortmund meanwhile have won the Bundesliga title two years running and also won the German Cup last season. They also boast some formidable attacking options with Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze in the side. The current Ajax side may lack the class of the teams from the 90s but Frank de Boer has made an impressive start to his managerial career and the Dutch club should not be treated lightly. Danger men: Carlos Tevez (left) will come up against Ronaldo when Manchester City take on Real Madrid . Arsenal may well view their group as lacking a giant but full of tricky fixtures. Schalke boast the attacking options of Swiss star Tranquillo Barnetta and Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar while a trip to Greece to face Olympiakos is never one to take lightly. Arsene Wenger's men will have to find a way past former Manchester United keeper Roy Carroll who joined the Greek side in January. Rounding off the group are French champions Montpellier who won their first top flight title last season. We meet again: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (left) and Lukas Podolski played against each other in the German league . Reigning champions Chelsea will be confident of qualifying for the knockout stages and their toughest test looks set to come from Juventus. The Italian champions returned to the top of the tree in Serie A last season but it is a long time since they tasted success on the European front. Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba could feature in the matches between the sides. Shakhtar Donetsk look set to hold on to star player Willian who has attracted interest from Tottenham over the summer. The Ukrainian side will be a tough nut to crack at home but are unlikely to pose much of a danger at Stamford Bridge. The final side, Nordsjaelland, won their first Danish title last season and the minnows will do well to take anything from the Blues. They will however feature Andreas Laudrup, the son of Swansea manager Michael. Former Blues assistant Ray Wilkins expects the Londoners to top the group despite the difficulty of travelling to Shakhtar and Italian champions Juventus. 'You'd expect them to go through, probably as top of the group,' he said. 'Shakhtar is a difficult game. It's a great stadium there but it's a lot of travelling and you don't want to be doing too much of that and Juventus is a classic game. 'They were undefeated last year, they have their own ground now, which is very compact. 'That will be a very difficult game but Chelsea have a fantastic squad now.' Return: Paul Pogba (left) will be back in England with Juventus when they take on Fernando Torres' Chelsea . Finally, Manchester United will once again be considered to have been handed a straightforward draw but Sir Alex Ferguson's men failed to qualify from a similarly 'easy' group last season. United will take on Portuguese side Braga for he first time in their history and will visit the three-sided ground carved into a quarry. Turkish side Galatasaray will provide their familiar formidable welcome and boast several former Premier League players in their ranks. Johan Elmander (Bolton), Emmanuel Eboue (Arsenal) and former Liverpool players Milan Baros and Albert Riera are set to feature. Romanian champions Cluj won their third title of the decade last season and will face English competition for the second time having played Chelsea in the 2008/09 season when they held the Stamford Bridge side to a draw in Romania. Ferguson has warned United not to make any 'stupid errors' in the Champions League. 'We have the experience of playing against Galatasaray in the past and we will always remember the ""Welcome to Hell"" banners,' he told the club's official website. So it's always a difficult type of match. 'We have drawn Portuguese clubs a number of times over the past few years - the likes of Benfica, Sporting [Lisbon] and Porto - so we have the experience of playing in Portugal on many occasions. 'Braga are one of the improving teams in that country. 'Obviously, we've never played Cluj before but, after the experience of last year, we don't want to make any stupid errors this time. We will play our strongest team to make sure we get through.'

'It is fantastic to be involved with the draw, very exciting and to be in a group with Barcelona - tough but real glamour games for the club - and the other two are huge clubs in their respective countries. 'We have familiar with all three clubs, we have recent history against all three of those teams. 'I remember under Gordon (Strachan) we played Barcelona and Benfica and we knocked out Moscow in a play-off. 'It's a tough, tough group but all the teams play football so it should be attractive to watch. 'Let's not get carried away, let's see what fixtures are coming up.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . PUBLISHED: . 14:06 EST, 2 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:05 EST, 2 October 2012 . Hyde Park IRA bomb survivor Michael Pedersen killed himself and his two young children days after his wife asked for a divorce, it emerged yesterday. Friends of the couple said he had become a ‘bully’ and ‘wife abuser’ in the months leading up to the tragic events on Sunday. The bodies of Mr Pedersen and his seven-year-old Ben and Freya, six, were discovered on a bridle path in Hampshire. He had stabbed himself in the chest after using the knife on his children. 'Bully': Police say Pedersen fatally stabbed his children Ben, seven (pictured), and six-year-old Freya before taking his own life . It emerged yesterday that Erica, his wife of 10 years and mother of the two children, had recently asked the 51-year-old former soldier for a divorce. The father-of-four, who had stabbed himself repeatedly in the chest after using the same knife on his children, had been kicked out of the family’s £310,000 terraced home in Ashford just three weeks ago. Neighbours said the couple, who had celebrated their 10th anniversary in July, had had problems after Mrs Pedersen got drunk at a party and kissed another man in front of her husband. They claimed police had been called to the family home a number of times over arguments between the couple. Michael Pedersen's wife Erica had asked him for a divorce just days before he killed his children and took his own life, friends claim . A woman, who described herself as Erica’s best friend said that the 43-year-old driving instructor had already started divorce proceedings against Mr Pedersen who she claimed had been using the children against his wife. Speaking after visiting the devastated mother at her red-brick home yesterday with flowers, the 45-year-old friend said: ‘He was controlling, a bully and a wife abuser. ‘His final control over Erica was the children; it was his last throw of the dice. No one expected this - he was meant to have loved those kids.’ Another friend, who declined to be named, said: ‘He (Michael) has been made out to be a hero, but he was not. He was a bully and a coward. ‘Erica was a wonderful Mum and those kids were just gorgeous, nobody can believe that this has happened.’ In 1982, Pedersen was riding the famous cavalry horse Sefton to the Changing of the Guard ceremony in Hyde Park when an IRA nail bomb exploded killing four soldiers and seven horses from the Household Cavalry. Scene: A dog walker came across the bodies of Michael Pedersen, 51, his son Ben, and his daughter Freya, next to a car at Newton Stacey, near Andover . Sefton was severely injured and suffered 37 shrapnel wounds in the blast but the horse’s remarkable recovery led to him becoming a household name. An ex-military colleague of Mr Pedersen last night dismissed claims that the bombing still haunted the former soldier. He claimed that Mr Pedersen had instead enjoyed the 'notoriety' of having ridden the iconic horse during the bombing. The former Household Cavalryman, who . declined to be named, said: ‘When I saw him at functions he always . seemed just a perfectly normal happy guy. ‘We would laugh, have a lot to drink and reminisce about the old days. I don’t think he was affected at all by the bombings. ‘I actually think that he quite liked the notoriety and enjoyed the fame that it brought him.’ Sefton: Friends claim Pedersen enjoyed the 'notoriety' that came along with having ridden the famous cavalry horse to the Changing of the Guard ceremony that ended in carnage . In the weeks leading up to his death, Mr Pedersen spoke about his marriage breaking up on Facebook. On August 31 he said: ‘Worst day of my life. Sadly have split with Erica am absolutely distraught.’ Surrey Police confirmed that officers had had contact with the family prior to the tragedy. The case was referred to the IPCC.","Ex-soldier Michael Pedersen stabbed himself and his two children to death in Hampshire on Sunday .

Trial: Justin Lee Collins (pictured today) arrives for the second day of his trial where he was accused of trying to push his ex-girlfriend in front of a taxi . TV star Justin Lee Collins tried to . push his girlfriend in front of a taxi on a night out with his friend, . comedian Alan Carr, a court heard yesterday. Collins, 38, is accused of subjecting . Anna Larke to a campaign of verbal and physical abuse during a . nine-month relationship last year. It is claimed he forced Miss Larke to . sleep facing him and ordered her to throw away DVDs featuring actors she . found attractive and compile a dossier of her former lovers. A jury has been told Miss Larke, 38, . is a recovering alcoholic with a history of depression. Sonia Woodley, . QC, defending at St Alban’s Crown Court, said Miss Larke had told . Collins about three suicide attempts including an occasion when she . threw herself in front of a taxi. But giving evidence yesterday, Miss . Larke insisted Collins had tried to push her in front of the car during a . drunken night out with Carr, his former co-host on The Friday Night . Project. She said: ‘No. He [Collins] tried to push me in front of a car when he was drunk out of his head. ‘I was with him and Alan Carr. We were walking down the street and he was shoving me and pushed me into traffic. ‘He pushed me in front of a car. I was lucky a man who was walking along caught me before I fell in front of the cab.’ Miss Woodley asked: ‘Alan Carr can confirm this can he?’ Former PR girl Miss Larke said: ‘He was drunk too, but yes. I stayed at his house that night. It was quite an evening.’ Miss Larke also denied she had . attempted suicide on two other occasions claiming she had lied to stop . Collins asking questions about her past. She said: ‘He asked me what the worst thing I’d ever done was and I did tell him I’d tried to commit suicide. ‘I told him to stop him from  asking me things and writing them down.’ Court: Miss Larke, left, was accused of trying to commit suicide and she told the court that comedian Alan Carr was with her and Collins when Collins tried to push her in front of a car on a drunken night out . Couple: Collins pictured in 2011 with his former girlfriend Miss Larke, 38, after he split from his wife Karen . The court has been told how Collins . left his wife in January 2011 and moved from Bristol to live with Miss . Larke in a flat in Kew, west London. Under cross-examination, Miss Larke . admitted Collins had showered her with gifts including a laptop, digital . camera and diamond ear rings. 'Bruises': Miss Larke claimed she had not shown them to her GP because she didn't want to 'grass up' Collins who was 'the love of [her] life' She also told how Collins had paid for . her to take three months off work as a Christmas present and had taken . her on ‘expensive and luxurious’ holidays. Asked why he had bought the computer, . Miss Larke – who gave evidence from behind a curtain – said: ‘I imagine . it’s because he was very guilty. He also abused my cat, he’s an animal . abuser as well.’ Miss Larke also claimed Collins bought her clothes, . including a $1,000 leather dress from New York, because he wanted to . control what she wore. She said he had abused her for being . overweight calling her a ‘fat, ****ing dog’ and said she was ‘riddled . with cellulite’. The jury of nine women and three men was told Miss . Larke went through menopause at the age of 36 and ‘despised herself’ because she couldn’t give Collins children. Miss Larke said Collins had given her . ‘thousands’ of bruises’ and some could be seen in pictures taken of them . on holiday in Miami last year. Despite numerous visits to her GP, she . said she had not shown the doctor her bruises because she did not want . to get Collins into trouble. A tearful Miss Larke said: ‘Justin was the love of my life. I still loved him. I’m not going to grass up my boyfriend.’ She admitted telling Collins in an . angry phone call after they had split in August 2011 that he was a ‘Z . list celebrity’ who was ‘going nowhere’. Presents: Collins is the former host of the Friday Night Project. The court heard he 'insisted' that his girlfriend 'sleep facing towards him' and today it heard how he showered her with gifts when he felt guilty . Trial: St Albans Crown Court where the court heard yesterday that Collins made his former . girlfriend recount every sexual experience she had ever had for a . notebook he kept as part of a campaign of domestic abuse . The court was also told she had sent him texts after they split saying she could not live without him. Miss Larke said: ‘I couldn’t stop crying. It was like grief. It was like someone had died.’ Finishing her cross-examination, Miss . Woodley accused Miss Larke of being a fantasist. Miss Larke replied: ‘I . would suggest I am absolutely not.’ Collins, of Kew, west London, denies a single charge of harassment by causing her fear of violence. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:07 EST, 28 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:58 EST, 28 September 2012 . It has been revealed that the man behind the anti-Islamic video that sparked violence in the Middle East legally changed his name because he felt his was too feminine. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Dugdale said Friday that Nakoula Basseley Nakoula will be now known as Mark Basseley Youssef in court records. Court documents filed in Orange County Superior Court today show he was granted a name change petition in 2002 and legally changed his name to Youssef because 'Nakoula is a girl's name and it cause me troubles.' US Courthouse in Los Angeles, California where alleged anti-Islamic filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is appearing on probation violation charges today . Nakoula appeared in court yesterday after authorities said he violated his probation from a 2010 check fraud conviction. The full story about Nakoula and the video 'Innocence of Muslims' still isn't known more than two weeks after violence erupted in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world where at least 50 people have died in protests related to the film. Citing a lengthy pattern of deception and the potential to flee, U.S. Central District Chief Magistrate Judge Suzanne Segal ordered Nakoula to remain in prison without bond until another judge can hold a hearing to determine if he broke the terms of his probation. These courtroom sketch's show Nakoula Basseley Nakoula talking with his attorney Steven Seiden, (left), in court yesterday . Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is sketched talking with his attorney Steven Seiden, (left), as U.S. Central District Chief Magistrate Judge Suzanne Segal presides over the proceeding yesterday . 'The court has a lack of trust in this defendant at this time,' Segal said. Prosecutors noted Nakoula had eight probation violations, including lying to his probation officers and using aliases. He could face new charges that carry a maximum two-year prison term. After his 2010 conviction, Nakoula was sentenced to 21 months in prison and was barred from using computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer, though prosecutors said none of the violations involved the Internet. He also wasn't supposed to use any name other than his true legal name without the prior written approval of his probation officer. Three names, however, have been associated with Nakoula this month alone. The movie was made last year by a man who called himself Sam Bacile. After the violence erupted, a man who identified himself as Bacile spoke to media outlets including The Associated Press, took credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about Muhammad and Islam, which he called a cancer. U.S. Federal marshals drive away in a vehicle believed to be carrying Nakoula Basseley Nakoula after his arraignment in federal court in Los Angeles yesterday . U.S. Federal Marshals block the street as agents drive away in a vehicle believed to be carrying Nakoula Basseley Nakoula after his arraignment in federal court . The next day, the AP determined there was no Bacile and linked the identity to Nakoula, a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases. Federal authorities later confirmed there was no Bacile and that Nakoula was behind the movie. Some of the false statements in Nakoula's alleged probation violations had to do with the film, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Dugdale said. Nakoula told probation officials his role was just writing the script, and denied going by the name Sam Bacile in connection with the film, Dugdale said. Before going into hiding, Nakoula acknowledged to the AP that he was involved with the film but said he only worked on logistics and management. Nakoula, a Christian originally from Egypt, then went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer, which depicts Muhammad as a womanizer, religious fraud and child molester. U.S. Federal marshals, (right), prepare to transport Nakoula Basseley Nakoula after his arraignment . He met with federal probation officials two weeks ago, led out of his home in suburban Cerritos in the middle of the night, flanked by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and cloaked in heavy clothing to protect his identity. Nakoula came out of hiding Thursday for his court appearance, although the news media were banned from the courtroom and reporters had to watch the proceedings on a TV in a nearby courthouse. No photos were allowed. Nakoula wore beige pants and a collared shirt when he was led into the courtroom handcuffed and shackled. He appeared relaxed, smiling at one point before the hearing and conferring with his attorney. Nakoula's attorney, Steven Seiden, sought to have the hearing closed and his client released on $10,000 bail. He argued Nakoula has checked in with his probation officer frequently and made no attempts to leave Southern California. Seiden was concerned that Nakoula would be in danger in federal prison because of Muslim inmates, but prosecutors said he likely would be placed in protective custody. An unoccupied Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department patrol car is parked across from the home, of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the man who made the film 'Innocence of Muslims' that has sparked violent protests . Lawrence Rosenthal, a constitutional and criminal law professor at Chapman University School of Law in Orange, said it was 'highly unusual' for a judge to order immediate detention on a probation violation for a nonviolent crime, but if there were questions about Nakoula's identity it was more likely. 'When the prosecution doesn't really know who they're dealing with, it's much easier to talk about flight,' Rosenthal said. 'I've prosecuted individuals who'd never given a real address. 'You don't know who you're dealing with, and you're just going to have very limited confidence about their ability to show up in court.' Enraged Muslims have demanded punishment for Nakoula, and a Pakistani cabinet minister has offered a $100,000 bounty to anyone who kills him. First Amendment advocates have defended Nakoula's right to make the film while condemning its content. And federal officials likely will face criticism from those who say Nakoula's free speech rights were trampled by his arrest on a probation violation. In arguing that Nakoula is a possible flight risk, Dugdale said Nakoula couldn't even reveal something as fundamental as his real name. 'He's a person who simply can't be trusted,' he said.","Mystery surrounding the man behind the .

The baby girl who was delivered by emergency C-section after her mother was fatally struck by a car has died, officials said today. The baby, whom postdoctoral instructor Jennifer Young and husband Gavan Young had named Samantha, succumbed to her injuries a day after her mother was killed. Mrs Young, of Rice University, was struck Tuesday while walking near the Houston, Texas campus; the baby was reported alive but in critical condition. Tragedy: Jennifer J. Young, a postdoctoral instructor at Rice University, was struck and killed at an intersection with her seven-month-old baby succumbing to the injuries on Wednesday . Scene: She was hit by a grey Acura as she tried to cross near Main and Cambridge streets . Expecting: Her baby who was delivered by an emergency C-section would have been her and her husband's first . Samantha Young would have been the couple's first child, the Houston Chronicle reported. Mrs Young, a mathematics instructor, was seven months pregnant when crossing near the intersection of Main St and Cambridge around 9:20am, the paper said. Her baby was delivered by emergency C-section at Memorial Hermann hospital, where the mother was later pronounced dead. She was reportedly struck by a grey Acura MDX that was driving down Main, though police said the vehicle had a green light. Houston police said the car next to the Acura stopped in the intersection, but the Acura continued on, striking the young woman. They held the driver of the Acura for questioning, but they were later released. The investigation for the case is on-going. Mrs Young was a bright postdoctoral student teaching at the Computational and Applied Mathematics department at Rice University. 'It seemed like the stars were perfectly aligned for her,' Rice professor Steve Cox told Chron.com. Mr Cox was the principal investigator . on the grant that brought Ms Young to the university's Computational . and Applied Mathematics Department almost two years ago. Mr Cox said Mrs Young's grant application stood out, particularly because of her extraordinary teaching and mentoring experience. 'It's just tragic,' he said. Urgent care: She was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where she died hours after the emergency delivery . The professor's husband, Gavan Young, was too grief-stricken to speak to the press on Wednesday, according to the news website. Instructors who worked with Mrs Young remembered her as hard-working. ‘Jennifer was a true collaborator and a key partner in establishing a working collaboration with scientists at the Texas Medical Centre,’ Computational and Applied Mathematics Chair Matthias Heinkenschoss told KVUE via email. In September, Mrs Young was to begin the last year of a prestigious fellowship at Rice University after completing her doctorate in applied mathematics. She would have been a fully-fledged professor in about a year, having recently accepted a tenure-track position at another university. In a letter to faculty, staff and students, the university's chairman of computational and applied mathematics Matthias Heinkenschloss announced Mrs Young's death, describing her as talented and accomplished with a bright future. Higher education: Ms Young taught at the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice University . Mrs Young arrived at Rice in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Delaware and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The academic continued that work at Rice, teaching and participating in mathematics outreach programs with high school students. The bond Mrs Young had built with her students brought her some of the best teaching evaluations in the department's history, Mr Heinkenschloss said in the note. Mrs Young, who specialized in mathematical biology, also participated in research. She spent significant time establishing a working collaboration with scientists at the Texas Medical Center, where she probably had been the morning of the crash, Mr Cox said. He called her 'a natural academic' and recalled how excited she was when she told him she was pregnant. 'She had this love and belief that one could do it all,' Mr Cox said. 'With no complaints.'","Jennifer J. Young, 30, fatally struck by grey Acura in Houston .

Wayne Rooney's brother was banned from the road today after being caught driving three times over the alcohol limit to buy booze for a party. The Manchester United striker's younger sibling Graham was found guilty of drink driving but blamed his friends. Dressed in a Team GB hoodie, the 24-year-old left Liverpool Magistrates' Court with friends after being handed a two-year driving ban, 150 hours community service and told to pay £650 costs. Community service: Graham Rooney, 24, leaves Liverpool Magistrates Court with a large group of friends after being sentenced for drink driving . Guilty: Rooney, just seen, leaves court with friends after receiving a two-year suspended driving ban and 150 hours community service and being told to pay £650 costs . He was arrested at his parents' luxury £450,000 house in Liverpool in April. Graham - who has a striking resemblance to his £180,000-a-week superstar brother, 26 - was held in custody for more than 14 hours. The court heard there had been a party at the house he shares with parents Wayne Senior and Jeanette. When the alcohol ran out there was a dispute over who should go to buy more, according to Rooney's solicitor Richard Derby. The lawyer claimed the East Villa player told his guests: 'I pay for everything, you're in my house so why don't you go and get it.' He was arrested after officers spotted a black Audi A3 driving erratically into the grounds of the property. Rooney was seen stumbling into the house and his manner alarmed the officers, who were concerned he was unfit to drive. The court heard he became 'instantly aggressive', threatening to sue the police for trespassing and have them arrested. Football mad: Graham, left, now plays for East Villa in the Liverpool County Premier League, while Wayne right, plays for Manchester United and England . A breath test found him to have 128mg per 100mg of alcohol in his system - more than three times the limit of 35mg.

An injured cuckoo who was flown business class to Italy to catch up with her migration trip has now completed an emotional release back into the wild. Idemili, a two-year-old cuckoo,  set off for her epic migration from . Brechfa Forest in Carmarthenshire, Wales, with four male companions  but . soon found herself in trouble. She made it only as far as Tolworth in . Surrey, where she was discovered the worse for wear in a garden, . malnourished and emaciated and unable to carry her GPS tag which allows scientists to track her movements. Comfortable: Idemili was flown to Italy by British Airways to continue her epic journey . But after a month of care at the . Wildlife Aid Centre in nearby Leatherhead, she was flown to Italy by . British Airways to continue her epic journey, crossing the Mediterranean and . then the Sahara desert before finally arriving in the Congo. Cuckoos tend to leave England during . July or early August. Idemili was travelling in her own seat – a . business class one would have cost £379 if booked this month – and was . accompanied on the flight from Gatwick by vet nurse Lucy Kells from . Wildlife Aid. Flying high: The cuckoo settles into her business class seat - and she slept for almost all of the journey . Only the best: The cuckoo had to go through security and even had a taste of the business class lounge . Almost immediately after releasing her . the cuckoo called back to her travel partner - a touching moment which . provoked a flood of tears. Ms . Kells said: 'All through the build up to Idemili’s flight and release I . was so nervous, I just thought ‘something is going to go wrong’. 'But British Airways were amazing and everybody at the airport knew what was going on when we arrived. 'We went through the security and whizzed straight through to our business class lounge - something I’ve never experienced before. 'We didn’t have to queue to get onto the plane either - in fact everyone parted to let us through - we were treated like royalty, it was surreal. 'Idemili was very brave throughout the flight, she actually slept the whole way and it was me that was constantly leaning over to see if she was OK. 'She is such an awesome bird and a real calm character.' The pair touched down in Turin and . were greeted by two University of Turin students, Dan Chamberlain and . Enrico Caprio, who had helped organise Idemili’s release. She was let off into the wild from the Association Center for Storks in Racconigi near Turin. The plan was to release the Idemili the day after arriving but Ms Kells  felt it was in the bird’s best interests to do it sooner rather than later. Flying without wings: British Airways staff carry the cuckoo through the terminal before she was released . And as the Association Centre had heard the call of a nearby cuckoo very recently, it was agreed to release that same day. Ms Kells added: . 'I am so grateful to Dan and Enrico, they knew exactly what the best . release site was for Idemili - it was a gorgeous place. 'Actually letting her go was very . emotional as I had got quite attached to her - there were a few tears . shed, but it was happy crying. 'I think the sudden realisation set in that I would probably never see her again, but it was a moving experience. Free: The cuckoo was let off into the wild from the Association Center for Storks in Racconigi near Turin .

'It was a hell of a privilege to have dealt with Idemili because in 21 years of being a vet nurse she is the first cuckoo I have seen.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:21 EST, 5 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:42 EST, 6 August 2012 . Half a million Sikhs in the U.S. have worried about their safety ever since the September 11 attacks, when some began targeting adherents of a peaceful religion that stresses the equality of people. Those fears came true on Sunday, when six worshippers were gunned down at a temple in suburban Milwaukee in a massacre which police believe was an act of 'domestic terrorism'. While police have not identified the gunman, who was killed by police, or described a possible motive for the Wisconsin shootings, several leaders of Sikh organizations nationwide say the killings have brought to the surface fears that have lingered since 9/11, when some ignorant about their beliefs began mistaking them for potential terrorists. Nightmare: Armed police outside the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in response to a massacre which left six worshippers dead on Sunday morning . Grief: A Sikh man wipes away a tear in the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Wisconsin . 'This is something we have been fearing since 9/11, that this kind of incident will take place,' said Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Washington-based Sikh Council on Religion and Education. 'It was a matter of time because there's so much ignorance and people confuse us [as] being members of Taliban or belonging to Bin Laden.' Valarie Kaur, 31, a filmmaker from New Haven, Connecticutt who has chronicled Sikh attacks for 11 years, said the shooting 'is reverberating through every Sikh American home,' where the worst is feared. 'We are experiencing it as a hate crime,' she said. 'Every Sikh American today is hurting, grieving and afraid.' The cloth turbans worn for centuries by members of the Sikh faith so they could better serve their communities through a commitment to the oneness of God in all faiths and equality for all people has ironically made them targets of those ignorant of their history, she argued. 'That turban has tragically marked us as automatically suspect, perpetually foreign and potentially terrorists,' Ms Kaur said. Horror: Sikhs have long feared a backlash from people who confuse them with jihadi terrorists . Confusion: Many members of Sikh communities in the U.S. have felt victimised since September 11 . Amarjit Singh, vice president of the Illinois Sikh Community Center, which serves 5,000 Sikhs, agreed about the September 11 fears and said the congregation prayed for the slain victims as word of the shooting spread. 'We have a lot of families who have family members that attend that temple,' Mr Singh said. 'It seemed so random.' Two elderly men wearing turbans were shot to death in March while taking a walk in Elk Grove, California, and police are investigating it as a hate crime. Days after the 2001 terror attacks, a Sikh man was killed in suburban Phoenix. The man who was later convicted of his death had told his wife that 'all Arabs should be shot'. And at airports, controversy has erupted when airport workers try to search or remove Sikh turbans, considered sacred in the Sikh faith. Comfort: A father holds his daughter near the scene in Oak Creek where six Sikhs were shot dead . Tragedy: On Sunday, Sikhs were faced with a disaster many had feared would eventually come to pass . Though there were no known threats, the New York Police Department announced it was increasing coverage in an abundance of caution in and around Sikh temples. Harkirat Sandhu, 45, of Hanover Park, Illinois, a member of the Sikh Religious Society of Chicago for more than 10 years, said he worried more Sikhs could be targeted. 'The Sikh community is a peaceful community,' he said. 'We don't believe in this type of hate and crime. We condemn this situation.' 'Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters,' said Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the New York-based Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organization in the U.S. Barack Obama and his presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, expressed their sorrow in statements.South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, whose parents are Sikh, posted a statement with condolences to 'the innocent victims and the family of the heroic officer' on her Facebook page. Ms Kaur, the filmmaker, said she was encouraged by the outpouring from others, unimaginable a decade ago. 'My phone has been ringing off the hook,' she said. 'That gives me hope. Any expressions of solidarity, messages, prayers, will be felt not only by Sikhs in Milwaukee but all over the country.'","Many Sikhs have felt victimised since September 11 attacks .

The family of a war hero have finally had the mystery about his World War Two death solved - after being reunited with his Will which had been undiscovered for 67 years. Private Gordon Heaton died on the Normandy battlefield in 1944 aged just 21, but his family never received his Will and Testament as they were left on a bus by a delivery boy. Amazingly, the stained documents were . recovered from a lost property box at a bus depot in Birmingham last . November, allowing staff to return the poignant letter to his family . nearly seven decades after he was killed on the battlefield. Brave: Private Gordon Heaton died in 1944, but his family have only just learned of his fate after his Will was lost and then recovered at a Birmingham bus depot . Touched bus drivers from the Acocks Green National Express depot launched a hunt to track down Private Heaton’s family - and finally let them know what happened to the hero. In a bizarre twist of fate, Pte Heaton’s great nephew was researching his family tree - and stumbled across a news release National Express had placed online, with Pte Heaton’s name on it. Pte Heaton's family have since been handed the documents for the first time in an emotional meeting. David Hall, 51, began to search for . his long-lost relative while caring for his sick grandfather, John . Heaton - the surviving brother of Pte Heaton. 'After . searching online, I found some information National Express had . released about their discovery, for someone with the name Private Gordon . Heaton. 'The information from the official records ties in with our family so we know it’s definitely him. 'Although . I’m pleased to make the discovery, I’m slightly tainted with sadness to . think a relative of mine who was fighting for his country died at the . young age of 21. 'I would rather have him with us here today.' Poignant: The Will and Testament of Private Gordon Heaton, which was undiscovered for 67 years before being found last November . The misplaced letter asks about the private effects and estate of Private Heaton, who died aged 21 . David hasn’t told his grandfather about the discovery yet due to his health but plans to when his condition improves. David, . from Halesowen, West Midlands, said: 'It will be an honour to pass . these records on to John, especially after all these years. 'I think it would be unsuitable to mention it yet, but as soon as he’s back on his feet, I will give him the news. 'I have told my mother, who was Gordon’s cousin, and she is pleased we have finally found the final piece of the jigsaw.' The . paperwork was discovered by Christine McDaid, who works at the National . Express depot in Acocks Green, West Midlands, while she was cleaning out . their packed lost property office. Christine, 43, said: 'I found it while I was moving furniture around in the lost property office so it could be painted. Documents: The Will and Testament have now been returned to Private Heaton's family after being unearthed last year . 'I lifted a heavy cardboard box placed . on top of an old metal cabinet and spotted the pristine paperwork . perfectly preserved underneath. 'I couldn’t believe my eyes when I . opened it and realised the dusty document was the signed last Will and . Testament of a 21-year-old soldier. 'It . was sent by the War Office and was also accompanied by a formal typed . letter to the soldiers’ parents informing them of his death.' The . tea-stained letter read: 'I am directed to enclose a certified true . copy of a Will executed by the late No. 4042611 Private Gordon Albert . Heaton of the Worcestershire Regiment in which you are named as the . executor.' It goes on to ask whether the soldier . had any private estate and, if not, his Army savings will be paid out in . full to the family. Christine . took it upon herself to discover the young soldier’s true identity - . and found that Private Gordon had tragically died on the bloody battle . fields of Normandy on August 27, 1944. National Express worker Christine McDaid unearthed the letter from a lost property box and was 'almost moved to tears' by its contents . She said: 'It is heart-wrenching to think that this soldier's poor family would never have received it and maybe got some comfort from it. 'It was so nice to meet the family and put a face to who this soldier was. 'It’s been nearly a year since we tried to find Private Gordon’s family - I was starting to think we would never find them. 'The documents were still in their original envelopes unopened, so someone delivering it must have left it on a bus all those years ago. 'My guess is that it was put to one side by someone in lost property and just got forgotten about as they expected someone to claim it.' The accompanying Will signed by Gordon states that he left his entire estate and all possessions to his mother, J. B. Heaton. Official records showed that the soldier, who was from Handsworth, West Midlands, was buried in Vernon Communal Cemetery in Normandy, France, alongside 15 comrades. Christine said: 'The saddest thing is that the Will is dated June 1944 and only a few months later he was dead with this letter informing his family. 'It’s been so nice to give something to Private Gordon’s family that you can see means so much. 'It was quite daunting holding on to something that is so crucial to a family, and I’m so pleased that it is now in the hands of its rightful owners.' Mr Hall doesn't believe there to be any estate of any substance left by Private Heaton, as he lived with his parents. Mrs Heaton died very soon after Private Heaton's death, so Mr Hall does not know whether or not any assets he had were passed on to her - despite the correspondence that never reached her.","Private Gordon Heaton died on Normandy battlefield in 1944, aged 21 .

'I cannot sit here in good conscience and, knowing what I've done … ask you with a straight face to give me life in prison. I can't and I won't,' William Davis III said in court on Monday. Davis, who has bipolar disorder, was found guilty of kidnapping 19-year-old Fabiana Malave from her job at a used car dealership in 2009, and proceeding to rape and kill her. He confessed without hesitation to police in Sanford after he was found and said that he forced the victim to his house at knifepoint and proceeded to rape her. The Orlando Sentinel cites the confession and says that Davis told officers she did not resist at all until he began strangling her from behind.

An elderly dementia sufferer has been forced to move seven times in just over a year, leaving his wife fuming. Pauline Hayes says she often finds husband Allan, 73, in tears when she visits him at his care home in Leeds. The 72-year-old is furious that Allan has been moved from a purpose built unit because of a reorganisation within the local NHS Trust. Allan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2006 and his wife of 41 years cared for him in their home until last June. He . has since been moved seven times something which has upset both him and . Pauline as she says his condition means he needs to be settled. Allan . was first taken into a mental health in-patient facility called The . Mount in Leeds but was able to return home after several weeks. He . was forced to return following a water infection and was then . transferred to an assessment bed in a care home, then back into . hospital, then a different care home. Most recently he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for the third time and moved to Asket Croft. Pauline . said the facility, which was purpose built for dementia patients, was . ideal to meet his needs but unfortunately Allan was moved back to The . Mount in early August. It followed a decision made by  Leeds and York Partnerships NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health care in Leeds, to centralise in-patient dementia services there as part of a plan to create a ‘centre of excellence for older people’ and Asket Croft is to be redeveloped as a community hub for mental health services in east Leeds. Alzheimer's patient Allan has been moved seven times in a year from care homes to hospitals and hos wife Pauline says she often finds him in tears . Mrs Hayes say that although the care provided at The Mount is good, the facilities are not and she questioned the judgement of moving patients away from a specially built facility. ‘The Mount does not have the lovely facilities that this purpose-built building had. ‘I want to know why they are closing these places but then re-opening them to someone else.’ ‘It’s terrible. I know he’s safe at The Mount but it’s only a stopping place.’ She said it was devastating to see the . ‘gentleman’ with whom she has four children and share six grandchildren . and two great grandchildren become a different person because of the . disease. ‘Even last year he would say “I know it’s hard for you.” ‘Then this plateau drops and their mind just goes. It’s a horrible, nasty illness.’ Change: Pauline says her husband has been crippled by the 'horrible' illness, right, and is not the gentleman he was, left . A spokesman for Leeds and York . Partnerships NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘The service at The Mount offers . far more treatment and activity and has access to the skills and . experience needed including medical and pharmacy provision. ‘The . trust has also reinvested a large resource in both memory services, . which will ensure that the need for beds reduces over time, and care . home services, so staff can support those with more complex needs who go . into long term care. ‘Due . to an increasingly ageing population we need to ensure we focus on . earlier detection rather than waiting for people in crisis who then need . a bed.’ The spokesman added that the trust accepted more could be done to improve facilities at The Mount.

Chancellor George Osborne out jogging in St James Park today, before announcing in the Commons plans to advertise the Governor job . George Osborne yesterday fired the starting gun on the race to become the next Governor of the Bank of England. The Chancellor said the job will be advertised on Friday and an appointment made by the end of the year. The successful candidate will take over from Sir Mervyn King and become one of the most influential figures in Britain. The Bank, which already sets interest rates, is being handed sweeping powers to oversee the UK’s financial system. Critics claim the Bank and its senior officials, who are unelected, wield too much power and senior MPs last night questioned the selection process. Sir Mervyn – who is on an annual salary of £305,368 and will leave with a pension paying £198,200 a year – retires after ten years as  Governor next June. His successor is likely to be paid even more as it has become a  bigger and tougher job. The choice could be controversial. David Cameron and Mr Osborne will be wary of bankers tainted by the financial crisis and the scandals that have rocked the industry. Sources close to the Chancellor said the successful candidate will need to be ‘someone who will not be pulled apart’ by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee who will quiz the new Governor. Given the tarnished reputation of some leading banks, that could rule out former Barclays chief John Varley and ex-HSBC boss Lord (Stephen) Green, now a trade minister. Frontrunners include Paul Tucker, deputy governor at the Bank, Lord (Adair) Turner, head of the Financial Services Authority, and former Cabinet Secretary Lord (Gus) O’Donnell. Sources said there was nothing to stop someone from abroad getting the job, with Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney highly rated. The Chancellor told the House of Commons the job will be advertised for the first time to ensure a ‘fair and open competition’. It will be up to an interview panel – chaired by Sir Nicholas Macpherson, permanent secretary to the Treasury – to draw up a shortlist. The appointment will be made by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and Chancellor. The new Governor will serve one term of eight years ‘ensuring the appointment will span at least two parliaments and will not be subject to undue political influence’. Mr Osborne said Sir Mervyn had been an ‘outstanding’ Governor who had helped the UK economy through ‘one of its most challenging periods in modern history’. His successor: The successful candidate will take over from Sir Mervyn King, pictured, who helped the UK economy through 'one of its most challenging periods in modern history', Mr Osborne said . Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said it was of ‘critical’ importance that MPs had a say in selecting the new Governor. He added: ‘The Governor has unprecedented powers of action in the UK economy and the Chancellor has failed to match the growth in parliamentary democracy that has evolved in recent times. ‘This was an opportunity for George Osborne to extend equivalent powers of interview to elected politicians but instead he has kept the appointment in the hands of leading government officials. ‘He is fearful of politicians holding the new appointee to account and risks an unprecedented stand-off if he attempts to put a political appointee into the role.’ The name of the new Governor will be made public by the end of the year to 'provide certainty to the markets and to manage the transition'. A new Governor is needed for the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street, London . The new Governor will be appointed for a single eight-year term in a move described by the Treasury as intended to remove 'undue political influence'. A Treasury source said the remuneration package would be decided by the Bank's ruling Court but they needed to remember 'we live in the times we do'. The open nature of the contest could potentially result in an overseas applicant filling the role of governor, but the source said the successful candidate would need experience of ""macro-economics and banking and obviously some knowledge of the British economy"". The source added: 'The Chancellor is very determined that we have a proper process that enables a wide field to apply and it is a process we will go through to ensure the best person gets the job.' Former civil service head Lord O'Donnell has been tipped as a potential successor to Sir Mervyn, along with a number of City figures both inside and outside Threadneedle Street. Mr Osborne also announced he will make his Autumn Statement to the House of Commons on December 5.

A sex attacker who molested a student was caught after she bit down on his hand - leaving his blood all over her coat. Detectives were able to track down Tony Jones using the DNA left on his victim's clothing when they discovered it matched records held on their database. The 43-year-old pounced on the woman from behind as she walked to a friend's house late at night in Coventry city centre on August 4 this year. Jones put both of his arms around her before placing his left hand between her legs and feeling her genitals over her jeans. However, when he put his right hand over the 27-year-old's mouth to stop her screaming she bit down on his fingers causing blood to splash onto her jacket and top. She bit him so hard the fingers in his bones broke, which caused him to scream and flee the scene while his victim dialled 999. Police arrested Jones the next day after DNA from his blood matched records on their database. Jones, who had to have pins inserted into his hand to heal the broken bones, was jailed for two-and-a-half years at Coventry Crown Court after admitting sexual touching. He was also order to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for ten years. Sentencing Jones, Recorder Roger Evans told him: 'This was a terrifying attack for the lady in question. 'She was subject to an attack that is going to have a long lasting effect on her and her ability to work as a student. 'It’s also the case that female students have the right to be able to walk the streets at night without being attacked in this fashion. Detectives discovered DNA left on the victim's clothes matched records held on their database (file picture) 'This was a very serious attack with serious consequences for your victim. 'I have to do my public duty. A strong element of public protection must take priority.' Prosecuting, Theresa Thorp, told the court the victim was certain she was going to be raped by Jones. She said: 'She had been working and made her way to her friend’s house on foot. 'She was on a footpath when she heard a car pull up behind her. She saw that it was a red car and it was the defendant in that car. She did not know him so kept walking. 'Suddenly she heard the defendant running up behind her. He grabbed her from behind with both arms. 'He placed his left hand between her legs and felt her over her clothes. Luckily she was wearing jeans. 'Her first thoughts were that he was going to rape her. She screamed loudly and he put his hand over her mouth. 'They fell to the ground and struggled and she bit him on the hand. She describes her teeth hurting the following day because she but him so hard. 'He got off her, returned to his car and drove off. Her top was covered in blood and her jacket was too. That was forensically analysed and that blood was confirmed to be the defendant’s. 'She is very scared of going out after 8pm and makes sure she isn’t caught on her own again.' The court heard Jones, from Coventry, had a long list of previous convictions but none of a sexual nature. John Evans, defending, said: 'The impact on the victim must have been absolutely devastating. Mr Jones is fully aware of that. 'There’s nothing within his record to suggest offending of this type is in his nature.' Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Jim Edmonds, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The victim showed great courage to fight back and did exactly the right thing in contacting police immediately so we were able to seize all forensic opportunities. 'She told how she’d bitten the man during the struggle so we sent her clothing off for fast-track forensic analysis. 'That revealed a tiny drop of blood on the back of her jacket and allowed us to make a swift arrest. 'When we arrested the suspect he was found with a bandaged finger which he claimed had been caused by trapping it in a car door. 'It had been fractured and needed pins inserting to correct it so she’d certainly bitten down hard. 'And once presented with the DNA evidence he realised he had no reasonable explanation for the presence of his blood and quickly changed his story.'","Victim bit Tony Jones so hard she broke his fingers .

Criminal: Laurence Kilby, member of the 13-strong gang of cocaine dealers, lived the high life on the proceeds of drug smuggling . A socialite who led a double life as the ringleader of a drug-smuggling gang was sentenced to 18 years in prison yesterday. Laurence Kilby is the former son- in-law of Lord Vestey, a close friend  of the Queen and one of the Royal  Family’s top serving officers. His conviction will come as a shock to the family of Lord Vestey, whose friendship with the Queen is so close that he holds the ceremonial title of the Royal Family’s Master of the Horse. Bristol Crown Court heard how Kilby boasted about his high society connections as he led a playboy lifestyle, indulging in fast cars. But despite his privileged background, police said that it was the  proceeds of crime that funded his lavish lifestyle. They described Kilby as the ‘main man’ in the international gang that smuggled more than £3million of cocaine into the UK. Kilby, who owns a motor racing business, entered the social elite when he married Flora Vestey, daughter of beef baron Lord Vestey. The Vestey family owns a 6,000-acre estate in Gloucestershire and Lord Vestey is the former chairman of Cheltenham racecourse. But the marriage was short-lived, as the couple separated in 2010 after barely two years together. Kilby, of Cheltenham, was yesterday jailed for conspiracy to supply cocaine alongside three other criminals. Another three gang members were jailed earlier this year. The 40-year-old was also charged with stealing money from the armed services charity, Help for Heroes. Kilby pleaded guilty to defrauding the charity of between £3,000 and £4,000, and received a ten-month sentence to run concurrently. Detective Inspector Steve Bean, of Gloucestershire Police, said:  ‘He portrayed himself as a well-connected socialite and businessman, whilst indulging his ambition as a minor league racing driver. Despite a privileged background, the reality was that his lifestyle was funded by the ill-gotten gains of drug-dealing.’ He added: ‘He displayed an air of arrogance and thought he could get away with it because he didn’t get his hands dirty.’ Seized: Cocaine which was found by Avon and Somerset Serious Crime Group which worked closely with Gloucestershire police to stop the gang supplying cocaine across the South West . Stashed: A secret compartment inside of a van where cocaine was found . Packaged and sealed: The gang smuggled more than £3 million-worth of cocaine . The gang operated a sophisticated network that saw cocaine shipped from Heathrow Airport to Gloucestershire and Bristol. A police surveillance operation was launched in September 2010 as they began to infiltrate the gang’s activities. The undercover sting culminated in a . day of raids in July last year when more than 100 officers swooped on . addresses in Cheltenham, Bristol and London. Police seized cocaine with a . street value of more than £1million. Addressing Kilby, Judge Martin Picton said: ‘You are at the heart of the conspiracy. You made the arrangements. ‘You attempted to make sure you kept . your hands clean and  you made sure you could not  be found in . possession of the drugs. You made sure others took the risks. ‘You have made a complete  mess of your life, both financially and personally.’","Aspiring racing driver Laurence Kilby lived like a millionaire playboy .

One of the four men killed in Tuesday’s deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was working on an intelligence mission to find dangerous weapons following the country’s violent revolution, it has been revealed. Former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty said in an interview last month that he was working as a contractor with the U.S. State Department and was on a mission to find surface-to-air missiles, then destroy them. He was killed along with America’s Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens. Killed: Glen Doherty, 42, has been named as one of the two security officials who died in the attack on the U.S. consolate in Benghazi on Tuesday night. He was a former SEAL and trained sniper . In the interview with ABC News, the contractor said that he went around Libya, following reports of possible MANPADS. U.S. officials were worried that these powerful weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists if left in-tact. To destroy them, Doherty said that he would roll over the weapons in their vehicles. Doherty, originally from Winchester, Massachusetts, was killed while seeking cover from gunfire in Benghazi in an attack that claimed the lives of three other Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. Doherty, 42, who was active in a group that fights against religious proselytising in the U.S. army, was working for a private company providing security when he died, his sister, Kate Quigley, said. 'He was on security detail and he was . protecting the ambassador and also helping the wounded' when he was . killed, she told the Boston Globe. 'He was the most wonderful person,' his mother, Barbara Doherty, added to WCVB. 'We are all in pain and suffering.' He worked as a ski instructor in Utah throughout his 20s and attended flight school before keeping a promise he had made himseld - that if he had no profession by the age of 30, he would join the Navy. He trained as a sniper and medical officer with the Navy SEALs, and served in Iraq and Afghanistan He served for seven years before leaving to work at the security company four years ago. Doherty had been on a tour of Libya and had returned to the country just six days before his death. Loved: His family called Doherty 'the most wonderful person' and 'the best of the best' at his job . Devoted: He spent seven years in the Navy and worked against religious proselytising in the military . He was also reportedly an active member of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), an advocacy group which fights inappropriate religious encouragement inside the armed forces. Doherty was also a trainer at Sealfit, a fitness company founded by a fellow SEAL veteran, and wrote on his Facebook page that he enjoyed biking, surfing and flying. 'You have to understand, Glen was . highly . trained. He was the best of the best. He wouldn't have gone down for . some protest over a movie,' Quigley said, referring to reports he was . killed amid riots across the Middle East over an anti-Islam film. 'This was serious, . well-planned, well-executed. He was very good at what he did... I never thought he’d be another victim of September 11.' According to reports from U.S. officials, Doherty died while trying to take cover from gunfire in the annex near the main consulate building. Struggle: Kate Quigley, with and her husband Mark, speaks out about the death of her brother . Holding it together: The Quigleys speak with police as they face the press over the tragic news . He is the latest victim to be . identified after the government confirmed U.S. Ambassador to Libya . Chris Stevens, 52, a career diplomat devoted to bringing democracy to the North African nation, had died. Sean Smith, a foreign service information . management officer and married father-of-two who had been with the State Department for ten years, was also killed. The name of the fourth American, also a security official, has not been disclosed. They were killed when a . group of U.S. employees went to the consulate to try to evacuate staff . as the building came under attack by a mob wielding guns and rocket . propelled grenades. Stevens is the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in . an attack since 1979, when Ambassador Adolph Dubs was killed in . Afghanistan.

Attack: The four men died after riots over an anti-Islamic film stormed past the U.S. embassy in Benghazi . Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . An anti-Muslim . film was initially blamed for inflaming protestors who attacked and . burned the consulate - but U.S. officials have since said the attack was . planned and used the riot as a cover. They suggested it may be linked to Tuesday’s anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, and may be a revenge attack by al Qaeda for an American drone killing their second-in-command in June. The Obama administration has begun what appears to be a terrorist hunt in Libya, as evidence mounts that the attack was perpetrated by well-armed thugs and not an out-of-control crowd. Marines have swooped in to protect the consulate, while drones may be sent over Libya to collect intelligence.","Glenn Doherty was killed in Tuesday's attack at U.S. consulate in Benghazi .

The career criminal accused of raping a 73-year-old woman in New York's Central Park on Wednesday bragged about how he murdered an elderly cleaning lady and terrified his neighbours so much that they bought guns to protect themselves when he was released from prison, it has been revealed. David Albert Mitchell's one-time girlfriend told how the accused rapist boasted about killing Barbara . Flake in the tiny West Virginia community of Jenkinjones, an . impoverished and tightknit community in the state's southern coalfields. But his half-brother has since leapt to his defence, claiming he was overwhelmed at the time by his evil alter ego, Johnny. Scroll down for video . Monster: David Albert Mitchell, who is accused of raping and robbing an elderly woman in Central Park, bragged about murdering two women, according to his ex-girlfriend . Joe Mitchell, 42, said he believes . his brother suffers from a split personalitly disorder, backing up his . claim with an eerie rendition of the first time he 'met' Johnny . face-to-face. 'We fought down the driveway, he broke my back and hit me in the back with a brick,' he said, according to the New York Daily News. 'That's the first time I met him and the last time he came out to meet me … I ain't met him since.' 'I guess y’all met him out there [in New York].' Joe. aged 22 at the time of the alleged attack, said he had to wear a back brace for six months. He is convinced it was Johnny who brutally raped the 73-year-old birdwalker in Central Park, not David. Police determined Flake died from a blow to the head . when they found her skull two years after she disappeared from her . home in 2002. But there was never enough information or probable cause to arrest . Mitchell, said Virginia State Police Sgt. C.F. Kane. 'In . a social setting, when there's alcohol involved, he will tell you . anything,' Mitchell's . former girlfriend, Saretta Mitchell, said. 'He bragged to me and some of our friends at . different times that he had murdered two people.' And, Mitchell allegedly frightened the residents of Jenkinjones for years - a neighbor says locals were so terrified after his release from prison last year they bought guns to protect themselves. Authorities say David Albert Mitchell has been in and out of prison since he was 18. He was arrested twice on charges of raping elderly women, suspected but not charged in the murder of one female neighbor and acquitted of killing another. Court records and prosecutors describe a man who drank heavily, was quick to threaten violence, never earned a high school diploma and may have been mentally ill. Mitchell served eight years in a Virginia prison for the 2003 abduction of ex-girlfriend Saretta Mitchell and got out last year. Records show he violated probation three times, then apparently fled to New York, where police say he attacked a 73-year-old birdwatcher in Central Park near a memorial to peace-loving John Lennon. Terrifying: Mitchell allegedly frightened the residents of Jenkinjones, Virginia for years - a neighbor says locals were so terrified after his release from prison last year they bought guns to protect themselves . Mugshot: An undated mugshot shows Mitchell, who police have just arrested for brutally raping a 73-year-old woman; he was released from prison last year after serving eight years for abducting his ex-girlfriend in 2003 . Criminal history: Mitchell's first felony arrest was in 1989, when he was accused of killing 86-year-old Annie Parks of Jenkinjones . Back in Jenkinjones, a hard-luck coalfields town of fewer than 300, a man well-acquainted with both Mitchell and some of his alleged victims said it's best if New York locks him up for good. He said when word spread of Mitchell's release from prison last year, people started buying guns to protect themselves because he had terrorized people in the town and preyed on elderly women for years. Career criminal: Mitchell has been arrested twice on charges of raping elderly women, suspected but not charged in the murder of one female neighbor and acquitted of killing another . 'They ain't gonna trust him down here again. They're gonna end up killing him,' said 45-year-old Wayne Mitchell, no relation to the suspect. 'To be honest with you, he needs to be put away for life.' Jenkinjones is an isolated, unincorporated town in McDowell County, an economically desperate part of the struggling West Virginia coalfields. More than a third of the population lives in poverty, with median incomes less than half the U.S. average. People have been fleeing McDowell for decades as the once-thriving coal industry died, and the population plummeted nearly 19 percent in the past decade. Drug abuse is rampant, schools and students are struggling, and it's historically been ranked among the nation's unhealthiest counties. It's also just miles from the Virginia line, a location that helped Mitchell build a criminal resume in both states. His first felony arrest was in 1989, when he was accused of killing 86-year-old Annie Parks of Jenkinjones. Although Mitchell was acquitted in that case, he was arrested again a few months later, charged with raping another Jenkinjones resident who was in her 70s and stealing her gun. Prosecutors dropped the sexual assault charge in that case under a plea bargain, Sid Bell, then Mitchell's attorney and now the county prosecutor, told The Charleston Gazette. Mitchell escaped for two days while serving that sentence, West Virginia Division of Corrections spokeswoman Susan Harding said, and was then convicted of the escape. He was released from the Mount Olive Correctional Center in February 2000, Harding said, but incarcerated again in December 2000 on a grand larceny charge. He finished that sentence in 2001. Disgusting: The 42-year-old, pictured, spat as he was escorted out of the police building yesterday . About a year later, 54-year-old Barbara Flake went missing from Jenkinjones, and some suspected Mitchell. When Flake's skull turned up two years later, ex-girlfriend Saretta Mitchell went to police with a shocking claim: David Mitchell had confessed to the killing. 'In a social setting, when there's alcohol involved, he will tell you anything,' she said. 'He bragged to me and some of our friends at different times that he had murdered two people.' Saretta Mitchell declined to elaborate on her relationship with the rape suspect, saying she fears for her safety and that of her children. Sgt. C.F. Kane said investigators considered David Mitchell a person of interest in Flake's death, but they lacked evidence to charge him. They reached out to authorities in New York on Friday to find out if Mitchell has said anything about the 2002 slaying. Police: Officers, pictured, cordoned off the area in Strawberry Fields yesterday . NYPD: Police, pictured at the crime scene, have released video footage of the suspected rapist . Wayne Mitchell said Flake was a sweet, generous woman who cleaned houses for a living and never bothered anyone. 'If you asked her for $5, she'd give you $10 -- if she had $10,' he said. 'She was just like your own mother.' About a year after Flake disappeared, David Mitchell was charged in Virginia with kidnapping his ex-girlfriend. The indictment says he stole a vehicle and used it to abduct Saretta Mitchell, and that he drove drunk while evading police. 'It was a scary incident,' said Tazewell County Prosecutor Dennis H. Lee, 'and thank God he was stopped before doing whatever he intended to do with her.' Although he'd been arrested many times in Virginia, the abduction was the case that sent him to prison for the first time there. He served eight years at Red Onion State Prison, a maximum-security facility reserved for the worst of the worst offenders. When he got out, he was placed in a halfway house in suburban Richmond and initially met the conditions required of him, according to a probation report filed in Tazewell County Circuit Court. Mitchell worked with a tutor and was trying to obtain his GED. He was passing random drug-screening tests. Lee said some records that haven't been made public indicate Mitchell may have schizophrenia. Scene: The attack took place in a popular area of the park dedicated to John Lennon . But a month into the halfway house stay, Mitchell claimed he was robbed of $125 while working a construction job, 'became very irate and threatened to kill everyone,' the probation report said. Mitchell agreed to a psychological evaluation but was thrown out of the halfway house over fears about his mental state. He went back to prison for probation violations last October but failed to report to his probation officer when he was once again released. 'He just dropped off the grid,' Lee said. Authorities believed he might have been living in a tent in West Virginia. Then came word of the rape in Central Park. Police there say he raped a birdwatcher who told police that she had taken a photo of Mitchell fondling himself days before the attack. She said Mitchell tried to take the camera away from her and demanded she delete the image. Then, on Wednesday, he attacked her in a wooded area near the busy Strawberry Fields section of Central Park, she told investigators. He was also charged with threatening a man with a knife last month in the same area of the park. He told the man, according to investigators: 'I have no problem stabbing you as many times as I want and making this circle full of blood.' Mitchell was arraigned Friday on charges of first-degree rape, robbery, assault and other charges, and ordered held without bail. A call to his attorney at arraignment was not returned. Mitchell said nothing as he was led from the special victims unit to face charges in court Friday, but he spat at reporters gathered there. Saretta Mitchell said she's not surprised by the latest accusation, but neither she nor his brothers want to talk about Mitchell. 'We want something to be done so he doesn't hurt anyone else,' she said, 'but he's done enough damage to the family already.'","David Albert Mitchell, 42, allegedly boasted about killing Barbara Flake, a West Virginia cleaning lady who was murdered in 2002 .

Ashley . Moran, a freshman from Houston, said she was waiting to get into class . when word quickly began spreading among students to leave immediately. She described the evacuation as orderly but tense. 'It makes me really nervous I just know we're supposed to get out,' she said. This morning an UT-Austin spokesman, told USA TODAY: 'We have emptied the buildings and we have told folks to stay far . away,' said Tara Doolittle. 'No decision has been made on whether to hold afternoon . classes. We're working with local and federal law enforcement to ensure . that the campus is secure.' One University of Texas at Austin student explained how no one was unduly worried at first by the alert. 'Everyone was on the phone ,and I thought it was normal,' said Bethany Wagner. 'It became too much when I went by the tower and 500 people were walking . away. A man said, ‘Get away from the buildings!’ I think he was just . being overzealous. 'No one is taking it seriously, everyone was laughing. But if something happens I want to be by the action.' North Dakota State University in Fargo has also received a bomb threat this morning and has evacuated its campus just like University of Texas at Austin . Meanwhile, over 1,000 miles north in Fargo, the campus of North Dakota State University was evacuated after a bomb threat was phoned in this morning. An emergency message sent out to students and posted on the university's . website this morning ordered all students and employees to leave campus . by 10:15 a.m. 'This is an emergency message from North Dakota State University,' read the alert. 'NDSU is requiring all employees and students to . leave campus by 10:15 a.m. 'This includes residence hall students, who, . if necessary, should walk to locations off campus. This also includes . the downtown buildings and agricultural facilities. 'NDSU received a bomb threat, prompting this evacuation.  Updates will follow. ' More than 20,000 students are enrolled at NDSU. The bomb threats at the universities followed a U.S. intelligence . bulletin that warned the violent outrage aimed at U.S. embassies could spread to America. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI said, 'the risk of violence could increase both at home and abroad as the film continues to gain attention.' 'First responders should remain aware of the potential for spontaneous large crowds and protests that could overwhelm resources and should be vigilant for possible efforts to encourage peaceful protesters to commit acts of violence,' continued the warning. It urged 'faith-based organizations to promptly report suspicious activities that could indicate pre-operational plotting against Jewish, Coptic, Islamic, or any other faith-based communities.' It added that there was no information regarding any specific threats.","University of Texas at Austin received a threat at 8.35am that explosive devices would detonate after 90 minutes .

A . still life painting by Sir Matthew Smith, sometimes called the ‘English . Fauvist’ because of his link with Matisse, is expected to fetch more . than £30,000. The collection, which numbers several hundred items, is expected to fetch a six figure sum at the auction at Duke’s saleroom in Dorchester, Dorset on  September 27. Avid collector: Lady Marion Rootes, seen here age 65 on holiday, housed a collection of remarkable . artworks that are now set to make a six figure sum when they go under the hammer later this month . Great beauty: Lady Rootes was regarded as one of the most beautiful women of her generation . Lady Rootes, who was in her 90s when she died, married into the family that founded car giant Rootes Motors, which supplied cars to Royalty. Two generations of the magnificently wealthy family collected art to decorate their enormous properties in England and Scotland. Rootes Motors was founded by William 'Billy' Rootes after WWI. Mr Rootes' son Geoffrey married Marian, who was a widow. Lady . Rootes father-in-law provided cars to the rich and famous and made sure . his chauffeur and car was available to the Duke of Windsor upon his . abdication. It was the same vehicle, a Humber known as Old Faithful, that Field Marshall Montgomery used throughout the war. He . also ensured that Sir Winston Churchill always had a succession of much . loved Humbers when there was a post-war shortage of motor cars. In . 1946 he bought the Glenalmond Estate in Scotland, a magnificent . 16,000-acre sporting estate with grouse moors, stalking, pheasant . shooting, duck flighting lochs and game fishing. At its heart stood a large house which he bought complete with contents, including silver and linen. Lord . Rootes and his wife had it beautifully re-decorated by John Fowler and . for 35 years it was the setting for many happy house-parties and . excellent sporting holidays. Rather special: A still life painting by Sir Matthew Smith, sometimes called the 'English Fauvist' because of his link with Matisse, is expected to fetch more than £30,000 . Exquisite: A mahogany early George III chinoiserie wall mirror could fetch more than £50,000 at the auction in Dorchester, Dorset . The guest list was illustrious, with Harold Macmillan among the distinguished guns listed in the Game Book. Lord . Rootes was honoured with an hereditary peerage in 1959 in recognition . of his role in promoting Britain’s interests abroad as Chairman of the . Dollar Exports Council. He . took the title of Baron Rootes of Ramsbury, having bought Ramsbury . Manor in Wiltshire a year earlier. The house was considered one of the . most beautiful in the country. When the Rootes' bought Ramsbury is came with many great paintings and the collection was added to by the family. ...And furniture too: A George III serpentine commode in the manner of Chippendale is expected to fetch more than £5,000 .

Benefit cheat: Fanta Sesay, an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone fraudulently stolen more than £400,000 in benefits while holding down two jobs in London . A benefit cheat asylum seeker from Sierra Leone fraudulently stole more than £180,000 in benefits while holding down two jobs. In a scam carried out over nine years, Fanta Sesay pocketed £20,800 in income support, £121,000 in housing benefit and £38,700 in child tax credits between 2005 and her arrest in April this year. Not legally entitled to work, the Sierra Leone national gave a false name, National Insurance number and date of birth in order to work as a nursing assistant at Homerton Hospital and at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London, earning more than £240,000 from her employment. In total the 41-year-old of Plaistow, London falsely claimed more than £420,000 in what Judge Lindsay Burn said was a ‘very serious fraud’ and sentenced her to 28 months jail. He said in Inner London Crown Court: ‘Many members of the public would be concerned that a person who was caring for them had got the job under a false identity.’ Rebecca Randall, defending Sesay, said: ‘Potentially, her life in the UK is now over.’ Sesay arrived from Sierra Leone but her application for asylum was turned down. As immigration services were due to deport her she married a British citizen and was granted indefinite leave to remain in August 2005. Sonal Dashani, prosecuting, said: ‘During the time up to and including August 2005, when her immigration status was pending, she was not entitled to any public funds, i.e. benefits, or to work. ‘This is the warning given to all people entering this country.’ In January 2003, however, she started working at Homerton Hospital under a false name, giving a false National Insurance number and a false date of birth ‘in order that she could not be detected or the authorities would have been aware of the other income.’ While still working at the hospital, in September 2005, she made her first claim for income support on the basis she was a single parent who was not in employment or in receipt of any other funds. Around the same time, she made a claim for child tax credit claiming she was not working in the UK. Ms Dashani said: ‘Given the amount of income support she was in receipt of, she would not have been entitled to tax credit.’ The funds continued while she left . Homerton and in August 2009 and started working at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, again giving a variation of her name and a different National . Insurance number. False details: Sesay gave a false name, National Insurance number and birth date to start working as a nursing assistant at Homerton Hospital, left. She then worked at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, right, giving a variation of her name and a different NI number, earning more than £240,000 altogether while not entitled to work . Sesay admitted handing her employers false names and National Insurance numbers and pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits in respect to council tax and housing benefit. She also admitted to being knowingly concerned with fraudulent activity, obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception and fraud by false representation. In sentencing her to 28 months jail, Judge Burn said: ‘You obtained that money which is, quite frankly, a huge amount, by running two parallel fraudulent activities. ‘You came here from Sierra Leona and because of your immigration status you were not entitled to work and you knew that was the position.’ Ms Dashani said that the money ‘goes in and it is simply used’ while some of it went to Sierra Leone which cannot be traced. She said: ‘Her immigration status is under review because there is a question mark over whether that was a genuine claim or not.’ 'Serious fraud': Judge Lindsay Burn said the money Sesay obtained was . 'quite frankly, a huge amount, by running two parallel fraudulent . activities' at Inner London Crown Court (pictured) yesterday . Earlier this month Somali man Karmal Mustafa, 29, dishonestly claimed £38,856.50 of income support, council tax and housing benefit while working over a seven-year period to support two families. He escaped a jail term after the judge handed him a 24-week suspended sentence, ordered him to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and pay £250 costs. Gaye Williams, 38, faced court in August after she pretended she was a single mother claiming council housing and tax benefits as well as income support while her husband, Glyn, was earning as much as £1,500 a week and her son was privately educated. The judge gave them six months to save up to repay a significant part of the loss of more than £11,500 and avoid prison sentences.","Fanta Sesay claimed fraudulently claimed £180,500 in benefits while earning more than £240,000 from her employment .

Sergeant Jonathan Eric Kups, of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) who died at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Southern Afghanistan, on Friday . A serviceman who died in Afghanistan yesterday was named tonight as Sergeant Jonathan Eric Kups of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). Sergeant Kups, who was 38 and from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, was an electronics technician, and was described by his commanding officer as 'a man of real substance'. The MoD said earlier that the death of Sergeant Kups was not thought to be the result of hostile action, though an investigation into the circumstances was continuing. His death at Camp Bastion, where Prince Harry is currently based, has raised speculation that the Sergeant may have committed suicide. He leaves behind his wife and three children. Sgt Kups' death brings to 432 the number of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001. His devastated family issued a statement paying tribute to a 'wonderful husband and loving father'. They said: 'Jonathan was a wonderful husband and loving father to three children. He was a loyal man with a wide circle of friends, a devoted son, son-in-law, grandson and brother.' His children said: 'You're the best Dad; always in our hearts - our hero.' Lieutenant Colonel Mark Smyth, Commanding Officer, 104 Force Support Battalion Reme, said: 'Sergeant Jonathan Kups, or 'Koops' as he was known, arrived at the Battalion in 2011. 'A real character, his dry and quick-witted sense of humour made him a pleasure to work with and he was extremely popular across all the ranks. 'A man of real substance, Sgt Kups' maturity and considerable experience enabled him to quickly become a vital member of the Electronics Platoon.' His 'clear and dynamic leadership' guaranteed success, Lt Col Smyth added. The serviceman joined the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in June 1992, training as an electronics technician. He specialised in the early years of his career in radar and ground to air weapons, completing an operational tour in Northern Ireland. Sergeant Gareth Thursby, left, and Private Thomas Wroe, both of 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment were killed in Afghanistan last Saturday, after being fatally shot by a rogue Afghan Local Policeman in Check Point Tora in the Nahr-e-Saraj District of Helmand Province . In 2011, Sgt Kups moved to 104 Force Support Battalion Reme before being attached to 4 Close Support Battalion Reme for its deployment. He was described as a 'family man' who 'loved the gym' by his colleague Lance Corporal James Sowersby, of the Electronic Counter Measure Section, General Platoon. He said: 'Sergeant Kups was a family man who was always talking to the section about his three children and his wife. 'He received many letters every day. He loved the gym and he could be there up to three times a day to maintain his fitness. Prince Harry (L), who is currently stationed in Camp Bastion, Helmand, is shown the Apache helicopter flight-line by a member of his 622 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, part of 16 Air Assault Brigade at the base . 'He was good at his job and will leave a large gap in our small section.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'I was saddened to hear of the death of Sergeant Kups. 'I understand that he was an extremely experienced soldier who always took great care and time to help develop and support all those around him. My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.' Sgt Kups was one of two service personnel to die yesterday. The MoD also announced yesterday the death of a soldier from 28 Engineer Regiment, attached to 21 Engineer Regiment at Forward Operating Base Shawqat, Helmand province. The soldier was involved in a shooting incident at a forward operating base in the district of Nad-e Ali, the MoD said. Suicide has also been speculated. A full investigation is continuing.","Sergeant Jonathan Eric Kups of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) died yesterday in a non-hostile situation at Camp Bastion .

David Cameron has been urged to call a halt to Britain's 'dangerous' defence cuts . David Cameron risks going down in history as one of the ‘Guilty Men’ unless he calls a halt to Britain’s ‘dangerous’ defence cuts, a report warned last night. The UK National Defence Association, a pressure group comprising former armed forces chiefs, said the UK could not risk reducing armed services at such a volatile time in world history. In a report, it warned that Britain will ‘decline into irrelevancy’ unless it increases spending from only 2 per cent of national output. Author Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, who fought in Bosnia, Iraq and the Falklands, said there was concern Argentina could take advantage of our weakness and invade the Falklands. The ‘Guilty Men’ reference is from a 1940 book by future Labour leader Michael Foot and others. They accused Tory prime ministers Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain of putting the country’s security at risk by appeasing Hitler before the war and failing to arm the forces properly. The UKNDA said the global situation meant war could come unexpectedly from any quarter. It points to increased military spending by China and Russia, a volatile Middle East, piracy off the coast of Somalia and the fact that the USA is reducing its commitment to Europe’s defence. Historian Andrew Roberts said in the report the Government seems set on a course that is ‘illogical, dangerous and ultimately self-defeating’. He wrote: ‘A loyal Tory to the marrow of my being, I do not want the present Cabinet to be arraigned at the bar of public opinion as tomorrow’s Guilty Men. For on present showing, they would be found culpable.’ Announcement: Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond . Ministry of Defence civil servants will have their bonuses slashed following an outcry over the size of payouts for penpushers. Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond will today announce the amounts will be slashed by £13million this year. In future, they will be given only to a handful of individuals for ‘genuinely outstanding performance’. At a time when thousands of frontline troops are being axed and having their pay capped, civil servants have continued to enjoy bumper bonuses. In 2010-2011, they pocketed more than £40million in bonuses as British service personnel risked their lives in Afghanistan and Libya. In one case, a civil servant received an £85,000 bonus. The payments are in stark contrast to the settlement for soldiers, sailors and RAF personnel, who have had pay rises capped at 1 per cent. But Mr Hammond will announce that the total bill for bonuses is expected to be reduced by a third this year to around £30million. The average award is £430 and for those receiving the top award is £860. In future, the larger bonuses will only go to staff below the Senior Civil Service level. In 2003-4, civil servants took home bonuses totalling £24.1million. By 2008-09 they had reached an all-time high of £47.5million.","Britain will .

He was Britain's most celebrated pilot of the Second World War, who lost both legs in a plane crash, yet went on to help the Allies beat the Germans in the air. But a new documentary, while confirming his aerial brilliance, has trashed Sir Douglas Bader's 'Big Wing' tactics that used up to 60 RAF planes to smash through the enemy in a cluster. Veterans who served with him say this was a sluggish way to attack and put many other pilots at risk. Hero: Sir Douglas Bader, pictured during the war, was a celebrated pilot but his tactics have been criticised in a new documentary . Critic: Wing Commander Tom Neil, pictured, said that Big Wing's success was overrated, adding it was slow and dangerous . Wing Commander Tom Neil, 93, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar and who had 15 confirmed kills in the war has taken part in the Heroes of the Skies programme. 'They always arrived after the action,' he told the Times. 'We would be arriving home with our tongues hanging out and we'd see these 60 aircraft in close formation coming overhead, going, ""Where is all the enemy?"" Well, they'd all gone home. 'They were claiming 20, 25, 30 aircraft shot down but as far as we were concerned no aircraft were shot down. The claims by Big Wing always seemed exaggerated.' Another pilot said simply: 'Big Wing was absolute nonsense,' Bader's story is an infamous one that later made it to the big screen. In the 1930s he lost both his legs in an air crash, but rather than being a disability he used it to his advantage and returned to flying. Many airmen passed out because of the G-forces, which caused blood to rush from their heads to their legs very quickly. But because of Bader's 1931 accident he had no such problems and could push himself, his body and his aircraft to the absolute limit. Incredible: Fighter pilot Douglas Bader lost both his legs in a flying accident in 1931 but overcame his disability, rejoined the RAF in 1939, and commanded the RAF Canadian Fighter Squadron during the Battle of Britain . Celebrated: Sir Douglas's exploits in the war . made him a hero in Britain and was even recognised by the Germans . despite his various attempts to escape captivity . Legend: In August 1941 he was shot down over Le Tourquet and He was captured by German forces - pictured here - and used for propaganda purposes . From the moment Sir Douglas Bader's plane crashed in 1931, it appeared he would be lucky to live, let alone fly again. While trying low-flying aerobatics his aircraft crashed when the tip of the left wing touched the ground and both his legs were amputated – one above and one below the knee. But he wouldn't be deterred and managed to rejoin the RAF in 1939 when war broke out and within two years he was a squadron leader. In 1941 he was shot down and captured in France. German forces treated Bader with great respect. He lost his prosthetic leg when he bailed out and the Germans allowed a new one to be dropped in by the British. From then came his series of escapes. He tried so many the Germans threatened to take away his legs. Bader escaped from a hospital by tying together a number of sheets but was betrayed by a hospital worker. After the war, the French authorities sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison. In 1942 he escaped with three others from Stalag Luft III only to be found a few days later - the Germans were so concerned by his attempts they produced a poster describing him and how he walked so the public could spot him if he fled again. Finally he was sent to Colditz staying there until the end of the war - but he had tried his best to get out before then. He became even more celebrated after he bailed out over France in the summer of 1941, falling into German hands. For the remainder of the war he was a . constant thorn in the enemy's side, successfully escaping with other . Britons from various camps they put him in. He managed to evade the Germans for days at a time during various thrilling escapes - almost making it back to Britain on more than on occasion. Finally he was put in Colditz, but despite further attempts to get out, he failed, staying there until the end of the war. Heroes of the Skies started last night on Channel 5, and is formed of six, one-hour documentaries. 'Big Wing' was Bader's brainchild and he managed to convince Air Vice-Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, who led the defence of the Midlands, that it worked and it should be used. But distinguished Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park, whose area was London and the south east, disagreed as he wanted smaller and faster teams to attack the Germans. However, he was replaced by Leigh-Mallory, who decided to use Big Wing more widely. And the tactic continues to be popular with other veterans, who defended Big Wing. Sir Alan Smith, 95, who was Bader's wingman and had at least 20 confirmed kills in battle said: 'It was very logical and very sensible.He was a marvellous leader, a brilliant pilot, a dead shot and everything you relished. In a final tribute to his friend, who died in 1982, 'He didn't just save my life, he saved a hell of a lot of lives,' Sir Alan said. Tactic: This modern reenactment over Duxford shows planes using Big Wing, which used up to 60 planes to fly at the enemy .","His 'Big Wing' theory - previously celebrated - has been slammed by veterans in a new TV film .

The app - dubbed a 'friendly stalking' application - locates nearby Facebook (and, as of now, Twitter) users with similar interests to be your 'friends', located via their phones . Facebook has made its second major acquisition this year after buying social location application Glancee. The app - dubbed a 'friendly stalking' application - locates nearby Facebook (and, as of now, Twitter) users with similar interests to be your 'friends', located via their phones. Along with its purchase of Instagram for $1 billion, it's an indication that Facebook is keen to beef up its expertise in mobile technology - both apps are focused on phones and tablets, rather than desktop PCs. For an undisclosed sum Facebook, took ownership of all of Glancee’s technology and its staff in its latest attempt to crack location based services. Glancee quietly tracks users’ locations and suggests people nearby who have similar interests by comparing their profiles on Twitter and Facebook. It is different from Foursquare because users do not have to check in and works in the background until it finds a good match nearby. Users can then ask to become ‘favourites’ with people they would like to know, a process that has been dubbed ‘friendly stalking’. Glancee generated a significant amount of buzz at the SXSW festival this year and appears to have impresed Facebook more than Highlight, a similar location sharing app. The difference with Highlight is that it shows the exact location of other users on a map, whereas Glancee just tells you they are nearby. Experts said that the sale was not another Instagram which had 35million users and was a potential threat to Facebook. Glanceee only has been downloaded 30,000 times and 20,000 users using it in the background on their iPhone. Unlike rivals, the app doesn't tell you the actual location of potential 'friends' - just that they are nearby . The app is not on the scale of Instagram - it only has a few thousand users - but it's an indication that Facebook is serious about mobile apps . It comes after Facebook bought photo sharing app Instagram for $1billion and shows how serious it is about beefing up its mobile site . But Facebook is keen to make it a success after its similar ‘Places’ app failed miserably.It also bought Gowalla, which again carried out a similar function - but shut it down months later. Facebook’s move was greeted with some scepticism on some technology websites and writing on Venturebeat Jolie O'Dell said it was bad for Glancee users. She said: ‘Unfortunately for the app’s users, this was a talent grab. ‘It looks like Facebook is shutting Glancee down; users are being offered the chance to download their data, and the app has been yanked from the App Store and Google Play’s Android apps section’. In a statement Facebook said it was ‘thrilled’ to acquire Glancee.","Second big buy in advance of like May 18 stock market flotation .

A woman deputy head who with a teaching assistant lifted a six-year-old boy by the armpits and carried him into school was banned from teaching by the teacher's watchdog. Deborah Ellis, 51, of Mold in North Wales, used 'inappropriate force' after she tackled the pupil who refused to return to class and wanted to lie face down in the sun instead. Mrs Ellis who taught at the Hafod y Wern primary school in Wrexham said she had acted because she feared for the boy's safety when he refused to budge. Banned: Former deputy head Deborah Ellis 'roughly' dragged boy back to class . She claimed the school was short staffed, drug users hung about the area and there was a danger of abduction. But CCTV footage captured part of the incident in June 2010 which showed the boy being dragged. Following the incident she was sacked by the school but an the eve of an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal last March she reached a cash settlement with the local authority. At the time her solicitor said she'd suffered 'a grave injustice.' The professional conduct committee of . the General Teaching Council for Wales decided her actions amounted to . unacceptable professional conduct. Lousha Brill, who presented the case . to the committee, said Mrs Ellis was the behavioural co-ordinator at the . school and should have set an example. She said: 'She has not shown insight or expressed regret.' The panel ruled Mrs Ellis could only return to the classroom after a six month suspension and she  has satisfactorily completed courses in 'challenging behaviour and physical intervention.' Wrexham primary school where deputy head Deborah Ellis taught at . Chairwoman Rhiannon Streets said that there had been 'other options' than manhandling the boy. Mrs Ellis should have got another member of staff . to sit with the boy known as Pupil A  as she knew his mother had been contacted. She said: 'She has shown insufficient insight into . the seriousness of the incident or the inappropriateness of her . intervention having regard to the needs of the pupil.' It was also ruled she had failed to report the incident to the head when he returned from a course, not made a note of the incident, ignored Welsh Government 'intervention' guidelines and . had involved the teaching assistant in a disciplinary offence. School staff have legal powers to use 'reasonable' force to stop pupils from committing crimes, injuring themselves or others, and damaging property. Guidelines say that force should only be used as a last resort and schools are urged not to have a 'no contact' policy as it could prevent a teacher from acting. One way for teachers to intervene is to act as a block between pupils or stand in their way. In instances where there is need for more control, they can lead a pupil by the hand or arm or ushering them away by placing a hand in the centre of their back. In extreme circumstances such as fighting, self defence and attacks on other teachers, they may also use restraint. The committee also took into account 18 months after the complaint was made and while on anti-depressants she was involved in a car crash when three times over the drink-drive limit. She was subsequently convicted of drink driving. Mrs Elllis did not attended the hearing at Ewloe in Flintshire but said she was now teetotal and her overriding concern had been for the boy's welfare. She denied she caused any physically or emotionally abuse to the boy. But Simon Edwards, headmaster of the 260-pupil school, told the hearing child protection training made it clear that they must not have gratuitous physical contact with young children, only to prevent real risk and immediate harm. He was shown the CCTV footage after he returned which he said depicted the dragging of a small child and looked to him like inappropriate behaviour. After showing the film to the governors' chairman, social services were contacted and a 'child protection' investigation was launched.

On the same day NASA makes a historic encounter with Mars, one of Man's earliest rockets is setting it's own truly historic record. In the last week, Voyager 1, which floated into the heavens in 1977, has signalled it has passed two of the 'key changes' expected when it passes out of the furthest fringes of our solar system - a staggering 11,100,000,000 miles away. This is the furthest distance any man-made object has ever travelled - and on July 28th, it's long and arduous journey was broken by cosmic changes. Scroll down for video . The probe is still detecting 'spikes' in the intensity of cosmic ray electrons - which lead scientists to think it's still within the 'heliosheath', the very outer edge of our solar system. The Voyager probe has been travelling towards the outer reaches of the solar system since 1977 - it has enough batteries to last until 2020, scientists estimate . The data received from the Voyager, which travels at ten miles a second, on July 28th showed a five per cent spike in the level of high-energy cosmic rays. This implies the Voyager is moving . out of the heliosheath - the 'protective bubble' around the solar system . created from charged particles from the sun. On the same day, the level of lower-energy particles coming from within the solar system dropped by half. However, over the next three days, . these levels returned to their previous amounts, giving NASA scientists a . small mystery to study while they await for more information. For the past year, Voyager 1 used its instruments to explore the new region. It appeared to be the cosmic doldrums where solar winds streaming out from the sun at 1 million mph have dramatically eased . Voyager is now detecting the first traces of 'interstellar winds' - the signs it is finally reaching the edges of solar system . The third indicator that the Voyager . is leaving the solar system is the direction of the magnetic field, and . this is now being studied by NASA. Once all signals have been passed, . NASA can confirm the Voyager is on to the final frontier, and they . expect to provide a preliminary report on the magnetic fields next . month. Voyager project scientist Edward Stone . said: 'These are thrilling times for the Voyager team as we try to . understand the quickening pace of changes as Voyager 1 approaches the . edge of interstellar space. 'We are certainly in a new region at . the edge of the solar system where things are changing rapidly. But we . are not yet able to say that Voyager 1 has entered interstellar space.'

Jeremy Hunt pocketed £366,000 last year from his outside business interests, it emerged yesterday. The millionaire Health Secretary received the bumper payout from the publishing firm Hotcourses, which he helped set up before entering Parliament. The payments include a £285,000 dividend and £81,000 for renting the company a building it used as its headquarters. The cash is on top of his Cabinet minister’s salary of £134,565, which took his income last year to more than £500,000. An aide last night stressed that Mr Hunt has not been involved in running the firm since 2009. ‘He is a shareholder and is paid a dividend but he has no control over how much he is paid,’ she added. ‘It is not a second job and it does not impact on his job in any way – it is just a shareholding like someone owning shares in BT.’ Nevertheless the scale of the payments may raise eyebrows among low paid Health Service workers who are suffering a Government-imposed pay freeze. Mr Hunt, 45, who is married to a Chinese woman, has previously courted controversy by charging the taxpayer for lessons in mandarin. The lessons, which he has been taking since 2009, when he got married, have cost more than £3,000 to date. Mr Hunt, who was appointed Health Secretary in last month’s Government reshuffle, has also faced criticism for heading off on a two-week holiday less than a fortnight into his new job. Mr Hunt was appointed to turn round the Tories' reputation on health which was damaged by his predecessor Andrew Lansley (pictured) The latest revelations will shine a fresh light on Hotcourses, the firm co-founded by Mr Hunt in 1996. The company produces a number of websites enabling people to locate the right course. It has a string of public sector clients, including the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Skills Funding Agency, the Higher Education Funding Council and the British Council. The company’s accounts, made public this week, show its overall dividend payment of £586,000 for 2011 was sharply down on the £1.8million paid out in 2010, the year before the 50p top tax rate was introduced. The company blamed the recession for a 12 per cent fall in profits. In a jibe at Mr Hunt’s recent  holiday, Jamie Reed, a Labour health  spokesman, said: ‘With all these outside interests it’s little wonder we haven’t seen or heard from him. ‘We’ve got a silent, invisible Health Secretary earning large sums as nurses are sacked and services are rationed.’ Mr Hunt was appointed by David Cameron to turn round the Tories’ reputation on health, which had been badly damaged by the row over reforms imposed by his predecessor Andrew Lansley. He is credited with delivering a successful Olympic Games in his previous role as Culture Secretary. Mr Hunt was praised for helping to deliver a successful Olympic Games in his previous role as Culture Secretary . But in the spring he faced fierce criticism following revelations about his cosy relationship with Rupert Murdoch’s media empire while he was overseeing its failed attempt to buy the part of BSkyB it does not own.

A Florida woman who climbed on top of a manatee and rode the creature while swimming at a Florida beach on Sunday has turned herself in - and she may be charged with a crime. Manatees - large, underwater mammals also known as sea cows - are protected in the state and it is a crime to 'intentionally annoy, harass or disturb' the animals. But that didn't stop Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez - dressed in a black and white bikini top, red boardshorts and a white cap - from catching a ride on one of the creatures at Fort DeSoto Park. Molestation: Police are on the hunt for the woman, pictured, who was snapped riding a manatee on Sunday . Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies rushed to the beach at about 1pm after receiving reports of a woman 'riding' the animal. But when they arrived, the culprit had disappeared. However, a quick-thinking onlooker . managed to take photographs of the woman's joy ride. After the photos of were released by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department, the 52-year-old Gutierrez turned herself in yesterday. She reportedly claimed that she was new in town and did not know she had done anything wrong. Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Act forbids 'activities may not, either intentionally or negligently, molest, harass, collide with, injure or harm manatees.' On the run: When Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene, the woman, pictured, had disappeared . Illegal: Under Florida law, it is illegal to 'annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee' Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the manatee-molestation was 'outrageous' and warned people to leave the animals alone. 'This is manatee mating season and there are a lot of manatees around but people need to just leave them alone and not molest them and certainly not try to ride them,' he said during a news conference. 'It's pretty outrageous when somebody does that.' But the sheriff's office told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she was not arrested because the crime did not take place in a deputy’s presence. Deputies told the paper that charges would be referred to the Florida State Attorney's Office. Manatee: A manatee, pictured, is a large, herbivorous aquatic mammal also known as a sea cow (stock photo) 'It's clear from the photographs that's what she was doing,' Gualtieri added. 'We are asking for the public's help in identifying this woman so that the deputies can place the appropriate criminal charges against her.' The unlucky sea cow wasn't believed to have been hurt in the incident. But the woman, if caught, will likely face a second degree misdemeanor charge for disturbing the mammal and possibly even prison time.","Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez, 52, turned herself in yesterday, claiming she's new to the area and wasn't aware she did anything wrong ."

The new mother-of-two said: 'I spent all day cleaning, and scrubbed the bathroom from top to bottom. Then when I was bathing Madison, Steve rang and I joked I might be having contractions because I had an upset stomach. 'Next thing I knew, my waters had broken, and by the time I rang Steve at 7.23pm, the baby had been born.' Happy family: Caley Thomas and Steve Board with their children Madison, two, and baby Bobby, one week.

The first Olympic action on British . soil since 1948 began at 4pm with a blast of the referee’s whistle at . the 74,500-capacity Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The winning goal that . took Team GB one step along their way to Wembley came in the 63rd . minute from a free kick from Arsenal’s Stephanie Houghton, 27. This was the first time a women’s team has represented Britain at any Olympics, even though the fairer sex has been playing the beautiful game since 1895. One day a future Equality Act may insist on calling it simply football, but right now the women are still the underdogs. That was effectively underlined . yesterday when George Lineker, whose father Gary is the face of football . on the BBC, referred on Twitter to the triumphant side as ‘birds trying . to play football’. He told . his followers the opening event was making him ‘lose the will to live’. Blokishly, he added that he was heading off down the pub.

If they get caught they just get back up and . get back on with it.’ The crowd wasn’t the biggest women’s football has . ever seen but it carried a distinct buzz. There were chants of ‘Gee Bee, Gee Bee!’ No one ate all the pies. No one questioned whether the referee knew both her parents. There were only two yellow cards and no red ones. As far as I could detect, no one felt the need to spit, swear, or aggressively challenge decisions that went against them. So there are clearly a few things the blokes can learn from these young women. Newcomers to the sport might be surprised to see that they are not strapping great lasses. Some are barely over 5ft tall. Nor are they big money-earners. Top players command only around £30,000 a year – it would take Chelsea and former England captain John Terry less than 36 hours to top that. But now there’s some glory in which to bask. Team coach Hope Powell said: ‘We wanted them just to go out there and have fun. But they made history today, and that will never change now.’ Clearly, she needs some coaching in footy-speak at this level. What she meant, of course, is that the girls done well.

But unlike athletes today, victorious athletes competing at the Olympics 116 years were awarded a mere silver medal. Second place athletes were given bronze, while anyone who finished third came off even worse and went home empty-handed. It is believed that gold was simply considered too precious to be handing out at sporting events. First place: The front and back of the silver medal awarded to winners of the events at the first modern Olympics Games in Athens in 1896 . The details of the sporting awards emerged after original medals from the the first modern Olympics staged in Athens in 1896 have been put up for auction. The medals were due to be given to the winners of  rowing and yachting but the events were cancelled due to the rough sea in Bay of Phaleron off the Greece coast. It's unclear which specific disciplines the medals were due to be award for, but after the cancellation they were handed to Nikolaos Starvidis, the doctor from the Greek Royal Palace. They have stayed with his family ever since and are now expected to fetch almost £40,000, with the silver worth the majority of that sum. The bronze medal was given to athletes who finished second, while any one who finished third traipsed home empty-handed. Today first place gets gold, second silver and third bronze . The medals, which have a two inch diameter, were designed by Jules Clement Chaplain and on the front is a depiction of Zeus with the globe in his right hand. Upon the globe stands the goddess of victory, Nike, who is holding an olive branch in her hands. On the back is a representation of the Acropolis and the Parthenon and the Greek inscription reads: 'International Olympic Games, Athens 1896.' The medals are to be sold at Christie’s London sale in London on September 3 and are expected to attract a lot of interest . Sophie Churcher, from Christie’s, said: 'At the first modern Games in 1896 all the sailing and rowing events were postponed because the sea was too rough. The gold silver and bronze medals used for the London 2012 Olympics Games. Like those from 1894, they feature an image of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory . 'They were then cancelled and these are two of the medals that were never presented. 'At those Games the winner received a silver medal and the person coming second got a bronze medal. 'After the Games these two medals were given to Nikolaos Starvidis who was the doctor from the Greek Royal Palace. 'They have remained in his family ever since. As the medals were not inscribed we don’t know exactly which events they were for. 'Winners at the Games also received an olive branch and a diploma.

She and her husband are charged with killing their daughter Shafilea, 17, in 2003 . A mother accused of suffocating her daughter for defying her parents’ strict Pakistani culture yesterday denied playing any part in killing her. However Shafilea Ahmed’s mother Farzana said her husband Iftikhar – who allegedly held a plastic bag in the 17-year-old’s mouth until she stopped breathing – had been violent towards their daughter in the past. Mrs Ahmed, 49, who is accused of starting the murderous attack with the words ‘Just finish it here’, said he had slapped Shafilea twice for refusing to name a boy who had rung her mobile. She also claimed Shafilea had been worried about being pressured into an arranged marriage before a family trip to Pakistan, but insisted there had been no such plan. Yesterday the couple’s murder trial at Chester Crown Court heard for the first time from Mrs Ahmed, who spoke in Punjabi through an interpreter. She has always denied murder, but earlier this month the jury heard  she had changed her account of the evening in question. She now says she witnessed her 52-year-old husband hitting Shafilea that night, although she did not see the killing. She also claimed he had threatened to attack her and their other children if she ever asked him what had happened to Shafilea. The jury heard she had undergone an arranged marriage to Iftikhar, her first cousin, in Pakistan, before settling in Britain. She said they first became aware that Shafilea was secretly meeting boys when she was 16 in November 2002. She and her husband challenged Shafilea over the identity of ‘a male’ who repeatedly rang her mobile phone, but she would not tell them. Asked how her husband responded, she answered: ‘He slapped her twice.’ The case continues. Since 2003, she had always supported her husband's claim that Shafilea had run away from home after a row about her Western clothes and her relationships with boys. The prosecution claim that both parents suffocated Shafilea with a plastic bag before Iftikhar drove the body to be dumped in the Lake District. Mrs Ahmed, wearing a black headscarf, gave evidence through a Punjabi interpreter and was asked by her barrister Mukhtar Hussain QC about Shafilea's death. The jury heard Mrs Ahmed tell the court Shafilea's father Iftikhar was the last person to see her alive . The prosecution has alleged that Shafilea was murdered for becoming 'Westernised' Shafilea brother, Junyad (far left), and sister, Mevish, walk with Mr and Mrs Ahmed to court . Today, the court heard evidence from Mrs Ahmed who spoke with the aid of an interpreter. Mukhtar Hussain QC, defending Mrs Ahmed, asked: 'Did you kill Shafilea, your daughter?' Mrs Ahmed, wearing a back head scarf and purple cardigan, responded: 'No.' Mr Hussain asked: 'Did you play any part in her killing?' Mrs Ahmed said: 'No.' He added: 'Did you see Shafilea being killed?' Mrs Ahmed again replied: 'No.' She said the last time she had seen Shafilea was on September 11 2003. Mr Hussain said: 'And who was the last person to see her alive on September 11?' The defendant replied: 'My husband.' Mrs Ahmed gave evidence today at Chester Crown Court, with the aid of an interpreter (seen to her left) In addition to changing her statement about her husband hitting Shafilea, Mrs Ahmed also . claimed he had threatened to do the same to her and their other . children if she ever asked him what had happened to Shafilea. It was not until last year that . Shafilea’s younger sister, Alesha Ahmed, provided the 'final piece of . the puzzle' about her death, the prosecution said, when she disclosed . that she witnessed her parents killing Shafilea at the family home. Alesha . described how her parents pushed Shafilea onto the settee in their . house and she heard her mother say 'Just finish it here' as they forced a . plastic bag into the teenager’s mouth and suffocated her in front of . their other children. The couple allegedly murdered their 'Westernised' daughter because they believed her conduct was bringing shame on the family, the prosecution said. Alesha’s version of events appear to have been corroborated in writings her sister Mevish gave to a friend in 2008, which emerged shortly after the start of the trial. Mevish told the jury the writings were 'fiction' and that her parents played no part in Shafilea’s death. Mr and Mrs Ahmed both deny murder. The trial continues.

The crew lay exhausted on the pontoon at Eton Dorney after winning silver in a thrilling race yesterday. After being pipped to the gold by a quarter of a second, Chris Bartley was too weak to get back in the boat and row up to the podium with his crew mates. Instead he had to walk over, supported by race workers. Exhausted: Chris Bartley after the British men's lightweight four threw all their energy into winning silver . Spent: The crew drained themselves of so much energy in their rowing final they literally had to be helped from their boat . Richard Chambers, 27, and his brother Peter, 22, from Northern Ireland, Bartley, 28, from Wrexham, and Rob Williams, 27, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, looked emotional as they stood side-by-side with their medals around their necks. Bartley said: ‘I don’t remember that much of the last 250m to be honest. We were so determined to come away with a medal and get to the podium that you will literally do anything to get there. The pain is so extreme.’ Richard Chambers, who was met at the finish line by wife Abi, 26, and nine-month-old baby Joshua, said: ‘We were in absolute agony. We had a fight to the death. We are on Cloud Nine.’ The race caused controversy when a row broke out over whether the men were given a lane which exposed them to the wind, preventing them from beating winners South Africa. However, Williams – who learnt to row at nearby Maidenhead Rowing Club –said: ‘You can’t be upset when you’ve got a silver medal in the London Olympics with 30,000 Brits cheering you on.’ The silver medal is Britain's third in the rowing at this Olympics and the country's tenth overall .

Richard Chambers said: 'That was really, really brutal. We were just fighting, fighting through the whole thing to get ourselves back into contention. 'We struggled to keep with the pace of the other crews in the first quarter of the race but we dug our heels in and fought really hard.' Peter Chambers said: 'We are gutted. We were unlucky to get a silver with those conditions. We're delighted with silver but we wanted to get gold. 'Fair play to the South Africans, they won that fair and square.'

Unfortunately for Andy Murray when his kept slipping out it became a problem that was always going to cause some chuckles. The host's on Radio 4's Today programme were quick to join in the giggles as they discussed the technical glitch plaguing the Scot in Saturday's late-night encounter with Marcos Baghdatis. 'I've seen it happen before bet I've never seen it happen to Andy Murray so it was very unfortunate,' former British women's number one Annabel Croft told John Humphrys as they discussed the Mail Online's exclusive story that Murray was wearing new shorts after adidas investigated the matter. Nice try, Andy, but they've got to be white: Murray arrives for practice in blue shorts on Sunday (left), a day after the balls fell from his pocket (right) in his third round clash with Marcos Baghdatis . There is no specific rule about balls falling out of a pocket but it comes under the hindrance law. The law states that, if a player is hindered in playing a point by a deliberate act of an opponent, the player wins the point. If unintentional or outside of the player's own control then the point is replayed. When the ball fell out of Murray's pocket a second and third time it was no longer deemed 'outside of his control' and he lost the point. The pair then proceeded to discuss the tightness of mens' tennis shorts in the past. 'John McEnroe had the obvious solution,' Mr Humphrys said. 'He was saying 'back in my days it couldn't have happened. Our shorts were so tight nothing could have come out''.' Laughing loudly, Ms Croft said: 'That is true, mens' shorts in tennis have just changed shape do dramatically it's hard to believe what they used to play in because they used to be very, very tight, very short shorts, and they look quite uncomfortable when you look back on them. 'Now of course the players are rolling round on the court in these very baggy shorts down to their knees so it's a very different situation.' Asked if she would be willing to be at the forefront of a campaign for player to bring back the tight old mens' shorts of yesteryear, she said: 'Definitely not. The shorts they were today look a lot more comfortable.' The British No 1 saw the objects pop out of his pockets three times during the encounter. He was twice punished with lost points. After taking up the problem with the German manufacturers adidas, Murray will . now wear a redesigned pair of shorts when he steps on to court for his . fourth-round match against Croatia's Marin Cilic on Monday. On Saturday the ball popped out three times, each at a critical stage. The . first time it happened umpire Steve Ullrich ordered they replay the . point, but on the latter two occasions the points went to Baghdatis. While the first slip was allowed to go . unpunished, after the second and third blunders the star was penalised . under rules governing hindrance during play. Giggles: Former British Women's No 1 Annabel Croft  and Today Programme host John Humphrys joked about Andy Murray's shorts . Tight: John McEnroe at Wimbledon in 1981 wearing a pair of shorts that are much tighter than those worn by modern players . Murray, . sponsored by adidas since late 2009 in a £3m-a-year deal, has worn the . brand's Barricade Short since the start of Wimbledon. Baghdatis, . Fernando Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga wear the machine-finished . Barricade Bermuda shorts, which look almost identical but are longer. The . German sportswear giant investigated the issue before issuing a . statement, which read: 'Adidas works closely with Andy on the design of . all his kit and we believe the issues were the result of an individual . technical error in the handmade pockets of those shorts. Andy will now . wear the Barricade Bermuda short.' The sportswear manufacturer last night put the incidents down to human . error, saying the pockets on the hand-finished shorts had been made too . shallow. Murray's progress towards Sunday's final could be further disrupted by the weather and his scheduling on Court No 1. The fourth seed is due second on the uncovered show court and heavy rain is forecast. If Murray's match against Cilic cannot be completed, the Scot would be forced into playing on consecutive days. At least Murray's shorts shouldn't trouble him. After Andy Murray's tennis ball mishap, I put a replica pair of Murray's shorts to the test… . On . Murray Mount, I ran a series of 15-metre sprints, side-stepped a bit . and jumped up and down on the spot for 60 seconds but I was unable to . dislodge a ball from the pockets on Sunday. Ball wiggler: Daily Mail sports writer Laurie Whitwell tries out a pair of the naughty shorts . It was only when I violently wiggled my legs that I could get the ball to nudge even slightly. Murray's thighs are at least double the size of mine but the key difference was the pockets on my shop-bought shorts (for £30) were finished correctly. Perhaps Andy should have nipped down the High Street.","Penalised for blunder after spare service balls popped out onto court .

Air Vice-Marshall Robert 'Pinpoint' Bateson, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) and Distinguished Service Order (DSO), alongside 10 other medals for his remarkable achievements during the War. All are expected to fetch up to £25,000 when they go on sale next month, a tribute to the courageous man who directed attacks which blew Gestapo headquarters to pieces. The pilot led a special force of Mosquitos on the dangerous raids in The Hague in the Netherlands, Copenhagen and Odense in Denmark. His notable exploits included targeting offices in Copenhagen on 21 March 1945 which was crucial to the success of the war. Pilots had spent weeks meticulously . organising the attack, even creating models representing the city and . the Gestapo building to prepare themselves. The target was a six-storey U-shaped building which housed the entire Gestapo staff for the whole of Denmark. According to the RAF, the Mosquitos took off in three waves . of six, together with two Mosquitos of the RAF Film Unit at exactly nine . o'clock in the morning - just in time to meet the Gestapo workers who would be . arriving at the Headquarters.

A former opium addict has described his 20-year love affair with the drug and the vomit therapy that cured him in a tell-all book. At the peak of his addiction, Steven Martin, now 50, would smoke up to 30 pipes per day and was unable to leave his home at night for fear he might not get a fix. 'Opium Fiend, A 21st Century Slave to a . 19th Century Addiction' opens with this harrowing description of the . American author trying to cut himself off from a drug that had taken . over his life as a freelance journalist in Southeast Asia. Anything for a hit: In this photo taken in mid 2007, Steven Martin himself smokes opium in the living room of his apartment in Chinatown in Bangkok when he had a twenty-pipe-per-day opium habit . Describing the first time he tried to get help in the late 1990s, he said: 'After seven years of curious dabbling I had awoken from my pleasant . dream and found myself a voracious opium fiend with a 30-pipe-a-day . habit.' He tells how, one Halloween night, in a blacked-out bedroom in Bangkok's Chinatown, he went into physical and mental free fall. High fever oscillated with shivering cold, gut-wrenching stomach pains brought on waves of diarrhea. Howling in agony, he leapt around the room in a kind of devil dance, his body smeared with oily sweat, vomit, mucus and feces. It was then that he joined Thailand's Tham Krabok Monastery, where . hundreds of Thai and foreign addicts have sought treatment through . Buddhist monastic discipline and a vomit-inducing herbal drink in what he calls 'Thai puking rehab'. 'Hell on earth': A Western drug addict pauses over the trough during induced vomiting to detoxify her body at the Tham Krabok monastery in Thailand. Martin says their screams were so loud they could be heard in the local town . 'Here,' he wrote in The Fix, 'under the auspices of monks, novices, and nuns in toga-like robes, . you will find scores of recovering drug addicts from countries all over . the globe, ready to take a particularly unpalatable cure involving five . days of induced high-intensity vomiting.' He describes being told to kneel with other addicts over a trough and handed a shot glass containing a 'muddy potion' to drink. The result 'brought forth torrents of rust-colored puke [...] until the deluge became dry heaves.' 'Opium Fiend, A 21st Century Slave to a 19th Century Addiction' opens with a harrowing description of the American author trying to cut himself off from a drug that had taken over his life as a freelance journalist in Southeast Asia . This ritual was repeated every day 'while a crowd of spectators sang songs to conga-drum rhythms and cavorted about while we gagged and retched'. Such is the nature of coming off opium in this way, he said people who lived near the . monastery 'used to complain that at night they could hear the addicts’ screams all the way into town'. Although Martin doesn't advocate opium use, his memoir is no simple cautionary tale, nor was he your average backpacker junkie, such as still roam this region of cheap and plentiful drugs. After intensive research, Martin says he never found a detailed, honest account by an opium addict, even during the drug's heyday. 'And as a result of the almost . complete eradication of opium smoking in the traditional Chinese manner, . it seemed that such a book never could be written — that the subject . had been lost to history,' he said in an interview. 'I knew that my experiences were uncommon. I simply wanted to share my story.' It's . one that in equal measure details both the bliss the drug induced — . 'never again would sleep be so delicious; never again would dreams be so . real' — and the pain of dependence and repeated attempts at withdrawal. Five years later, now living in Los . Angeles, the 50-year-old author acknowledges the drug's continuing siren . call — as do experts on addiction. 'I think about opium every day — . that's no exaggeration,' he says. 'While sleeping I dream about smoking . opium, and sometimes I wake up from these dreams lying on my left side, . in the same exact position that an opium smoker who is right-handed like . myself would lie in order to prepare and smoke his pipes.' Old addiction: A young Westerner smokes opium by an Asian man in French Indochina in this picture from 1930 . Dr. Christian Brule, a French doctor . who coordinated drug policy at the Council of Europe, agrees that opium . addiction is extremely difficult to shed, both physically and . psychologically, the craving still there decades after the last pipe is . smoked. Big business: A Thai soldier displays opium poppies at a hilly area of Tak province during an annual search and destroy opium eradication operation. Steven describes it as 'a habit that had financed empires and made fortunes all over the world' 'We call it the syndrome of lost heaven,' he says. Martin . traces his addiction to childhood, when he exhibited a more than normal . penchant for collecting things and an allure for exotic Asian . artifacts. After a stint in the U.S. Navy he moved to the Philippines and then Thailand, home for 18 years. His introduction to opium came in 1992 in Laos, where the last of the old Chinese-style opium dens still existed. 'Opium smoking, a habit that had financed empires and made fortunes all . over the world, was now so rare that only in this landlocked backwater . could the classic Chinese vice be witnessed,' he writes. It's . still around in Southeast Asia today, but mainly used by elderly . hilltribe people and young Westerners seeking a quick, exotic thrill . while trekking in northern Thailand or hanging out in backpacker . destinations like Vang Vieng in Laos. The so-called Golden Triangle, which . includes areas of Laos, Myanmar and northern Thailand, remains the . world's number two opium producer although Afghanistan accounts for some . 75 per cent of the crop. But . almost everywhere the opium is refined into heroin, which has . supplanted the ancient opiate, along with designer drugs and sometimes . morphine. 'Only very . particular personalities still go into this hellish opium experience . these days,' says Brule, who has also worked with addicts while helming . several international organizations related to narcotics. What . hooked Martin initially was not the drug itself but obsessive amassment . of pipes, lamps and other opium-smoking paraphernalia. The first smoke: A Chinese man smokes in a very upscale opium den in China in around 1920. Steven's introduction to opium came in 1992 in Laos, where the last of the old Chinese-style opium dens still existed . He eventually gathered one of the world's largest collections, wrote a book on the subject and pursued scholarly research into opium's history, culture and abiding romantic image. An opium pipe became for him a thing of rare beauty and 'symbol of the old Orient — as archaic as rickshaws, Chinese junks and man-eating tigers.' Closer to home, he came upon the largely forgotten fact that in the 19th and early 20th century the United States was awash with opium. There were dens in Manhattan and popular songs like 'Fast Asleep in Poppyland.' ""Yen"", was originally used to mean a craving for opium. Along the way, Martin's occasional, recreational pipe led to a powerful addiction. Martin doesn't hold back when describing the pleasures he drew from the drug. He experienced 'a welling euphoria followed by a serene sense of well-being washing over me like a succession of tender caresses.' 'Opium is a charismatic lover who takes . you to heaven, giving you years of warmth and affection, and then, like a . schizophrenic, inexplicably and without warning begins putting you . through hell' - Steven Martin, former opium addict and author of 'Opium Fiend' A few pipes made him feel he could recapture childhood's boundless optimism and wonder at the world. 'Opium is a charismatic lover who takes you to heaven, giving you years of warmth and affection, and then, like a schizophrenic, inexplicably and without warning begins putting you through hell,' he notes. And Martin was entering the lower depths, rooted to his apartment, his work neglected, afraid to be away for even a single night lest he go without a fix. The death of a close companion in 2008 - possibly from sudden opium withdrawal - hit him hard. He had often smoked up to 30 pipes a day with Roxanna Brown, who remains a local legend for her expertise in Southeast Asian ceramics and her tragic life. A Vietnam War reporter, she lived in constant pain after losing a leg in a car accident and died in a U.S. prison where guards failed to provide her with medical care. Charges of alleged fraud involving smuggling of Thai antiques were dropped, the U.S. government paying compensation to her family. With the help of his detox at Tham Krabok Monastery he has freed himself from opium's grip. But the last line of his book is no ode to deliverance: 'When the cravings get particularly keen, I tell myself that when health is lost to disease or old age, I will find a way to once again to light the lamp, take up the pipe, and roll myself into sweet oblivion.'","Steven Martin, 50, first smoked opium in 1992 in Laos, where the last of the old Chinese-style opium dens still existed .

MORE than 450 council bigwigs have picked up six-figure pay-offs despite pressure to slash public spending. The biggest redundancy package of the last financial year went to Kent County Council's former managing director, Katherine Kerswell, who received a staggering £589,165 after only 20 months in the role. She lost her £200,000-a-year job at the Tory-run in December and was described as the 'architect' of a savings programme aimed at slashing 1,500 staff by 2015. The council said Ms Kerswell had done an exceptional job' at reshaping its 'approach to service delivery' and 'recasting our overall management arrangements'. More than £100,000 was also handed to 36 employees at Lancashire County Council, including two who walked away with £300,000, and 13 staff at Staffordshire County Council. Golden goodbyes of more than £200,000 were given to at least 25 council workers, including one at London's poorest boroughs, Tower Hamlets, while three Glasgow City Council top brass shared packages totaling nearly £1.3m. Development and regeneration assistant director Tommy McDonald was given £586,000, head of service development Kenneth Harkness received £425,000, and development and regeneration executive director of  Gerry Gormal picked up £288,000. The Sunday Telegraph investigation revealed many of the officials got highly-paid jobs elsewhere in the public sector, including Andrew Kerr, who was earning £131,000 as Cardiff's chief operating officer six months after walking away from Wiltshire's chief executive post with £144,000. Jo Williams was re-employed by Merton council in London within months of losing her £130,000-a-year job as head of housing, while former Scottish Borders council chief executive, began consultancy work with a quango just months after receiving a massive £318,000 pay-off. Public spending: Minister Bob Neill said councils must account for casual attitude . The figures were described as 'shocking' and 'galling' by the TaxPayers' Alliance, and local government minister, Bob Neill, said: 'Councils must account for what appears to be a very casual attitude to spending public money.' But Local Government Association spokesman, Dale Atkinson, told MailOnline: 'Councils have delivered bigger savings than almost any other part of the public sector. 'They have reduced the local government headcount by 214,000 and sliced £1.4 billion from the annual paybill. 'Ninety per cent of councils have also lowered senior staff costs. 'There are inevitable short-term costs associated with restructuring on this scale but the overall savings to the public are significant and ongoing. 'Councils will always meet the legal requirements in relation to redundancies'","More than 450 bigwigs picked up six-figure deals .

The U.S. military has halted the training of Afghan government-backed militias for at least a month to give the Americans time to redo the vetting of new recruits after a string of attacks by Afghan soldiers and police on their international allies, officials said Sunday. There have been 34 insider attacks this year – at least 12 in August alone – that have killed 45 international troops, putting intense strain on the relationship between coalition forces and the Afghans they live and work with. The shootings also have thrown doubts on one of the pillars of the American-led coalition's planned withdrawal by the end of 2014 – training Afghan forces so they can take the lead for security in the country. Stopping training: The training of Afghan Local Police forces by American troops has been temporarily suspended while they review their application policies in wake of a number of insider attacks . Lieutenant Colonel John Harrell, a spokesman for U.S. special operations forces in Afghanistan, said the pause in training affects about 1,000 trainees of the Afghan Local Police, a militia backed by the government in Kabul. 'The training of the ALP recruits has been paused while we go through this re-vetting process, to take a look at this process to see if there's anything that we can improve,' Harrell said. 'It may take a month, it may take two months, we don't know.' International forces have been re-vetting Afghan forces across the board, but U.S. special operations forces decided to stop training the ones they were responsible for – the 16,000-strong ALP – while redoing the background checks. Afghan Local Police forces that have already been trained will continue to operate, and the government will continue to recruit new members, Harrell said. Colonel Tom Collins, a spokesman for the international military coalition in Afghanistan, also said there was no set date for the training of the local police to resume. The pause in training for the government-backed militias was first reported by the Washington Post. Harrell said the Americans last month also put a two-week pause on operations by the Afghan special forces last month to re-vet those soldiers for any potential ties to insurgents. He did not say whether any suspicious links were uncovered. Exit strategy: The attacks made from within the ranks of the ALP have thrown doubts on the theory that an American withdrawal will work if the Afghan police are properly trained by 2014 . The international forces in Afghanistan have been revisiting both security for their forces and re-examining the backgrounds of the Afghan forces in the wake of the recent attacks on international troops. The Post also reported that training of special operations forces had been halted, but a spokesman for the NATO training mission in Afghanistan, or NTM-A, which oversees this training said there has been no such pause. 'There has been no halt in training with NTM-A assets as they relate to special forces,' said Major Steve Neta of the Canadian military. He also said no other training programs involving the traditional military or police have been halted for re-vetting. The head of the Afghan special operations forces said there has been no pause to the training of his forces. The program to train Afghan special operations forces had already been on break for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and had been scheduled to restart in mid-September. 'It will continue. It is not ended at all. After the 15th of September we restart,' Brigadier General Sayed Karim said. The United States and its allies have been training the Afghan army and police so that they can gradually take over security for the country by the end 2014. Bringing up the numbers: Before the pause, Americans announced they hoped to have 350,000 ALP trained . They hope to have about 350,000 Afghans trained and ready by the end of the year, and gradually have been putting them in the lead for security in parts of Afghanistan since last year. The U.S.-run ALP project is much smaller and currently has about 16,000 members around the country. The most recent insider attack took place last week when an Afghan army soldier turned his gun on Australian soldiers, killing three of them and wounding two more in Uruzgan province, according to the Australian military. Afghan President Hamid Karzai's office condemned an operation by international troops to catch the shooter, describing it as unilateral and saying it resulted in the deaths of a 70-year-old man his 30-year-old son. Karzai's office said in a statement late Saturday that the operation took place without the coordination or approval of provincial authorities and violated an agreement that calls on Afghan troops to lead night raids. The U.S.-led international coalition responded by saying that Afghan officials approved and supported the strike. In a related incident, NATO said it arrested a Taliban insurgent who was responsible for the May 12 shooting of two members of the British military in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province in the south. At the time the man was a member of the Afghan police. An accomplice was shot and killed at the scene. The man, who was not further identified, was arrested along with another suspected insurgent on August 30 in the Hisarak district of eastern Nangarhar province. Prior to the two most recent attacks, coalition authorities said they believed that 25 per cent of this year's attacks had confirmed or suspected links to the Taliban, which sometimes has infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan army and police and in other cases is believed to have coerced or otherwise persuaded legitimate members of the Afghan forces to turn on their coalition partners. Also Sunday, seven people were killed in an apparent clash between rival tribal leaders in eastern Kunduz province. The violence broke out when gunmen from one village killed the brother-in-law of a tribal leader in another, said Sarwar Husseini, spokesman for the provincial police chief.","34 attacks in past year- with 12 in August- killing 45 international troops .

Obama, who was campaigning in Bolder, Colarado, today, went on to call Eastwood 'a great actor, and an even better director' in the interview. 'I think the last few movies that he's made have been terrific,' he added. He also praised Mitt Romney's business career, describing his Republican rival as 'incredibly successful' as well as 'disciplined and hard-working'. However, Mr Obama had harsher words for his GOP rival's healthcare plans, saying they could be summarised as 'Romney doesn't care'. The President said: 'You know, he calls it Obamacare. I like the name. I do care. 'I don't know exactly what the other side is proposing - I guess you could call it ""Romney doesn't care"". But this law is here to stay.' In a fierce defence of his controversial reforms, Mr Obama said: 'Governor Romney promised that on his first day in office he's gonna sit right down, grab a pen and repeal Obamacare. 'What that means is that right away he'd kick 7 million young people off their parents' plan. He'd take hope away from tens of millions of American with pre-exiting conditions by repealing reform.'

While the President was expressing . his approval of Eastwood's performance, other leading Democrats were far . less complimentary towards last week's GOP convention. Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles who is chair of the . Democrats' convention, said the Republican plan for office 'looks like . the platform of 1812'. In an appearance on Fox News, he added that 'Reagan would be turning in his grave' over the GOP's current agenda. Campaign aide Stephanie Cutter went even further, suggesting that the convention shows Republicans 'think lying is a virtue'. Most re-tweeted: Obama's response to Clint Eastwood's speech, which featured this photo, was the most re-tweeted tweet of the Republican convention . Rahm Emanuel, the President's combative former chief of staff, was also . on the attack, saying that Mr Romney's speech had 'nothing memorable' about it. But other Obama allies were forced to be more defensive, with Maryland . governor Martin O'Malley admitting that Americans were not 'better off . today than they were four years ago' in an interview on CBS's Face the . Nation. And Bill Richardson, former governor of New Mexico, resorted to arguing . that Mr Obama would win the support of 'the international community' in . his re-election attempt. These remarks all came as . hundreds of protesters marched on 'Wall Street South' in Charlotte, . North Carolina, and the town ramped up security ahead of the Democratic . National Convention. About 600 marchers carried signs and banners, including one accusing Obama of murdering children with drones, yesterday afternoon but the lively demonstration was a fraction of the size organisers had hoped.

They had the phone numbers of lawyers written on their arms. But police officers standing nearby took no action. The group sat for about 10 minutes before getting up and moving on. At least 100 officers in plain uniforms walked along with the parade, carrying gas masks, wooden batons and plastic hand ties. A police helicopter hovered so low that people on the ground could feel the wind off its rotors. Organizers have pledged that the march will be peaceful.

Hurricane Isaac's outer bands thinned the ranks of protesters. The Charlotte demonstrators had . anti-war signs as well as those promoting unionized labor and the plight . of undocumented immigrants. One . read: 'Bankrupting America' with a font and logo that mimicked Bank of . America. Another said: 'OBAMA MURDERS CHILDREN WITH DRONES.' Participants ranged from young girls in cheerleading outfits and parents pushing strollers to Occupy Wall Street demonstrators in black shirts and red bandannas.

The route of the march was also taking . demonstrators by a major office hub for Wells Fargo. The banks are two . of the nation's largest financial institutions and beneficiaries of . massive taxpayer-backed loans during the 2008 bailout of the financial . sector. Both banks have also been criticized for roles in the home . foreclosure crisis. Before the march, the demonstrators gathered at a park on the outskirts of Charlotte's Uptown business district. Speakers addressed the crowd from a stage in front of a banner that read 'PEOPLE POWER NOW.'

A teenage robber who robbed a man at knife-point has been jailed after being caught by an iPhone tracking app. Jason Harewood, 19, had only just been released from prison for a previous knife-point robbery when, covering his face, he pulled a knife on a 42-year-old man in Fortis Green, North London on March 15 this year. Harwood, of Islington, London demanded the victim’s phone, cash card and pin number before warning him not to call police and running off. But the victim quickly rang 999 and, . while being driven around by plain-clothes officers, used a police iPad . and the 'Find my iPhone' app to track his phone to Islington, where he . pointed out Harwood. Self-employed . Harewood tried to run from police and ditched the stolen phone in some . bushes but was arrested shortly after trying to hide on top of garages. Harewood pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years at Wood Freen Crown Court. Investigating . officer, DC John Martin of Haringey CID thanked the victim for phoning . the police quickly and praised the tracker technology for its usefulness . in bringing criminals to justice. I’d like to thank the victim of this robbery for his diligence in phoning police on 999 at the earliest opportunity and having already installed and enabled the tracker app on his phone prior to the theft. 'His actions enabled police to do what we like to do best, to obtain best evidence and to arrest the offender at the earliest opportunity,” DC Martin said. 'Faced with the overwhelming evidence Harewood realised he had no option but to enter a guilty plea.' DC Martin said he was happy with the lengthy sentence dished out to Harewood. He said: 'Harewood had only been released from prison on licence a couple of weeks before carrying out this robbery, having served one year of a two year sentence for a knife point robbery just streets away the previous year. 'By carrying out a similar offence, he has shown a complete disregard for the criminal justice system and for the right of law abiding members of the public to go about their business without fear. I am pleased that he will not be walking the streets for a significant period of time.' Technology: The victim used a police iPad and 'Find my iPhone' app to track his phone to Islington where he recognised the robber (file picture) Borough Commander Sandra Looby urged people to download tracker apps for their phones and electronic devices. She said: 'This case exemplifies the professionalism and dedication of my officers when it comes to tackling violent offenders and dealing with incidents of robbery and knife crime. 'We’ve had some real successes using tracker technology to trace stolen phones and computers resulting in police returning stolen property to victims of crime, obtaining convictions and also putting those handling stolen goods out of pocket. 'Help us to help you. Search the internet for theft recovery apps or software and see which ones people recommend. While most of the basic tracker Apps are free, the more advanced ones - that take photo’s of the person using the device - do tend to have a cost. 'Only last week my officers arrested someone on suspicion of handling stolen goods after the victim of a theft presented police with photos of someone using their stolen macbook and location information.' 'I urge people to install and activate an appropriate tracker service on their device. Importantly, also set a lock code so that a thief can’t de-activate the tracker while they try to make their escape.' 'Register any serial numbers of valuable electrical items onto the immobilise.com database free of charge, as this also helps us to return stolen property to its rightful owner and to catch the people that help drive theft by their involvement in handling stolen goods. 'Remember, if you’re set to get a new phone, tablet or computer in the coming months, make sure you re-install any tracker or anti-theft software onto it.'","Jason Harewood, 19, had only just been released from prison when he pulled a knife on a 42-year-old man .

Three generations of a single family were murdered in their house during a stabbing rampage that killed a grandmother, a mother and a 14-year-old boy. The boy's 9-year-old sister watched at least one of the horrific murders in the home in suburban Nashville, Tennessee. She ran out of the house to get help, though the rest of her family was already dead when she returned. Police have arrested a neighbor, Craig Garber, who was still at the crime scene when officers arrived. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Back on track: Michelle Pinkowski, who had a history of alcohol abuse, was said to be 'doing well' and trying to take care of her family at the time of her death on Saturday . Youngest victim: Johnathan Culpepper (left), Pinkowski's 14-year-old son, was thought to be asleep upstairs when suspect Craig Garber fatally stabbed the boy . He answered the door covered in blood and said, 'just kill me.' The bodies of 48-year-old Michelle Pinkowski; her son, 14-year-old Jonathan Culpepper, and her mother, Marylea Jordan, were discovered around 3am Sunday at the Bellevue home. Police said the 41-year-old Garber, who had self-inflicted stab wounds, was in stable condition on Sunday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Garber lives a few doors down from the family and is known to have 'emotional issues.' Investigators described the scene inside the home as gruesome. 'The scene is very bloody,' Metropolitan Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron said. 'It's not something that you see in Nashville.' Evidence search: When police arrived at the scene, they banged on the door and were greeted by Craig Garber who was dripping in blood, had self-inflicted stab wounds, and said 'just kill me' Shocking: Police taped up much of the block while collecting evidence, as the suspect lived a few houses away from the victims . Mr Aaron said Garber and Pinkowski were seen together on his porch about 11pm on Saturday. He said the two may have gone to Pinkowski's home, to her finished basement, which is where her body was eventually found. Police believe Garber then went upstairs and killed the boy in his bedroom and then murdered Jordan. Mr Aaron said the young daughter, who was sleeping on the couch, saw her grandmother get stabbed and fled out a back door to seek help from a neighbor, who called 911. Police later determined that evidence and blood transfer shows that Garber likely went looking for the little girl not knowing she had escaped. According to police, the neighbor got a gun and rushed to the girl's home, where he saw Garber walking around inside. 'The way she was screaming and crying . saying ""He's killing her, he's killing her!"" I just ran,' the neighbor, . Jason Zimmerman, told WKRN-TV. The neighbor said he backed away from the home when he heard sirens. Horror: Neighbors gather near the site where Michelle Pinkowski, 48; her son, 14-year-old Jonathan Culpepper, and her mother, Marylea Jordan, were discovered around 3am on Sunday . Mr Aaron said police are trying to get warrants to search the homes of both the victims and the suspect. He said police are also trying to determine the exact nature of the relationship -- if any -- the man has with his neighbors and what the motive could be. While Ms Pinkowski has a history of . alcohol abuse and credits a stint at a recovery center for drug-addicted . mothers for her recovery, The Tennessean reports that she twice lost . custody of her children. Doing well: Ms Pinkowski worked at Athens Family Diner and had done a shift during the day on Saturday before her murder . 'Michelle was really trying to straighten out her life, she'd been in and out of jail. Marylea, the grandmother was a sweet lady who just tried to help take care of her family, and Johnathan was a little boy who was very lost who didn't know family structure,' neighbor Jackie Allison told the paper. 'Craig and his family, he was always there to help me. He was an animal lover, he was always helping Michelle. He had issues, of course, obviously.' Her sentiments were echoed by police . who said that even Garber's family admitted to their son's 'emotional . problems' though no further explanation was given. Aaron . pretty much ruled out any other suspects saying the police 'firmly . believe the man responsible for this is known, is in custody and is in . Vanderbilt'. Neighbor Josh Kirby last spoke to him the day of the murder, saying that he always got an off-putting feeling when they talked. 'He had crazy eyes. He jumped around to a lot of different subjects while trying to tell me a story and it was very unnerving,' Mr Kirby said. 'My wife, she was very scared of him from the very beginning.'

A jobless mother-of-four who starred in a BBC Panorama documentary about life on a 'Shameless'-style council estate claims the Corporation made her look worse than she really is. Olwen Page, 44, sparked outrage amongst millions of viewers after being filmed saying: 'I’ve got better things to do than go jogging down here looking for a job', whilst pocketing up to £1,100 a month in benefit handouts. The show entitled ‘Trouble on the Estate’ was screened last night on BBC1 and portrayed life on Shadsworth Estate in Blackburn, Lancashire, as miserable. Scroll down for video . Adamant: Mrs Page, 44, who has lived in and around the Shadsworth Estate in Blackburn, Lancashire for 20 years, said the BBC edited out the fact she could not work because she was 'on the sick' It described the estate as 'one of the most deprived places in . the country' and noted that 'on average, per person, had one of the . highest welfare bills in the country'. Mrs Page, other estate residents and local . councillors have now hit back at the BBC saying the Panorama . investigation had contrived to liken Shadsworth Estate to Channel 4's . drama Shameless. Mrs Page, a former teaching . assistant, who has four children by three different fathers, was filmed . explaining why she had not worked for eight years and admitting smoking . cannabis at home to 'chill out'. When her local job centre asked her to attend a meeting about her continuing unemployment she declared she was 'p****d off' at having to get a bus into town and appeared to express relief when she returned home still jobless on the show. Gritty: A grab from Panorama's Trouble On The Estate investigation, broadcast last night, which purports to give an honest depiction of life on one of Britain's most run down social housing districts . 'Misrepresented': Youths wearing tracksuits and hooded tops - all with their hoods up - mill about at recreation ground . She also blamed the authorities for one of her children being excluded from school and was given two skips, free paint and wallpaper to clean and spruce up her home. 'On the sick': Olwen Page outside her home on Shadsworth Estate . The show also claimed Mrs Page was given 'parental skills' by social workers, which included how to put her son to bed. Her daughter’s unruly behaviour was said to be so bad that council officials threatened the family with eviction. After the programme, viewers claimed she 'made their blood boil' and branded her a 'moaning minnie' for complaining about her life on the Shadsworth Estate in Blackburn, Lancashire. But today Mrs Page who has lived in and around the estate for 20 years said: 'I’m not happy about the ""can’t be a***d jogging to the Job Centre"" because they didn’t explain why I couldn’t work. 'The fact is I have been put on the sick because I’m struggling physically because of depression. The programme was edited in a way that didn’t show that. 'They didn’t put that I have been through domestic violence and I have low self esteem and when I go to the Job Centre they make me feel low and dirty and it’s degrading. Mrs Page added: 'I haven’t put my Facebook on yet, I don’t think I can face it but anybody who knows me knows that I tell it how it is and I don’t give a flying f**k what people think.' Residents insist the Panorama show was one-sided and purposely focused on the . negatives. Some accused the broadcaster of encouraging local youths . to look more menacing than they actually are. Police raid a man's home on the segment of the documentary dealing with the estate's drug problems. Residents say the BBC have played up negative aspects of life there . Honest? The BBC denies claims its journalists 'sexed up' their findings for effect . Councillor . Jim Shorrock said: ‘As someone who has lived in Shadsworth for the past . fourteen years, I am horrified. They chose Shadsworth as an easy . target. ‘Constituents tell . me of young lads being asked to pull their hoods up “for effect”, and . working people being edited out simply because they work. I despair if . this is true.’ He added he was worried that the BBC had simply tried to make Shadsworth appear like Channel 4’s sink estate drama Shameless. Mr . Shorrock explained: ‘I sincerely hope this doesn’t look like an episode . of Shameless, because it could set my ward back twenty years.’ Speaking to local papers, Mary . Anderson and Alison Critchley, from the Shadsworth Tenants’ and . Residents’ Association, said they had been 'misled' by programme makers . and regretted agreeing to take part. Named and Shamed: The estate says it has unfairly been portrayed as a sink estate like that in Channel 4's Shameless . She . said: ‘They have scandalised our home. The film makers asked me for . help. I was concerned but they promised they would highlight the . positives and give a fair picture. When I saw the title I felt I had . been misled and the estate was being misrepresented. ‘There . are lots of good things in Shadsworth, investment and many good people. We run many clubs and events at the community centre - jobs clubs, . breakfast clubs for older people, support for those with mental, drug . and alcohol problems.’ Mrs . Critchley insisted that while the area was deprived, the crime rate had . fallen for three consecutive years and feared the Panorama programme . could impact house prices, local investment and community morale. Today Blackburn MP Jack Straw vowed . to complain to BBC governors about the programme claiming it portrayed . Shadsworth as if it was 'an uncharted part of Africa'. He said: 'I shall be writing a strongly-worded complaint to the BBC Trust about this film. It is unacceptable to send a reporter from London who then treats Shadsworth like a Victorian explorer in an uncharted part of Africa. Bleak: The estate was deliberately portrayed in a negative light, say residents . Set up? The Panorama investigation has attracted strong criticism from locals . Shameless: Shadsworth residents say the BBC has tried to make their town look like the area featured in the Channel 4 sink estate drama (pictured) 'The estate does have problems, but so do many others everywhere else in Britain. They viewed Shadsworth through the eyes of a handful of well-known dysfunctional families and implied everybody on the estate shares that outlook. 'The few positives mentioned were simply fig-leaves. The film badly misrepresented the lifestyles of the great majority on the estate, and sought to sensationalise its problems. 'I have spent 33 years as its MP, and know the area extremely well. It went through serious problems in the 80s and early 90s - just as many similar areas did when much of manufacturing collapsed. 'But the area has improved significantly since then. As for ""drugs, anti-social behaviour, family break-ups, and joblessness"" - such circumstances are not confined to classic estates. 'But these days there is overall much better social behaviour, and significantly less crime.' A Panorama spokesman said: 'It is categorically untrue that the programme team sought to influence the behaviour of anyone they filmed, and certainly didn’t ask them to put up hoods, as is evident from the youngsters featured in the film. 'We didn’t edit out anybody on the basis that they worked. Indeed, working people are featured in the film.' Regarding the comments made by Mrs Page, the spokesman said: 'The programme quoted Olwen explaining why she can't work because of illness and the programme made clear that she has suffered domestic violence. 'When she spoke to the programme makers this morning she said that she was happy with it and her contribution to it.' In response to the comments made by Mr Straw: 'We stand by the programme as a fair and balanced portrayal of life on the estate. 'All of the main contributors to the programme have said that they are both happy with it and their contribution to it. 'Indeed the programme makers have been thanked by some residents. We spent many months on the estate and reflected both what we were told and what we filmed, including the view of the police. 'However, the many residents we spoke to told us that anti-social behaviour and drugs are a real problem there. Whilst the programme makers are happy to defend their journalism, they believe that the criticism it is currently receiving deflects attention from the issues which are of genuine concern to many residents on the estate and the wider public.'

"PUBLISHED: . 14:17 EST, 16 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:07 EST, 21 September 2012 . Once banned by Christian missionaries as a barbaric, heathen custom, traditional tattooing is making a comeback in the Cook Islands as locals in the Pacific nation reconnect with their cultural roots. Body art was common in South Pacific nations such as the Cooks, Tonga, Tahiti and Samoa before missionaries arrived in the 19th Century -- so much so that the English word tattoo is derived from the Polynesian terms 'tatau' and 'tatatau'. Applied with bone or shell chisels, tattoos were a rite of passage for Polynesian men and paintings from the the early days of European contact show muscular warriors with elaborate designs covering much of their bodies. A tattooist uses a traditional method to tattoo Ricky Masoe during an exhibition in Wellington . 'If you were out in a waka (canoe) and came across another boat, you could tell from their tattoos where those guys came from,' said Luther Berg, who runs a tattoo studio at the back of Boogies Bar in the capital Avarua. 'You could identify whether they were from Tonga or wherever. More specifically, if you were among that group, you could tell which island they came from, right down to their family line and genealogy.' Ricky Masoe lies down as assistants hold his skin tight while master tattooist Su'a Paul Sulu'ape tattoos him . Su'a Paul Sulu'ape, who is descended from a line of master Samoan tattooists, visited the Wellington City Gallery in New Zealand in September to demonstrate the ancient techniques. Among those he tattooed was Ricky Masoe, who lay prone on a mat as Sulu'ape carved into his skin the precise geometric lines of a pe'a sogaimiti, a design that scrolls from the upper waist to the knees. Betraying only the occasional wince of pain as the club cracked against the chisel, Masoe held his wife's hand while Sulu'ape worked, assisted by four men, one to stretch the skin, another to wipe away the blood and the others holding Masoe's limbs still. A master tattooist cracks a club against a chisel to carve the pe'a sogaimiti, a design that scrolls from the upper waist to the knees . Sulu'ape welcomed the tattoo revival in the Cook Islands and said a similar phenomenon was occurring in Tonga, where his father was helping teach locals traditional techniques. Author Therese Mangos, whose history of Cook Islands tattooing 'Patterns of the Past' was published last year, said missionaries took Biblical warnings against marking the body literally, and zealously set about banning tattoos. In the Cook Islands, anyone who received a tattoo was fined or given punishment work details under rules imposed by church authorities, Mangos said. 'It was seen as very shameful and against Christianity,' she said. 'There's evidence in the archives that some tattoos were physically removed and scraped off people's bodies with pieces of coral.' The result, with the exception of Samoa and New Zealand, was a form of cultural amnesia across Polynesia, where traditional tattooing virtually died out. Traditional tattooing is making a comeback in the Cook Islands as locals try to reconnect with their cultural roots . Many once-revered designs were lost and the ancient technique of applying tattoos by striking an ink-soaked bone chisel with a wooden club resembling a spatula was no longer practiced. Mangos said interest in tattooing revived in the Cooks in the 1990s as part of a broader cultural movement which involved locals rediscovering their heritage through traditional arts and crafts. Croc Coulter, one of the few tattooists in the island nation now practicing the traditional technique, said that while some designs had been lost forever, others survived through carving, weaving and tapa (bark cloth art). Coulter said body art was a type of language in Polynesia and tattooists underwent a lengthy apprenticeship before being considered worthy of working on traditional designs with a chisel and club. Ricky Masoe's right leg is tattooed by Su'a Paul Sulu'ape using a chisel and club to make the traditional design . He said the growing popularity of Polynesian designs among Westerners had led to concerns about tattooists in Europe stealing artwork they had seen on the Internet simply for its aesthetic appeal, with no regard for its cultural meaning. 'When a person gives you their skin, it's an unusual relationship of trust,' he said. 'You don't want to stuff it up. 'It has to reflect the tradition of their family line or island. That comes with a lot of responsibility.' Tattooists undergo a long apprenticeship before being considered worthy of working on traditional designs . Not all efforts to suppress tattooing were successful, the practice remains strong among New Zealand Maori and receiving a customary design is still regarded as an important step on the passage to manhood in Samoa. Tatooist Sulu'ape said he believes the missionaries opposed tattooing because it is a bloody, painful process when performed with customary tools, but said it was such an integral part of Samoan culture that the church was unable to stop it there. Sulu'ape said he could not understand why the missionaries worked so vigorously elsewhere in Polynesia to stop a practice that he regards as a vital part of the region's cultural identity. 'For me, to be able to pass down this knowledge and art from generation to generation, it's a gift from God,' he said.","Tattooing is being revived as locals .

The fugitive being questioned over the killing of the policewomen and two other murders was arrested and released on police bail three months ago. Dale Cregan, 29, was held at Manchester Airport in June after returning on a flight from Thailand. But he was allowed home pending further inquiries. Cregan had been questioned over the murder of Mark Short, who was gunned down in a Manchester pub on May 25. Scroll down for video . Hideout: Dale Cregan, who was being sought by police offering a £50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest, may have been hiding out in this outhouse at the rear of the White Hart pub in Hyde, Greater Manchester . Going underground: Staff at the pub discovered a pillow, blanket and candle on top of a pile of newspapers in a shed at the back of the White Hart pub . Overflowing: The disused outhouse was overflowing with newspapers when staff went to inspect it . By the time the police finally had him . under lock and key on Tuesday, he was suspected of three more – the two . policewomen and Short’s father, David, in a gun and grenade attack in . August 10. Greater Manchester's Chief Constable . Sir Peter Fahy today defended his force's decision to release Cregan, . insisting it was 'absolutely normal' for him to have been bailed. Sir Peter said: 'It is absolutely normal in the course of complex crime inquiries that when people are arrested there are occasions where there is insufficient evidence available for them to be charged. 'In those circumstances suspects have to be released on bail as there are strict time limits covering how long suspects can be held in custody without charge. 'That is exactly what happened in this case.' A spokesman for the force said officers could hold a suspect for a total of 96 hours, if magistrates grant permission. The spokesman would not disclose how long Cregan was held for before being bailed. Until recently Cregan, who has worked as a roofer and lived . for a time in Tenerife, had few major dealings with police. Born in Tameside to parents Paul and Anita Cregan, and with a younger sister, he was well-known as an intimidating character. His image was enhanced by his facial appearance. He told friends that he lost his eye after being hit in Thailand. Police had offered a £50,000 reward for information about the murders of David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23. The Short family had been at . loggerheads with a rival clan for more than ten years but it spilled . into bloodshed – reputedly over drug debts – in May when Mark Short was . killed. A gunman walked into the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden on May 25 and Mark Short died from a gunshot wound to the neck. Four men have been charged in connection with his murder and are due to enter pleas at Manchester Crown Court in November. Tragic: Police officers Pc Fiona Bone (left), 32, and Pc NIcola Hughes (right), 23, were shot dead on a routine call . David Short was killed in a gun and . grenade attack at his home in Clayton on August 10 and earlier this . month a 33-year-old man appeared at Manchester Crown Court charged with . his murder. Suspect: Police released this photo of Dale Cregan who was wanted in connection with the killings of a father and son . David Short is understood to have . vowed revenge for his son’s death and had threatened to murder relatives . of Mark Short’s killer in retaliation. Short senior had apparently been . repeatedly warned that his life was in danger and been wearing a . bulletproof vest for the past eight years. By 2004, police had issued him with . three ‘Osman’ warnings – served when officers receive intelligence that . someone is at risk of serious harm or being killed. It is believed he . may have been killed in a ‘pre-emptive strike’. Both father and son had served time behind bars. In 2006, David Short was jailed for . six years for possessing a firearm with intent, after he and his son . drove a gunman away from a street where shots were fired in daylight. Six months after the shooting, Short . battered a man during a drunken row at the Garibaldi pub in Gorton, . which led to a conviction for wounding. Back in the 1990s he was accused of intimidating a witness after threatening a woman while wearing a balaclava. Mark Short also had a history of . violence, admitting firearms offences following the 2006 incident . involving his father, but was spared a custodial sentence.

Investigation: Police at the scene in Clayton, Manchester, where David Short was killed in August - three months after the death of his son . Teams of armed officers involved in the manhunt were aware of the increasing involvement of grenades in crime in the North West. They were told the Russian-made military devices each contained 1,000 ball bearings with a ‘kill zone’ of more than 25 yards. One of the best-known Soviet grenades is the F1, nicknamed the Little Lemon, which has a four-second fuse. Based on a French design and introduced during World War II, it is now obsolete but can still be found in war zones and is highly prized by gangsters.
