"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Sky Sports are running an ill-conceived promotional trailer for the start of the Football League season tonight that in no way reflects the diverse support amongst the 72 clubs. The ad features supporters drawn from 23 clubs across all three divisions expressing their passion for their team. Yet remarkably, when inclusion is such an important factor at every level of football, it features only one black fan. The blunder comes despite anti-discrimination being at the top of the football agenda and FA chairman Greg Dyke recently calling the FA council ‘overwhelmingly white in a world that isn’t’. Sky Sports blunder: While Greg Dyke recently called the FA council ‘overwhelmingly white in a world that isn’t’ In their own promotional activities, football bodies are always mindful of displaying the sport’s hugely diverse following and a League spokesman said: ‘This was an unfortunate oversight that Sky have recognised.’ A Sky spokesman said: ‘We always try and represent the breadth of football fans and acknowledge we could have done better this time.’ It was a close run thing at Old Trafford between Channel 5 analyst Simon Hughes and busy England managing director Paul Downton over who spent more time on the playing area before the start of play in the Test for no seemingly obvious reason apart from being seen to be there. Aussie irritant Shane Warne might have taken Mike Gatting’s wicket with the ball of the century at Old Trafford in 1993. But he had to be reminded by fellow Sky commentator Mike Atherton that the pitch had been turned around before the 2013 Ashes match in Manchester at which Warne was working for TV. Meanwhile it’s become very noticeable since Warne’s chat with Alastair Cook before the Lord’s Test that he has quietened down on his previous relentless criticism of the England captain. Back in 1993: The Old Trafford pitch Shane Warne knew when bowling Mike Gatting isn't the same anymore . lt has emerged former Southampton overlord Rupert Lowe might be interested in the vacant post of Premier League chairman. Certainly Lowe, responsible for setting up the Saints academy that has produced so many top-quality players — only for most of them to be subsequently sold off — knows how the Premier League works and wouldn’t be in the pocket of chief executive Richard Scudamore. Ex-Soutmapotn man: Rupert Lowe might be interested in the vacant post of Premier League chairman . Gidney’s Jimmy gaffe . Lancashire’s rebel members, upset at being marginalised at Old Trafford, felt even more detached from the corporate-obsessed hierarchy when chief executive Daniel Gidney told them Burnley’s born and bred Jimmy Anderson had proved a great signing from another county. The upset at changes Lancashire have made can be gauged by membership free-falling from more than 14,000 to around 4,500. A major grievance is that the dressing-rooms have been located at the opposite end of the ground from the members’ pavilion, resulting in Ashwell Prince raising his bat to empty stands after scoring a career-best 257. Upset: Lancashire chief executive toldrebel members Jimmy Anderson was signed from another county . There is a desire among some sports governing bodies for flexibility in UK Sport’s zero tolerance towards funding any athlete who doesn’t show Olympic medal potential — especially for a team sport such as basketball. However that view isn’t shared by the high command of UK Sport, who remain steadfast there can be no going back if they want to accomplish their target of improving on doing better than London 2012 by bringing home 66 medals from Rio. Certainly Chris Spice, British swimming performance director, is confident enough about his gobbledegook ‘pathway performance indicators’ to award himself nine out of 10 for his own ‘analysis framework’. Flexibility: There are calls from some sports for UK Sport to be lenient on their specific funding for Rio 2016 . The torment goes on for former Leeds CEO David Haigh, who has been in prison in Dubai since May 18 following a dispute with former Leeds owners GFH Capital, with no charges laid against him nor any date set for a court hearing.

"By . Andrew Pierce . Furious: Fiona Cunningham, Theresa May's spin doctor, was said to be incensed by attacks on her lover Charles Farr . The feud between two senior Cabinet colleagues may centre on toxic allegations about ministerial failure to address the threat of terrorism and an alleged refusal to heed warnings of a plot by extremist Muslims to take over several schools in Birmingham. But behind it lies a fascinating tale of two Home Office civil servants who are having an affair together. One of those involved is a no-nonsense Scottish divorcee, Fiona Cunningham, 40, who is Home Secretary Theresa May’s devoted spin doctor. For two years, she has been in a close relationship with her colleague Charles Farr, 54, a former spy chief who runs the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism in the Home Office. When they were both criticised by officials in Michael Gove’s Education Department, Miss Cunningham went into full-blooded attack mode. I’m told she immediately mounted an operation that would have been worthy of the attack dogs once employed by Gordon Brown, who conducted smear campaigns against not only opposition Tory MPs, but against people on their own side, too. Miss Cunningham is a former journalist with Sky TV who is now one of the most powerful figures in the Home Office, advising on everything from policy to Mrs May’s clothes and trademark designer shoes. Under fire from Mr Gove’s officials, who had accused the Home Secretary of being reluctant to confront the threat of terrorists strongly enough, Miss Cunningham was particularly furious that, by implication, the reputation of her lover (who, as a civil servant, is unable to answer his critics in public) was being maligned. Mischievously, BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, suggested on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday that the relationship between the ex-spy chief and the adviser was a ‘complicating factor’ in the war of words between the two Ministers. His report caused outrage in the Home Office, which is convinced he was put up to it by Mr Gove’s officials, a charge both Robinson and Gove’s camp deny. Whatever the truth, the relationship between Miss Cunningham (whose marriage to a journalist ended in divorce six years ago) and Mr Farr has caused a stir in Whitehall. ‘If the person who is giving the advice is in love with the individual who is meant to be considering the merits of the advice, it is understandable that it is a cause for some alarm,’ says one official. Indeed, Mr Farr, who worked for MI6 in the Eighties, is not popular among colleagues. He has even upset the mild-mannered Shami Chakrabarti, director of the pressure group Liberty. Having described herself once as ‘an irritant to six democratically elected secretaries of state’, she said she was ‘generally treated with courtesy and even kindness in their [the ministers] company.’ But she added: ‘By contrast, Mr Farr is the only person ever to shout at me in the Home Office.’ Mr Farr wears thinly rimmed spectacles that give him an owlish appearance and once led the Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, to describe him as ‘a grown-up Harry Potter’. Educated at Monkton Combe, a private boys’ school in Somerset, and Magdalen College, Oxford, Mr Farr did a PhD in the philosophy of aesthetics — not maths or modern languages, the normal subjects for a spy. After university, he joined MI6, working in southern Africa and the Middle East. He was once assigned to fly round Afghanistan in a helicopter, with thousands of dollars in cash, trying to persuade farmers not to grow opium. He has never married and, typical of his character, his relationship with Miss Cunningham has been conducted discreetly. They don’t live together and are rarely seen in public together. The other pair in this poisonous feud - Mrs May and Mr Gove - have history, too. The slow-burning fuse that finally resulted in yesterday’s explosion was lit when they first became Cabinet Ministers in 2010. Silent: Charles Far, pictured, has conducted his relationship discretely. As a civil servant, he is unable to answer criticisms in public . She was a surprise choice to be Home Secretary, having never held the brief in Opposition. For his part, Mr Gove has a long record of calling for an uncompromising hard line on Islamic terrorism. In his book, Celsius 7/7, published in 2006, the year after the terrorist bombs in London, the former Times journalist accused the West of spawning extremist terror through a policy of appeasing fundamentalism. Crucially, he believes the Home Office is guilty of this charge. Indeed, the two Ministers clashed at a recent meeting of the Extremism Task Force, which was set up after the murder of drummer Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists in Woolwich last year. Mr Gove considered the Home Office had not acted firmly enough against hardline Islamic preachers. However, his position was opposed by Mrs May – backed by loyal aide Mr Farr – who believes in a more softly-softly approach. As a result, Mr Gove was out-manoeuvred by Mrs May, who is well-known for fiercely resisting any attempts by fellow Ministers to ‘encroach’ on her policy area. Not to be outdone, Mr Gove contacted the Prime Minister, who is a close friend, to put his case. Mrs May duly found out much later - and has been spoiling for revenge ever since. But it’s not just differences over the response to Islamic terrorism that have Mr Gove and Mrs May at daggers drawn. Although Gove regards her as a competent Minister who can master a complex brief, he sees her as incapable of innovative and independent thought. This, he believes, rules her out as party leader. As for Mrs May, she regards Mr Gove as an intellectual snob who spends too much time scheming and plotting. She is angry, too, that he does not accord her the respect she thinks her more elevated Cabinet position deserves. Nothing stops her, though, ‘encroaching’ on his turf. Last spring, she made a speech that ranged beyond her Home Office brief, suggesting that people who run Mr Gove’s much-loved ‘free’ schools should be allowed to make profits for themselves. The speech was seen as a signal of her leadership ambitions. Feud: Mr Gove, left, was given a dressing-down by the Prime Minister for triggering the row with Mrs May, right . Mr Gove was incensed, and during a Cabinet session a few days later, he angrily declared his ‘shock at seeing some around the table participating in leadership speculation’. Everyone in the room, including David Cameron knew he was referring to May. Despite the provocation, a furious Mrs May remained at the table stony-faced. However, she was even more enraged when a word-perfect account of the exchange was leaked to the Press. To add to the explosive mix, it was revealed this week that Mrs May has, for the first time, topped a ‘league table’ of Cabinet Ministers after Tory activists were asked to give an approval rating - edging George Osborne and Mr Gove into second and third place. She is also ahead of Boris Johnson, in the same poll, over who should eventually succeed Mr Cameron. She scored 35 per cent, Mr Johnson 23 per cent and Mr Gove 7.9 per cent, down from 15 per cent three months ago. The drop in the popularity of Mr Gove, who professes no leadership ambitions and backs Mr Osborne to succeed the Prime Minister, could be because he is perceived as being involved in too many unnecessary controversies. This feeling will undoubtedly increase after the Queen’s Speech was overshadowed by the row between him and Mrs May. Significantly, it was Mr Gove whom No 10 officials ordered to issue a conciliatory statement yesterday. As for his bitter rival, Mrs May may not be an intellectual titan - but we’re quickly learning that she is a formidable political bruiser whom colleagues cross at their peril.","Theresa May and Mr Gove have been locked in conflict over extremism .

They’ve all been saving up! I imagine all the tickets will go pretty quickly.’ For the 23-year-old and the other players looking forward to a starring role in the global gathering on these shores a year from now, the challenge this season will be to keep minds focused on club duties while not losing sight of the bigger picture. Yet Launchbury insisted the England squad are used to this balancing of priorities. ‘It is no different from any other season in a way because you have chunks at your club and chunks when you are off playing international rugby,’ he added. ‘The World Cup is there in the background as something to get excited about, but for now we have to concentrate on what is coming up.’ England will spend a fortnight in Denver, Colorado, next July as part of their World Cup preparations and Wales coach Warren Gatland revealed on Wednesday that his squad will have stints in the Swiss Alps and the desert in Qatar.

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . There’s a beautiful scene in Field of Dreams, a film that touched my life like no other. In the scene, the main character Ray Kinsella, actor Kevin Costner, asks Dr ‘Moonlight’ Graham, played by the brilliant Burt Lancaster, about his short baseball career – one inning, he didn’t get to make a play, and he never got another chance. Kinsella wondered how that felt. The Doc held his finger and thumb close together and replied: ‘It was like coming this close to your dreams, and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd. At the time you don’t think much of it. You know we just don’t recognise the most significant moments of our lives when they’re happening. Back then I thought, ""Well there’ll be other days."" I didn’t realise that was the only day.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Barcelona reveal Luis Suarez will wear number nine . The dream is over: Steven Gerrard comforts Luis Suarez as Liverpool see their title dream slip away . Moving on: Suarez left Liverpool to go to Barcelona for £75m after the World Cup . I couldn’t help thinking of that scene when Luis Suarez move to Barcelona from Liverpool was confirmed last week. That dream of winning a first Premier League title – Liverpool came close. And then, Steven Gerrard slipped, and the fans had to watch that dream brush past them. Will there be other days? Liverpool fans seem to be putting a brave face on, showing faith in Brendan Rodgers, and after the improvements under the manager last season why shouldn’t they have faith? There is a huge problem though: the best player has gone, and the second best player is a year older and ‘broken’ – his description not mine - after a disastrous World Cup. Rodgers claims Liverpool will come back ‘stronger’ next season. If they do then this guy is the new Fergie in that he will have proved he can rebuild a side after losing a main man. Fresh face: Rickie Lambert trains with his new Liverpool team-mates at Melwood . Right now I can’t see it: I rate Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana, I think had Lazar Markovic not been suspended, Benfica would have won the Europa League, and Emre Can has shown enough to suggest he has a great career ahead of him. The talk of more players coming in is exciting for Liverpool fans. The only problem is – none of them are on the same planet as Suarez. Letting it slip: Gerrard fell over against Chelsea to allow Demba Ba to score at Anfield . Shattered dream: Gerrard looks dejected as he sees Liverpool's title dream slip away . I’m not saying it was wrong to sell: biting opponents is not the Liverpool way. I just can’t help thinking that in the market Liverpool are trading, there is no proper replacement around. That slip against Chelsea, was that the most significant moment of Liverpool’s recent history? Is that a moment most fans have failed to grasp the significance of? That was the moment the dream brushed by, and although there is brash determination being shown by all involved at Anfield, the reality is they have just lost their only truly world-class player, who took them above Everton and United, to within two points of the title, to a place where they could see the dream coming true, and then had to watch while it shattered around them. Dream over? Liverpool fans may realise that last season was their best chance to win the title . For those Liverpool fans the dream is alive. For the rest of us realists, the chance of domestic greatness returning to Anfield has evaporated. You don’t realise what you had until it’s gone. Some Liverpool fans, historians and experts were ready to elevate Suarez to a place among the all-time greats, some even suggested he could be the best player the club has ever had. You don’t replace that kind of quality easily. Rodgers has a chance to show how good he really is – it’s a fantastic opportunity for him. But I can’t help feeling the Liverpool fans’ dreams of seeing their club return to domestic greatness just brushed past Anfield last season, and then disappeared into the crowd.

"By . Tom Roddy for MailOnline . Iker Casillas celebrated 15 years since making his debut for Real Madrid  and could be in line to face rivals Atletico. It was under John Toshack in a 2-2 draw with Athletic Bilbao in September 1999 that the highly decorated Spanish keeper made his first-team bow. Casillas, now 33, enjoyed a decade of success for both club and country, captaining Spain to successive European titles in 2008 and 2012, and lifting the World Cup in South Africa four years ago. Anniversary: Today marked 15 years since Iker Casillas made his debut for Real Madrid . In the famous white of Real, Casillas has won three Champions League medals, five La Liga titles and two King's Cups. It was under the management of Jose Mourinho, however, that Casillas lost his place as Madrid's first choice keeper. Having usually found regularity in the first team, Casillas soon became a rarity. When Carlo Ancelotti took Mourinho's seat as manager in 2013, the Italian continued to pick Diego Lopez as his goalkeeper in La Liga but used Casillas in Europe. Golden generation: Casillas was part of Spain's formidable side in 2010 . Iker Casillas lifted the European trophy (left) in 2008 as Spain beat Germany 1-0, and two years later he raised the World Cup in South Africa (right) Despite Lopez's departure to AC Milan this summer, competition for the number one jersey remains high as Ancelotti brought in Keylor Navas, who impressed for Costa Rica in Brazil this summer. But Ancelotti has reinstated Casillas as his number one and the 55-year-old manager has signalled that he will remain there. 'He (Casillas) has never lost our confidence,' Ancelotti explained in a news conference. 'We congratulated him today for his anniversary with Real Madrid and we wish him the best for the future. We have the same confidence in him as always.'

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Fernando Alonso is wanted by McLaren and may well end up there. It is understood from sources close to the situation that meetings have recently taken place to this end. Although Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, and Alonso fell out in 2007, the animosity may not prevent a reunion. Dennis wants to sign a big name. Alonso is struggling to obtain success at Ferrari. McLaren's partnership with Honda, which starts next year, offers an obvious attraction. Off track: Fernando Alonso - taking part in practice on Thursday - has endured a difficult season with Ferrari . Interest: McLaren are courting Alonso, who left the British team (right) after he fell out with Ron Dennis in 2007 . As does the fact Eric Boullier, the new de facto team principal, is unconnected to the 2008 turbulence. The notion of Alonso leaving Ferrari was fuelled this week, when he said: 'It is sometimes strange to see good comments and compliments from people outside the team, and the opposite from people who are supposed to be close to you. 'It's motivating for me and to see good comments and is funny when you see the opposite from your closest friends.' This outburst prompted Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to issue an unusual statement-cum-love letter. He said: 'Fernando is the best driver in the world, who always gives 200 per cent in the races.' Alonso may end up staying, but at this stage I would be tempted to put a fiver on him going to McLaren. Tough going: Jenson Button, pictured here in practice, and team-mate Kevin Magnussen have struggled in 2014 . The only problem that people in Monaco have ever had with alcohol has been trying to walk down the gangway. But while the champagne-fuelled roistering is in full swing on lilting yachts, miserable plans are afoot to ban all alcohol advertising from sport, including Formula One. In an echo of the ban on tobacco advertising, a pincer movement is starting to move across the continent. France has already outlawed alcohol advertising: what we call the Heineken Cup is called the H Cup just over the border from Monaco. Other countries will follow suit, experts say, and then the European Union will introduce a Europe-wide ban. Labour have included a ban in their draft manifesto for next year's general election. This move is bad news for the likes of Williams with their Martini sponsorship, Force India with Smirnoff, and McLaren with Johnnie Walker. In all, drink advertising brings £300million into British sport. The FA Cup (Budweiser), the Grand National (Crabbie's) and Everton FC (Chang Beer) would all lose out. Dr Kerry O'Brien, head of behavioural studies, at Moash University, Melbourne makes the case for the ban. It sounds sanctimonious rubbish to me but here goes: 'Formula 1 has displayed such strong leadership in ensuring their driver safety, so it seems odd that they remain happy to promote alcohol given its a factor in around one third of all road fatalities in western nations. I'll drink to that: Williams' title sponsor this season is alcohol brand Martini . 'We know that young people are particularly influenced by alcohol sponsorship and advertising, with those exposed to alcohol marketing early in life more likely to be problem drinkers later in life. Unfortunately, young men are also much more likely to die from drink driving than any other group. 'Expecting a few anti-drink driving messages to reduce the problem of drink driving in the face of a 1000 times more ""please drink alcohol messages"" along with heavy alcohol discounting, defies logic. 'If you really thought you needed to address alcohol consumption and drink driving you would not put alcohol and driving together in the first place. 'Formula One has some of the most intelligent and decent folk you could meet, but you really don't need to be smart to know that alcohol and driving cars don't go together in any context. But young people watching Formula One could certainly gain that impression with the current alcohol sponsorship arrangements. 'France took the global lead in banning alcohol sponsorship and advertising, and it didn't affect the success of sport in their country. Indeed they hosted the very successful 1998 FIFA World Cup, and won it! Perhaps Formula One can be the moral leaders of international sport and be the first to ban alcohol sponsorship and advertising.' I have never heard anyone in Formula One say that they want alcohol advertising banned. It seems illiberal to me. People, I would argue, should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to buy drinks or not.  Where will all this legislation end? With bans on drinking in public places? Driving seat: Lewis Hamilton leads the drivers' championship by three points from team-mate Nico Rosberg . Lewis Hamilton said this week that he is 'hungrier' for success than Nico Rosberg because he, unlike his team-mate, was not born into privilege. Now think if Rosberg had made the claim in reverse. If he had said his more expensive education, for example, made him better equipped for Formula One. Imagine the outrage. I think Hamilton was on to something, though. There is a certain chippiness to Lewis and his father, Anthony (and I say that more admiringly than critically). Anthony, it always struck me, had a sense of 'Lewis and me against the world,' derived from their lowly beginnings as a poor immigrant family. This is part of what made them so successful and Anthony such a power for good as a father. Rivals: Rosberg and Hamilton, posing with girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger (right), are battling for the title . As promised last week, I returned to the track at Monaco to sample the new, quieter engine noise. Would it, I wondered, damage my enjoyment of watching the cars at close quarters, especially around the swimming pool. The answer is yes and no. Yes: because there was a lack of sheer screaming violence. No: I was not deafened. I feel my quandary is shared by many within Formula One.","Unsettled Fernando Alonso could be in line for a reunion with McLaren .

"By . David Kent for MailOnline . Jenson Button’s future is uncertain after McLaren boss Ron Dennis said on Thursday he was monitoring other leading drivers who might become available. Button, Britain’s 2009 world champion with Brawn, has been at McLaren since 2010 and, aged 34, is in the final year of his contract. The winner of 15 grands prix, he is the most experienced driver in Formula One. He made his debut in 2000, and sits eighth in the championship with 68 points. Final lap? Jenson Button will consider retirement if he loses his place in McLaren's team . True Brit: Jenson Button has been with McLaren since 2010 . Kevin Magnussen, his Danish rookie team-mate, has scored only 37 but, at 21, is seen as a face of the future. Dennis told the Formula One website that he was satisfied with his drivers, but added: ‘The fact that we’re keeping an eye on what a few other drivers are up to in no way contradicts that. ‘If opportunities arise, we’ll appraise them — we always have and we always will.’ Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso continues to be linked with McLaren even though he had an unhappy season at the team alongside Lewis Hamilton in 2007 and fell out with Dennis. McLaren have not won a race since 2012 and failed to even get on the podium last year. But Honda are returning as McLaren’s engine partners next year and are said to be pushing for an ‘A List’ driver. Button acknowledged the uncertainty of his situation after Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, saying: ‘If I have to retire at the end of the season then so be it, but I feel I have so much more to give.’ Hamilton’s future with Mercedes is also unsettled.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Mercedes are to wait until this year's Formula One championship fight has been resolved before continuing new contract talks with Lewis Hamilton. Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff announced last month, following the confirmation of a new deal for Nico Rosberg, that negotiations had started with Hamilton about an extension to his own contract. But Wolff does not feel, given the intensity of the battle for this year's title between Hamilton and team-mate Rosberg, that it is right to be taking the Briton's focus away from his bid win a second drivers' crown by talking to him about a new contract.

On Sunday, Hamilton accused Rosberg of deliberately driving into him on lap two of the Belgian Grand Prix. He was forced to retire late on due to the damage to his car caused by the collision and is now 29 points adrift of Rosberg in the drivers' standings. The drivers and senior team management - Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe - are expected to meet at the team's Brackley base on Friday in a bid to resolve some of the issues between the pair.

"By . Matt Morlidge for MailOnline . Follow @@MattMorlidge . It's the Belgian Grand Prix weekend. The sound of the Ferrari engines are rhythmic in my ear as I look across the track and the Francorchamps landscape, while my heart is beating at around 140 beats per minute. This must be what a Formula One driver feels like. But as news filters in on Thursday about a soon-to-be dramatic race weekend, I am made aware of two special features on this course, snow and a neon rave. This is not Spa. Instead, I am taking on an experiment Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen  took part in earlier that morning. Two laps around Shell's specially designed circuit, with excitement metres and hearbeat sensors connected. VIDEO: Scroll down to see how the Ferrari duo and Sportsmail got on on the track . Changeable conditions: Shell's special test track for the 'Science of Driving' experiment . Ready to go: Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso have their excitement levels tested using skin conductance . Neon rave, or a race track? The tunnel we would be passing through on our laps . Sportsmail were invited to this secret test track, just a stone's throw from the famous circuit, to truly appreciate Shell's long-standing partnership with Ferrari. £250,000 Toys were provided in the shape of an F12 Berlinetta and the 458 Speciale, but the results of mine and the two former world champion's experiences in truth couldn't be more different. An F1 driver's heartbeat rests at around 40BPM (no wonder Kimi's so cool), while they have to be extraordinarily fit to keep up a rate of around 170 on race day. By the end of today mine would have fluctuated between 70 and 150. Ferrari test drivers Marc Gene and Andrea Bertolini would be our pilots today as we look to uncover the Shell V-Power 'most exciting driving experience'. As I step foot into the 458 Bertolini is clearly more used to this than I am. 'This is really fun,' he says, grinning from ear to ear. Aren't these guys used to this? 'Shell always give us great events, but this is something else.' He tells me to wait and see. Fast and furious: We tried out the 458 Speciale with Ferrari test driver Andrea Bertolini . Contrast: Ok, so Kimi Raikkonen may pull off the Ferrari look better than me... The thrill is something else. While I am soon to be made a fool by Kimi and Fernando, the  two laps are exhilarating. The Le Mans specialist is laughing as he drifts round a corner covered in snow, while my excitement percentage rises as we pass through the tunnel. The back-end of the 458 kicks out round sharp corners after using most of that V8 engine, one that is 'technically' more powerful than those being used in this year's F1 championship. Watching Alonso and Raikkonen take on their laps later makes me realise just how 'cool' these drivers are. They are paid a huge amount of money, yes, but they risk their lives week-in, week-out for their employers. To see them flicker a smile as they are presented with this custom-made track reminds you that this is their playground, their life. They're born to drive. Me, I'm just a passenger. 'Thanks to Shell, I now know to go looking for tunnels when I’m not on the track.' Räikkönen said. Speed: The 458's tail kicks out as it passes through the snowy section of the track . Life of a Formula One driver: These guys really know how to play it cool... week in, week out . As my lap finishes I am told more about Shell's partnership, and in particular their fuel technology. We are told that a version of V-Power Nitro is '99 per cent' the same as the 'Super Unleaded' fuel anyone can pick up today, so much so that we are told a Formula One car's performance wasn't drastically altered by using 'normal' fuel. Time to pretend you're an F1 driver. Shell have been the power behind the Ferrari at Grand Prix's since 1947, making it one of the most enduring partnerships in the sport. That much is clear throughout the race weekend, with Alonso and Raikkonen not shy to praise their contribution. It hasn't been the best of year's on the track for the motorsport giant but plans are certainly in place for next season. Approximately 21,000 hours of testing are put into just the fuel alone, and we are shown certain features in an on-site track lab. Despite the season's form suggesting otherwise,  Alonso is bullish when assessing his chances for the weekend. Making the most of it: Alonso said he always believes he can win, no matter what car Ferrari give him . 'Mercedes obviously have the advantage,' he admits. 'But when I get in that car, I always think I can win.' These drivers aren't short of confidence. The Ferrari duo weren't overly unhappy with qualifying (rumours were Kimi was seen as a push to make it through to Q2), while their race pace was generally encouraging. And hey, despite the two contrasting personalities, there has yet to be a public fall-out between the pair. Shell found a place to let these spirits free. Maybe if Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were to race round Shell's track, they'd start to have some fun together too. Watch Shell Motorsport's video here .

"By . Sam Webb . A man who has been called Britain's most prolific shoplifter was back behind bars again today after admitting four more offences - bringing his total to 343. A week ago magistrates at Prestatyn in North Wales released David Archer after he had spent two days in custody awaiting his appearance on offences 338 and 339. But today magistrates in the same court remanded the 58-year-old in custody to await sentence at Mold Crown Court on April 11 after he admitted to four more offences, including theft from a charity shop. Serial shoplifter: David Archer has admitted to four offences. He now has 343 and is believed to be Britain's most prolific shoplifter . Archer, of Mostyn, Flintshire, admitted stealing clothes and a camera from the RSPCA charity shop at Colwyn Bay and a collection box from the Co-op store at Llandudno Junction. He also admitted two breaches of an indefinite ASBO imposed in 2006 which, among other things, prohibited him from entering any charity shop in England and Wales and from possessing a charity box. Prosecutor Julie Jones said that he was seen on CCTV burning a piece of string which secured the charity box in aid of carers which was on the counter at the Llandudno Junction store. Defence solicitor Roger Thomas told Prestatyn magistrates that one of the problems facing David Archer in the past was that whenever he was released from prison he was given only £40, which he had to spend on essentials, he had nowhere to live and was not entitled to emergency benefits. 'He is known in every shop in North Wales and there was no subterfuge involved,' he said. 'He is institutionalised and struggles to cope with life.'

"By . Rob Cooper . Career criminal: Harry Hankinson, 64, who blames his 501 convictions on a head injury he suffered falling out of a window in 1970 . Britain's 'most prolific thief' has walked free from court despite clocking up crime number 501 after five decades of offending. Harry Hankinson, 64, claims his incredible criminal career started in 1970 because his personality changed when he fell out of a window and banged his head. The shoplifter says he is now a 'kleptomaniac' and simply cannot stop himself. Over the years, Hankinson has targeted dozens of shops in his hometown of Bolton and even once took his unsuspecting wife on a shoplifting expedition during a sightseeing coach trip. Hankinson was hauled before Bolton Magistrates' Court again yesterday after his latest spate of thefts in April and May. The court heard he snatched £203 of clothes from a fashion store in Bolton, Greater Manchester, £295 of perfume from Boots, toiletries worth £350 from Debenhams, and £8 of chocolate from Pound Empire in Manchester. He also walked into a branch of the Body Shop in Blackburn town centre and asked staff if the shop sold any expensive perfume - then stole the £42 gift set pointed out to him by a store assistant. Hankinson, from Halliwell, Bolton, admitted five charges of theft over his £900 spree and admitted: 'I'm ashamed of myself'. He was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months after JPs told him: 'We want to help you', to the fury of his victims. After the case Anwar Fozdar, 52, manager of the Pound Empire in Manchester which was raided by Hankinson said: 'This guy should be in prison not get wrapped up in cotton wool and molly-coddled by some probation officer. 'Shoplifters cause us nothing but misery and at this guy's age, a leopard is never going to change his spots. 'I just cannot understand how someone can get off scot fee when he's committed over 500 offences. What more does it take to get locked up? 'We get loads of shoplifters coming in stealing toiletries because they see this crime as easy to do and knowing they'll probably get a soft sentence if they are caught. 'We lose on average at least £100 a month because of crime - maybe more and its causes us all sorts of economic problems. Giving this man help rather than prison just sends out the wrong message - and tells people shoplifting is not taken seriously.' The court was told that over the last 43 years, Hankinson had 416 convictions for theft, seven offences of violence, four sexual offences, two offences . against property, 28 relating to police courts and spells in prison, . three drug offences and 36 'miscellaneous' crimes. The record is thought to make him Britain's worst offender. In 1996 his offending became so prolific his long-suffering wife Linda, then 46, spoke out to condemn an 18-week stretch he received for stealing cigarettes, spirits and groceries. Anger: Anwar Fozdar, manager of the Pounds Extra store Hankinson targeted in Manchester, said the criminal should be sent to prison rather than 'molly-coddled by some probation officer' She said: 'He should have got at least 18 months. The only way he will stop is by being in prison. If he's in there long enough he might stop and think and get some proper help while he's locked up. 'When he's out after short stretches its just too easy for him to go and do it again. A psychiatrist has told me that he's a kleptomaniac, I don't think there's much doubt about that.' But although she vowed to stand by her man, in 2008 Mrs Hankinson was unwittingly caught up in another thieving expedition when she and her husband went to Ripon, North Yorkshire, for a day out by a coach - to celebrate his release from another prison stretch. While browsing around the shops in the historic market town, light-fingered Hankinson helped himself to more than £1,000 worth of jewellery from two shops after telling staff he had won the Lottery. He then took jumpers and biscuits while waiting at Edinburgh Woollen Mill shop for his wife to meet up with him. Target: Hankinson admitted stealing £8 of chocolate from the Pounds Extra store in Manchester as his tally of convictions hit 501 . Target: Hankinson asked staff in the Body Shop, Blackburn if they sold any expensive perfume - then stole the £42 gift set pointed out to him by a store assistant . Target: The Body Shop targeted by Hankinson is in The Mall Shopping Centre, Blackburn (pictured) In mitigation, his lawyer Stephen Teasdale said: 'All this behaviour is impulsive or compulsive. There's nothing sophisticated. There's no planning, he goes straight into the shop, picks up a select three or four items then walks out. 'There's no violence or damage to the shop. There are many many convictions of shoplifting but there is no violence or damage and normally items are recovered all of the time.' He said the defendant's personality changed after an accident in 1970. 'He decided to attend a family function and the windows were open, they were the type you could pull up. He fell out backwards and it wasn't a ground floor window. 'That has changed his personality. A psychologist is going to be most help to him. 'He doesn't steal from vulnerable victims - every time it is a large retailer - like Boots and Asda. He has a long suffering sister who has supported him. His sister does his shopping. He does not want to go to shops and be around temptation.' Chairman of the magistrates Nat Ayisi-Biney also ordered Hankinson to comply with a electronic curfew between 10am and 5pm for six months and to pay an £80 victim surcharge. Mr Ayisi-Biney told Hankinson: 'It's up to you now, we want to help you.'","Harry Hankinson, 64, 'became a kleptomaniac' after falling out of a window .

"By . Phil Barnett . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has vowed not to 'park the bus' against Chelsea on Saturday as he relishes testing his side against Jose Mourinho's title favourites. Last season's Championship winners will look to build on an opening-day draw with Everton when they go to west London this weekend. Pearson accepts any kind of result they can get will be a bonus and therefore hopes his side can play with a degree of freedom. Tactics: Nigel Pearson says he will not park the bus against Chelsea in the Premier League this weekend . 'I'm looking forward to taking Leicester City to Chelsea in the league rather than the cup,' said Pearson, whose side lost 5-2 in an FA Cup quarter-final in 2012. 'The most important thing is I want to see how our players cope with a big fixture. It's important for us to play the game and not the occasion. 'Chelsea at Stamford Bridge speaks for itself. Their record there is very good but we have to think of this as something of a bonus. 'Not many people give us much hope but we have a strong resolve. If we can be an awkward customer I'll be happy. But we have some good footballers. Confidence: Pearson insisted his team had some strong players and could be an 'awkward customer' 'We may be need a bit of time for our players to dictate the tempo a bit better. There are a lot of counter-attacking sides in the Premier League. 'I don't want us to just soak pressure. We need to give each other enough options to maximise our offensive players. We have some threats.' While Pearson may be intrigued to pit his side against the Blues, he has less interest in his own 'battle' with Mourinho. 'I have a huge respect for Jose,' he said. 'I don't see it as a duel between managers. I see it as about how to be competitive as a team. How others want to bill it is up to them.' Respect: Pearson said he has 'huge respect' for the Chelsea manager as the two sides prepare to meet . Pearson, who may be able to welcome back Jamie Vardy (thigh) and Marc Albrighton (groin) for the match, insists his job has barely changed since reaching the top flight. 'It feels like it always does,' he said. 'I'm managing the same people. The problems and challenges are different but it is all about managing the expectations in terms of excitement generated. It's been a long time since we were in the Premier League. 'It's important for people to enjoy the experience but we will only do that by performing as well as we can. 'I don't see my job to be fundamentally different. I'm very pleased to be the manager of a side that has achieved promotion with style. 'It's not an easy thing to do and for us to establish ourselves as a Premier League side it will take a lot of hard work and patience.'

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton has vowed to win this year's Formula One world title after clear-the-air talks with Mercedes team-mate and bitter rival Nico Rosberg. Mercedes have taken 'suitable disciplinary measures' against Rosberg after he 'acknowledged his responsibility' for the collision with Hamilton in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. The Brackley-based marque have also confirmed the duo can continue to race for the title, without intervention from the team, providing they keep it clean over the closing seven races. Damage:  Hamilton (left) and Rosberg clashed on the second lap in Belgium forcing the Brit out of the race . Blame game: Hamilton at first came out strongly against his teammate but now refuses to point fingers . Although Hamilton is 29 points adrift of Rosberg in the championship after failing to finish at Spa, whilst the German went on to finish second, such a scenario has only stiffened his resolve. 'It's going to be a tough road from here, but championships have been won from much further back than I am now,' said Hamilton. 'And I promise you I will be giving everything and more to win this for my team, for my family and for my fans,' For now, the hatchet has been buried, with Hamilton acknowledging that previous events between the pair this year resulted in Rosberg taking matters into his own hands on Sunday. Debris flies: Part of Hamilton's car takes to the air after the clash during a controversial Belgian Grand Prix . From the get go: Hamilton got off to the perfect start, overtaking pole position holder Rosberg at the beginning . As far as Hamilton is concerned, he appreciates it is crucial he and Rosberg give their all, not just as individuals in their quest for the title, but more importantly for the team. 'Nico and I accept we have both made mistakes and I feel it would be wrong to point fingers and say which one is worse than the other,' said Hamilton, on his official website. 'What's important is how we rise as a team from these situations. We win and we lose together and, as a team, we will emerge stronger. 'There is a deep foundation that still exists for me and Nico to work from, in spite of our difficult times and differences. Sorry: Lewis Hamilton (right) said he and Nico Rosberg had 'both made mistakes' in his statement . Winging it: A piece of Hamilton's wing soars over German Rosberg's Mercedes after the high-speed collision . 'We have the greatest team, the strongest group of individuals who have worked their hands to the bone to give us the best car you see us racing today. 'It's important we never forget that and give them the results they deserve.' After initially remarking his version of events were 'very different' to that of Hamilton after the Briton revealed from a heated post-race meeting Rosberg had conceded to causing an accident 'on purpose', the German has since been forced to issue sincere apologies. A further meeting unfolded on Friday at the team's Brackley base involving the drivers, motorsport boss Toto Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe, with Rosberg contrite. Via a statement, Rosberg said: 'The number one rule for us as team mates is we must not collide, but that is exactly what happened. 'For that error of judgement, I apologise to Lewis and the team. 'I also want to say sorry to the fans who were deprived of our battle for the lead in Belgium.' Rosberg has now promised 'hard, fair competition on and off track right up to the final lap of the season in Abu Dhabi'. That will serve Mercedes well as they have vowed 'another such incident will not be tolerated', albeit confirming the duo 'remain free to race' for the rest of the campaign. April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second. May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent. Rosberg wins the race from pole. August 24: The two drivers collide on lap two in Belgium, with Rosberg later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash.","'Championships have been won from further back' says Lewis Hamilton .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy for the Daily Mail . Nico Rosberg will fly from his home in Monaco to next weekend's race in Monza with an untroubled 29-point lead in the Formula One drivers' championship to show for his controversial driving in last Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. To the German's critics, the six-figure fine imposed by his Mercedes team after his second-lap crash with title rival and team-mate Lewis Hamilton is scant punishment: he is a multi-millionaire for whom donating a fraction of his earnings to charity is a minuscule price to pay. But Max Mosley, the former president of motor racing's governing body, the FIA, believes Mercedes did Rosberg a disservice by divulging that they were disciplining him for a crash that ended Hamilton's race while he went on to finish second. Made up? Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will continue racing next week in Monza . Harsh: Former FIA president Max Mosley believes it was not right to go public regarding Nico Rosberg's fine . Private matter: Mosley (centre) believes the fine should have been dealt with privately by Mercedes . 1 Nico Rosberg - 220 . 2 Lewis Hamilton - 191 . 3 Daniel Ricciardo - 156 . 4 Fernando Alonso - 121 . 5 Valterri Bottas - 110 . 6 Sebastian Vettel - 98 . 'In every respect but one I think Mercedes dealt with the incident in the right way,' said Mosley. 'If they decided to fine or punish Rosberg they should not have announced it. It's as if the team are blaming him publicly. That's not really right.' Many observers suggested the FIA should have investigated after Hamilton claimed Rosberg admitted he had deliberately caused the incident at Les Combes as they sparred for the lead. It was said that Mosley's FIA, which was proactive to an occasionally mischievous degree, would have intervened in contrast to the more passive regime of the current president, former Ferrari team principal Jean Todt. Winging it: Nico Rosberg's Mercedes collided with Lewis Hamilton's car at Spa, forcing the Brit to retire . Costly: Nico Rosberg eventually finished second after the crash, meaning Lewis Hamilton is 29 points behind . But Mosley, who was in charge from 1993 to 2009, disagrees. He said: 'The way I see it — and I'm on the outside now — is that the very experienced race director [Charlie Whiting] and the stewards decided to act because it was a 'racing incident'. 'That was more or less that. It was a minor incident with serious consequences. What the drivers did or not say afterwards is not clear. On that basis the FIA could not get involved. 'It's then a matter for the team. A lot goes on behind closed doors. What is unusual is announcing it. Personally, I wouldn't have done that.' Rosberg's fine was the upshot of a two-hour meeting between the drivers and their bosses, Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, at in Brackley on Friday. 'Gutted': Hamilton was left distraught for his team after the contact with his Mercedes team-mate Rosberg . Booed: Rosberg was jeered when he took to the podium to claim his second-place prize in Belgium . Contender: Daniel Ricciardo (centre) won the last GP at Spa and is closing in on the Mercedes duo for the title . With Mercedes' management having been criticised for perceived naivety this season, their hard line must be interpreted, at least in part, as an attempt to show Hamilton, their boardroom and the public that they have reasserted their authority. It has been suggested Rosberg could be forced to yield position, either in a future qualifying session or a grand prix, or even be handed a race ban. But Wolff rejected such speculation, saying: 'The team discussed at length what the consequences could be. 'But there is one thing we stand for at Mercedes-Benz, and this is racing, straight and fair racing, and we remain committed to that. Both drivers are racing at the absolute limit against each other, and we are not going to interfere in the race result, or pre-agree any race result. This is not what we will ever do. 'When the racing happens we need to react sometimes, but we will not pre-agree in favour of one or the other. This is not what we do.' The effectiveness of Mercedes' action will be seen in the closing seven races. 'The proof of the pudding will be in the eating,' admitted a team insider. Next course, Monza.","The German 'acknowledged' his role in the crash on lap 2 of the Belgian GP .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Fernando Alonso would appear to have confirmed his intent to remain at Ferrari, despite McLaren's interest in luring him back to Woking. With Honda powering McLaren again from next season as the Japanese manufacturing giant returns to Formula One after a seven-year absence, they had hoped to attract a stellar name. It is understood Alonso and Sebastian Vettel are at the top of Honda's wanted list, but the former is contracted through to the end of 2016, with the latter's current deal with Red Bull expiring after 2015. Return? Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso appears to have ruled out being reunited with McLaren next season . History: Alonso (left) raced for McLaren in 2007 but left the team because he was not given No 1 status due to Lewis Hamilton impressing . McLaren Group chairman and CEO Ron Dennis indicated last week he is a man who respects contracts, and therefore would bide his time to land either Alonso or Vettel, or both. For his part, Alonso, who drove for McLaren in 2007 before becoming embroiled in an ignominious bust-up that hastened his exit after one year, seems eager to help Ferrari back to winning ways first before moving on. 'From summer last year there has been a lot of talk,' said Alonso, speaking to Sky Sports. 'But from my mouth came nothing about any interest to leave Ferrari, or saying I would join another team. Interest: McLaren want to sign a big name before season and have also looked at Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel . Wanted: Alonso has been driving in a Ferrari which has not been competitive for several seasons in a row now . 'There has been a lot of speculation, which is not disturbing, but... it's half disturbing because it creates a little bit of tension and stress. 'But also you feel happy and proud the best teams have an interest in you, and they say that in public. 'But it's not my intention at the moment to move. As I've said, I want to win for Ferrari here and finish the job we started some years ago. 'We will see what the future holds.'

"By . Patrick Collins . As the band churned out the familiar air, Wayne Rooney’s mouth formed a string of stilted, half-remembered phrases: ‘Send her victorious / Happy and glorious…’ The television director lingered on the close-up, searching for signs of patriotic fervour. Rooney simply frowned and mumbled on. Given the choice, he would surely have remained silent, since that is his preference. But he hadn’t been given the choice. Roy Hodgson had insisted prior to the match against Ecuador that his players sing the National Anthem very loudly, in order to demonstrate that they are ‘proud and happy’ to wear the shirt. It was a fatuous gesture designed to win a tub-thumping headline and a younger, more confident Rooney might have ignored the demand. But these days he senses his England place is in the balance, so obedience was the prudent course. It all seemed dreadfully unfair. The principle involved is self-evident. We have the good fortune to live in a robust democracy that respects our right to remain silent when the anthem is played. Clearly, it is not our most significant liberty but it is one we should not lightly surrender. Gary Neville, the England coach, would appear to share that view, since he declined to sing the anthem in each of his 85 international appearances. Yet here we had Hodgson denying that elementary freedom to Rooney and the others. It shone a worrying light upon the manager’s current state of mind. In full cry: Wayne Rooney (right) toed the National Anthem line but did not appear comfortable . Edict: Roy Hodgson told his players to sing the National Anthem . The cliche insists that the England job drives them all mad in the end. It isn’t true but I can think of three or four who were just a stride or two ahead of the men in white coats before their term was over. Yet the present manager has always seemed immune to such pressures. This is partly due to the range of his managerial experience — which includes four international teams and four Premier League clubs — but still more to his personality. For Hodgson has a hinterland. This is not merely a matter of theatre, galleries and modern American novels but an abiding sense that his love for the game falls comfortably short of obsession; that he understands how the world works outside football. After the past fractious week or so, we are less certain. At this stage of affairs, the phoney war, Hodgson finds himself giving a whole string of media conferences, despite having little to impart. His predecessors coped in their own, idiosyncratic fashion; from Fabio Capello, who said little since he mistrusted his English, way back to Sir Alf Ramsey, who said even less since he mistrusted his audience. But Hodgson has always possessed the ability to fill reporters’ notebooks with a stream of reassuring platitudes. With the anthem misjudgment and the consequent embarrassment to Rooney, his assurance suddenly appears a good deal less serene. That impression is enhanced by the maladroit manner in which he dealt with Ross Barkley’s display against Ecuador. A constant menace: Ross Barkley shows flashes of brilliance during his cameo against Ecuador . In seeking to spare the youngster the burden of excessive praise, he tilted the balance too far. ‘He’s got to learn when to release the ball… For every good turn, there was a time when he lost the ball,’ he said. He sounded almost curmudgeonly. In normal times, he would have  handled it with ease. But these pressurised days are quite different and, for a moment, he seemed to be floundering. Now, trivial though it may seem, this actually matters because Hodgson matters. For the next few weeks, the manager of the England football team will become the most scrutinised individual in our public life. His moods will be interpreted, his utterances diligently analysed. Failure, in terms of a premature departure, will attract rancorous attacks. These will be led by the small tribe of armchair warriors who opposed his appointment, resent his indifference to their opinions and have spent these past two years willing him to stumble. The public at large, whose irrational expectations seem to be growing by the day, may be no less hostile. But if he should succeed…? It would represent a miracle, of course; a squad selected from less than a third of his nation’s bloated Premier League, a team skilfully fished from a pitifully shallow pool of talent. The rewards would include an open-top bus ride, an automatic knighthood and the guarantee of immortality. We may be sure that the unthinkable has crossed his mind. Relax: Leave England to the football and they will reap the rewards . The likelihood is that his fate will settle somewhere between the two, with honourable elimination the reward for his endeavours. But such matters are beyond a manager’s control and the realisation is proving unsettling. And so, in his desperation to affect events, he creates a distracting drama from a populist gesture. And all before a ball has been kicked. One day, when he reflects on the World Cup of 2014, Hodgson will look back on his decision and wonder: ‘Was it really worth the fuss?’ I suspect I know what his answer will be. Meanwhile, a young man with a mass of anxieties flooding his mind will stand in line, mumbling patriotic platitudes, aware of his duty to appear ‘proud and happy’. While the rest of the world gets on with the football. Winning is everything, second is nowhere: that’s the line which sports people tend to recite when they want to appear mean and grimly purposeful. But it isn’t always true and this was a case in point. Eden Park, Auckland, can be a tricky place for international rugby teams to visit. So tricky, in fact, that New Zealand hadn’t lost there for 20 years and 31 Test matches. Yet England, whose chances were rated as lowly as 25-1 in some quarters, got within two heartbreaking minutes of a thoroughly deserved draw. Deep breath now: Chris Robshaw cannot fail to hide his pain as England concede a crucial late try . This was an England side, remember, who were missing around half of their first choices through injury and fixture chaos. A side, moreover, who played most of the final 10 minutes with 14 men. In such circumstances, survival without disgrace tends to be the highest ambition. But England were braver and bolder. They went for victory, for a shuddering upset; and on a luckier day they might have landed it. Of course, the All Blacks will be sharper next week; indeed, they might even inflict a degree of damage. But Stuart Lancaster’s England have made their statement, they have demonstrated their desire to compete and they know that a narrow defeat in Eden Park is worth a dozen cheap victories over some of the weaker Six Nations teams. In short, they have succeeded in sharpening the appetite for next year’s Rugby World Cup. Which goes to show what an honourable second place can achieve. Mike Ingham is old school. He does not answer to a laddish nickname, indulge in blokeish banter or crave the company of bumptious celebs. Instead, he fulfils his role as BBC football correspondent with grace and flair and an understated eloquence. He has held the job since 1991, explaining and informing, painting pictures on the mind, never coming between the event and the radio audience. The voice: Mike Ingham (right, alongside fellow BBC stalwart Alan Green in 2006) brings dignity to the airwaves . He stands alongside such fabled figures as Peter Jones and Bryon Butler as a master of his medium. Ingham is stepping down from the role of chief football correspondent at the end of this World Cup. And radio sport will lose a gently memorable voice.","Roy Hodgson had insisted prior to the match against Ecuador that his players sing the National Anthem very loudly .

"By . Rob Shepherd . Follow @@robshepherd5 . Ahead of the clash with Chile, Brazil pin-up star Neymar – who so far is living up to his billing as Pele’s heir, has admitted he came close to joining Chelsea as an 18 year old. The Blues tried to tempt him away from Santos when they were alerted of his potential after West Ham had £12million bid turned down that summer for the then ‘unknown’ mega-star in the making. His first season at Barcelona after his transfer last summer was not sensational – Gareth Bale has made a bigger impact after his move to Real Madrid. Stardust: Brazil's Neymar is realising his potential in this World Cup and Thiago Silva expects him to get even better . But Neymar is coming of age at this World Cup and his Brazil skipper Thiago Silva reckons he can eventually reach the level of Lionel Messi. Silva said: ‘Neymar is growing into a crescendo. ‘Messi is one of the best strikers in the world, one of the very best players. But Neymar is growing into a crescendo and he will be soon considered one of the best in the world. ‘Technically, he has all the skills. Messi is one of the best of all, but I’m sure Neymar will get to that level.’ There is an old newspaper saying: Dog bites man, no story. Man bites dog, big story. But far from losing his livelihood or even liberty, Suarez arrived back in Uruguay following his ban after an unprovoked assault on Italian Giorgio Cheillini hailed as a national hero. Indeed he can look forward to a pay rise if a move to Barcelona goes through. Banned: Uruguay and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (pictured with his children) is banned from playing against Colombia . Sometimes justice and morality around modern football seems to be upside down. After all, his grandmother has been quoted as saying the FIFA ban was ‘barbaric’ and he has been treated like a, er, ‘dog’ as if HE has been the victim of rough, rough justice. Talk about barking. Despite a lot of unpleasant baggage at this World Cup there is no doubt most of the football has been fantastic. There have been the most goals at the end of the group stage since it became a 32-team tournament in 1998 – 136 at an average of 2.83 per game. The lowest total in that period was the last World Cup, when only 145 were scored during the entire competition at a rate of 2.27. No World Cup has averaged more than three goals a game since 1958. The question is, now it is sudden death, will teams become more cautious? Well according to statistics it has been, er, Iran. On the basis of 92 attempts in or around their goal, they unleashed 72 tackles, made eight blocks and there were eight saves. But they still finished bottom of Group F with one point from a 0-0 draw with Nigeria, losing to Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Numbers Game: Statistically Iran have the best defence in the World Cup so far, yet exited in the group stages . So much for the having the best defence. Mind you, Iran’s goals for and against column (For one,  Against, four) was only marginally worse than England’s (also one point) of For two, Against four. But it was sufficient for Carlos Queiroz to resign as manager – something Roy Hodgson has refused to do. As the above shows, always beware of every stat and sometimes one can’t be quite sure how these things are assessed, but according to FIFA anoraks this is the World Cup best XI so far. The stats XI: Enyeama (Nigeria), Chiellini (Italy), Van Buyten (Belgium), Medel (Chile), Alves (Brazil), Rodriguez (Colombia), Robben (Netherlands), Cuadrado (Colombia), Neymar (Brazil), Benzema (France), Messi (Argentina). Inevitably, there have been some dodgy refereeing decisions, but there are always going to be honest mistakes. Although there are some conspiracy theorists who say Brazil have benefited more than most from officials. Under the spotlight: English referee Howard Webb will be in charge for the clash between Brazil and Chile . After all, could you imagine the furore among many already angst-ridden protesters about the cost of staging the tournament if Brazil hadn’t have got out of their group? But in general, the match management of officials has been good and a lesson to some Premier League refs who are overkeen to issue cards. So far there has been an average of just 2.7 yellow cards per game and 0.2 reds. English ref Howard Webb goes under the spotlight on Saturday evening, taking charge of the Brazil Chile game. With Suarez gone, Edinson Cavani – a possible target for Manchester United – takes on the role of lead striker. But don’t underestimate former Manchester United forward Diego Forlan. He was joint top scorer at the last World Cup. Even though he is now 35 and playing out his career in Japan he could still make an impact against Columbia. Pressure: With Luis Suarez banned the pressure is on strike partner Edinson Cavani to step up and supply the goals . Let’s not forget what Suarez did at the last World Cup, cynically handling on the line to prevent a late winner for Ghana in the quarter finals. Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent penalty – the sent-off Suarez celebrating on the sidelines – and Uruguay went on to win the penalty shootout. Brazil are 1-2 with most bookies to win but this could go to the wire. And 14-1 to be 0-0 is worth a look. It could go to penalties on that basis and Brazil are 3/10 to qualify Chile 5-2 .","Brazil captain Thiago Silva says Neymar is 'growing into a crescendo'

"By . Margot Peppers for MailOnline . As the world's most celebrated personal shopper for nearly four decades, Betty Halbreich has seen it all. And now, the glamorous 86-year-old has offered a glimpse into the most memorable moments of her illustrious career - from teaching a young Candice Bergen how to walk in heels to instructing former President Gerald Ford on how to carry a garment bag. These are just some of the memories the famed Bergdorf Goodman personal shopper recalls in her new memoir, I'll Drink to That: A Life in Style, With a Twist, which hits stores on Thursday. Iconic: Bergdorf Goodman personal shopper Betty Halbreich (pictured in 2013) recalls some memorable moments from her 37-year career in her new memoir, I'll Drink to That: A Life in Style, With a Twist . One of the most striking aspects of Betty is that she views her job not as a mere salesperson, but more as a therapist. '""Patients,"" I call them. They open up to me like a therapist,' she told WWD. 'It's very difficult to describe what I do. Yesterday I said, ""Basically, I'm a clerk"" - a very costly clerk for 37 years.' Even though she launched her career a staggering 37 years ago, Betty has experienced a resurgence in the limelight recently - first when she was featured in a documentary called Scatter My Ashes At Bergdorf's, which was released last year. And now, not only is her highly-anticipated book about to hit shelves, but she is also working with Lena Dunham to create a comedy series based on her life. Counsel: Betty (pictured at work on an unknown date) views her job as more than just a salesperson. '""Patients,"" I call them,' she says of her customers. 'They open up to me like a therapist' Highlights: She describes how she taught a young Candice Bergen (pictured in 1966) how to walk in heels, and how she instructed former President Gerald Ford on how to carry a garment bag . 'She is one of the most gracious, full of fun, intelligent, sane, intellectual people I've ever met,' Betty writes about the Girls star, 28, who has become an unlikely ally. Betty has made her fair share of famous friends in her time. Indeed, in her memoir she describes how President Gerald Ford came to her to pick up an altered dress for his wife, and she took it upon herself to show him how to carry it correctly. 'It had just been pressed and finished. He took it and wrapped it over his arm like he was taking his shirts to laundry,' she recalls. In the works: Not only is her highly-anticipated book about to hit shelves, but she is also working with Lena Dunham to create a new comedy series based on her life (pictured together in October) 'I said, ""Oh, for God's sake. She’s going to wear that dress tonight,"" she explains. 'He said, ""I can't believe Betty's telling me how to carry a dress."" I said, ""At least I’m not telling you how to run the country.""' The quick-witted octogenarian goes on to say that the pair had 'a wonderful love affair. She came out of that dressing room and showed him every dress. And his appreciation for her was written all over his face.' Much of Betty's success is due to her ability to adapt to the times - although she can't help but remark on how much the fashion world has changed since her youth. 'We dressed - that's what's different,' she writes. 'You went to El Morocco on Saturday night and tipped the head waiter heavily to get a table. You didn't think about going out not dressed.' Flashback: 'We dressed - that's what's different,' she says of fashion back in her day. 'You went to El Morocco on Saturday night and tipped the head waiter heavily to get a table. You didn't think about going out not dressed' In contrast to the overwhelmingly casual style of today's population, 'When you went into a store - let's say Bonwit Teller or Lord & Taylor - you got dressed up,' she says. 'You wouldn't walk around in shorts or tight white pants.' Indeed, this last trend is one that Betty just cannot get her head around. Read all about it: Betty Halbreich's memoir, which costs $20 on Amazon, will be released on Thursday . 'Have you noticed everyone is walking around in tight white pants - large, medium, small?' she says. 'They are so awful. I just can't wait until people put their coats back on in winter and hide all this provocativeness.' Thanks to her influential fashion sense and no-nonsense outlook, Betty has amassed an endless list of famous friends. 'Lauren Bacall, Betty Buckley, Susan Lucci, Jane Pauley,' she rattles off effortlessly. 'Gwyneth Paltrow, Jane Curtain, Sharon Stone - I don’t even remember her - Julia Roberts, Bobbi Brown, Estée Lauder - that was something - Babe Paley, Farrah Fawcett. These are the people who were great to work with. The ones that I didn’t keep a list of weren't so great to work with.' But at the heart of it all, she says her job is about more than just doling out style advice. 'For me, dressing someone well is as divine as helping someone to walk, to see, to smile or to bake a tall, light angel food cake,' she writes in her typically poetic fashion. 'You're probably looking at one of the most satisfied people in the world,' she adds. 'I'm really blessed, I can sit here at 86 and talk to you. I still have my teeth and the rest of me is OK.'","Betty Halbreich has been the New York department store's most famous personal shopper for 37 years .

"By . Robin Cottle for MailOnline . Arsenal target Kostas Manolas has been left out of Olympiacos' first league game of the season. The Gunners have been linked with a £6.5m move for the 23-year-old defender. And speculation is set to intensify after Manolas was not included in the squad to face Niki Volou tonight. In demand: Kostas Manolas (left) challenges Edinson Cavani in last season's Champions League . World Cup star: Manolas, taking on Japan's Keisuke Honda, impressed at this summer's tournament . Arsene Wenger wants to sign a new defender before the transfer deadline following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his view of Arsenal's potential new signing Kostas Manolas . The Gunners’ need for defensive cover has heightened following a hamstring injury to Kieran Gibbs that will rule him out for the next three weeks. And Arsenal's defence looked far from secure in the 2-2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park. As  revealed last Wednesday, Manolas is a strong contender to fill the vacancy left by Vermaelen. And Arsenal are pushing hard to complete a deal by September 1. Pastures new: Thomas Vermaelen left Arsenal to join Barcelona . Impressive: Calum Chambers has looked assured at the centre of the defence since signing from Southampton . The North London club believe Olympiakos will sell their highly-rated defender, who played for Greece during the World Cup. But doubts linger over whether Manolas is prepared to sign for the Gunners without the guarantee of regular first team football. Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny - who is nursing an Achilles injury - are Wenger’s first-choice central defensive pairing and Calum Chambers has been employed in the middle since his summer transfer from Southampton. The level of Manolas’ first-team chances appears to be the key stumbling block towards the completion of a deal. But the Gunners are growing increasingly confident a deal can be reached. Determined: Manolas sticks close to Manchester United forward Danny Welbeck in pre-season .","Arsene Wenger has been linked with a £6.5m move for the Greek defender .

SWAT teams swarmed the Floridian Hotel in Tampa and arrested Adam Matos. An Amber Alert for his son was issued Thursday after officers checking on the child found four bodies piled up on each other near his house in Hudson, on the Gulf Coast. When they arrived at the house in Hudson, they found nobody home but were overpowered by a bad smell. They followed it down the street towards an area where birds were beginning to circle and found four bodies piled on top of each other. Adam Matos, pictured, became a suspect after he had been seen in the area of the killings . Matos became a suspect after he had been seen in the area and police tracked him down to a Tampa hotel yesterday. When SWAT teams arrested him, taking him into custody, they then found the boy, who was said to be uninjured and is now in good spirits. Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor told CBS News that Matos was found on the 18th floor of the hotel and police had to use a ruse to get him to leave the room. She added that prior to that he had been seen at different bus stops in the downtown area and may have been inquiring about buying a bus ticket. While at the hotel, it is said Matos used his own name to check into the hotel around midnight. Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said the killings were not a random act. Officials have not released the names of the victims or said how they may be related to the boy and to Matos. The investigation is continuing and multiple charges are pending.","Police went to arrest Adam Matos, 28, on suspicion of murdering four people .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Changing jobs too often can be bad for your career, a survey suggests.

Nine in ten bosses said they were likely to drop an applicant from consideration if they thought the individual had moved around too much during their working life. Scroll down for video . Recruitment firm Robert Half interviewed 200 bosses about whether a large number of job changes would make them suspect a candidate might lack staying power (image is file picture of models) Recruitment firm Robert Half interviewed 200 bosses about whether a large number of job changes would make them suspect a candidate might lack staying power. Thirty-six per cent of the executives admitted they were ‘very likely’ to look badly on an applicant they considered a ‘job hopper’ and 53 per cent said they were ‘somewhat likely’ to do the same. The remainder did not care about the number of jobs held. ‘The job market has rebounded in recent years, and employers understand that job candidates may have had short stints in some positions,’ said Phil Sheridan of Robert Half. ‘However, businesses look for people who will be committed to the organisation, can contribute to the company, and help it reach its short and long-term goals. The survey found that 90 per cent of bosses were put off by applicants who have moved jobs too often (file picture of models above) ‘Too much voluntary job hopping can be a red flag.’ Research by the company puts the ideal stay in a job as six years, but this was from a worker’s point of view, not that of a potential employer. Mr Sheridan added: ‘While there is no optimal time to stay in a job, the secret is to show progression. ‘This can come in the form of promotion and/or additional work responsibility and often takes four or more years to attain, on average.’","Recruitment firm Robert Half interviewed 200 bosses about preconceptions .

"By . Australian Associated Press . A mother has pleaded guilt to taking confronting and explicit photos of her daughters for the sexual gratification of Sydney dance school teacher Grant Davies (pictured) His wife took confronting and explicit photos of their young daughters for the sexual gratification of a Sydney dance school teacher. But the husband says she has always had their children's best interests at heart and wants her back home. He told her sentence hearing on Friday that it was like she was 'under a spell'. The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to producing and disseminating child abuse material following an investigation into alleged sexual and indecent assaults on dance students by their teacher Grant Davies. Sydney's District Court has heard that over almost three years the mother took numerous photos of her daughters for Davies, some of which depicted them performing sexually explicit acts. Describing the dance studio as cult-like, the husband said his wife became ensnared by Davies' charisma. When he raised concerns over the long hours his wife and two children would spend at the studio, he explained it was like talking to a 'zombie'. 'I had no control over my wife and two daughters.' The husband said his wife had always been 'a loving, caring mother'. Davies ran a studio in Sydney's inner west and trained performers for his productions like Billy Elliot . The court previously heard extracts from a series of texts allegedly sent between Davies and the mother on November 8, 2011 about her daughters. When he allegedly requested some 'special G-shots', half an hour later the mother sent sexually explicit photos of her daughter. 'Now that has made me excited. I'm so lucky,' Davies allegedly responded. When Judge Peter Zahra asked the father for his views about these, he said it was a 'different person' to the woman he married 16 years ago. 'She unfortunately, I believe, came across a very evil person and she was too weak to resist the temptation he put in front of her.' He said his wife, who was taken into custody last month, should not be imprisoned but instead be allowed back home. 'They (my children) really are suffering tremendously without her. We all are.' She has pleaded guilty to two counts of using a child under the age of 14 for the production of child abuse material and two counts of disseminating child abuse material. Davies ran a studio in Sydney's inner west and trained performers for hit productions, including Billy Elliot. He is facing more than 50 charges, including child sex and child pornography offences. She will be sentenced on September 19. The dance teacher allegedly requested some 'special G-shots' of his student from her mother .

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . and Alan Roden, In Edinburgh . Support: JK Rowling, pictured with her husband Dr Neil Murray, has taken to Twitter to vent her frustrations at the SNP leader . JK Rowling has accused Alex Salmond of ‘scaremongering’ over the threat to the NHS in Scotland if it stays in the UK. The English-born writer, who has lived in Edinburgh for many years, took to Twitter to vent her frustration at a series of claims from the SNP ahead of this month’s independence referendum. Mr Salmond has claimed the health service can only be protected from ‘privatisation’ in an independent Scotland, even though policy is already fully devolved to Edinburgh. Miss Rowling is married to Dr Neil Murray, a former hospital doctor in Edinburgh who is now a GP, and has donated millions of pounds to tackling multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases. In June she was subjected to a torrent of online abuse by Scottish nationalists after giving £1million to the No campaign. Yesterday, the Harry Potter author directed her 3.6million Twitter followers to a ‘fact check’ by Channel 4, which concludes: ‘NHS England can use more private providers, introduce more charges or stand on its head, but there is no pressure on Scotland to follow suit and no reason why health funding to Scotland will be affected.’ Challenged by photographer Alan McCredie on Twitter, the author later replied: ‘I fund medical research in Scotland (MS). I’m also married to a Scottish GP who deplores scaremongering on the NHS.’ Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: ‘JK Rowling is absolutely right. The nationalists are trying to scare people on the NHS. They should stop it now.’ But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denied scaremongering, saying an independent Scotland would help to ‘protect our public services like the NHS’. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown yesterday pledged to lead the negotiations to win new powers for Scotland following a No vote in the referendum. The former prime minister insisted a vote to keep the Union ‘does not mean no change’. At a Labour event in Westminster, Mr Brown revealed he has written to Commons Speaker John Bercow demanding a full debate when parliament returns in October to thrash out the extra powers that will be handed to Holyrood if full independence is rejected. Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems are agreed further devolution should follow a No vote, but have set out different visions of what should be included. Mr Brown, who is believed to have agreed his plan with Ed Miliband, said the other two parties would have to ‘accept our proposals’, as the Tories have almost no representation north of the border and the Lib Dems are languishing in sixth place in the polls. He said this would involve Scotland being given new tax-raising powers and control over some benefits, including housing benefit. But he said there would be no change in the funding formula, which English MPs complain leads to Scotland being subsidised by English taxpayers. Scroll down for video . The English-born writer was subjected to a torrent of online abuse by Scottish nationalists after giving £1million to the No campaign in opposition to Alex Salmond (right) Mr Brown said Scotland receives £1billion more from the NHS than it would if funding was provided on a strict per-head basis. He also launched an assault on Mr Salmond, particularly over his suggestion that an independent Scotland could continue to use the pound even if Westminster rejects a full currency union. He said this would leave Scotland in a ‘colonial relationship’ with the rest of the UK, as interest rates would be set in London without any regard for the needs of the Scottish economy.","English-born writer took to Twitter to vent her frustration at SNP claims .

Blood was left spattered in the street after the 28-year-old was attacked at 6am today following a night out in the Spanish island's popular tourist resort of Golf De Sur. He was visiting with his pregnant wife Lindsey just two weeks after being named the International Boxing Federation's welterweight world champion in a tense fight in California. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Boxer Kell Brook (right) is in hospital after he was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in Tenerife . Stable condition: Brook was being treated at Candelaria hospital as police remained at the scene of the attack . Aftermath: Blood was splattered on the pavement after the stabbing as police cordoned off the area . A spokesman for his promoters Matchroom said the star was in a stable condition, and a source close to Brook said he was conscious and had suffered a cut arm. The boxer, from Sheffield, had been enjoying a night out in Golf De Sur when the attack happened. An eyewitness to the aftermath told Sportsmail the attack left a trail of blood 100m long, leading to an apartment where an ambulance was called. By MARTIN DOMIN . The 28-year-old won a career-defining victory last month when he defeated rival Shawn Porter in Los Angeles. The Sheffield star had already been through a long career which included 32 professional fights before earning his shot at the IBF welterweight title. Challenging legendary Manny Pacquiao as early as 2010, he nevertheless faced a slow rise from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas. Victory over Argentinian veteran Hector Saldivia two years ago moved him into position to fight then-champion Devon Alexander, but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled. Instead, he faced the undefeated Porter, ousting the champion to become the sixth Brit to hold a world title in the division and the first since Ricky Hatton's brief stint in 2006. Brook was being treated tonight at Tenerife's Candelaria hospital as police remained at the scene of  the attack. A spokesman for the Spanish police, the Guardia Civil, said: 'This morning a 28-year-old British man was stabbed at Golf del Sur in San Miguel de Abona. 'He was stabbed in the left leg and is hospitalised. He lost a lot of blood. 'There are no arrests at this time and the Guardia Civil are investigating.' Brook was on holiday with his heavily-pregnant wife, Lindsey, who is expecting their second child. She left earlier in the evening and was not present when the altercation happened. Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn has not yet been able to speak to the boxer but said he planned to fly out to Tenerife tonight. He said: ‘I will be flying out tonight to see what is going on. We are all worried about what has happened. 'There are a lot of stories out there so let’s just wait and see. I am told he is stable.’ It is the second time Brook has been stabbed after he was attacked outside a nightclub in Sheffield in 2007. He was leaving the Cactus Club when he was stabbed in the side and buttocks. His trainer at the time, Dave Coldwell, said he had been attacked by ‘kids from a car that pulled up’ next to him. Brook returned to fight six months later and has since amassed a perfect record of 33 fights and 33 wins. In action: Brook turned in a gutsy display to beat Porter and line up a potential fight against Amir Khan . Champion: The fighter won a world title just two weeks ago (pictured) and was on holiday with his wife . He won the IBF world title from American Shawn Porter in California last month, and was being lined up this week for a major fight next spring against two-time world champion Amir Khan. Hearn wrote in a column for MailOnline earlier this week: 'Talks are ongoing over a fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan. It is going well because I think everyone realises it makes sense. 'Khan obviously wants a fight with Floyd Mayweather, as does everyone in the division, but he knows that while that fight might never happen, even if it did he would make more money fighting Kell. ‘Everything so far has been very straightforward and I am in talks with Wembley over a May date. They want us back there as soon as possible after the success of Froch-Groves – I have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again. I hope to have this tied up in the next month or so.’ Hearn failed with a previous £3million offer to Khan to fight Brook, but the situation is believed to have changed after the boxer's world title win. Brook's promoter said: 'There are a lot of stories out there so let’s just wait and see. I am told he is stable’ In training: Brook on a run in his hometown of Sheffield in 2010. He has enjoyed a steady rise to fame . Rising: Brook is unbeaten in 33 fights.

'Checkout was midday on the 28th and we didn't see him but the key was still at reception. We waited for a long time and then had a look at his room - it has all his bags still there, his passport, his wallet, wet suit and camera.' Mr Mariata said they then reported him missing to police. Police are mystified on the whereabouts of the Australian tourist, failing to find any trace of Mr Maynard despite searching the area and speaking with locals.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . The note which was left on the dash of the accident victim's car . A Sydney motorist who crashed into a parked car scrawled a note on the back of a fast food voucher offering it as compensation for the damage caused. The unknown driver of a 'nice, black fancy car' apologised in the note for crashing into the parked vehicle in Sydney's inner-western suburb of Newtown on Sunday. But they failed to do the right thing and include their contact details so they could contribute to the repair costs. 'I'm sorry I reversed into your car, I am Asian & can't drive here's a Hungry Jacks voucher!'' said the note. Two witnesses to the Newtown crash said they didn't raise the alarm or take down registration details because they thought the culprit was doing the right thing when they placed the note on the car. The contents of the note indicated the driver was being mischeivous, and possibly racist. Witnesses said the offending driver was not even Asian. The furious owner took their rage to social media site Reddit where they left an image of the Hungry Jacks voucher - valued at $6.25 - and proof of the damage to the car they said would cost them at least $625. 'Some mysterious a-hole smashes into (name redacted) parked car in Newtown and leaves this charming, racist note and a $6.25 Hungry Jacks voucher,' Reddit user Ilyank posted. 'Needless to say they didn't bother to leave any identifying information. Excess on damages = $625.' The damage left to the car by the driver of the 'nice, black fancy car' 'Ilyank' said the witnesses of the alleged crash didn't write down the driver's number plate because they 'assumed they were doing the honourable (sic) thing.' 'Also, they said they were driving a nice,  fancy black car.' The Reddit user hopes by telling her story someone will see what happened and make a stand. 'So, with that huge amount of info to go on, if you know who did this, be a dibber dobber.' In instances such as this, Ilyank said that 'it's OK to turn in your mate.' 'Your friend is an a*****e (sic), friend code does not need to extent to a*****es.' Comments condemning their actions have littered the user's Reddit site, with some venting their own anger over similar incidents. One user, 'furgle' said:  'Luckily I have zero trust for the general driving public and have front and rear dash cams in my cars.' 'Guy left after waiting to see if anyone saw him. Took the video to the police and they had a laugh. He got done with hit & run, and my excess was $0.' Another said it was an unfortunate situation given the witnesses would have taken action to write down the perpetrators details, had they known better. 'The sad thing is that the bystanders would have helped had they known they weren't writing down details. Just an all around a**hole.'","Voucher for $6.25 is worth just 0.01% of the insurance excess on the damaged car .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . An Islamic radical has branded Australian authorities 'the real terrorists', accusing them of plotting to destroy the religion, while an outspoken Islamist firebrand declared today's anti-terror raids were a 'bogus' stunt  to justify new terror laws. Off the back of the largest terror raids in the nation's history, controversial Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne wrote on Facebook: 'THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ALONG WITH ITS AUTHORITIES ARE CLEARLY ATTACKING ISLAM AND MUSLIMS!! (sic)'. He said the Australian government wants to 'destroy Islam by any means...closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims cancelling their passports... and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims'. At the same time, in remarks labelled 'inflammatory' by one moderate Muslim leader, Uthman Badar, the spokesman for the Hizb ut-Tahrir group, said the mass police raids in Brisbane and Sydney were 'just in time to justify the bogus terror threat level rise'. As members of the Islamic community organised a protest in Sydney tonight claiming brutality against Muslims, community leader Dr Jamal Rifi issued a call for calm, asking members of the community, politicians and the media 'not to inflame the situation by throwing oil in the fire'. Scroll down for video . Remarks: Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne (left) and Uthman Badar, the spokesman for the Hizb ut-Tahrir political group, both made the fiery statements this morning. Remarks: Mr Badar made his statement after news of the terror raids this morning. NSW Police released these images of arrests that were made in Sydney this morning. Fifteen people were detained in NSW. Come with us: This arrest, from today's raid, was made in Logan, south of Brisbane. Mr Badar (pictured) made the remarks on his Facebook page this morning. Dr Rifi, who hosted a succesful 'Muslims for Australia' barbeque, at the weekend, said: 'We all have to invest together fighting anyone who is going to affect the safety and security of all Australians.' Both Thorne and Badar today linked the raids to the Abbott government's proposed terror laws. Thorne said the government would use 'the excuse of ""terrorism"" to launch a crazy indiscriminating assault against harmless youth who have done nothing wrong'. Badar said: 'As last as last week the PM and ASIO head were telling us that there was no intelligence of any plans for attacks in Australia'. 'Few days later we wake up to yet more dawn ""terror"" raids with hundreds of police raiding Muslim homes in Sydney and Brisbane.' 'Just in time to justify the bogus terror threat level rise and the 'anti-terror' laws which will be tabled to Parliament next week.' 'Once again, we wake up to the sad news of our innocent Muslim brothers being arrested by the Australian authorities, their families being terrorized, their houses being raided, their freedoms being confiscated, their rights abused... This is becoming more than what a sane person can bare.' 'The Australian government want to destroy Islam by any means, and they know that they can't do so by attacking it directly, so they resort to closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims, cancelling their passports, restricting their freedom, enforcing policies that aim to dividing the Muslim community, and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims, and therefore, they will face no opposition when it comes to passing these new terror laws or arresting innocent Muslims... 'The Australian government is practising institutional terrorism. Its authorities are the real terrorists. 'We ask Allah to destroy those who plot against us, and to keep their harm away from us. Ya Allah look after your obedient servants and protect them from the harm of this government. Ya Allah this government and its authorities have felt safe from your punishment and therefore unleashed their wrath against the innocent harmless Muslims, O Allah so please deal with them according to your justice, and substitute them with others who are less harmful to your religion and its followers.' He continued by saying it was the 'same thing (former Prime Minister) John Howard did' in 2005 when terror raids also took place. Nine men were arrested as part of Operation Pendennis in 2005, which found Australian jihadist cells were amassing equipment to use in a terrorist attack on Australia. Muslim leader Dr Jamal Rifi told Daily Mail Australia those remarks were 'inflammatory' and 'totally premature' given those arrested have not faced court. Dr Rifi said: 'Anti terror raids are really serious matters, and I believe in the professionalism of our security agencies. 'Such a raid shouldn't be taken lightly and I have no doubt that if there isn't enough sufficient evidence, arrest warrants would not be given for such raids.' He said those arrested were entitled to the presumption of innocence and a fair hearing in a court of law. 'Any arrest will be tested in the court of law and we have full confidence in the judiciary systems.' 'We are lucky to be living in the country where the judicial arm will not be influenced by the executive arm of the government - and we (should) just have to wait before making such inflammatory remarks.' Badar said in his post that it would be a 'tough week' for the Muslim community but agreed that the presumption of innocence needed to be upheld. 'It's the government that needs to be interrogated here to prove its claims, not those being made examples of,' he said. He issued a follow up statement this morning labelling the timing of the raids as 'suspect'. 'The timing of these raids is suspect indeed. With the ""anti-terror"" laws, which hit a wall in the community, to be tabled to Parliament next week and with ""military intervention"" imminent in Iraq, these raids are very timely for the government and its propaganda campaign for the same.' Today's raids, which occurred at dawn in suburbs in Sydney and Brisbane, involved 800 police in New South Wales alone. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and outgoing ASIO chief David Irvine announced Australia's terror alert level would be raised to 'high' - meaning an attack is likely - last Friday.

"By . Spencer Matthews for MailOnline . If you had driven past the St Pancras Hotel in London this Thursday you would have thought the billionaire Arab playboys were back in town again. There was a queue of over £5m worth of supercars were parked in a line for the start of the DodgeBall Rally 2014. Two Ferrari 430 spiders, Lambourghini Gallardo and an Aventador, a McLaren 12C, a Ferrari California, Audi R8, and my latest toy, the gorgeous Caterham Seven Roadster. Scroll down for video . Raring to go: Spencer poses with the supercars outside the St Pancras Hotel . A small but perfectly formed pocket rocket – 0-60mph in 4.8 seconds, 175 BHP, top speed of 138 mph, from a 2.0l engine, which punches well above its weight and looks bloody sexy. So sexy in fact that when stopped at the lights on the way down Oxford Street, wearing my new Taylor Morris Roll-Right sunglasses I was approached by a stunning model who came over and just started talking to me out of the blue and then gave me her number. Behind the wheel: The MIC star is ready to go for a spin . Pocket rocket: Spencer drove the small but perfectly formed car . That doesn't normally happen, it's got to be something to do with the motor I suppose, or the glasses, or both. Anyway back to the start of the race and there was much revving of engines as we prepared to put our cars on the Eurostar to start the first leg of the five day journey down to Monza – with Johnny Dodge's merry men and women. Johnny Dodge is a high-end party organiser and this little jaunt is going to visit all the six-star hotels from the Champagne region of France, to Zurich in Switzerland, then on to Lake Como, and then on to the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The last time I was involved in the Dodge Ball rally I didn’t actually make it off British soil. I was the passenger in a £220K Lamborghini Gallardo and the driver took a corner badly in the wet, flipped the car and wrote the Lambo off completely before we even got to Dover. Pulling power: The car helped him get a phone number from a model . I was actually asleep at the time and luckily emerged unscathed but it meant that my Dodge Ball race was seriously cut short. Anyway this year I’m taking no chances with the car and for insurance purposes I have fitted a SmartWitness SVC 1080 camera on the windscreen of the car. It’s an HD CCTV camera that you stick to the front windscreen and it records any incident and can be used as evidence of who is at fault if you are in a crash. Pretty important for me as I don’t want to have to pay for a new Caterham if someone totals this. But as an added bonus is that the quality of the footage is amazing so it’s great for making videos of motor sport races or road trips like this. So wish me luck and hopefully I will actually get to France and back in one piece and I'll see you all next week. Lots of love, Spencer.","This week Spencer took part in DodgeBall Rally 2014 .

"By . Chris Spargo for MailOnline . A new book is giving people an in-depth look at the very secretive world of marijuana farms in America. Grassland is a collection of photographs taken over the course of four years in Humboldt County, California, by an anonymous photographer known simply as H. Lee. From the planting and growing to the tending and picking, Lee had unparalleled access in shooting many of these never before seen workplaces. All access: Anonymous photographer H. Lee spent four years photographing marijuana farms in Humboldt County, California . Stunning photos: Grassland is a sweeping look at the very private world of marijuana growing . Protecting the farms: Lee told growers she would never use her real name if she published her photographs . In the beginning: Smaller plants starting to grow . The result is a stunning and sweeping look at a very hidden industry. So hidden, in fact, most authorities in the sate of California cannot find these farms. Lee spent six years in Humboldt County before she began taking these photographs in 2010, right around the time Prop. 19 appeared on the ballot in California, which would have legalized marijuana in the state had it passed. And while she did not live there full-time, she still considered it a 'home' by her own admission. These six years not only allowed her to get to know everything about the marijuana growing industry, but also  to gain the trust of her subjects, who eventually let her turn the camera on their world. 'I promised the growers and those I photographed that I would use a pseudonym if the work ever got published,' she said in an interview, via email of course, with Feature Shoot. 'As I had spent a lot of time there, I imagined that people would feel more safe if my real name wasn’t linked to the project. Secrecy and discretion are key components to growing weed in Humboldt, as you can imagine.' Prop. 19: Lee says many growers were happy when the California proposition to legalize marijuana was struck down . Secrecy: Though many allowed her in, some refused to let Lee photograph them or their farms . No surprise: Growers were not fond of any sort of press or media according to Lee . Not everyone, however, was willing to let Lee in. 'Many people weren’t into it, and wouldn’t give me access to their scenes at all,' she said. 'And there were others who didn’t even want their body parts shown. Media of any kind wasn’t too popular up in the hills.' Shockingly, she said many growers were happy when Prop. 19 did not pass, as they were afraid government regulations might ultimately drive down their profits once the drug was legalized. Times are changing: Lee feels there has been a major shift in how the public feels about marijuana in just the past four years . Home: Lee spent six years in Humboldt County before she started taking photographs . Small groups: Many farms only had a few people around, unless it was time for picking . She also noted that there has been a major shift in the public's attitude towards marijuana in just the past four years. 'I started the Grassland project when Prop. 19 appeared on the California ballot,' she explained. 'The county was all abuzz and in debate, and most seemed against it. But there were those organizing for the imminent change ahead, and plenty of new people inundating the area to cash in on what people are now calling a Green Rush.' Hidden away: Many authorities would love to know the locations of these farms . Profits: Lergalization could cause trouble for some of these farmers and their profits . It's all here: Lee's book is out now . Grassland, published by Kehrer Verlag, is available now.","A photographer known only as H.

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A retired music teacher has built a custom-made £20,000 garden shed at the bottom of her lawn to house her very own church organ. Alison Malcolm, 66, bought the 424-pipe Victorian instrument from a church 20 years ago for just £500 after they wanted to clear room for renovations. She spent thousands transporting the ten-foot-tall organ and another £20,000 building a special sound-proof shed at the end of the lawn at her detached home. Scroll down for video . That's unusual! Tucked inside Alison Malcolm's garden shed in Wiltshire is an entire 424-pipe organ . Passion: The 66-year-old spent thousands transporting the historic instrument after it was thrown out . The stunning instrument - made by one of the finest pipe organ makers in history - has just been valued at a staggering £72,000. And Mrs Malcolm insists its unusual location not only helps her play better but also keeps her pet hens happy and doesn't disturb the neighbours. She said: 'I really am very lucky to have it - it is a beautiful instrument. 'It is a bit unusual to have a huge church organ at the bottom of your garden where most people keep the garden tools. 'I think most people think I'm a fruit and nut case to be honest but I don't mind. 'I love my organ. The dogs like the music, and the hens like it too - I reckon it makes them lay more eggs.' Taking it down: Cheriton Baptist Church in Folkestone decided to get rid of its organ in 1995 (pictured) Enormous effort: Here, workers are seen intricately dismantling each pipe and board and loading it into a van . A lifelong musician from Alderbury in Wiltshire, widowed Mrs Malcolm bought the organ from Cheriton Baptist Church, in Folkestone, in 1995. The clergy wanted to sell it to make room to install meeting rooms after the stunning wooden and metal instrument was abandoned in favour of more portable instruments. The 1881 eight stopper organ with two keyboards was made by the esteemed 'Father' Henry Willis - the man behind the organs at St Paul's Cathedral and the Royal Albert Hall. But incredibly the church accepted Mrs Malcolm's offer of £500 for the instrument - despite later receiving a £20,000 offer from Holland. She hired specialists to dismantle and reassemble the air-powered instrument and after realising it would not fit in her living room decided to built a huge garden shed. Council planners gave her permission for the structure after visiting her remote home - and making her promise not to play before 8am and after 11pm. Pride and joy: Now Mrs Malcolm can play the grand instrument to her heart's content at the end of her garden . Mrs Malcolm, who is director of music at her local church, said: 'I was so lucky to get the organ for that price, and it was very good of the church to honour their agreement with me. 'It balances beautifully because it is built by such a genius. You pull out one stop and whatever you pull out on top of it to add colour it still balances. 'I had to put it in storage while the room was built. It was quite a thing - the roof had to be specially built and 20 men had to lift the huge metal girder in to support the roof. 'It doesn't disturb anyone when I play because the shed really is sound proof. 'And it's also not that loud. If you pulled out every stop on the organ and played it together it would be very loud, but you don't do that.' The organ has a range of wooden and metal pipes helping it to create a whole orchestra of sounds - including flutes, trumpets and strings. Each stop - the component which lets pressurized air into a set of pipes - is insured for £9,000, making the organ worth £72,000.","Alison Malcolm, 66, bought the 424-pipe organ when church had a clear out .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . and Lucy Osborne for the Daily Mail . and Paul Harris for the Daily Mail . Great British Bake Off contestant Diana Beard has revealed she left the show not because of the ice cream pudding controversy, but because she lost her sense of smell and taste in a freak accident. Viewers of this week’s Great British Bake Off saw one contestant’s ice cream pudding reduced to slush in an apparent act of sabotage by Mrs Beard, causing her rival to storm off and also be eliminated from the competition. The grandmother has since railed against the BBC1 show's producers, claiming their editing 'fakery' made it appear as though it was a deliberate act of sabotage. She has also now clarified that she left the show because she fainted and banged her head during supper with the other contestants just before production of the following episode was due to start. In a freak accident, the pensioner, who lives near Whitchurch in Shropshire, said: 'I fainted - which I have never done - and bashed my head, severing my olfactory nerve. So I have now lost my sense of smell and most of my taste.' She added that she has some sensation of foods which are very salty or vinegary, but has been told by a specialist that nothing medically can be done to repair the damage and she may never fully recover her senses. Stroll down for video . Upset: Diana Beard, 69, pictured at her home in Shropshire, says she has been unfairly blamed for a rival's failed Baked Alaska on last night's show - it later emerged that she never returned to the show . Wednesday night's show descended into chaos when bearded competitor Iain Watters binned his pudding after the ice cream melted in the 25C heat and stormed out of the tent . Diana Bird - who at 69 is the show's oldest ever contestant -  was clearly seen removing his pudding from the freezer despite being warned by another that it belonged to him - but Mrs Beard said today she was the victim of a 'stitch up' Meltdown: This is the moment Iain Watters decided he had to bin his Baked Alaska after it collapsed . Grey-haired Mrs Beard, 69, wept as she . claimed the corporation had cast her as the villain, deliberately . editing the show to make it look as if she had left the dessert out of . the freezer for several minutes. The Daily Mirror reported she said: 'It's a form of fakery and trickery. 'They deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the sake of entertainment. The BBC should be ashamed.' The scandal is the . biggest to hit Bake Off since last year’s Custardgate drama, when one . contestant tearfully admitted taking another’s custard to use in a . trifle. Getting to the soggy bottom of the baked Alaska incident, however, was proving rather more difficult last night. The . story starts on Wednesday when 8million viewers watched bearded Iain . Watters, 31, throw a wobbly when he found his dessert had been reduced . to a splodge after Mrs Beard took it out of the freezer. Diana Beard says the knives have been out for her and she sobbed after watching the show last night . Mr Watters, 31, screamed in frustration and was knocked out of the competition after he walked up to judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with a bin in his hand instead of a pudding . He was eliminated after he presented it in a bin to judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, then stormed off set. That . led to Mrs Beard, from Shropshire, being pilloried as a cheat in cruel . online comments. There were more than 550 complaints to the BBC. She, . however, insisted the recording had been edited to make it seem as if . she had left the meringue and ice cream dessert out for minutes, rather . than seconds. ‘They deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the . sake of entertainment,’ she said. ‘The BBC should be ashamed. ‘The . cake was out of the freezer for 40 seconds and I was asking who it . belonged to. Then Iain walked over and took it away. It happened as . simply as that. ‘Iain didn’t . blame me at all. I was very disappointed and upset by how they cleverly . edited the show and as a result I have people saying all sorts of nasty . things about me.’ What happened to Iain's baked Alaska and is the BBC to blame for its destruction? Others pointed out that Wednesday’s episode had been . filmed in a tent in the May heatwave. Fellow competitor Jordan Cox, 33, . said some freezers had not worked properly in the heat and added: ‘Poor . Diana is a scapegoat for BBC.’ The BBC has received at least 811 complaints about the episode, and the regulator Ofcom received another 13 - a baker's dozen. Twelve of the complaints to Ofcom were raising concerns about the apparent sabotage of the bearded baker's dessert, the regulator said. But today the regulator confirmed it will not investigate further, saying: 'Having assessed viewers’ complaints received to date, they do not raise issues warranting further investigation under Ofcom’s rules.' A spokesman added that if further complaints are raised they will be addressed. Judge Mary Berry, 79, said his behaviour was 'unacceptable' and refused to put him through to the next round . The Irish construction engineer won the sympathy of many who felt he had been the victim of an underhand plot by his rivals . How the Daily Mail reported on Wednesday's scandal . Even . Mr Watters said: ‘I don’t hold Diana responsible in any way. There are . no grudges, we are still friends and keep in contact regularly.’ However, he disputed the claim that the dessert was out of the freezer . for only 40 seconds or so, saying it must have been longer because . otherwise it would not have melted so much. A . BBC spokesman said: ‘Diana removing Iain’s ice cream from the freezer . for less than a minute was in no way responsible for Iain’s departure.’","Diana Beard says 'knives are out' for her and she cried after seeing show .

"By . Ap . A cousin of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez has been sentenced to two years of probation after pleading guilty to contempt for refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted Hernandez in the 2012 killings of two Boston men. Tanya Singleton changed her plea to guilty during a hearing in Boston on Tuesday. Singleton, of Bristol, Connecticut, has been battling a recurrence of breast cancer. Her lawyer says the cancer is incurable and she cannot receive adequate medical treatment in jail. Too ill for jail: Tanya Singleton, the cancer-stricken 38-year-old cousin of accused killer and former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, was sentenced to another two years of probation Tuesday in her second contempt charge for refusing to testify against her cousin . Choosing family: Singleton is battling a recurrence of breast cancer that her attorney says is incurable. She was sentenced to two years probation on the other charge last month . Tanya Singleton, of Bristol, Conn., center, is escorted into a courtroom at Suffolk Superior Court in Boston on Tuesday . A judge granted the defense request to sentence her to probation. She received the same sentence last month in Bristol County, when she pleaded guilty to a separate contempt charge for refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted Hernandez in the 2013 shooting of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. In the previous case, Singleton pleaded guilty to refusing to testify before a grand jury even though she had been granted immunity. 'Ms. Singleton's health is the only reason she is not being placed in jail,' Fall River Superior Court Judge E. Susan Garsh said. County jail officials made it clear they could not meet Singleton's medical needs, the judge said. Singleton is subject to GPS monitoring for the entire probationary period, the first year of which must be spent confined to her home, except for medical and legal appointments. She also was ordered to have no contact with Hernandez, any other suspects or witnesses, except for her father, sister and two close friends. Singleton had refused to testify before a grand jury investigating the July 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd. Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial area near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough. He was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to killing Lloyd and is being held without bail. He also has pleaded not guilty in the 2012 killings of two men in Boston. Singleton, who has been undergoing treatment for a recurrence of breast cancer, pleaded guilty to criminal contempt and had faced up to 2½ years in jail. Tuesday's sentence was the same Singleton received in Bristol County last month when she pleaded guilty to a separate contempt charge for refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted Hernandez in the 2013 shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd . 'Ms. Singleton's willful conduct was an assault on the rule of law,' Garsh said. The sentence was in line with what prosecutors requested. Singleton 'perverted her sense of loyalty' and had an 'utter disdain' of the legal process in trying to protect Hernandez, prosecutor William McCauley said, noting that she had received financial assistance from her NFL star cousin. She put Hernandez ahead of her children, who were ages 4 and 7 at the time, McCauley said, even arranging for their care, knowing she risked imprisonment. Singleton's attorney, E. Peter Parker, asked for a year of home confinement. 'She chose family loyalty ... over civic duties,' a choice most people would make under similar circumstances, Parker said. Prosecutors said Singleton has material information about Hernandez and the movements of his friends Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who both pleaded not guilty to murder and accessory charges in the Lloyd killing. Singleton also refused to testify in the Boston double-killing case and is facing another contempt charge to which she intends to plead guilty. Pleaded not guilty: Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after one of the men accidentally spilled a drink on him at a Boston nightclub. He also has pleaded not guilty to murder in Lloyd's killing. The body of Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, was found near Hernandez's North Attleboro home .","Singleton, of Bristol, Connecticut, got the same sentence last month when she pleaded guilty to a separate contempt charge .

"A French a surf instructor has claimed he saw a man disappear while surfing 10 foot waves at a break know as 'No Man's Land' in Indonesia about the same time as Australian surfer Peter Maynard was reported missing from his Indonesian hotel. Peter Maynard, a father-of-three from Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, was reported missing nearly ten days ago from the Nusa Indah Bungalow on Nusa Lembongan, an island off Bali. Mr Maynard was last seen ten days ago at his hotel having breakfast at about 9am, August 26. But now surfing instructor Christopher Capel, who works at the Monkey Surfing school, claims he saw a surfer separate from the pack, making his way to No Man's Land, he told News Corp Australia. Peter Maynard's wife, Kylie, reveals her devastation by this mysterious disappearance and believes one of her husband's three surfboards was missing from his room . He says he last saw the surfer catch a 10 foot wave before disappearing into the sea. At the time he disappeared, the island was experiencing winter huge swells. Mr Capel said he remembers 15 surfers in the area and predicts the over crowding as the reason for the surfer to separate. 'It was a big set coming and we could see from far away he managed to catch one wave and after the big set was going, he went with the foam.

But she said she didn't have any clue he was missing until she was contacted by consular officials. The father-of-three was last seen ten days ago at his hotel, in Nusa Indah Bungalow on Nusa Lembongan, having breakfast on August 26 at around 9am. It was when Mr Maynard failed to check out on August 28 that staff became suspicious and reported him missing to police. Hotel owner Made Mariata told Daily Mail Australia Mr Maynard checked in to the hotel on August 23 at midday and was meant to stay for five days. 'Checkout was midday on the 28th and we didn't see him but the key was still at reception. We waited for a long time and then had a look at his room - it has all his bags still there, his passport, his wallet, wet suit and camera.' Mr Mariata said they then reported him missing to police.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Clive Turner, pictured, died at his home in Rossett, north Wales after suffering a haemorrhage in his digestive tract, just hours after being released with constipation . A pensioner died after waiting five-and-a-half hours for an ambulance - and a further two hours to be seen in hospital before being incorrectly diagnosed. Clive Turner died at his home in Rossett, north Wales after suffering a haemorrhage in his digestive tract, just hours after being released with constipation. The night before, the 73-year-old had waited five-and-a-half hours for an ambulance to be made available before waiting two more hours to be seen at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. An inquest heard he had suffered with constipation in the week leading up to his death. On March 25, an ambulance was called at 4pm after he reported suffering pain, but it was not until 9.30pm that an ambulance was available. A first responder paramedic arrived to Mr Turner one hour and 27 minutes after the initial 999 call and a healthcare worker stayed with him until the main ambulance arrived. Mr Turner arrived at Wrexham Maelor Hospital just after 9.50pm but was not seen until almost midnight, by Dr Tatiana Rooney from the emergency department. That night, an abdominal X-ray was ordered for Mr Turner, who worked in engineering and as a ground catering manager at Liverpool and Everton football clubs, which found no signs of bowel obstruction. Dr Rooney diagnosed Mr Turner with constipation and, during the early hours of March 26, discharged him from hospital. But shortly before 1.25pm that day Mr Turner died at his home. A post-mortem examination found he had a haemorrhage in his digestive tract and coroner John Gittins said he had been incorrectly diagnosed as constipated. The cause of death was listed as a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, as a result of ischaemic bowel owing to atherosclerosis - or a clogging of the arteries. In evidence, Dr Rooney said Mr Turner's main complaint was abdominal pain but he appeared comfortable and his pain score was recorded at two, which is deemed 'mild'. She said she had not asked if he had taken any pain relief as she relied on the ambulance for that. he 73-year-old had waited five-and-a-half hours for an ambulance to be made available before waiting two more hours to be seen at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, pictured . Mr Gittins gave a narrative conclusion at the hearing in Wrexham but made reference to the death of Fred Pring, who died at his home in Mynydd Isa, near Mold, in March 2013 after waiting 48 minutes for an ambulance. At Mr Pring's inquest in January, Mr Gittins said it could not be 'established with certainty' if Mr Pring would have survived if the ambulance had arrived sooner. But he said it was 'probable' if it had arrived within eight minutes he would have lived long enough to be transported to hospital for further medical treatment. A post-mortem examination found Mr Turner had a haemorrhage in his digestive tract and coroner John Gittins, pictured, said the pensioner had been incorrectly diagnosed as constipated . He said the loss of even a single life to a potential delay was unacceptable and he was writing to the Welsh Ambulance Trust and Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to tell them about his concerns that - unless action was taken - risks of deaths would continue. The Welsh Ambulance Trust responded on March 19 - a week before Mr Turner's death - saying problems with delays were being tackled. During his conclusion, Mr Gittins said the situation cannot continue. He said: 'I know from the evidence he has undoubtedly suffered in the hours leading up to his death, as a result of not being treated quickly enough.' 'Although the death was not as a result of that delay, I am concerned about that delay. 'Changes must happen and they must happen soon. 'My intention is to seek assurances from them (the Welsh Ambulance NHS Trust and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board) and to receive updates, tables and averages times of delays and handovers.' Mr Gittins said Mr Turner's case could be a 'catalyst for change'. The coroner said he would raise a regulation 28 report regarding Dr Rooney's absence of knowledge regarding whether Mr Turner had been administered pain relief, as well as her absence of knowledge on the safeguarding of discharging patients. A Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board spokesman said: 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Clive Turner. 'We fully accept the coroner's verdict and will ensure the appropriate action is taken to address the issues raised at the inquest. 'We are working very closely with the Welsh Ambulance Service to minimise delays at emergency departments wherever possible.'","Clive Turner died at his home after suffering haemorrhage in digestive tract .

"Father's day is fast approaching, but ambulance workers urge Dad's to pick up their new tools with caution, as injures increase over special occasions . Father's day is just around the corner but if you are thinking of getting your Dad a tool to do some DIY around the home - you might want to think again. Each year, at least 4 people - mainly men - die due to ladder injuries with 1,300 people are injured.  While at least 46 Australians were crushed and killed while working under a vehicle in the decade to 2011. NSW Fair Trading work are running a national 'Don't be a Tool' campaign, to combat the number of injuries that result from home DIY projects. But ladders are the least of your worries according to NSW Fair Trading Minister, Matthew Mason-Cox, who is urging do-it-yourself (DIY) enthusiast to 'take extra care' while doing work around the home. 'DIY gadgets are popular purchases for Father's day and many dads, me included, will be tempted to try out the new gadgets and do maintenance and improvements around the home,' Mr Mason-Cox said. 'The reality is that simple DIY jobs like pruning, cleaning out gutters and painting a ceiling can end in disaster,' said Mr Mason-Cox. He advises people who attempt to fix their car to never work under it, saying each year '160 people experience fracture and crush injuries' due to car jacks. Mr Mason-Cox suggests planning your home project in advance, to assess what skills  and equipment are required to complete the project safely, and to not be afraid to pass the job on to an expert. Dr Tim Health, Head of Hand Surgery Unit at Sydney Hospital said injuries from a circular saw and angle grinders are common . Superintendent for Queensland Ambulance Service Sean Mutchmor has seen plenty of DIY victims and told Daily Mail Australia that Father's day weekend is a lot like any other long weekend where people need to be more conscious of safety. 'It's one of those things where a father and son build a deck - when it is a holiday and frosty beverages, alcohol and power tools are involved, it becomes dangerous. 'We have to remind people to take on the project safely,' he said. 'A lot of people are too relaxed.' 'Projects can be fun of course but you just need to remember to be conscious.' 'Most of the injuries we see are related to power tools, people who aren't professionals, sawing their fingers off or lacerations,' Superintendent Mutchmore said. James Golfin, 35, an experience tradesman, knows the effects of a DIY injury all too well, after accidentally slicing off his pinky finger with a circular saw, while finishing off a day-bed he had built for his partner's family home in Bondi Beach, Sydney.

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . An ex-soldier has been handed a suspended sentence for racially aggravated threatening behaviour towards an amputee gipsy busker who bragged on national TV about 'milking the benefits system'. Viorel Dinu, 25, told Channel 5's Gypsies on Benefits and Proud he and other Romanians had come to the UK because it was a 'soft touch' for scroungers, a court heard. But his boasts caught up with him when former soldier Mark Hawksby, 34, recognised him from the programme after tripping over the busker's money-filled coat on a street in York. Scroll down for video . Amputee Gipsy busker Viorel Dinu, 25, appeared on Channel 5's Gypsies on Benefits and Proud earlier this year . When he turned round he found Dinu, who has no legs, sitting on a skateboard in a shop doorway grinning all over his face, the court heard. Hawksby recognised the busker immediately from the hour-long documentary which he had only watched the week before. Hawksby, who pleaded not guilty, told York Magistrates' Court: 'I had a go at him about being on the programme and what he had said. 'He said he had come to Britain purposely because it was a soft touch. 'I said ""You're out of order for going on this TV programme and saying you can milk the system"". 'I admit I raised my voice - but after he started laughing at me. 'I'm an ex-soldier - 10 to 12 years ago. I was three years in the Army and served with the Ghurkas, Fijians and all races. 'If he had been an Englishman, Welshman or Scotsman I would have had the same feelings towards him.' The court heard that Hawksby threw the coat into the gutter in Coney Street, York, on the morning of April 26, scattering the cash everywhere. He then grabbed Dinu's accordion and threw it into the road, saying: 'This is English money for English people.' A crowd quickly gathered, with many puzzled by what was happening because they had not seen the TV programme, the court heard. The court heard that Hawksby was grabbed by a girl from a hen party and he then stormed off, yelling: 'I will see you do not busk in York again.' Ex-soldier Mark Hawksby, 34, was found guilty of racially aggravated threatening behaviour . Dinu, who travels the country telling people he lost his legs as a child when he was run over by a train, did not report the incident and did not co-operate with police who investigated after complaints from the public. The incident would never have come to police attention if pensioner Maurice Vassie had not reported the matter and a university professor had not taken pictures. Mr Vassie overheard Hawksby telling the busker: 'Go back where you come from.' Mr Vassie said: 'It could have been Doncaster for all I knew - but it was clearly xenophobic. I was shocked.' Professor Nick Brown, of the science and technology department at York University, took the photos which led to the ex-soldier's arrest. He said: 'The busker was being told to go back home because he was not from Britain. 'What I was witnessing was almost certainly a racially motivated attack.' The incident, on Coney Street, York (pictured), was caught on camera by a university professor who handed over the pictures to the police . After his arrest, Hawksby told officers: 'I told him ""I couldn't go to Romania and do what you do"". He is milking the system and it winds me up. 'He is not even from York. It costs £23 to £25 on the train so he must be earning some right money busking.' Neal Kutte, defending, said: 'It was a chance meeting. He had seen this programme which was glorifying milking the system. 'He was annoyed this man was claiming money when he should not have been. It was nothing to do with his nationality.' But prosecutor Neil Holdsworth argued: 'The target of the abuse was a foreign national and therefore it's a racial incident.'

"A 19-year-old student pledging to the Zeta Mu Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi at California University State Northridge (CSUN) was killed by hazing, the school confirmed today after an internal investigation of the July incident. Armando Villa, 19, was found blistered and barefoot in a ditch after running out . of water while being forced to complete an 18-mile hike through the Angeles Forest while 'blindfolded and without shoes or his cell-phone.' Other pledges were able to track down a park ranger for help but Villa was later pronounced dead at the hospital. CSUN President Dianne Harrison read a report of the school's findings on Friday and announced that the fraternity has permanently withdrawn from the institution. A separate police investigation will probe individual student culpability for Villa's death. Victim of hazing: Armando Villa, 19, died in July after her ran out of water while hiking an 18-mile trail in the Angeles Forest without shoes or his cell phone as part of a hazing ritual . Serious matter: California State University, Northridge, CSUN,president Dr. Dianne Harrison, right, reads a statement regarding Pi Kappa Phi fraternity activities that lead to the death of CSUN student Armando Villa . Surrendered:  The Zeta Mu Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi at Cal State Northridge permanently withdrew from the institution yesterday . 'The report’s findings are deeply disturbing, and I will not turn a blind eye to any reports of hazing. Hazing is stupid, senseless, dangerous and against the law in California. 'It is a vestige of a toxic way of thinking in which it was somehow okay to degrade, humiliate and potentially harm others. It has no place on this or any university campus, in any student club or organization, and it will not be tolerated,' said Harrison in a statement. Harrison also said that the hike was planned without safety precautions. The pledges didn't have enough water and were blindfolded and were stripped of their cell phones and their shoes, reports NBC. Villa's family are asking students who were present during the hike to come forward with more information about the moments leading up to their son's death. 'There’s just a lot of things that don’t add up and what they’re telling us, it’s not enough. They know a lot more than they’re telling us,' says Jose Serrato, Villa’s stepfather, told reporters at NBC. In a separate statement, Villa's parents called hazing a 'barbaric ritual.' Initiation: Villa's family say he and other young men hoping to join the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity were left on a mountain with very little water and no shoes to find their way back overnight .

Hazing is to blame: California State University, Northridge, CSUN president Dr. Dianne Harrison, right, holds a report regarding Pi Kappa Phi fraternity hazing activities that lead to the death of CSUN student Armando Villa . Beloved: Villa (left, pictured with two cousins) was trying to join the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and his family say they believe his death is the result the 'barbaric' hazing ritual . 'Hazing is an awful practice. It cost our son his life,' they said. 'No one else should suffer because of this barbaric ritual that endangers and ridicules others just for the enjoyment of immature young men.' Villa's mother and stepfather told reporters that they found a message in their son's phone following his death about his desire to stop hazing. 'Some people know what happened out there on the trail. They talk about a fraternity being a brotherhood based on honor, but neither the local chapter, the national parent organization of Pi Kappa Phi, nor any of Armando’s so-called brothers have done the honorable thing by telling us what happened to our son,' Villa’s parents said. 'It is shameful behaviour and we hope and pray that no other parent ever has to go through what we have suffered through.' Investigation: Villa (left) was found with no shoes and blisters to his feet and back and police are investigating to determine student culpability for his death . The national and local chapters of Phi Kappa voted yesterday to withdraw from the university permanently, reports the LA Times. The fraternity had already been suspended. The Los Angeles County Sherif’s Department is conducting an investigation but their findings have not yet been released . NBC reports that the college set new guidelines for hazing on August 19 including conditions that fraternities must submit recruitment procedures to the school before proceeding with them. In a statement issued back in July following Villa's death, Mark Timmes, chief executive of the national Pi Kappa Phi, said hazing 'has no place in our fraternity.' 'Should the student chapter or individual members be found in violation of Pi Kappa Phi’s standards of conduct through our discipline process, they will be held accountable by the national fraternity,' he said. Now being questioned is whether or not criminal charges will be filed against members of the fraternity if they are found responsible. The LA Times reports that hazing is a crime in California ever since the 2006 death of a Cal State Chico students who was forced to drink too much water and suffer at the hands of fraternity tormentors.","Armando Villa, 19, was pledging to the Zeta Mu Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi at Cal State Northridge (CSUN) when he was found dead in a ditch .

Animal expert and 'outback wrangler' Matt Wright who spends most of his time, relocating wildlife, and collecting crocodile eggs in the wet season definitely had a bit of a close call with one fiesty character. The 33 year old, a well-known Nat Geo Wild channel personality, was fishing at the mouth of the Victoria river near the Western Australian border when it's believed a large crocodile tried to steal his dinner. The NT News reported that the hungry croc followed his catch back to the bank in an attempt to try and chow down.

'With the movement of the fish flapping around he got pretty inquisitive and came up to grab it,' he said. 'He was only about 1.2 metres long — the photo makes it look worse than it is.' 'I’ve never had a problem with the big ones, unless they’re trying to defend a nest. But the little ones are really inquisitive. he told NT News. The daring facebook picture from 2012, which sees Matt prodding the crocodile with a fishing stick only just surfaced this week. The animal lover then told the bizarre story to go with it, of how he had to fend off the hungry croc so he could keep his catch which was his dinner. Mr Wright said when the animal fronted him on the river, he was fortunately able to defend his catch by chucking the reptile one of the smaller fish.

"By . Associated Press . A bow-hunter in Washington says he was attacked by a black bear while looking for deer. Jerry Hause, 61, and his 26-year-old son Jeffrey were out on a hunt Monday when he decided to sit down to rest for a minute. That's when he saw the black bear coming at him at a dead run. 'I stood up and in one motion that bear jumped out of the creek it was in and was on level ground with me,' Hause, of Longview, told The Daily News. 'And as soon as it was on level ground it was on a dead run after me.' Jerry Hause is an avid outdoorsman, but running away from a black bear was a first for him . A few days before Jerry Hause was bit by a black bear, his son captured this image of what appears to be the beast that bit him . Hause is an avid outdoorsman who's been hunting for decades — but having started bow hunting just four years ago, he didn't think he'd have time and the skills to pick up his bow and shoot the charging bear. Instead, he scrambled up a tree while the animal, which appeared to be 250 to 300 pounds, closed in on him. 'I knew the tree was right there, so I headed up that to get far enough up the tree that the bear couldn’t get me,' Hause told The Daily News. He thought he was out of the bear's reach. He was wrong. 'It totally amazes me how fast that bear got on me,' Hause he told the newspaper. 'In three seconds it was on me.' The black bear bit and clawed against the hunter's left leg — and didn't let go until Hause kicked it in the snout with his right foot. 'I was thinking, ""If it gets me out of this tree I’m a dead man,""' he told The Daily News. 'It was mad, it was growling, it was serious about what it was going to do.' But amazingly, the bear let go after the kick, dropped to the ground and moved on. Hause waited around for a while and was eventually able to walk out and call for help. He was treated for puncture wounds and claw scratches at a hospital and is recovering at home. Wildlife experts say black bears usually run away when they hear people. This unusual level of aggression indicates the bear may have been a mother protecting its cubs. Local officials planned on euthanizing the bear — but Hause convinced them otherwise because of the likelihood it was a just a frightened animal acting our of motherly instincts. 'It either had cubs out there or I was threatening its food,' he told The Daily News. 'It’s bear country. They live in the woods. I don’t.' For his part, Hause has learned his lesson: next time he goes bow hunting, he plans to carry a pistol.

The Welshman famously scored the winning goal in extra time of the 2014 FA Cup final and has since signed a contract with Elite models. Now the Arsenal midfielder, 23, stars in Urban Active - Men's Health's brand new biannual supplement dedicated to fashion and sport - revealing his diet secrets and what he really thinks about modelling. Scroll down for video . Handsome footballer Aaron Ramsey is hotly tipped to be the next David Beckham . Giving an insight into his daily diet, he said: 'Breakfast is muesli, a couple of eggs, green tea and a banana; lunch is fish with a big plate of vegetables and maybe a bit of rice. 'I stay away from desserts but every now . and then I have a sticky toffee pudding or a cup of tea with some . biscuits… I say ""some"", more like half a packet. I try not to keep any . in the house.' After a game, he swears by protein shakes and cherry supplements - 'they help you recover that extra one or two per cent,' he said. Fashion is something the photogenic Ramsey is increasingly concerned about, having been signed to the special bookings' board of London's Elite model agency. 'There's been some banter about it from the lads. But I really enjoyed the Urban Active shoot,' he said of his recent turn in front of the camera.

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . A teacher who had a major meltdown and suffered chronic depression, due to 'feral' and 'unruly' students, has been awarded almost $770,000 in damages. Peter Doulis, 48, sued the Victorian education department after he claimed he was left unable to work because he was forced to teach some of worst behaved students at Werribee secondary college between 1998 and 2004. The Supreme court ruling which was handed down Friday, could also set a precedent, and pave the way for more action against the Victorian Education department. Teacher Peter Doulis was awarded almost $770,000 in damages after he claimed he suffered major depression and a meltdown from being forced to teach some of the worst behaved students at Werribee Secondary college (pictured) between 1998 and 2004 . The Supreme court ruled in favour of a Melbourne teacher who claimed he was left unable to work after being subject to 'feral' and 'unruly' students at Werribee Secondary College between 1998 and 2004. Peter Doulis says some students would be 'virtually crawling up the wall' before his classes . The court was told, Mr Doulis was threatened while teaching at the school. ABC News reported he described how 'feral' students would be 'virtually crawling up the wall' before his classes and in one instance a student, armed with a makeshift flame thrower, singed another student's jumper. The supreme court voted in favour of the teachers claims, finding the school had breached it's duty of care to Mr Doulis. 'I find that that breach of duty was a cause of the chronic severe major depressive condition that he now has,' ABC News reported the judge saying. 'I also consider that, had Mr Doulis's workload of low classes and foundation classes been reduced, and if he had been supported in his teaching duties, then it is probable that his psychiatric condition would not have deteriorated.' Principal Kevin O'Neil commented on behalf of the school and the education department releasing a statement. 'Our school has a learning model that allocates students to classes based on their different academic achievement levels, allowing them to move up and down the levels each semester as their achievements change,' he said. 'this allows our teachers to target their teaching to the appropriate level and spend more time teaching level-appropriate content and less time addressing the varied needs of students in mixed classes.' Mr O'Neil also added that the results of the model are clearly demonstrated by the school's VCE performance, which is consistently higher than similar schools. 'Our teachers also benefit from this model. It allows them to become well rounded and dynamic.' 'All of our teachers are given classes across levels and we do not disproportionately allocate any teachers to any one level. We no longer allow teachers to request to teach at only one level.' The statement also added, quoting directly from the judgment –'The evidence at trial established that the College is now one of the finest schools in the western suburbs of Melbourne.' The Victorian Workcover Authority also commented on the ruling saying it will consider the judgement handed down in the Supreme Court. 'A decision as to whether or not the matter will be appealed will be made in due course,' said a Victorian Workcover Authority spokesperson. A separate hearing to determine compensation for future losses will be held later this month.","Melbourne teacher Peter Doulis has been awarded nearly $770K due to 'feral' and 'unruly' kids .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . and Reuters . The biggest soda companies in the country promised to cut the calories Americans get from their drinks by a fifth - but will do it by clever marketing rather than changing the sodas themselves. The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc. and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. today gave a joint pledge to cut the calories consumed via their products by 20 per cent before 2025. However, the companies' plan won't involve changing what's in their sugary drinks - but by promoting their lower-calorie alternatives, cutting portion sizes and making people more aware of the amount of sugar in regular sodas. Cut calories: The companies have said they want to reduce the number of calories consumed as a result of their products - but will do so by plugging low-calorie products rather than changing what's in them . The companies - whose full-calorie products are already in decline - made the promise today alongside the rest of the American Beverage Association at a New York summit arranged by the Clinton Foundation and supported by former President Bill Clinton. They plan to reach their 20 percent goal through . education targeted at communities with less interest in and . access to lower calorie beverages. They will promote products . like bottled water and introduce and expand their offerings of . zero calorie or lower-calorie products. Initially, those efforts . will be rolled out in Little Rock, Arkansas and Los Angeles. Supporter: Former President Bill Clinton described the initiative as 'huge' - and confessed to his own youthful soda habit . The foundation was also linked to a . separate initiative to reduce beverage calories in schools in . 2006. Speaking about the pledge to the New York Times, President Clinton said: 'This is huge - I've heard it could mean a couple of pounds of weight lost each year in some cases.' He added that he could sympathize with those who drink a lot of soda, because it is a cheap way to keep back hunger. Alternatives: The soda companies will push lower-calorie versions instead of the standard ones in a bid to boost public health. Pictured above is Coca Cola Life, an alternative soda with 60 per cent fewer calories than regular coke, which is currently on trial . He said: 'When I was in my freshman year in college trying to live on a dollar a day, I drank at least one and sometimes two 16-ounce bottles of Royal Crown Cola a day because they cost 15 cents.' Now he prefers water and iced tea. Susan K. Neely, the president of the American Beverage Association, said the plan will build on earlier success. She said: 'It'd be hard to sustain the progress that has been made so far without this commitment,' In 2010, 16 of the biggest U.S. food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, pledged to remove 1 trillion calories from the U.S. marketplace by 2012 and 1.5 trillion by 2015. The companies are part of the CEO-led Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation formed in 2009 to reduce obesity. In January, companies in the foundation said they had collectively sold 6.4 trillion fewer calories in the United States in 2012 than in 2007. ut an analysis by University of North Carolina researchers, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine last week, showed that total calories from packaged goods sold to households with children by those companies did not change from 2011 to 2012. Government data show that 34 percent of adults were obese in 2007-2008.","Companies made pledge - to take effect by 2025 - today in New York .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . A Utah woman accused of dumping her newborn in the trash in an attempt to hide her pregnancy from her parents has been charged with attempted murder, Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill said Friday - and a batch of photos reveal she may have been partying while expecting. Alicia Marie Englert, 23, deliberately tried to kill the baby by depriving her of food and medical care before leaving her in the bottom of her neighbor's trash underneath other bags of trash, Gill said. The baby girl was flown to a hospital in critical condition on Aug. 26 after being found suffering from hypothermia and respiratory distress, he said. She has since improved and is now in fair condition, Unified Police said. 'It's certainly a testament to how resilient these babies can be,' Gill said. 'It's quite remarkable that the baby is doing well and is improving steadily.' Fox13 published last Friday a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said. Partier: Fox13 published photographs of Alicia Englert, who may have been partying while pregnant with her baby daughter . Charged: Englert has been charged with attempted murder . Social: Englert and her apparent friends were seen 'partying' in this image released by Fox 13 . The affiliate station also reported on Englert's 'Meet Me :)' profile, which stated she didn't have any children. In full, her 'About Me' section read, 'hi my name is alicia im 23 years old I work full time I have brown hair im 5'1 I have no kids I do drink but only on the weekends I have my own car I still live with my mom and dad for now!!! if you want to know more just ask ;)' Fox13 said its Facebook commenters, responding to Englert's story, said 'they don’t believe she has severe learning disabilities because she had a driver’s license, drove her own car, was normal at work and ""partied a lot.""' Englert doesn't yet have an attorney. She is in Salt Lake County jail on $500,000 bail. Her father, Robert Englert, declined comment when reached by phone by the Associated Press Friday. Gill offered new details about what happened in the 36 hours leading up to the baby being found by a neighbor in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns. Englert gave birth in a bathroom inside the house she lived in with her family around midnight on Aug. 24, Gill said. She wrapped the baby in a towel and left it on the floor of the basement bathroom, he said. Bust a move: Englert seems to dance on the ground while at a party . Ready to mingle? Englert maintained a dating profile, which stated she did not have any children . Well-documented: Besides the photos of Englert 'partying,' multiple selfies have emerged . Englert left for work the following day, leaving the baby alone without feeding her or getting her any care. She came back home that night and left the baby on the floor. The next morning, Englert put the baby in her neighbor's trash can just before 6 a.m., Gill said. A neighbor heard sounds of what she thought was a purring cat in her trash can. When she moved several trash bags, she spotted the baby, Gill said. She couldn't get the baby out and ran next door for help. There, she found Englert's father, Robert Englert, who helped get the baby out of the trash can. Emergency responders put the baby on a life-flight helicopter. The baby was dirty, smelly and had a blood-borne infection, Gill said. 'If the baby had not been discovered and not received medical condition, it certainly would have died,' he said. Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said. Robert Englert has said previously his daughter has a learning disability and has only recently begun to understand what she has done. Hidden: Englert shields her face as she is escorted by police from a home in Kearns, Utah in this August 26 file photo . 'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune last week. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.' He told the newspaper he didn't know who the baby's father was. The woman's mother, Tammy Englert, told The Deseret News last week that her daughter didn't understand what had happened. 'We tried to explain it to her, and she didn't realize it was that bad what she had done,'Tammy Englert said. She said her daughter had gained weight recently, but she had no idea Alicia Englert was pregnant. 'I'm not going to tell my daughter, ""You're fat, and lose some weight,""'Tammy Englert told the newspaper. 'How do you do that?' Gill said they had no evidence of any disability and that it was not a factor in his decision about charges. If Englert suffers from any condition, that issue will be dealt with as the case moves through the courts, he said.","Alicia Englert, 23, is charged with attempted murder and allegedly dumped her newborn in the trash in an attempt to hide her pregnancy from her parents .

"By . Aap . A Victorian snake handler who was banned from performing live shows after letting snakes repeatedly bite his daughter can reapply for his licence. Raymond Hoser, 52, was stripped of his licence to perform with snakes because he allowed a taipan and death adder to bite his 12-year-old daughter seven times in a show at a Melbourne shopping centre. The snakes had undergone a procedure to remove their venom glands, but the bites drew blood. The 52-year-old man has had his performing licence re-instated after it was revoked when he had two deadly snakes bite his daughter during a live show . Hoser was also punished for having his snakes too close to the audience without proper barriers. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) stripped Mr Hoser of his wildlife demonstrator and handler licence. This decision was upheld in an appeal in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). But the Victorian Court of Appeal on Friday set aside those 2012 rulings, and will allow Mr Hoser to reapply for his licence. This was Raymond Hoser's third appeal to the Court of Appeal in Victoria. He said the revoking of his licence meant his business lost thousands of dollars . Justices Robert Redlich and Joseph Santamaria found the VCAT rulings that Mr Hoser had reckless disregard for the public could not be sustained and failed to take account of the effect of the cancellation on his livelihood. Hoser celebrated the success of appeal on Facebook and said his business, Snakebusters, had lost 'thousands of dollars' in income because of his licence being revoked. This was the third time Hoser had tried to overturn the ruling in the Court of Appeal.","Raymond Hoser's licence was revoked in 2012 after he let deadly snakes bite his daughter .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . A door-to-door salesman who promised to clean an elderly grandmother's home before charging her $3500 for a vacuum cleaner she cannot even lift. Paulette Rozan, who lives in a one bedroom apartment in Southport, north of Surfers Paradise in Queensland and cannot lift heavy objects after having shoulder surgery, said the salesman convinced her to sign up for a cleaning service. The 83-year-old woman told A Current Affair she was convinced to sign up after the man said he 'was from the government' who worked as a cleaner. Scroll down for video . The 83-year-old woman told A Current Affair that the salesman claimed he was a cleaner from the government and asked if he could clean her carpet . The Gold Coast woman said he asked if he could come and clean her carpet . 'Can I come to clean your place? I said 'yes,' she said. When she realised the salesman was trying to sell her a Kirby vacuum cleaner, she said, 'no thank you.' 'I was very angry to have that vacuum cleaner. I've never used it and nobody used it, ' Ms Rozan said. 'I said I can't use it, don't you understand? [The man said] But you don't have to use it because I will come and use it for you. 'He said, ""don't worry, I'll come every week to do the cleaning"". I believed him because I told him I cannot use that vacuum cleaner - it's too heavy and I've got a vacuum cleaner.' An elderly grandmother was promised to have her house cleaned every week by a door-to-door salesman, instead, she was left with a $3500 vacuum cleaner almost the size of her . Monique Hopkins said there was no possible way for her grandmother to use the vacuum cleaner if she wanted to because it was too heavy and big . A Current Affair visited the Queensland Carpet Shampooers and Vacuums Pty Ltd in Bundall, west of Surfers Paradise and a saleswoman demonstrated on how to use the Kirby vacuum cleaner. When asked how heavy the machines were, the saleswoman said: 'They're about 18 kilos.' 'It pretty much sells itself. It can blow up air mattresses and balloons and all that, the list goes on and on. And they all explain that when they come out,' the saleswoman said. Ms Rozan said the man told her: ""Don't worry. This is a fantastic vacuum cleaner and it vacuum cleans and steams - everything. I'll do it"" but I never see him again and never heard from him.' Her granddaughter Monique Hopkins said: 'I just thought he took advantage of her, an elderly lady who was not understanding of what was being said,' she said. Ms Hopkins said her grandmother is around five foot tall and the vacuum cleaner is almost the size of her. 'So she's not even big enough or strong enough to be able to use a machine and you can see that by just looking at it straight away.' The 83-year-old woman told A Current Affair that the salesman claimed he was a cleaner from the government and asked if he could clean her carpet . The distributor told A Current Affair that the Kirby vacuum cleaner can shampoo carpets, blow up air mattresses and balloons, and can also do spray tans . Ms Hopkins said that there was no possible way that her grandmother could use it if she wanted to. But that didn't stop the salesman from selling it to the elderly woman and she didn't realise how much it had cost her until he left her home. 'My credit card - I paid him and he left. And he left me that and took the money.' Ms Rozan told A Current Affair that she cannot afford to keep the vacuum cleaner but was told that the machine could shampoo so he could come and shampoo her carpets as well. Tim Perry, from Queensland's Fair Trading, told A Current Affair that it was also the first time he heard of the salesman's offer to do the cleaning for the customer. 'It would be a very flamboyant sales technique to go around and vacuum someone's house on the provider that they purchase the product. It's the first time I've heard one of those. 'That's probably the first $3500 vacuum cleaner I've ever heard of,' Mr Perry said. A Current Affair reports that the distributor had told them that the vacuum cleaner can even do a spray tan, which is another service that Ms Rozan did not need. 'He did take advantage of me and I won't let him in [my home] again,' she said. A sales rep from the distrubutor told A Current Affair that the vacuum cleaner weighed around 18 kilograms . Ms Hopkins said she called the distributor to tell them that she was not happy with the situation that had happened to her grandmother. 'Shes been taken advantage of and we would like our money back and there was no more contact after that,' Ms Hopkins said. Ms Rozan is not the only one who came close to falling for the 'promising deal.' One woman posted on the A Current Affair Facebook page saying she also had a man selling a Kirby vacuum clearer at her door step, 'promising to clean all my carpets.' 'One square for the demo, couldn't get a stain out and some ridiculous price which even though, all through the 3 hours, I asked the price was not revealed until the end,' she posted. A Current Affair contacted the company on Thursday and were told that the man who sold Ms Rozan the vacuum cleaner, no longer worked for the company and reported that the manager apologised for the stress they put Ms Rozan through and were happy to refund her money.","A Gold Coast grandmother was sucked in by a door-to-door salesman, who sold her a machine she can't even lift .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A stray dog from Chicago covered in matted fur and soaked in urine went through a miraculous transformation after being saved by animal care workers and will now live in a new and loving home thanks to her story becoming viral on social media. When Ellen the dog, 2, was discovered as a stray walking through the Chicago streets she was covered in matted fur and soaked in urine. Animal workers at the Trio Animal Foundation couldn't even tell if she was a girl or a boy. NBC reports that Ellen was once described as being a 'clump of pungent urine-soaked matted fur.'After being found by animal control in July, 8.5 pound Ellen was shed of her fur and her dramatic transformation became viral shortly after being posted on social media. Hidden: When animal rescuers found Ellen, she was so covered in fur that they could not tell if she was a girl or a boy . Severely abused: Ellen was covered in matted and urine soaked fur and was very hungry . Matted: Ellen's fur was stuck together and weighed a total of two pounds . Grooming: Ellen's grooming took two hours of hard work from rescuers . A posting about her rescue has over 3,000 likes on Facebook. 'Flies and gnats swarmed around the pup and what appeared to be the dog’s back legs dragged on the floor and left a watery trail… just like a snail,' wrote Sue Naiden of the Trio Animal Foundation. Ellen remained brave throughout her whole transformation and didn't once threaten the staff with barks or bites. 'Even though we had to pull out fur that had grown 2 inches down Ellen’s ear canal and shave matted fur away from her irritated paper-thin skin, never once did Ellen growl or show her teeth,' wrote Naiden. The grooming took an hour and a half and groomers shaved away two pounds of fur. 'The amount of grooming tools that [the groomer] had to use to break through the hard shell of fur was unbelievable, ‘Naiden wrote. 'The first time that she could feel the touch of my hand on her newly shaven back… She looked me in the eyes and it was as if she was saying thank you… Her past abuse was literally being shaved away,' she added. Heavy load: Ellen was walking around with two pounds of fur she is now relieved to have shaved off and tossed aside . Starting to emerge: After having fur shaven from her face, Ellen is able to breathe easily once again . Fur-get about it!: Little did Ellen know she would be able to feel free again after animal care workers took care of her fur problem . Road to recovery: After being groomed, bathed, and given vaccinations, Ellen will be able to live her life in a happy home . After being given more baths and getting up to date on her vaccinations, Ellen was taken to Naiden's home for further care until finding a permanent residence. Thanks to Ellen's story being such a hit on social media, hundreds applied to take the rescued puppy into their home. The foundation narrowed it down to three homes and it wasn't long before they found a perfect match. NBC reports that their project's rescue division, Project Rescue Chicago, found Ellen a home with another young dog named Linus who she quickly befriended. 'Ellen’s eyes lit up, and she ran right to him,' Naiden wrote. 'It was love at first site and she made it very apparent that this was the family that she wanted to call her own… it was then that our mighty girl picked her forever home.' Naiden said that Ellen is a special dog and that she will miss her very much. 'We will so miss seeing this resilient girl running around and jumping on the laps of those that aided in her recovery and fell in love with her. By far… saving Ellen is one of our proudest accomplishments,' she wrote. How's that feel?: Ellen gets a good scrubbing after she is shaved of all her excess fur . Barely recognizable: Ellen looks nothing like the matted dog she once was hours before . Proud moment: Ellen's rescuers say that saving her was one of their proudest career moments . Looking forward to a home: Ellen got hundreds of applications for adoption and now she will be living in a loving home with another dog named Linus .

Friendly: Ellen loves playing with other dogs and will be living with a sweet canine named Linus .

"By . Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail . Business Secretary Vince Cable boasted on Twitter that he was voting to 'fix the Tories' unfair bedroom tax' The Liberal Democrats were accused of ‘outrageous hypocrisy’ tonight after voting against one of the Government’s flagship welfare policies. Lib Dem ministers and MPs voted in the House of Commons for drastic changes to the ‘spare room subsidy’ for council house tenants - a policy better known as the 'bedroom tax' which they voted for just two years ago. Tory ministers said the reversal would cost £1billion in additional welfare spending. Business Secretary Vince Cable even described the policy by the ‘bedroom tax’ name given to it by its most vociferous critics. He wrote on Twitter: ‘I'm cancelling my meetings today to go to vote for the Lib Dem bill to fix the Tories' unfair bedroom tax.’ Tory sources described their coalition partners’ actions as a ‘cynical PR move’ designed to appeal to supporters ahead of Lib Dem party conference next month. The move is also seen as a Lib Dem tactic to charm Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 election. Tory MP for Bury North David Nuttall said: ‘The Lib Dems are guilty of serial and outrageous hypocrisy. ‘This is not the first time they have changed their position on an issue to try and win back some of their former supporters. ‘They are clearly not a party who can be relied upon to stick to the same policy.’ Tory MP Philip Davies said the Lib Dems had shown they were ‘devious and untrustworthy’ and claimed the vote showed the coalition had officially come to an end. Lib Dem ministers were allowed – in effect – to vote against the government after the normal rules on collective responsibility were suspended. With Labour MPs backing the Affordable Homes Bill it passed by 306 votes to 231. The Bill, which is proposed by backbench Lib Dem MP Andrew George, would create sweeping new exemptions for people whose housing benefit could be reduced. The controversial reform, was first introduced in April 2013 – and backed by the Lib Dems – meant social housing tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced. It would lead to no-one facing a benefit cut if there was no smaller property available for them to move to. The Bill will in all likelihood be killed off by the Government at a later date. But its continued life in the House of Commons could delay Tory efforts to vote for a Tory measure to put in law the proposed 2017 EU referendum. Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claims he has simply removed a 'spare room subsidy' for people living in state-funded houses that were too big for them. But Labour say it is simply a 'bedroom tax' Conservative Minister for Disabled People Mark Harper warned that the Bill would cost £1 billion if it was made law. He demanded to know ‘what spending cuts or tax increases’ were proposed to pay for the change. Supporters of the policy say it encourages people to move to appropriate sized properties, and housing associations to build suitably sized homes. Labour has insisted it will scrap what it calls the ‘bedroom tax’. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: ‘The Government should scrap the hated bedroom tax following the overwhelming vote by MPs against the cruel tax on bedrooms today. ‘David Cameron and Nick Clegg's cruel and unfair bedroom tax has hit hundreds of thousands of people across the country causing misery, hardship and forcing families to rely on food banks. If the Government won't ditch the bedroom tax, then the next Labour government will.’ Ed Miliband described the vote as ‘incredible news’ and a ‘huge blow to David Cameron’. The Lib Dems insisted their change of heart on the policy was a result of seeing it in action. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘This Bill is an excellent articulation of our policy which will help build a stronger economy in a fairer society.’ ‘The Liberal Democrats believe that only those already in the social rented sector who turn down suitable smaller homes will see a reduction in their benefit.","Lib Dem  MPs voted in the Commons for changes to the 'spare room subsidy'

"By . Tara Brady . A British second-hand exchange is replacing the pound with virtual currency Bitcoin for three days in one of its stores, making it the first retail outlet in the UK to let customers receive the virtual coins for products. CeX, the high street chain that buys, sells and exchanges technological and electronic products, is switching from the pound to digital currency Bitcoin exclusively in its store in the Sauchiehall area of Glasgow. While using Bitcoin to buy products is becoming increasingly common in stores and online in the UK, CeX will be the first outlet to pay out in the currency, meaning customers can earn the currency for the first time, by selling goods. A British second-hand exchange is replacing the pound with virtual currency Bitcoin for three days in one of its stores . David Butler, commercial director at CeX said: 'It's really exciting to be at the centre of such an innovative trial. 'In our store, the staff and customers live and breathe technology so it's only appropriate we looked at Bitcoin as a way for our customers to buy and sell electronic goods. Not only does Bitcoin have a number of security and access benefits, but it is also gaining popularity amongst consumers the world over. 'While we are temporarily dropping the pound from our Glasgow store, at a time when Scottish Independence is high up on the news agenda, we are doing so to give customers a choice in how they trade with us.' Bitcoin is an entirely virtual currency that works without the need for a central bank, and can be sent over the internet. Coins are transferred directly from person to person and are kept in a digital wallet that can be accessed on a computer or mobile device. Bitcoin is an entirely virtual currency that works without the need for a central bank, and can be sent over the internet . Creating new coins is done through a process called 'mining' where users are rewarded with new coins for verifying transactions that take place. The process is open source and can therefore be used by anyone, with more and more mainstream businesses now accepting the currency as a form of payment. According to a report by The Why Forum, the number of Bitcoin transactions globally have increased tenfold in the last year, and are now worth more than £40 million. Several pubs as well as some taxi companies around the UK have begun to accept the currency as a means of paying for goods. Part of the scheme is designed to highlight the pressing issue of Scottish independence, with the country going to the polls in September to vote on leaving the UK. CeX says this trial will offer an opportunity to show that the country could manage without the pound. Technology expert and writer Benjamin Cohen said: 'Interest and curiosity around peer-to-peer electronic payments and digital currencies is at an all time high because there are compelling benefits for both the merchant and consumer. 'CeX's introduction is a reflection that the demand is there and also poses the question, do we need cash? CeX is giving its consumers a genuine way to test that theory. I'm eager to see the results of the trial.' What is a bitcoin? Bitcoins are basically just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. They are the basic unit of a new online economy which runs independently of any company, bank, or government. Because bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting involved, they have become popular with libertarians as well as technophiles, speculators — and criminals. Who's behind the currency? It's a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to attract widespread attention, but proponents say that doesn't matter; the currency obeys its own, internal logic.What's a bitcoin worth?Like any other currency, bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your counterpart want them to be. In its early days, boosters swapped bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game. One website even gave them away for free. As the market matured, the value of each bitcoin grew. At its height three months ago, a single bitcoin was valued at $1,200. On Tuesday, it was around $500.Is the currency widely used?That's debatable. Businesses ranging from blogging platform Wordpress to retailer Overstock have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage, but it's not clear whether the currency has really taken off. On the one hand, leading bitcoin payment processor BitPay works with more than 20,000 businesses — roughly five times more than it did last year. On the other, the total number of bitcoin transactions has stayed roughly constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over the same period, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info.Is Bitcoin particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting?The Bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals' greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn't be an issue.","CeX sells and exchanges technological and electronic products .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . A hotelier has been jailed after he was caught flicking the V-sign at a speed camera and then pretending it was his dead father who was driving. Vasille Georgiou, 48, was driving his Audi A4 sports car at 59mph in 40mph limit in Plymouth, Devon, when he made the gesture at a speed detection officer, a court heard. He attempted to escape prosecution by blaming it on his father Stavros Georgiou – even though he had been dead for four years. Vasille Georgiou, 48, was driving  at 59mph in 40mph limit when he made the gesture at a speed camera . But the law caught up with him after a two year police investigation when officers began to ‘smell a rat’. The former hairdresser turned publican was more camera shy when he arrived at Plymouth Crown Court today as he wore a motor bike crash helmet to cover his face. The jury was told that Georgiou had managed to get away with two previous offences by saying his Cypriot father had been behind the wheel. On one occasion he had been travelling at 104mph on the A38 in Devon in August 2005. Recorder Stephen Parish said after each offence someone returned a form from Cyprus confirming that Stavros Georgiou had been driving the vehicle. Arriving at court today Georgiou was more camera shy wearing a bike helmet concealing his face . He said: ‘On three occasions over a period of seven years you attempted to pervert and in fact did pervert the course of public justice by giving the name of your father in Cyprus, Stavros Georgiou, as being the driver of your car which had been caught on speed cameras - on one occasion doing 104mph.’ During a two-year inquiry, officer in charge of the case, PC David Williams, contacted the Cypriot authorities where the truth was revealed. Prosecutor Alistair Verheijen said the first speeding offence was in August 2005 on the A38 in Devon where he was caught doing 104mph in a Renault Clio Sport near the Devonport Interchange. Police wrote to Georgiou as the registered keeper but he told officers it was his father that was driving – at which point he was still alive. The Crown said because the ‘driver’ was a foreign national living in Cyprus the file was closed. In June 2011 he was caught doing 46mph in a 30mph zone in Plymouth, again blaming his father – who by this point had been dead for three years. He committed his third offence in January 2012 on the A374 in the city, when he was caught putting two fingers up to the camera. Georgiou admitted two charges of attempting to pervert the course of public justice and he asked for a third count to be taken into consideration. Defence barrister Nick Lewin said: ‘These offences are borne of arrogance and stupidity, someone trying to get the better of the system.’ He was jailed for four months and banned from driving for eight months by the court. The Peninsula Road Safety Partnership said: ‘What Vasille Georgiou did was engage in a deliberate act which was long and protracted over a period of seven years avoiding prosecutions for safety camera offences.’","Vasille Georgiou, 48, was caught driving Audi A4 at 59mph in 40mph zone .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Tens of thousands of middle class parents are being sent letters ordering them to repay hundreds of pounds of child benefit - even though many have already returned the cash. The letters, which say ‘You need to act now!’, have been sent to 30,000 families where one earner receives more than £50,000 a year. Since January last year, families with someone earning between £50,000 and £60,000 a year lost a proportion of the child benefit. Where one parent earned more £60,000 a year, the child benefit was lost altogether. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne cut child benefit for any family where one parent earned more than £50,000 . The letters cover a three month period last year after the benefit was cut. A family with one child would owe £263 and £438 if they had two children. Parents  had to opt out of receiving the benefit - or fill in a self-assessment form if they were still entitled to some of the cash. Around a million parents were hit by the benefit cut. But the Government has sent letters to around 30,000 who it believes have yet to pay back the cash. A HMRC spokesman said: ‘Those who have paid the tax charge due need not be concerned and can simply disregard the letter. Tory MP Christopher Chope said the benefit cut for middle class families was a 'nightmare' ‘The letter reminds taxpayers to include the charge on future tax returns and we would encourage couples to discuss between themselves which partner might be eligible for the charge. ‘If that is not possible, we can provide guidance to allay any concerns about who is to pay the charge.’ But Tory MPs, speaking to the Telegraph newspaper, said the letters were ‘disproportionate’. Christopher Chope, a senior Conservative MP, said: ‘The nightmare of this new tax on families who want to do the right thing is far from over. 'We knew it was going to be an administrative nightmare – and so it has proved.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Our tax and benefit system has become so complex that even HMRC can't make head nor tail of it. ‘The taxman got 5.5 million bills wrong last year. Until both our tax and benefit systems are radically simplified, mistakes will continue to be made and ordinary people will feel the pain.’ The tax office HMRC has previously faced criticism for its use of blanket mail outs. In May, letters were sent to savers asking them to explain why their rate of tax was ‘lower than the average for people with a similar amount of income to you’. HMRC admitted sending 1,000 letters to customers with an income of more than £150,000. Proposals to hand the taxman the power to raid the bank accounts has also faced intense criticism, with critics pointing to HMRC’s track record of errors over the past decade.","HMRC letters saying 'You need to act now! have been sent to 30,000 families .

I spent my days picking at food and could easily eat three or four times a day at work. I was a lot less active than I had been when I was younger, too – and it showed. Although happily engaged to Hannah (right), Matt's weight meant his self confidence was at an all time low . Hannah and Matt, pictured together recently, embarked on their weight loss journey together, with Hannah losing over 3st before the wedding . Matt and Hannah were originally motivated to lose weight when they started planning their wedding . 'On the one hand, I was really happy and secure with Hannah. On the other, my confidence had taken a real nosedive and I was very self-conscious about my size. I had to buy XXL clothes online and I hated seeing photographs of myself – there's a picture of me at a wedding and I swear I've got three chins.' Around 18 months ago, Matt and Hannah began planning our their wedding and decided it was time for them both to lose weight. But when Matt was persuaded to join a weight loss group with his fiancée, he was shocked to discover his constant snacking had caused his weight to rise into the clinically obese category- putting him at increased risk for a range of illnesses and conditions. 'Hannah suggested we join Slimming World and to say I wasn't looking forward to it is an understatement. I thought it was somewhere only women went– no place for a young bloke like me! Matt reached his target of 11st 5lb two days before his wedding, and the couple looked stunning on the day . 'Once I was eventually coaxed inside, I soon realised I'd been completely wrong. I wasn't the only man there and everyone was incredibly friendly. 'Discovering I was 17st 12lb – and clinically obese – was a proper wake-up call, so I was delighted when I lost 6lb in the first week. Especially as neither of us could believe we were still able to eat so much.' The couple began to totally change their lives, overhauling their diet and incorporating exercise into their routines. More of Matt's story appears in the new men section in the October issue of Slimming World . 'We soon got into the habit of planning our meals at the start of each week – one of my favourites is homemade burgers and chips made with low-calorie cooking spray and served with piles of fresh vegetables. We still have a night out or a takeaway once a week too. 'After I'd lost 3st, I decided to join a local gym. My first visit was like the first Slimming World experience all over again: I expected everyone there to be toned and intimidating. Instead it was really welcoming. I started running, too – walking and jogging at first, then building up gradually until recently I completed a 10km race.' Matt found the weight dropping off quickly, despite continuing his job as a chef, and managed to lose an incredible 6st in the 18 months before his wedding. The biggest boost came when I went to see my GP a couple of months ago. When I walked in, he glanced from me to his computer screen and said, 'Sorry – I think I've got the wrong person. It says here you're nearly 18st'. He was really impressed by my weight loss and agreed that I could stop using my asthma inhalers. A lot of people have commented on how hard it must have been to lose weight working as a chef. The difference is that I have the know-how to make healthier choices now. And when I check the food I'm cooking, I just taste a small spoonful rather than eating loads. I reached my target of 11st 5lb two days before our wedding – a loss of 6st 7lb. Hannah's lost 3st 7lb, too. Even though we've always been very happy with each other, we weren't happy with ourselves. 'Now we both have so much more energy and confidence. We're excited about starting our married life together.' Matt's full story appears in the October 2014 issue of Slimming World magazine, which features the title's first ever men's section 'M' and is on sale now in Slimming World groups and on newsstands.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A mother who claims her software millionaire ex-husband cheated her out of a fair share of his fortune will fight a landmark divorce battle in the Supreme Court. Alison Sharland, 46, accepted £10.35million from AppSense founder Charles Sharland two years ago after their marriage of 17 years broke down. She agreed to the payout thinking it was worth half his fortune - yet his stake in the firm was estimated wildly higher at £150million soon afterwards, London's Court of Appeal heard. Battle: Alison Sharland, 46 (left) accepted £10.35m from her ex-husband Charles (right) in the belief it was half his fortune. But his firm AppSense was later valued wildly higher, and his stake was said to be worth £150m . Ms Sharland tried to secure more money from her ex-husband but her bid was rejected, despite a top judge agreeing he had 'lied' and 'misled' the first hearing. Today Ms Sharland was given the go-ahead to challenge that rejection in Britain's highest court. The Supreme Court, which was founded in 2009 and sits opposite the Houses of Parliament, will consider the case next June because it raises wider issues about the British legal system. Her barrister Patrick Chamberlayne QC told the Court of Appeal: 'She was cheated into an agreement. If someone dupes you into a deal, why should you be held to a deal? 'This was a case of equality. It was a long marriage. All the assets had been acquired during the course of the marriage and each party had made their full contribution. 'Part of the wife’s case was that she was busy making post-separation efforts as well. She had the unusual task of lifelong care of the parties’ disabled child.' Popular: AppSense provides remote access software to  4,000 companies and was said to be worth £460m . The couple married in 1993 and separated in 2010, divorcing two years later. They lived in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and had three children as they built a substantial fortune. Mr Sharland ran his company from a business park in Daresbury, near Warrington, while Mrs Sharland ran an autism charity, the court heard. In July 2012 they agreed a settlement which handed Ms Sharland £10.35million in cash and properties. She would also gain 30 per cent of proceeds from her ex-husband's shares in his company when it was floated on the stock market. Mr Sharland would take less in cash and properties at £5.64million, but retain 70 per cent of his shares in the digital firm when it was floated. The row then ignited over how much Mr Sharland's company was worth. Used by high-end firms including the bank JPMorgan Chase and the airline Lufthansa, AppSense was founded in 1999 and has offices in cities including London, Paris, Amsterdam and Oslo. In the original court action, the firm was valued at between £31.5million and £47.25million while Mr Sharland's shares were said to be worth £7million. But it later emerged the company was said to be worth £460million - putting Mr Sharland's stake at £150million, the court heard. Landmark: Ms Sharland's case will be heard at the Supreme Court, opposite the Houses of Parliament . High Court judge Sir Hugh Bennett refused to 'set aside' the agreement and restart the process, even though he found Mr. Sharland had been 'dishonest' about his wealth. He took the decision because he said it would not have made any substantial difference to the settlement. Charles Sharland founded AppSense in 1999 and it has now grown into one of the biggest firms of its kind in the world. It provides secure remote access software for large companies, so their employees can get onto complex internal systems reliably from their laptops in airports or hotels. The technology is used by more than 4,000 firms including the bank JPMorgan Chase, sports channel ESPN and the airlines United Airlines and Lufthansa. An article in the Wall Street Journal in August 2012 - a month after the Sharlands' divorce settlement - suggested it could be worth as much as $1billion (£613million). But the firm's finances are also secretive and difficult to define for sure. A spokesman told the newspaper at the time: 'The company doesn’t comment on rumour or speculation.' She escalated her fight to the Court of Appeal but it agreed, throwing out Ms Sharland’s case by a two to one majority. She was ordered to pay the appeal's £50,000 legal costs, including those of her ex-husband. That was despite the Court of Appeal saying Mr Sharland's behaviour was 'deplorable' and his deceit had been 'deliberate and dishonest'. Lord Justice Moore-Bick added Mr Sharland 'had lied to the court and misled both the wife and the judge.' Mr Sharland did not deny that he had misled the court, but insisted the settlement reached was a fair one. The Supreme Court case will rest on whether the millionaire's dishonesty made the whole of the original divorce settlement 'unjust'. Ms Sharland's lawyer Ros Bever, of solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are very pleased that the Supreme Court has agreed that this is a case which requires consideration at the highest level. 'Dishonesty in any legal proceedings should not be tolerated; the family court should not be an exception. 'There are numerous legal arguments to be had before the Supreme Court but we hope that ultimately justice will be done and will be seen to be done.' Mr Sharland's solicitors, James Brown and Beth Wilkins at JMW LLP, said: 'With the Supreme Court due to consider the details of Mr and Mrs Sharland's divorce, we feel that it would be inappropriate to prejudice those deliberations by taking relevant arguments to the media before they are presented to the Court. 'The fact remains that the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's judgement that the agreement struck between Mr and Mrs Sharland was fair and had not caused her any loss.'","Alison Sharland, 46, was married to AppSense founder Charles for 17 years .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Kerry Capper, pictured leaving Birmingham Magistrates' Court today, was cleared after keeping her seven-year-old daughter Libby off school for seven days earlier this year . The mother of a seven-year-old girl recovering from cancer has been cleared after keeping her off school for seven days. Kerry Capper, 25, said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill – fearing the disease had returned. In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups. Between January and March this year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham. Ms Capper, from Birmingham, had been summoned to appear before magistrates today for failing to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’, which was later increased to £120. The unemployed mother told Birmingham Magistrates' Court today that she 'couldn’t afford to pay', which landed her with the summons to court, and a trial. Birmingham council said no reason was given for the time off and that Miss Capper had failed to attend meetings arranged by the school to discuss the situation. Tom Harrill, prosecuting for the council, . said Ms Capper provided no evidence of her daughter’s sickness or of . some 'unavoidable cause' which prevented her daughter attending school. The mother claims she had run out of credit on her mobile phone so was unable to inform the school that Libby – who had an 85 per cent attendance record prior to the fine – would be absent. But the authority said it took a ‘robust stance’ on unexplained school absences. Ms Capper told magistrates that her daughter had a kidney taken out in 2009 to remove a cancerous tumour 'the size of a grapefruit'. The procedure left her daughter’s immune system weakened, and she informed teachers of that when Libby started at the school in July 2011. In the run-up to the diagnosis with cancer, Ms Capper said her daughter had complained of 'stomach ache'. She said that it was a similar complaint, . together with a three-day bout of hand, foot and mouth, which accounted . for her daughter’s absences earlier this year. Kerry Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' when she was feeling ill - fearing that her cancer had returned. In 2010, Libby was diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kindeys . Ms Capper, pictured left outside court today, said that it was a stomach complaint, together with a three-day bout of hand, foot and mouth, that accounted for her daughter Libby's, pictured right, absences earlier this year . She accepted missing two meetings arranged by the school to discuss the days off. One one occasion she turned up on the wrong day and on the other she forgot to attend. Asked why she had not made an appointment with the doctors when her daughter was ill, Ms Capper said: 'Unless you phoned the doctor really early, you couldn’t get an appointment the same day.' The prosecution argued that she had no doctor’s note or medical evidence to back up the reasons her daughter had been kept off school. But Neil Davis, defending, said his client had a letter from a paediatric consultant at Birmingham Children’s Hospital which stated that Ms Capper got 'extremely anxious' whenever Libby complained of any abdominal pain. Birmingham council said no reason was given for the time off and that Miss Capper had failed to attend meetings at Paget Primary School in Birmingham (pictured) to discuss the situation . In her school report, which was read to the court, the little girl was described by teachers as an 'excellent role model” who was a 'pleasure to teach' and was achieving above her age. But a box had been checked stating her attendance needed attention. The Government’s change to the law on school absences, in September last year, was designed to stop families taking pupils on term-time holidays. But some parents have been penalised for children missing class to attend important events or medical appointments. In May, Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, were warned they could face a £1,000 fine if they took their ten-year-old daughter out of school for her grandfather’s funeral. Hanbury’s Farm Primary School, Tamworth, told the couple the reason did not amount to ‘exceptional circumstances’. Ms Capper was summoned to Birmingham Magistrates' Court, pictured, after she said  she 'couldn't afford to pay' a £60 fine - which was later increased to £120 - that was imposed by Birmingham Council .","Kerry Capper said that she wanted to keep a close eye on daughter Libby .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Tom Gardner . Fame game: Former Detective Constable Dan Neal, 33, pictured, has caused controversy after quitting the Yewtree Operation to pursue celebrity in reality show Big Brother . A senior police detective has quit the Jimmy Savile sex abuse inquiry and is now pursuing fame on reality show Big Brother. Bosses at Scotland Yard are said to be . at furious former detective constable Dan Neal's decision to seek celebrity status on the back of . Britain's biggest sexual abuse investigation. They have raised concerns his appearance on the show could compromise Operation Yewtree, the . investigation launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Until recently, the gay father-of-one, 33, had been hunting celebrities who may also have carried out sex . attacks, either with the help of paedophile Savile or working alone. But he is expected to be one of the show's most controversial contestants when he enters the house tonight. 'I think there will be some concern within the force', he told the Daily Express. Mr Neal, from Ongar, Essex, said that he did not want to jeopardise a case he had worked on during the past eight months, adding: 'I can't talk about the content of the investigation but there may be a few concerned faces within my old department.' A Met Police spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports concerning the proposed media appearance of a former detective constable. 'We've been in contact with Channel 5 and made them fully aware of potential risks and their responsibility to live investigations. 'All officers joining and leaving the Met are required to sign the Official Secrets Act.' It is unclear if the former detective, who quit his job last month, applied to be a contestant on the . reality TV show while working for the Metropolitan Police. Arrested stars include Jim Davidson, Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis, . Freddie Starr, and Gary Glitter. They all deny the allegations. Big Brother 2013 launches tonight on Channel 5 with a 'secrets and lies' theme, which includes a prison inside the house. Concerns: A Scotland Yard child abuse detective who worked on Operation Yewtree will enter the Big Brother House, probably on Friday . Revealed: The officer will be inside the new Big Brother house (pictured), which has been unveiled as producers gear up for this summer's new series . His decision to become a reality star will shock Scotland Yard and producers . have said the child abuse expert has told them how life working on Yewtree and . its 400 lines of inquiry was 'upsetting' and 'draining'. Paedophile: Operation Yewtree was launched after Jimmy Savile's decades of sexual abuse were uncovered, which the officer reportedly told BB producers was 'upsetting' and 'draining' A show insider said the officer knows the confidential nature of his work . but understands 'it is only natural' that other contestants will try to get 'as much . gossip as possible' about the investigation. Mr Neal also spoke about the hours he . spent sifting through evidence linked to Savile's decades of sexual abuse. He also said he worked in a specialist team of 30 officers and was pleased . they had been able to make a difference to victims. 'The housemate knows they are going to hit the headlines over this. Leaving . the police force to go into the Big Brother house is a massive move,' a show . insider told the Daily Star. 'Their former bosses are going to be shocked about their decision to join . the show and naturally will be worried about what might be said inside the . house. 'This person has seen a lot of bad things while working on Operation . Yewtree. They will know what can and can’t be said inside the house but it’s . only natural for their housemates to want to try to get as much gossip as . possible.' Channel 5 sought to allay fears something broadcast on Big Brother could compromise the on-going investigation. A . spokesman said: 'Extensive procedures are in place to ensure nothing . will be broadcast with which would involve the former police officer . breaching confidentiality, committing libel or a contempt of court.' New pictures released this week revealed the house the new set of contestants will live in for the . duration of this year's show. Ready for action: The theme this year is Secret & Lies and the house is decked out with numerous secret rooms - including a prison . Not long now: This year will see Emma Willis take over the main hosting duties to replace Brian Dowling, but will the police officer keep quiet about his work at the Met . Not only have producers added an . outdoor shower, no doubt in the hope to get some steamy viewing action, . but they've also included a snug treehouse in the garden. Its addition is no doubt put in place in a bid to encourage housemates to get some privacy away from the main building. Other . features include an outside shower, a 'prison' for any bad behaving . contestants and an electricity generating bike in the bedroom. Suspects: PR guru Max Clifford, left, and comedian Jim Davidson, right, are among those arrested in the Operation .

"By . Madlen Davies For Mail Online . A bride-to-be left paralysed by a rare spinal condition made a staggering recovery to walk down the aisle to marry her husband. Leigh Cooke Bennett woke up one morning to find that she was paralysed from the waist down. But determined not to be wheelchair-bound at her  wedding, the 43-year-old endured hours of physiotherapy to regain her strength. And to her delight, the bride-to-be was able to take her first steps down the aisle on her big day, to marry her husband Phil. Leigh Cooke Bennett, 34, from York, was left paralysed from the waist down by a  rare spinal condition, but with determination and gruelling physiotherapy sessions she was able to walk to meet her groom Phil, (pictured left) and was even able enjoy a first dance with her him on the big day (pictured right) After experiencing numbness and pins and needles in her foot, one day Mrs Cooke Bennett woke up unable to move her lower body. She went to see a neurologist who diagnosed rare spinal condition transverse myelitis (TM) within seconds of hearing about her symptoms . Mrs Cooke Bennett, from York, said: 'I knew that no matter what, I wanted to be able to walk down the aisle. 'I didn't want to use a crutch or a wheelchair - I wanted to be able to walk to meet my groom - like every woman dreams of. 'The wedding was a great motivation for me and helped me focus on my recovery. 'As I walked I just felt so proud, it was always going to be the best day of my life, but that made it even better. It was incredible.' Mrs Cooke Bennett was struck down with transverse myelitis (TM) in August last year. The condition occurs when the immune system attacks the spinal cord, and in the worst cases can leave sufferers completely paralysed. Mrs Cooke Bennett first realised something was wrong when she started to experience numbness andpins and needles in her feet. Transverse myelitis is a rare disease of the central nervous system involving inflammation in the spinal cord. The inflammation causes swelling which can bock nerve impulses travelling along the spinal cord. Most people with transverse myelitis experience weakness and a change in sensation or unusual feelings in the lower half of the body and have problems with their bowel and bladder. Commonly, the onset of transverse myelitis is sudden and it can progress to its most severe state very quickly, often in just 24 to 48 hours. However, for some people affected by transverse myelitis, their symptoms develop slowly over several weeks. Source: Brain and Spine Foundation . She said: 'It gradually crept up on me over a three week period. 'I started noticing things like my foot would go dead or I'd get pins and needles. 'Then I woke up one morning and I was totally numb from the waist down - I was basically paralysed.' She was referred to see a neurologist who diagnosed the condition within seconds of hearing the symptoms. She said: 'I asked her if I would ever recover - she said that one in three people make no recovery at all. 'It was just a case of wait and see what happens, it was very scary.' Mrs Cooke Bennett immediately started rehabilitation in an attempt to regain movement and feeling in her legs. Two months after her diagnosis in October, her husband proposed. 'I'd dropped hints at Phil for ages that I'd love to get married, but with everything else that was going on with my recovery it wasn't on my mind.' she said. 'He caught me totally off guard. 'Then at the end of the year it was time to make a New Year's resolution and I decided I wanted to make one that was important. On the 22nd of August, Leigh and Phil Cooke Bennett married in a humanist ceremony. She was able to walk down the aisle unaided . Leigh and Phil Cooke made the decision to get married two months after she was diagnosed with transverse myelitis, giving the future Mrs Cooke something to focus her recovery on . 'Suddenly it came to me - I was going to walk down the aisle at my wedding. 'As soon as I told my friends and family they were completely on board and we all decided we'd do whatever it took. 'I immediately stepped up and I worked hard at my rehab. 'I told my physio my plan, and as a bride to be herself, she was determined to get me to my goal. 'I was so focused - there was no way I was going to give up.' Over the course of the next eight months, Mrs Cooke Bennett worked during physiotherapy sessions and slowly began to see results. Walking down the aisle was a 'dream come true' for Mrs Cooke Bennett . She said: 'My physio and I worked tirelessly. 'We spent each session talking about weddings, and we set interim goals to make it easier. 'Things like stand up on my own, walk a certain distance, or only use one crutch - it made it more manageable. 'It was hard but by about June, it dawned on me that I was really going to be able to do it.' On the August 22, Leigh and Phil Cooke Bennett  married in a humanist ceremony - and she was able to walk down the aisle unaided. Achieving her goal was a dream come true, especially as she was able to dance with her new husband on their wedding day, she said, . 'The whole day was absolutely brilliant. 'As soon as I came into the marquee, to walk up to Phil, I just burst into tears. 'I was nervous, but I knew I could do it.' The lady who led the ceremony explained to the room that it had been a difficult year Mrs Cooke Bennett, and that she'd achieved her dream. She said: 'The whole room erupted into a round of applause. It was really emotional. 'For the rest of the day I was determined to stay on my feet, and I was even able to dance with Phil and all of our guests. 'For a few days afterwards it really took it out of me but it was all well worth it. 'I still have a little way to go in my recovery as I get tired, but I'm almost there. 'I'm over the moon to have been able to walk down the aisle, it was the best day ever.'","Leigh Cooke Bennett, 34, from York began to feel  pins and needles .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Romanian President Traian Basescu said emigration was good for his country . Romanian immigration is a good thing because it reduces unemployment – in Romania, the country’s president has said. Traian Basescu said the number of jobless Romanians leaving for Britain was ‘helping us very much’. Mr Basescu attempted to ease concerns over the number of immigrants arriving in the UK. He said many would return to Romania when wages in Eastern Europe started to match those in Britain. He said: ‘We would be happy to have them back – probably as soon as the wages from Romania be more close to wages in the UK, or in France or in Italy or in Spain.’ Wages in Romania average around £420 a month – less than a quarter of the £2,000 a month take home pay in the UK. The latest figures show 28,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nations arrived in Britain in the 12 months to the end of March – more than double the previous year’s influx of 12,000. Border restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians were lifted on January 1 this year – allowing migrants from the two countries to move to the UK for work. The number of people in Britain from the two former Communist states now stands at 177,000 – more than five times the level seven years ago. But Basescu said: ‘The reality that a part of Romanian peoples decide to find more work outside of Romania is something helping us very much – maintaining the unemployment at a reasonable rate.' He said the money sent back by Romanian workers had supported the economy, saying: ‘During the crisis period the remittances for Romania practically kept our foreign trade balance calibrated.’ Romanian migrant Victor Spirescu, 30, arrived at Luton Airport on New Year's Day - the first day after the lifting  of travel restrictions - to be greeted by MPs Mark Reckless (left) and Keith Vaz . Dozens of East European immigrants set up camp to sleep rough in a subway at Park . Lane,central London . The president said migrants from his country are not reliant on state benefits, and are determined to pay their own way in life. ‘I’d like it to be understood, as soon as the Romanian economic conditions allow we will be ready to invite them back. Romania needs these people,’ he told BBC Radio 4. ‘They are people who understand the state is not the one that has the obligation – like during the Communist regime – to take care for the life of each one.’","Traian Basescu said Romanians leaving for the UK was good for his country .

"By . Chris Spargo for MailOnline . The Seattle Seahawks may have defeated the Denver Broncos in this year's Super Bowl, but when it comes to football in America, it seems that it is the Dallas Cowboys that truly reign supreme. This according to the 2014 NFL American fandom map, just released by Facebook, which shows every American county’s favorite professional football team, as determined by the NFL team that Facebook users have ‘liked’ the most. And like all athletic events, this one has a big loser too, with the New York Jets failing to be the most popular team in any county in the country. Fans: A new map shows the most popular NFL team by county according to Facebook . Winners: The Dallas Cowboys are the most popular team in the country according to Facebook . Most of the map is no surprise at all though, with the New England Patriots locking up almost every county from Connecticut through Maine; the New Orleans Saints claiming the top spot throughout Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama; and the Broncos controlling a large portion of middle America. It is the Cowboys, however, who are by far the biggest team in the country, with large chunks of fans not only in Texas, but also Nevada, Virginia, Oregon, and Idaho. The San Francisco 49ers have a pretty strong reach too, as the most popular team in Hawaii, as well as northern California. No love: The New York Jets failed to claim a majority of fans in any county in the country . Second rate: More people in Pennsylvania are fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers rather than the Philadelphia Eagles . On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Philadelphia Eagles did not manage to get much love at all, with almost every county in their home state backing the Pittsburgh Steelers. But even the Eagles managed to lock up southeastern Pennsylvania and parts of New Jersey, whereas the Jets got trounced in New York by Giants fans. In fact, of the 32 professional teams in the NFL, they are the only one who did not manage to secure at least one county. Seems like that Giants-Jets rivalry may be a little bit more one-sided than some would like to admit.","Facebook has released a report on the most popular teams in America by county .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Travis, pictured, has denied two charges of indecent assault and a further allegation of sexual assault . Former BBC star Dave Lee Travis was an ‘opportunist’ who acted as if he had the ‘perfect right’ to grope young women, jurors in his retrial were told yesterday. Travis, 69, who faces three charges, inappropriately touched women who were ‘many years’ younger than him over a period of more than 20 years, Southwark Crown Court heard. The former Radio 1 DJ and Top of the Pops presenter faces a retrial on two counts – one of indecent assault of a woman between November 1, 1990, and January 31, 1991, and another of sexual assault on a different woman between June 1, 2008, and November 30, 2008 – on which a jury was unable to reach verdicts at a trial earlier this year. Charged under his real name of David Griffin, he has also pleaded not guilty to a count of indecent assault alleged to have taken place on January 17, 1995. Opening the prosecution case, Miranda Moore QC told the jury of six men and six women that a TV expose on Jimmy Savile in 2012 had prompted a number of women to come forward to Operation Yewtree – the investigation set up in the wake of the Savile scandal – about Travis. She said the allegations spanned 1985 to 2008 and were alleged to have taken place when Travis was working as a DJ or entertainer, such as starring in a pantomime, or as a guest celebrity, or in his own home while he was being interviewed. Miss Moore said the jury would hear from three women to whom the three charges relate, but also two other women who would describe similar alleged incidents. She said: ‘We say … he has a propensity towards laying his hands in a sexual manner on young women who are alone with him or in vulnerable positions. He is an opportunist.’ Southwark Crown Court heard that Travis offered to take his alleged victim's photograph at his home . Miss Moore said the women were embarrassed and shocked by the alleged assaults and, while they had not told police, all had confided in other people at the time. She said the first charge related to a woman who was working on a production of Aladdin in which Travis was starring. The woman claimed that the DJ assaulted her while they were in his dressing room, holding the door closed as he put his hand inside her trousers. She managed to prise open the door to the corridor – where comedy stars the Chuckle Brothers were standing – and escaped, later telling co-workers. The second charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman working on the Mrs Merton Show. The court heard today that the trial involves five separate incidents involving similar types of behaviour . In a third count, Travis is alleged to have groped a female journalist when she went to his home to interview him. She later told her flatmates and her mother but did not take it any further because she did not want to jeopardise her career, Miss Moore said. The prosecutor also outlined claims from two other women – to which charges are not related. One woman claimed she was assaulted by Travis as she served him drinks at a venue on the Isle of Man, when he pinned her against a wall and put one hand on her chest and one between her legs. A journalist, who is Travis' third alleged victim told the court that he groped her at his home, pictured, in 2008 . Another female journalist claims that Travis assaulted her while she was at his house to interview him. Travis, who was arrested in October 2012, denies all of the incidents. Miss Moore said: ‘He has suggested that possibly the women have come forward motivated by greed or compensation or possibly fame. ‘Essentially his defence is, this never happened, it is made up, fabricated, lies, whatever expression you want to use, that’s what he says.’ The trial continues. The jury was told that one of the alleged assaults was interrupted by the Chuckle Brothers, pictured . Southwark Crown Court heard that the alleged victim's mother advised her not to tell her employers .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Former N-Dubz singer Dappy faces jail after being found guilty of assaulting a man at a nightclub - having suffered the 'humiliation' of not being recognised. The 27-year-old, who was tried under his real name Costadinos Contostavlos, was found guilty of punching Devonn Reid on the dance floor of Evissa nightclub in Reading on October 6 last year. The singer committed the offence while serving a six-month suspended sentence for a previous affray and assault, which could now be activated. Scroll down for video . Former N-Dubz singer Dappy, pictured, had denied assaulting a football coach at a nightclub . District Judge Davinder Lachhar told Reading Magistrates' Court: 'Custody is a realistic prospect as far as this case is concerned in light of his record.' The court heard the fight broke out because Contostavlos began chatting to Mr Reid's female friend and girlfriend at the club's bar, and that the singer punched him after Mr Reid told him not to talk to them. Describing the lead up to the incident, Mr Reid said he and his friends were on the dance floor when Contostavlos approached them and asked them if they had a problem before offering them a drink. Mr Reid said he later saw his friend Marie O'Reilly and his girlfriend Cydney Webb chatting with Contostavlos at the bar, that the singer had his arm around Ms O'Reilly and Mr Reid thought he was flirting with them. Mr Reid told the court: 'He said something and I said, ""what"", and I turned to look at him and that is when he hit me straight on the nose.' Mr Reid added: 'He had just turned and hit me straight with his right hand. The 27-year-old, who appeared in court under his real name, Costadinos Contostavlos, punched Devonn Reid at the Evissa club in Reading . 'After that we just gone. Bouncers came and grabbed him, I have gone to the toilet to clean myself up. He had popped my nose.' Contostavlos had arrived at the court wearing dark sunglasses, a white shirt and black trousers, with a matching Yves Saint-Laurent belt and trainers. Before the trial he posed for 'selfie' photos with friends in the corridor outside the court. Giving evidence, the singer said he had gone to the club with a small group of friends at around midnight on October 5 and initially went to a private seated area. Describing the mood as 'very happy', he said: 'It was splendid to be there. It was a very good night, everyone was polite to me and I was being polite back, showing lots of love, taking pictures. It was a good vibe.' Contostavlos said he drank a beer and about four shots of sambuca, and was buying drinks for other people and was giving out 'hugs and kisses' on the dance floor. Reading Magistrates' Court, pictured, heard that the star punched Mr Reid during a fight on the dance floor . But he said he got a 'vibe' from a group of six or seven 'very aggressive' men after he and a friend, Tipper, chatted and flirted with some girls. He said one of the men approached Tipper to accuse him of thinking he could 'take our girls' because he was with the singer. Contostavlos, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, said Mr Reid, who was out celebrating his 21st birthday, pushed Tipper in the head and then did the same to him. He said: 'He pushed my head, Mr Reid, and that is when my security pulls me away. 'After I got pulled away there was a big kerfuffle, hands and noise, and I got pulled to the cloakroom.' Asked by his defence barrister, Jon Harrison, whether he had punched Mr Reid, he replied: 'Certainly not'. But prosecutor Zainab Mohamed suggested he had been 'humiliated' when Mr Reid and his friends did not want a drink with him and warned him off talking with the women in the group. She said: 'You were angry, you were humiliated, you had been drinking alcohol during the evening and you became annoyed at the aggrieved (Mr Reid) when he told you not to talk to them. The court heard that the fight broke out because Contostavlos, pictured, began chatting to Mr Reid's female friend and girlfriend at the club's bar, and that the singer punched him after Mr Reid told him not to talk to them . 'Because you were angry you in fact punched the aggrieved in the nose.' Summing up the case at Reading Magistrates' Court, the judge said: ""You were frustrated. Some people were not particularly interested or knew who you were."" Contostavlos denied hitting Mr Reid, saying it was 'two of us and seven boys, and that he was scared because he was outnumbered and they were bigger than him. But Mrs Lachhar said she found the witnesses, who included Mr Reid's girlfriend Ms Webb and friend Ms O'Reilly, to be 'truthful', and found him guilty of assault by beating. She said: 'There is a question of who assaulted him (Mr Reid) and in my mind I have no doubt that you did."" Contostavlos sat with his head in his hands as he realised he could be sent to prison following his conviction for the attack, which occurred while he was serving a six-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, for a previous incident of affray and assault. The judge adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report ahead of a sentencing hearing at the same court on October 6.

"By . Andrea Magrath for MailOnline . Four British tourists have been hospitalised after the bus they were travelling on crashed into a lawnmower working on a central reservation on a busy Slovakian dual carriageway. The crash, that left all four British people badly hurt and killed the driver of the bus, happened while the vehicle was travelling between the capital Bratislava and Svaty Jur, a small town to the north east of the Slovak capital. Many of the injured were taken to hospital in Bratislava. Police said that in total there were 35 people on the bus and confirmed that 33 had been hurt, and the 52-year-old driver had been killed instantly. Accident: Four British tourists have been taken to hospital after being injured in a bus crash in Slovakia . The President of the Slovak Republic Police Force confirmed that five of the people on the bus were foreign tourists. He said four were British citizens and the fifth was a Russian citizen. All of the other people on the bus were believed to be Slovakian. Petra Stano Matasovska, the Bratislava University Hospital spokesperson told Central European News: '28 injured passengers were transported to the University Hospital Bratislava. I can confirm four of them were British citizens.' It was unclear where the other five of the total of 33 reported injured had been treated. Fatality: The driver of the bus was killed instantly in the crash, which happened between Bratislava and Svaty Jur . Police who are investigating the cause of the accident confirmed that initial reports suggest the driver of the coach tried to overtake and hit a vehicle which was mowing grass on the dual carriageway. After crashing into the mowing vehicle he lost control before topping over. The accident happened at 10.30 AM local time (CET).

"By . Ruzwana Bashir . It was with tears in my eyes that I read about the horrific cases of abuse and neglect in the Rotherham report. Much of the coverage has focused on how men of mostly Asian descent preyed on vulnerable young white victims. The details of this abuse are awful. But what has largely been ignored is the report's finding that sexual abuse has been systemically under-reported among Asian girls due to entrenched cultural taboos - obscuring the reality that there is a similarly rampant problem of minority girls being abused by members of their own community. I have first-hand knowledge of this problem. I'm coming forward to publicly share my own story in the hope that I can encourage others to do the same and help tear down the wall of silence that perpetuates further abuse. Scroll down for video . Ruzwhana Bashir began being abused by her neighbour in Skipton when she was aged 10 . I grew up in a small community of a few hundred British-Pakistanis in Skipton, less than 60 miles from Rotherham. When I was ten, a neighbour started sexually abusing me. Paralysed by shame, I said nothing. At 18, I was fortunate enough to receive an offer to study at Oxford University. I was enthralled with the exciting new world around me and tried desperately to fit in. I replaced my traditional shalwar kameez with jeans. I bared my shoulders and cut my hair. I socialised more than I studied and became president of the Oxford Union. An internship at Goldman Sachs led to a job in private equity in London, and after a few years I got an MBA from Harvard Business School. But all the while, I knew the girls I had grown up with didn't have the same opportunities - and that my abuser was probably still preying on other children. It was only after a decade away from Skipton that I was finally able to garner the courage to return and testify against my abuser. When I first told my mother about the abuse, she was devastated. The root of her anger was clear: I was heaping shame on to my family by trying to bring the perpetrator to justice. In trying to stop him from exploiting more children, I was ensuring my parents and my siblings would be ostracised. She begged me not to go to the police. If I'd still been living in Skipton, surrounded by a community who would either blame me for the abuse or label me a liar, I'm not sure I could have rejected her demands. It was only after a decade away from Skipton that Ms Bashir was able to garner the courage to return . Once the police began the investigation, another victim came forward. Sohail described how he too had been abused almost 20 years before I was. Due to our combined testimony, the perpetrator was jailed for eight years. Within a few weeks another young woman in the community, emboldened by the conviction, told the police that a relative had raped her for several years. It had started before Sara was in her teens. We have supported her through the process of taking this to court. Although Sohail and I had removed a proven paedophile from the community and helped empower another woman to end her torture, we were not celebrated. On the contrary, we were shunned. The Rotherham report cites a home affairs select committee finding that cases of Asian men grooming Asian girls did not come to light in Rotherham because victims 'are often alienated and ostracised by their own families and by the whole community, if they go public with allegations of abuse'. This was our experience - and the experience of everyone I've since spoken to. It became clear that for three decades many other women had suffered at the hands of our abuser, but they had refused to testify because of the stigma. I learned that the parents of at least one victim had known their child had been abused but had done nothing. We discovered the larger community had long been aware of rumours of abuse by my neighbour but had ignored them - even when Sohail had attempted to come forward several years earlier. This refusal to condemn perpetrators persists even after their conviction. Soon after our case, another convicted sex offender was released back into our community and was accepted as if nothing had happened. It was clear that the same would happen with our abuser. Much has been made about the religion of the offenders in the Rotherham report. But this problem isn't about religion or race: it's about a culture where notions of shame result in the blaming of victims rather than perpetrators. Although painful to read, the Rotherham report presents an opportunity for leaders in the British-Pakistani community to speak out about the sexual and physical abuse in their midst. The Asian community isn't unique in having evildoers, and the overwhelming majority of its men and women are good people who care about protecting others. I always will be proud of my Pakistani heritage, but I firmly believe community leaders must take responsibility for the fact that the taboos that prevent others from identifying perpetrators and supporting victims enable further abuse. And those taboos must be challenged. The report also presents an opportunity to overhaul the public institutions that have failed to protect the defenceless - which includes everyone from the police to schools to social services. On multiple occasions, beginning when she was 12, Sara went to her GP and to walk-in clinics wearing her hijab to get the morning-after pill. She was never asked if she needed help. When she approached the police the CPS initially told her it would not pursue the case because there was too little evidence. It's a testament to her resolve that she pushed back, demanding a chance to seek justice. The system failed her, just as it has thousands of other children of all backgrounds. We now have the chance to change that, and there are four immediate steps we should take to address this problem. First, we need better training of social workers and police to identify victims. The Rotherham report cited that one reason for the under-reporting of abuse among minority communities was officials' focus on communicating with male leaders, who ignored the problem. Women and girls need including in these conversations, and officials must broaden the scope of their inquiries. Second, we need mandatory reporting by people of authority when they see signs of potential abuse. One of the most damning parts of the Rotherham report was that teachers were discouraged from reporting potential cases. For Sara, mandatory reporting by doctors could have saved years of abuse. Third, we need improved support for victims when they come forward. Sara's case has been drawn out for far longer than expected, during which time she has faced pressure to withdraw her testimony. She has struggled to get the help she needs to overcome her trauma. We need a judicial process that recognises the cost of delayed prosecutions for victims and better counselling services. The Jay Report, published last month, estimates that 1,400 children were abused in Rotherham, pictured, over a 16-year period . Fourth, we need a single person in each community accountable for ensuring these and other relevant policies are implemented. There are a lot of people with partial responsibility, but for this to be an effective, coordinated, comprehensive response, we need one individual who takes full responsibility for ensuring child sex exploitation is addressed and who can be held accountable for real change. Some of these policies are being implemented. But they are not being implemented everywhere, and they are not being implemented quickly enough. The biggest risk is that once the shock of this report dissipates, it will get swept under the rug, just like three previous reports in Rotherham. We cannot let that happen. We don't need any further reports: we need system-wide change in the way we approach fighting sexual abuse against children of all backgrounds. This is not a problem in Rotherham, Oxford or Rochdale. This is a problem in the United Kingdom. And we need to tackle it together. In the words of Edmund Burke, 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A tourist has paid a parking fine – half a century after he left his Vespa in a no stopping zone. American Robert Atherton rediscovered the penalty when he was going through papers from a holiday to Italy in 1964, when he was a high school student. Alongside the usual keepsakes, he came across the charge which had never been paid, totalling 1,000 lire or about 57p. In today’s money it would cost about £8. Robert Atherton found the 50-year-old penalty notice when he was going through papers from a holiday to Italy . He incurred it in the northern Italian town of Lerici in Liguria and it was to be paid within 15 days, the fine paperwork stipulated. The honest tourist from Phoenix, Arizona, has now sent the authorities 50 US dollars to cover the fine and the interest accumulated over the last 50 years. In a note with the money, he asked them to ‘please excuse his forgetfulness’. The original fine was issued by the father in law of the current mayor of Lerici, who at the time was a young traffic policeman. Mr Atherton had been riding a Vespa in the Italian town when he left it in a no stopping zone and received fine . The American has not been punished for paying it more than 18,000 days late. Mayor Marci Caluri said it was an ‘admirable’ gesture that others should follow. ‘I thank Mr Atherton for his honesty,’ he said. ‘It was an admirable gesture which I hope serves as an example to others. I won’t forget to write and thank him.’ He incurred it in the northern Italian town of Lerici in Liguria (pictured) and it was to be paid within 15 days .","American Robert Atherton rediscovered penalty from holiday to Italy in 1964 .

"By . Madlen Davies For Mail Online . A five-year-old boy who was born with his bowel attached to his heart has already faced eight life-saving operations -and he has more to come. John-Joseph Lively, of Wallsend in North Tyneside almost died in his father's arms after contracting meningitis. He has endured multiple procedures on his heart and bowel and became the one of the first children in the country to have a pioneering surgery to flush out his bowel. Now the inspiring five-year-old has been nominated for a bravery award, in recognition of his fight to survive. Scroll down for video . John, 50 and Angela Lively, 42 (now separated) have been told their son John-Joseph, 5, faces more surgery despite having already undergone eight operations since birth . John Joseph (pictured left) loves playing football, computer games and Lego. Father John (pictured right) says he is inspired by his son, who manages to smile even when coming out of surgery . Father John Lively, 40, said his son's courage is infectious. He said: 'My little boy is my inspiration. I don't know anyone whose been through so much and come out smiling.' After he was born, doctors became worried about John Joseph as tests revealed his bowel was attached to his heart. Mr Lively said they were given difficult news about their newborn son straight away. He said: 'They also said he had a hole in his heart and that the valves were collapsing. 'We were told pretty much straight away that he was going to need open heart surgery.' At just nine-months-old, John-Joseph underwent the operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. Straight after surgery he contract pneumonia and spent the next two weeks in intensive care. Operation after operation followed, not only to help repair his heart, but also his damaged bowel. John-Joseph also became one of the youngest children in the country to undergo an Antegrade Colonic Enema (ACE) procedure to help with his bowel condition. A small opening was made in his lower tummy, and a saline solution flushed in to wash out his colon and produce a bowel movement. But contracting meningitis meant he almost lost his life. Mr Lively said: 'He was so poorly, he contracted meningitis and almost died in my arms three different times.' Antegrade colonic enema, or antegrade continence enema (ACE) is a surgical procedure designed to make enemas easier and more convenient. The surgeon uses the appendix to create a channel between the bowel and the abdomen. An artificial opening called a stoma is then made in the surface of the abdomen. A catheter can be inserted into the stoma so that liquids can be passed into the bowel to wash out its contents through the anus. Source: NHS Choices . Today Mr Lively and his former wife Angela, 42, of South Shields, have been told their son faces the prospect of more heart surgery. But that is not stopping John-Joseph enjoying sports and activities. 'He's such a happy little chap,' added Mr Lively. 'He loves football, computer games and Lego. 'Don't get me wrong, we have our hard days but every time I see him laughing, it touches my heart and I think what an incredible inspiration he is.' John-Joseph has now been nominated for a Champion Child of Courage award by his local paper. Recently he also starred in a video for the Royal Victoria Infirmary to help other parents and children who are going through the ACE procedure. Mr Lively said he is truly inspired by his son's continuing optimism. He added: 'To me, my son is a hero. I can't count the number of times I have seen him come out of surgery, open his eyes, sit up and smile.'","John-Joseph Lively, 5, was born with his bowel attached to his heart .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . Yvonne Pickford, 55, was hit by her daughter's sledge and found lumps in her breasts which turned out to be malignant when she was checking herself for bruises . A mother-of-three discovered she had life-threatening breast cancer after being knocked over by her daughter's sledge on a ski trip. Yvonne Pickford, 55, from Olton in Solihull, had been on an annual family holiday in Valmorel, France when the sledging accident happened- and she then discovered a cancerous lump as she checked herself over for bruises. Her six-year-old daughter Jenii Quigley sped down a hill in the sledge but crashed into her mother, who was waiting at the bottom of the slope. Mrs Pickford, a theatre nurse who works at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, said her daughter knocking her down ironically saved her life. She said: 'Thank God Jenii hit me with the sledge - she saved my life. 'If she hadn't have done that I wouldn't have checked myself over that night and discovered the lump. 'I do normally check for lumps, but hadn't done for a while and decided that while I was making sure I was OK I would feel around for anything on my breasts.' She contacted her GP and mentioned  the growth as soon as she was home. Tests revealed  two lumps on her right breast and one on the left side. Mrs Pickford, said she counts herself very lucky to have caught the cancer before it spread further. She said: 'One of the lumps on the right breast was malignant and the cancer was spreading fast. 'They told me it was a good job I had found it when I did.' Mrs Pickford, who is also a grandmother, underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in a bid to beat the disease after the diagnosis in 2003. Since then she has raised more than £15,000 for Cancer Research UK. She will now front the charity's newest campaign - Stand Up For Cancer - which has been organised with Channel 4. She said: 'I believe wholeheartedly in research and have run marathons and even cycled across India to raise funds.' 'I'm so grateful for the treatment that saved my life but not everyone survives. That's why I want to do all I can to get people standing up to cancer right now.' Mrs Pickford said that six -year-old daughter Jenii 'saved her life' when she careered into her with a sledge on a family skiing holiday in Valmorel, France, as it led to her being diagnosed with breast cancer . 'We need to fight back against this disease by raising money so that brilliant research can be translated into treatments for patients faster.' A host of celebrities have joined the Stand Up to Cancer campaign, which will culminate in a live TV fundraiser on October 17. As part of the drive, Birmingham has been chosen as one of only 15 cities to host a unique March on Cancer event, which will take place simultaneously around the UK on October 11.

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . and Australian Associated Press . Hamid Kehazaei, who had been detained on Australia's Manus Island facility, has died after an infection in a cut foot deteriorated to septicaemia . A brain-dead Iranian asylum seeker who had been detained on Australia's Manus Island facility has died after his family decided to switch off his life support. Hamid Kehazaei was taken from Papua New Guinea last week after an infection in a cut foot deteriorated to severe septicaemia. He was then treated at a Brisbane hospital. He was pronounced brain dead this week, according to refugee advocates. Mr Kehazaei's family gave consent on Friday afternoon to switch his life support off, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed. 'I am very saddened by this man's passing and on behalf of the Australian government I extend our deepest sympathy to the man's family and friends,' Mr Morrison said in a statement. 'My department has and will continue to provide support to the family and has been in contact with family members during the course of the man's treatment,' he said, adding that the name and age of the man would not be released, subject to agreement from his family.' The Australian Greens earlier disputed Mr Morrison's claim's that Mr Kehazaei had received 'outstanding' care before his transfer to Brisbane. 'If outstanding care on Manus Island sees someone die because of a cut foot, it needs to be shut down,' Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said. Mr Kehazaei's family gave consent on Friday afternoon to switch his life support off, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed . Mr Kehazaei was initially transferred to a Port Moresby hospital last Wednesday, where he had a heart attack before being sent to Brisbane. Mr Morrison rejected suggestions the care provided to Mr Kehazaei was inadequate. 'When someone becomes ill they receive outstanding care from the people who work as part of our mainland detention network,' he said. Mr Morrison has asked the immigration department's chief medical officer to review Mr Kehazaei's treatment. 'I will base my assessment of that treatment on facts and not Facebook,' he said. Refugee advocate Ian Rintoul claimed asylum seekers on Manus Island sometimes had to walk through raw sewage. 'Nothing else to describe it, but it is just sheer negligence,' Mr Rintoul told the ABC. 'Hamid is a victim of the shocking conditions and medical neglect on Manus Island.' The 24-year-old was transferred to a Port Moresby hospital (pictured) after suffering from septicaemia following a cut on his foot. He suffered a heart attack at the hospital and was taken to a Brisbane hospital . He is believed to have spent days seeking treatment for his cut foot that had been there for a few weeks at the Manus Island detention centre (pictured) Labor has called for the review to be made public as soon as possible. Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said Labor continued to be concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers. Mr Rintoul said Mr Kehazaei's death was 'senseless and inexcusable'. 'Hamid's death speaks for the medical neglect, and to the culture of punishment, and indifference that pervades Manus Island,' he said. 'Infections and skin disease are endemic in the detention centre. It is unhygienic, unsanitary and unsafe.' The family have indicated they wish to have his organs donated.","Hamid Kehazaei, who had been detained on Australia's Manus Island facility, had an infection in a cut foot deteriorated to septicaemia .

"By . Louise Eccles For Daily Mail . A social worker admitted yesterday she had ‘failed’ a housebound pensioner who died after being left without food or medication for nine days – because the 81-year-old was well off. Gloria Foster, who funded her own care, was assumed to be able to make other arrangements when the agency that visited her four times a day was shut by immigration officials. The dementia sufferer, who did not know the agency had been closed, was found dying after nine days by a nurse, dehydrated and starving. Gloria Foster (pictured) was assumed to be able to make other arrangements when the agency that visited her four times a day was shut by immigration officials, an inquest heard . Mrs Foster, from Banstead, Surrey, died 11 days later on February 2 in Epsom Hospital. An inquest heard council staff failed to arrange alternative care for her after the UK Border Agency raided the Carefirst24 agency. Social worker Elizabeth Egan said she did not realise Mrs Foster had dementia, and claimed she only tried to call her once to let her know that the agency had been shut down, but didn’t get through. She said she only made a record of the call after Mrs Foster was found dying because she was too busy at the time. Police said phone records indicated that no such call took place. When Carefirst24 closed, Mrs Egan was told to find replacement carers for the firm’s customers, even though she was suffering from depression and had told her bosses at Surrey social services she was not coping. The 81-year-old (left) was left in her home for nine days before a nurse found her dehydrated, hungry and soaked in urine . She told Surrey Coroner’s Court that she was ‘reaching the point of burn-out’ at the time and had made a ‘judgment error’. The agency's owners appeared in court accused of employing workers without visas . Mrs Egan said people who funded their own care were often thought to be able to look after their own arrangements, adding: ‘There is an assumption which is wrong – and I think I made that as well – that they can manage their own care or have help from someone else to arrange it. ‘I tried to ring the lady. I didn’t get any reply. I didn’t follow it up. I don’t think I was even thinking straight. 'There was too much happening. The bottom line is that I failed. I made a mistake. I wasn’t in a fit state to take on any extra work.’ Nurse Rosemary Greig, who called at Mrs Foster’s home to carry out a blood test on January 24, found her fully clothed and lying across her bed, soaked in urine. The Woking inquest was told the widow died from pulmonary thrombo-embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Coroner Richard Travers will record his verdict next week. Meanwhile, the married owners of Carefirst24 appeared at Croydon Crown Court yesterday accused of illegally employing workers without visas.

"By . Catherine Hardy For Mailonline . When Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead were convicted of in 2013 of lighting the fire that destroyed their home and resulted in the death of their six innocent children, the entire country was baying for the couple's blood. But no one wishes that Mick Philpott was dead more  than Mairead's father, and grandfather of the dead children, Jimmy Duffy, who has spoken in a TV interview to be shown on Sunday night. Speaking in an episode of The Crimes That Shook Britain, Jimmy says that he'd 'like to kill the man for what he’s done to them children and what he’s done to my daughter.' See below for video . Jimmy Duffy with daughter Bernadette arriving to the trial of his daughter Mairead Philpott in 2012 . Jimmy puts what his daughter did down to her husband's abusive and controlling behaviour . Jimmy puts what his daughter did down to her husband's abusive and controlling behaviour. 'I blame him for the way she was and the way she is now and what she’s done. All his doing. 'If it was up to me I’d strangle the man tomorrow if I was given half a chance.' The episode, which details the crime, also includes reflections from neighbours Darren and Jamie Butler, who were present the night of the fire. Mairead was sentenced to 17 years imprisonment for manslaughter for her part in lighting the fire at her children's home, and attempting to blame the arson on husband Mick's ex-lover Lisa Willis. The jailed couple were married in 2003, but Jimmy says that he had misgivings about Mick from the beginning . The pair married in 2003, and in the episode Jimmy recalls that from the beginning he had misgivings about his son-in-law. '[At their wedding] he seemed to be mingling around everywhere in among the women, stuff like that there and half the time she was sitting there on her own, and he was nowhere near her. I said to him ‘You’re supposed to be with your wife today. You’re going round all these women’. And he did quite annoy me but I was in two minds of saying I’m going to whack him one, but I decided not to ruin the day kind of thing, so I just kind of bit my tongue and left it at that.' Speaking in The Crimes That Shook Britain, Jimmy says that he'd 'like to kill the man for what he’s done' In the aftermath of the fire in May 2012, Mick and Mairead appeared on TV to talk about the incident, but even then something didn't seem right to Jimmy. 'To me it was a show because I couldn’t see a tear. I never heard a mention of the children or ‘Find out who done this to my children.’ 'I thought to myself, ‘What’s wrong with the man?’ Six children are dead; somebody set the house on fire. No mention of the children; no sign of a tear. 'I don’t think there was a tear coming out of Mairead’s eye either. But she just sat there with her head down, clinging on to him.' Mairead and Mick speak to the media in Derby, 2012, following the fire that killed six of their children . Once their crime was discovered, Mick, Mairead and co-conspirator Paul Mosley underwent an eight week trial, at the end of which they were all found guilty and sentenced, Mick to life imprisonment and Mairead and Mosley to 17 years each. However, Jimmy believes that sentencing should have been harsher, saying that some of the spectators in court believed the couple should have received an individual sentence for each of the six children who died. Despite saying he 'can't forgive' Mairead for her actions, Jimmy says that she's 'still my daughter, I still love her' and worries that he might somehow be responsible for what happened. 'Some nights I sit back and think what did I do wrong that she turned out the way she did? You know, I blame myself sometimes.'

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . and Kelly Strange For Mailonline . A mother has shared a heartbreaking photo diary of her terminally ill daughter's life as she vows to make wishes come true for other dying children. When Emma Whitfield was told her young daughter, Evie Kean, had just months to live, she was determined to fit a lifetime of memories into whatever time they had left together. She didn't ask Evie to write a bucket list because she did not want her child to know she was dying, so she instead asked the eight-year-old to list all the things she would do if she were the Queen – and then secretly set to work making them happen. Made her dreams come true: Emma, pictured with Evie, who passed away peacefully in January, says the happy memories of fulfilling Evie's wishes give her some comfort . Evie's wishes included meeting boy band One Direction, visiting Legoland and owning her own dog. And when she died 10 months later, in January this year, mother of three Emma had ticked off all the items on the 'secret bucket list' without her daughter ever knowing it existed. Now Emma, a dinner lady at Evie's old primary school in Hull, says that thanks to various charities, she has a lifetime of memories to cherish. 'My daughter was dying but making all her dreams come true made her so happy and that to me is priceless,' says Emma, 32. 'Asking her to write a bucket list would have been awful so instead I managed to get her to tell me without her knowing how ill she was.' Shock diagnosis: There was no indication that anything was wrong until Evie fainted at school in February 2013 and it was eventually revealed she had an inoperable brain tumour and had only months to live . Puppy love: The day before her ninth birthday in May, Evie was given a dog she named Lucy . There was no indication that anything was wrong until Evie fainted at school in February 2013. When she came round slurring, staff feared she had suffered a stroke and called an ambulance. Emma, who was working as a PA at the time, raced to the hospital. She says: 'I was terrified but when I got there Evie was sat up in A&E, laughing and smiling. The only thing I noticed was that her speech sounded a bit babyish.' Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary decided to run tests and an MRI scan came back with devastating results. Evie had a large tumour on her brain stem which was later found to be cancerous. Two weeks after Evie had fainted, while she lay in a hospital bed surrounded by family, doctors took Emma and her mother Marjorie, 76, into a side room and explained that the tumour was inoperable. Royal treatment: Emma got the chance to meet some of her Disney heroes in the months after her diagnosis . Happy memories: Evie, right with her siblings Lottie, four and Riley, three, was delighted by the fact she didn't have to queue up to meet the characters when the family went to Disneyland Paris to fulfill one of her wishes . Family pulled together: Evie's grandfather paid for the whole family to visit Disneyland Paris in between Evie's chemotherapy . Evie had just months to live. Emma says: 'I was so shocked I ran outside. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. But then I composed myself because I needed to get back to Evie and make sure she was OK.' And that evening, after discussing what to do, Emma and Evie's stepfather, Shane Gray – who are also parents to Lottie, four and Riley, three – decided not to tell Evie she was dying. Emma says: 'Evie was a worrier and I couldn't put that on her shoulders. It would have frightened her.' Star pupil:  Evie continued to go to school because she didn't want to fall behind, especially in her favourite subject maths . Dream trips: Visiting Hamley's toy-store (left) and Legoland (right) were two of the things listed by Emma . Instead Emma gently explained to Evie that she was poorly and the doctors were trying to make her better. 'She seemed happy with that.' But that left Emma wanting to make her girl's dreams come true without asking her to write a bucket list. 'I realised the only way I could do it would be if I tricked her into making it by asking her what she would do if she could do anything in the world. 'My heart was breaking because I knew what I was really asking her but Evie's face just lit up at the question. Poignant party: On Evie's ninth - and last - birthday she had her dream of an ice-skating party granted . Heartbreaking decision: Emma and her partner chose not to tell Evie, pictured here with siblings Lottie and Riley, that she was dying . 'I could see her mind racing as she came up with all these wonderful ideas.' Evie wanted to have an ice-skating birthday party, visit Disneyland and Legoland, see a West End show, go to the zoo and Hamley's toy store plus own a dog and rabbit and meet her beloved boy band One Direction. While Evie started an intensive 30-session course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try to extend her life, Emma quit her job and started fundraising to make her wishes come true. She held parties, bake sales, sold wristbands and was nominated for grants from charities who assist families of terminally ill children. The first wish to be granted was by One Direction who sent a film clip, holding up a message: 'Dear Evie, Get well soon, Love One Direction.' It arrived in April, a month after the terminal diagnosis was given. Animal lover: Emma quit her job to help grant her daughter's wishes, which included going to the zoo . Strong: Emma said she always tried to keep a brave face for Evie . Emma says: 'I tried to arrange a meeting with them but they were on tour and instead offered to do a message. I told Evie something special was coming in the post. She was thrilled when she saw what it was. 'We watched it in her hospital bed about 500 times. She was over the moon that they knew who she was.' Then the day before her ninth birthday in May, Evie was given a Lhasa Apso dog she named Lucy – another tick. Emma says: 'She had always wanted one so she couldn't stop smiling.' The following day another wish came true when she had an ice skating birthday party for her friends. 'Evie was too weak to skate after the first hour and had to be pulled in a sledge on the ice. She still loved every minute and was calling out for me to pull her faster. Brave and beautiful: Despite the chemotherapy causing her to gain weight, making her a little self-conscious, Emma says Evie was happy to have her mother taking pictures of her experiences . 'I had to hold back tears but I wanted every minute to be a joy because I knew it was her last birthday,' says Emma. Then Evie's grandfather paid for them to visit Disneyland Paris. Emma recalls: 'Evie made us laugh because she worked out that as she was in a wheelchair she didn't have to queue to meet the characters. She felt like a superstar.' Next Evie was taken to London to see hit show Mamma Mia! and the following month they took Evie to Legoland. Snow fun: In December last year the family took Evie to visit Lapland and meet Santa, granting her last wish . Loss: Heartbroken Emma has taken comfort from the happiness of her daughter's last months . Legacy: Emma is now launching a charity - Evie's Wishes - to help all terminally ill children's dreams come true . Emma says: 'She had lost a bit of hair and had started to gain weight because of her chemotherapy and was feeling self-conscious. But Evie was still happy for me to take lots of pictures.' In between the wishes Evie continued to go to school because she didn't want to fall behind, especially in her favourite subject, maths. 'I didn't have the heart to tell her it didn't matter any more. It mattered to Evie so she kept going,' says Emma. Between June and October she had a second course of chemo and in December last year they visited Lapland to meet Santa. But after Christmas the child's health went rapidly downhill. And when in early January she complained that she felt too poorly to go to school, Emma knew the end was coming. She says: 'Evie never wanted to miss school - but she still insisted on going to buy me a present even though my birthday was a month away. It made me wonder if she knew. 'But soon she was in pain so nurses came and fitted a morphine drip.' Days later Evie died at home, holding her mother's hand. Heartbroken Emma took comfort in the happiness of her daughter's last months. She says: 'The memories we made are what get me through each day. Lottie and Riley miss her. They think she lives in the clouds. It helps that they talk about her' Emma is now launching a charity - Evie's Wishes - to help all terminally ill children's dreams come true. 'I want to make sure that can happen for any other family. Evie's wishes made her happy - and as a parent of a dying child that is all you can ask for.'","Mother decided not to tell eight-year-old she was dying to avoid scaring her .

"By . Rachel Watson For The Scottish Daily Mail . It's the moment every Lottery player dreams of; that ‘money for nothing’ feeling of winning a big prize on a scratchcard that cost only a few pounds. But in the case of grandmother Grace Walker, it was probably just as well she picked up a million – because she has been spending thousands of pounds a year in an attempt to win a top prize. As she celebrated her win yesterday, the housewife from Hamilton, Lanarkshire, admitted she has been buying up to 30 scratchcards a week, costing £1-£5, for the past few years. Scroll down for video . Cashcard: Grace and William Walker pose with a super-size mock-up of her winning scratchcard . That means she could have spent up to £600 a month for more than two years – almost £15,000 in total. But the investment has paid off. Mother of three Mrs Walker, 49, said she had not slept and had eaten only a plum since her win was confirmed on Saturday. She added that she had been in floods of tears and nearly fainted when she realised she had become Scotland’s latest millionaire. She celebrated her win with champagne at the Strathaven Hotel along with 48-year-old husband William. The couple said their children, Siobhan, 28, Kevin 27, and Michelle 22, could not believe their mother was a millionaire, as she had often tried to fool them in the past. Here's to a champagne lifestyle: The Walkers celebrate their big win in Lanarkshire yesterday . Mrs Walker was at home on Saturday with Michelle, after buying her scratchcard at a local store, when she realised she had won. She said: ‘I go to the shop every Saturday and buy a card. I usually buy about 30 cards a week, I’ve been doing it for a long time. ‘I started to scratch the lines then I got to the bottom and when I saw it was a million I just couldn’t stop thinking I had to get my daughter over to check. ‘Normally I wind up her and her brother and tell them I’ve won £100 or something. But she came over, looked at it, looked at me. She started howling and said, “Mum, you’ve won a million”. I nearly fainted. The tears were just coming.’ 'The world is your oyster': Yet Mr Walker said he has no plans to give his job as a removals man, and Mrs Walker said she would continue to 'enjoy the thrill' of buying lottery scratchcards . Mrs Walker won her £1million on the £100million Cash Spectacular Game card. Asked why she had picked the winning card, she said: ‘It was my favourite colour, pink.’ She added: ‘I won’t stop buying scratchcards, though, I enjoy the thrill of it, knowing it could be me.’ Mrs Walker said the family would remain in their council house in Hamilton’s Fairhill, adding: ‘I’ve lived here for 30 years and I love it.’ ‘Two of our children live at home. One of them wants to get a dog, she would love a pug. And I’ve only got a £60 phone so I’m going for an iPhone with the winnings.’ Mr Walker said he had no plans to give up his job as a removals man but did concede: ‘You can do anything you want with a million pounds. The world is your oyster.’","Grace Walker has spent almost £15,000 on scratchcards in recent years .

"By . James Tozer for the Daily Mail . They simply wanted to smarten up their local area, and were happy to give up their own time to do it. But one group of neighbours faced an unexpected obstacle as they prepared to take up litter-pickers and clean up their street … the local council. It informed the residents that under health and safety legislation, it had no choice but to order them to down tools because they had not been trained to use them. Norman Bryant, member of Normanton Empowerment Team, with equipment supplied by Derby City Council . Yesterday the volunteers – part of a network backed by none other than the local council – said they were ‘stunned’ by the demand. Dawn Gee, who was among those planning to help spruce up Clarence Road in the Normanton area of Derby, said: ‘We have been collecting litter for a number of years and were issued with a small amount of litter-pickers to support us doing this. ‘Why are we now being told we cannot use them without training – why now? ‘We were told it is because the litter-pickers were issued by the council.’ She pointed out that she and her fellow residents – members of Normanton Empowerment Team, backed by Derby City Council –were still expected to use wheelie bins, also issued by the council. ‘Does this mean that all the residents in Derby should undergo moving and handling training to avoid personal injury?’ she added. ‘We have worked very hard trying to empower people into taking responsibility to pick up litter in front of their own properties. This action can have the opposing effect.’ Karen Williams, another volunteer, said: ‘I feel that the council is doing everything it can to deter us from carrying on as a group but it is not going to stop us.’ They were backed by Simon Bacon, another resident, who said he was ‘stunned’. He added: ‘As a community group, we act responsibly at all times around waste on the street because of the known risks. ‘So, to learn after carrying out regular litter picks safely for so many months that training was now required came as a shock. ‘I am fearful that such an approach will put off concerned members of the public looking to take pride in their community by looking to collect litter from the street if the council puts in place such requirements. We should be looking to empower people to care for their community, not place hurdles in their way.’ And fellow volunteer Ashley Waterhouse said: ‘It has come as a great blow and a shame to hear that the council is stopping dedicated volunteers within the community taking pride within their area, spending hours of their time litter-picking.’ Paul Robinson, Derby City Council’s strategic director for neighbourhoods, said the authority wanted people to help keep their streets clean but there were dangers and it was legally obliged to train them if they were using council equipment. He added: ‘We absolutely want to encourage people to pick up litter and to take pride in their locality. The volunteers were cleaning Clarence Road in Normanton, Derby, when they were told to stop by the council . ‘Under the Health and Safety Act, we have a duty of care on people undertaking work on our behalf. ‘Where we are asked by people to work on our behalf, we have to satisfy ourselves that they understand the risks and what they are going to be doing. ‘With litter, there could be needles in what they pick up or large items could be heavy.’ Mr Robinson added: ‘If anything were to go wrong, we could potentially be sued as we’ve sanctioned that work.’ The council is understood to have let the team hold on to the litter-pickers until they can be trained in how to use them properly. In the year to March, there were 6,651 incidents of fly-tipping in Derby, including 5,173 in the Normanton and Arboretum wards, but no convictions.","Volunteers cleaning the streets in Normanton, Derby, were ordered to stop .

Pam Radford, 68, from Merstham, Surrey, has commemorated every St Patrick's Day, St George's Day, St Andrew's Day and St David's Day since 1972.

Dedicated Pam also dons military dress six times every year, to mark Victory in Europe Day, Victory over Japan Day, D-Day, Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday - as well as the newly marked Armed Forces Day. Pam, a retired secretary, also puts on fancy dress every time there is a Comic Relief or Children in Need appeal. She said: 'Some people think I'm a bit mad, but I love it. I do get positive reactions from people. Sadly, these days we only ever seem to celebrate St Patrick's Day. 'I want to make sure people don't forget the other special occasions on our calendar.' While Pam sometimes travels further away from home to spread her patriotic cheer, she prefers doing the same regular walk around her home town.

She said: 'I don't do April Fools' Day, because I'm dressed as a fool most of the time already.' Pam dressed up to celebrate the 25th anniversary of end of the Falklands War 2007 .

'I'm still a member of the Royal British Legion - every year I'm out there collecting money for the Poppy Appeal, and if there is ever an opportunity for me to go out and raise money for a worthy cause, I will. 'I never married. I never found time for it, really. I just spend every spare moment I have enjoying myself, and trying to help others.' On military occasions, Pam can dig out camouflage, period war uniforms and her Royal British Legion outfit from her massive fancy dress box. She even tailors what she drinks for each occasion.

'None of my Welsh friends can tell me what their national drink is, so on St David's Day, I just drink whatever I want. 'I've started drinking more halves now than pints, as I'm getting on a bit.

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . It is the retirement village gone wild; with Gold Coast residents claiming abuse, harassment and bullying from a group of other retirees on the body corporate committee - not to mention a still that allegedly has senior citizens illegally selling bottles of alcohol for $10. Now, victims at Aveo retirement village at Ashmore's Amity Gardens in the Gold Coast is fighting back at the perpetrators voicing their complaints about the body corporate clique. Great grandparents Jon Withers and his wife June, have begun protesting against the injustice, in order to stop the control of the corrupt body corporate and retiree members, Gold Coast Bulletin reported. Aveo retirement village describes the community as an 'oasis' After the 77 years-old resident discovered Aveo's official Facebook page was monitoring posts by only approving comments of their choice, Mr Withers decided to create a public Facebook page which allowed residents to openly voice their concerns without censorship. He and his wife, June, 70, wrote a letter to residents: . 'In the seven years we have lived in the village, from the beginning we endured bullying... a solid clique of supporters have held the control of the body corporate and residents committee, even protecting an illegal still operating in the village with sales to general consumers.' *Single female residents receive warning letters after having 'male visitors' at night . *Illegal alcohol operation, as clique members sell spirits for $10 to elderly residents . *A 79 year-old woman was rushed to hospital after a parking confrontation between her and a body corporate committee member caused the retiree to experience overwhelming stress . *An elderly Asian resident was denied a herb garden by body corporate, which resulted in her leaving the village . The couple claim they witnessed another resident carrying a box of spirits from a unit, driving off in a golf cart to sell the bottles to older women in the village, which apparently is initiation into the clique. Another resident at the 122-unit estate have affirmed an illegal moonshine distribution within the community, after noticing the still  walking home through the village. 'There was steam coming up through a storm water drain. I thought something was on fire. It was from the still,' an elderly female said. But illegal alcohol sales to elderly residents is not the communities only concern, some single residents claim 'continual harassment and verbal abuse', with one claiming she received an unjust warning from body corporate after a 'male friend' visited her during the evenings. 'The send you a contravention notice for the car noise at night,' Dani Tobin said. A former member of the body corporate was pushed over the edge to resign after witnessing 'personal attacks' on residents at Aveo. The Withers said although advertising for the Facebook page has been removed, residents have not stopped posting their views on Facebook.

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Tory MP Michael Fabricant has clashed with Commons Speaker John Bercow . Commons Speaker John Bercow was facing further questions over his authority today after his own staff allegedly railed against him in an expletive-ridden phone call to a Tory MP. Mr Bercow is under pressure over his attempt to parachute in controversial Australian Carol Mills to become Parliament’s most senior official. But after a revolt by MPs the Speaker announced a ‘modest pause’ in the appointment process. Following Mr Bercow’s u-turn he has faced a series of challenges in the Commons. Leading rebel Michael Fabricant revealed today that he had been egged on by Mr Bercow’s own Parliamentary staff. He told the Spector magazine: ‘I have had so many messages of support from junior employees of the House saying go for it, the Speaker is a c***.’ The Tory MP added: ‘I don’t use language like that, but I do think he can be a bit of a knob. He doesn’t inspire loyalty at any level it seems.’ The remarks came after Mr Bercow rowed with Tory MPs in the Commons for a fourth day about the selection of Ms Mills. In tense exchanges, Mr Fabricant said he had been told that head-hunters Saxton Bampfylde were stopped from meeting the panel and presenting information about Ms Mills, who was nominated by the Speaker as the replacement for recently retired Sir Robert Rogers. The nomination, which must be confirmed by the Queen, has provoked a row about her qualifications to undertake the constitutionally sensitive role of head clerk advising the Speaker on matters of procedure in the House. On a point of order to the Speaker, Mr Fabricant said: ‘Under those circumstances, I wonder whether you might wish to put the record straight so the House might not be misled?’ Mr Bercow gave a lengthy reply, insisting: ‘Let me reiterate: I believe you to be incorrect. The panel, of which I was chair, was briefed about all of the applicants for the post of clerk and chief executive and I think you are quite wrong to say there was prevention of SB giving information to the panel. ‘The panel made a judgment on the material with which it was provided, including a piece of information provided to it on the occasion of the second set of interviews. The panel made its own judgement on the basis of that information and did not see any need for a meeting. ‘I would also reiterate ... the individual, whose name you bandy around in the House, that of Carol Mills, was indeed on the original list of proposed interviewees. You put it to me that she had not been; I told you she had been - and I have one slight advantage of you in this matter. ‘That is, I was there and I do know, and you weren't and do not.’ Mr Bercow stopped Mr Fabricant from intervening again with a further point of order - despite the MP, who has had long feud with the Speaker, shouting from a seated position. Mr Bercow added: ‘I hope you will be able to observe the normal courtesies that obtain in the House of Commons. That is the end of the matter for today.’ Tory Simon Burns however raised a further point of order, and questioned why Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle had been left off the selection panel. He was replaced by Labour MP Margaret Hodge, whom Mr Burns suggested could have a potential conflict of interest because of her role as chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee. Commons Speaker John Bercow is facing growing questions over his authority in the Commons . But Mr Bercow said: ‘In the selection of panels that make judgments of this kind, it is perfectly normal practice to vary the membership of those panels from one instance to another - there is nothing disorderly, irregular or particularly surprising about that. ‘Secondly ... I thought when you raised the point (about Mrs Hodge) before it was a poor point and it hasn't improved with time. There is no conflict of interest at all.’ He added: ‘I think the House will agree I have set out the matters with crystal clarity. I have done so a number of times and I would hope people having had the point made to them a number of times would see it and acknowledge its veracity.’ The Speaker then clashed again with Mr Fabricant during a further point of order from Tory MP Julian Lewis, who spoke up in favour of Mr Bercow. Mr Fabricant was accused of heckling and was told by Mr Bercow: ‘Try showing some basic courtesy and manners of the kind the people who attend our proceedings would wish to hear. ‘You made your point and it was decisively dealt with by the chair.’ Mr Bercow has called for the historic role of Commons clerk to be split, arguing that the traditional qualifications of the clerk do not match up to the needs of managing the large staff and budget of Parliament. The £200,000-a-year role has always previously been held by one person, appointed by Letters Patent from the Queen to ensure independence and impartiality.","Commons staff dismiss Mr Bercow with derogatory swear words, MP claims .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . They were so close, yet so far away. Koalas, usually the type of species spotted grazing up in Eucalyptus trees, are perhaps not the brightest of animals after an unfortunate video shows a mother taking a leap of faith whilst carrying her baby on her back. Unluckily for the pair, they didn't quite make it but they certainly gave a whole new meaning to 'drop bear' - the fictitious and vicious Australian marsupial. An unfortunate video has emerged of a mother koala taking a leap of faith whilst carrying her baby on her back . The Australian native animal makes the decision to jump but unfortunately misses by a few centimetres . Also known as the Phascolarctos cinereus, the Australian native animals were filmed carefully climbing across a shed rooftop. The mother reaches the edge, pauses for a few seconds and observes her surroundings - calculating the distance between the shed and a neighbouring tree. Then she makes the decision to jump but unfortunately misses by few centimetres. Chris Winter caught the action and uploaded it on YouTube, naming the video: 'Koala Fail...Drop Bears Exist'.","The mother koala was carrying her baby on her back as she climbed across a shed .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Clattering through the air like skittles cleaned up by a bowling ball, these Portuguese forcados really struggled to grab the bull by the horns. The huge, black beast appears to be coming out very much on top as it brushes aside the unarmed bullfighters - despite the fact that it has been stabbed in the back of the neck with three javelins. The bull knocked several of the Vila Franca Xira forcados group head over heels during the event at the Campo Pequeno bullring in Lisbon yesterday. Dressed in their ornate jackets and knee-high socks, the fighters looked like little more than plastic toy soldiers as they were tossed around the ring. Portuguese bullfighting differs from the Spanish method as it involves eight forcados tackling the bull bare-handed, while Spanish matadors are armed and have their traditional red cape. The Portuguese tradition also says that the bull should not be killed in the ring - though it is usually led off out of the audience's sight to be slaughtered after the fight. A Portuguese bullfight starts with the cavaleiro - an armed horseman - stabbing the bull in the back with javelins to weaken it. It then tackled the forcados, who try and provoke it to charge in the hope of eventually grabbing it by the head and subduing it. Double strike: The huge, black bull clatters two of the forcados into the air as they try and grab it by the head in the hope of subduing it . Head over heels: One of the bullfighters is flipped over by the beast as he makes as grab for its horns, while the others run in worriedly to assist . Ten-pin bulling: The bull knocks a shoe off one of the fighters as four more stand in wait behind him - the next in line screaming out in fear . Head-to-head: The bull and a brave forcado tackle each other head on as the seven other fighters spot a chance to jump in and grab the animal . Brushed aside: The bull has absolutely no trouble in swiping away a lone forcado, despite the three javelins sticking deep into the back of its neck . Seizing the opportunity: As one fighters is tackled to the floor, two more of the unarmed men step in to try to grab it by the head and take it down . Hold on tight! A forcado grabs onto the bull's head and holds on for dear life as the beast tries to flip him angrily onto the sand . You're pulling my tail: A bullfighter with a ripped jacket attempts to stop the bull from behind as another scarpers off quickly in the other direction . Time to kick back: The forcados relax after the fight, with one lighting a cigarette to calm his nerves after being tossed all over the Lisbon ring .","Vila Franca Xira forcados group took on the huge, black bull at the Campo Pequeno bullring in Lisbon yesterday .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A family of millionaire travellers who were jailed for forcing vulnerable men to work as slave labourers have been ordered to repay more than £2million. The Gloucestershire-based Connors family benefited from more than £5million as a result of their crimes after tricking homeless men and drug addicts into living with them on the promise of work, money and accommodation. William Connors, 54, wife Mary, 50, their sons, John, 31, and James, 22, and son-in-law Miles Connors, 25, were jailed in December 2012 after being convicted of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. However, a judge has now ordered them to pay a total of £2million within six months or face an extended prison sentence of up to six years. William Connors, 54, (left) and his 50-year-old wife Mary (right) were both jailed in December 2012 for forcing vulnerable and homeless men to work as slave labourers at their caravan park in Staverton, Gloucestershire . The couple's son's (from left to right) John, 29, and James, 20, and their son-in-law Miles, 24, were also jailed . Judge Michael Longman issued the court order today following a five-day proceeds of crime hearing at Bristol Crown Court. William Connors was told to pay back £1.5million or face six years' jail and his wife has to pay £140,000 or face 20 months' imprisonment. Their children, John and James, owe the courts £305,000 and £135,000 and, if they fail to pay, face prison sentences of 38 months and nine months respectively. Miles was told to pay £17,000 or face nine months' jail. £500,000 seized by the police three years ago will be forfeited immediately while the Connors' victims will receive nearly £150,000 in compensation. Gloucestershire Police said it was the largest confiscation order in its history. The Gloucestershire-based family were caught after a major undercover surveillance operation which saw police film more than 8,000 hours of footage, including this clip of Connors assaulting one of his slave workers . The Connors forced the men to work and live in squalid conditions while they enjoyed a luxury lifestyle including lengthy holidays abroad, cruises (above), a fleet of expensive cars and a number of investments in property . Police began investigating the family in 2008 after the remains of a former worker were found near a caravan site. Undercover surveillance revealed workers were living in cramped, filthy conditions, while the Connors lived the high life in plush accommodation and jetted off on luxury holidays. As well as holidays, they drove around in top-of-the-range cars, including a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a Rolls-Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick-up, a Ford Ranger and a Mercedes van, and had built up a mounting property portfolio potentially now worth millions of pounds. Several houses - including one with a hot tub and accompanying flat screen television - were registered in the names of other relatives. The family bought two caravan parks in Gloucestershire for £545,000 more than a decade ago and had £576,000 in bank accounts seized by the police. The Connors' enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in Staverton, Gloucestershire, in Enderby Leicestershire and in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in March 2011 following a lengthy surveillance operation. More than 8,000 hours of footage captured the men carrying out humiliating tasks including emptying buckets the family used as toilets, as well being subjected to brutal beatings. Despite all of the family being jailed in 2012, William Connors (left) is the only one to remain behind bars as the others, including wife  Mary (right)  have all since been released. However, they face jail again if they don't repay . The Connors, who lived at this large property in Willowdean, Gloucestershire, enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with the money they amassed from their crimes. The rich travellers invested in property, holidays and expensive cars . Police found hundreds of pounds dumped in a toilet when they raided one of the family's properties in 2011 . The victims - believed to be 37 in total - were paid as little as £5 per day and those who received state hand-outs had the money confiscated by the family. The family initially denied any wrongdoing but were each convicted, by a unanimous jury, of conspiracy to require a person to carry out forced or compulsory labour. Between them they were given 18 years behind bars, though four out of the five family members have already been released. In December 2012, William was jailed for six –and-a-half years while his wife Mary, also known as Brida, received a sentence of two years and three months. John was jailed for four years and James got three years' detention in a young offender institution. Son-in-law Miles received a three-year prison sentence. Apart from William, who remains in prison, the other members of the family have been released. Christopher Quinlan, prosecuting, said that the family gained in the region of £5million from their crimes. The family will be forced to sell a number of properties, as well as land, and caravan parks, cars, caravans and jewellery to pay the costs. Judge Longman warned the family that if the money was not paid back within the allocated time they would be handed further prison sentences ranging from nine months to six years. The Connors' enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in Staverton in Gloucestershire (above), Enderby in Leicestershire and Mansfield in Nottinghamshire in March 2011 following the surveillance operation . At least five slaves were found working for the family at Green Acres caravan park in Bedfordshire. They will now be forced to sell a number of properties, as well as land, to pay the costs owed to the court and victims . Detective Inspector David Sellwood said that it was a relief to have the case wrapped up after four years and ten months of hard work. Speaking outside court, he said: 'There were times when we thought we might get nothing so today's result is phenomenal. 'Getting a conviction was one thing but making them pay back was another. 'Now, 18 months after we started looking into the money situation, they have been ordered to pay back £2.25 million. 'They have already signed over around half a million pounds in bank accounts, so that is money that can be recovered quite quickly. 'This is not going to be something that stops. They owe £5 million, so if we see them driving around in flashy cars or purchasing luxury homes we will go after them. 'I am really happy with the amount they have been ordered to pay back today though - it sends out a message to criminals that we will get proceeds of crime back. 'This really will have a damning effect on the Connors family.'","Gloucestershire family targeted vulnerable men and kept them as slaves .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Anne Hammond awoke to a peculiar shrieking sound. It was vaguely familiar but it wasn't until she turned to her husband that she was able to put her finger on it. 'It's a frog,' he said. 'A frog's cry for help.' Indeed it was. But much to the couple's surprise, there was another creature waiting for them outside their Millner home - a northern suburb in Darwin. A frog was found under the eaves of a Darwin house up on its side while a snake was pulling it from the other side . Anne Hammond says she was woken my a screeching noise coming from the frog at 4am on Tuesday . Ms Hammond, who was sleeping with her windows open during the warm night, was woken to the strange screeching noise at 4am. 'I've definitely heard it before - kind of like what a cat would sound like if it catches a frog,' she told Daily Mail Australia. She jumped out of bed and grabbed her torch to investigate the source of the sound. 'We spotted the frog under the eaves of the house up on its side and then realised there was also a snake,' she said. Ms Hammond used her broomstick to give the creatures a nudge and helped the frog escape to safety . 'The two were stuck in a stalemate - the snake was inside the roof mesh wire while the frog was outside. 'The poor frog had its leg caught in the snake's mouth and it wouldn't let go.' Ms Hammond gave the green tailless amphibian a nudge with a broomstick, which freed the frog as it quickly hopped away. As for the serpentine, it slithered away into darkness. 'I couldn't sleep that night because all I could think about was that snake in my roof,' Ms Hammond said. 'I've lived here for 30 years but I was more shocked to see that rather than the frog - we've got them everywhere.'","Anne Hammond was woken by a strange shrieking noise at 4am on Tuesday .

"By . Harriet Arkell for MailOnline . Police who stopped a car found a vast arsenal of weapons including a claw hammer, a sledgehammer handle and a baseball bat studded with nails and wrapped in barbed wire. Five gang members admitted possessing an offensive weapon but walked free from court yesterday after saying they intended to damage a man's car rather than a person. Prosecutor Paul Newcombe told Teesside Crown Court that the baseball bat officers found in the gang's Fiat Punto late one night was 'more suited to Game of Thrones than the streets of Guisborough'. Police found a baseball bat studded with nails and wrapped in barbed wire hidden in a car in Guisborough . Concrete blocks, a modified baseball bat, a sledgehammer handle and claw hammer were among the array . Mr Newcombe said: 'It's a very threatening and dangerous weapon.' adding that police also found three concrete bricks, two masks, one of which was a 'Scream' mask, and gloves. The court heard that driver Kyle Wright, 28, looked nervous when police came across the car in Guisborough, Cleveland, at about 11.20pm on March 17. He made a U-turn and tried to drive away but was stopped by officers who then found the stash of weapons hidden under seats, in footwells and by the handbrake. Wright, of Guisborough, told police the implements were 'for protection', though he later said that was a joke, the court heard. Also in the car were passengers Sean Harris, 27, also from Guisborough, Paul Jeffels, 32, of Easington, Saltburn, Lewis Swatton, 20, from Brotton, and Jamie Haley, 18, from Loftus. The prosecutor said: 'While it's unknown exactly what the true purpose of this journey was, it may well be related to a recent stabbing in the area, and possible revenge for that stabbing.' All five admitted possession of an offensive weapon but said the intention was to damage a man's car. The court heard they had few or no relevant previous convictions, except for Jeffels who had numerous assaults on his record. Andrew Turton, defending Harris, said: 'No violence was used. No threats of violence were made. Police found Sean Harris, 27, Paul Jeffels, 32, and Lewis Swatton, 20, in a car with an arsenal of weapons . He said Harris, a college student, was foolish and had alcohol issues, but said he was tackling those and aspired to set up his own business. Duncan McReddie, representing Wright, said prison would have a serious impact on the single father's two children, and that he had medical problems. Alex Bousfield, for Jeffels, said: 'It was to be a show of force, it seems, to a certain individual in Guisborough. 'He just went along with it. No member of the public saw any of these weapons.' Swatton's barrister Nigel Soppitt said: 'He's very easily led.  He says he was really oblivious at that point through drink and drugs.' And Peter Makepeace, defending Haley, said he was a hard-working man of previous positive good character, and unlikely to be in court again. Judge Howard Crowson told the five: 'I'm not going to lock you up today, but it comes pretty close - this sort of weapon could cause a great deal of harm. 'What we see is the final offences which usually result in dreadful violence and horrible injury.' He said police information matched the assertion that the men didn't mean to hurt people, but such street violence could have erupted. He gave Jeffels,  an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for one year, and Wright, Harris and Swatton five-month sentences, suspended for one year. Wright and Swatton were also each given eight-week tagged curfews, Harris and Jeffels were ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work each, and Haley, of Loftus, was given a one-year conditional discharge. Game of Thrones is a fantasy television series based on the novel series A Song Of Fire And Ice by George R. R. Martin. It has won several awards and nominations, as well as record audience figures, but has also attracted criticism for its ultra-violence, particularly towards women. Games of Thrones (season four pictured) features terrifying weaponry in its many scenes of violence . Filmed in a Belfast studio and on location in sites around the world including Morocco, Scotland, Croatia and Malta, Game of Thrones spans four seasons and began its original run in October 2011. The show roughly follows three storylines from the original novels, and is set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. But many of the episodes feature violence to women, prompting one critic to write: 'rape has become so pervasive... that it is almost background noise'.","Police came across five men in a Fiat Punto late one night in Guisborough .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . James Richardson, a former spokesman for the GOP, has come out as gay and hopes to legalise same-sex marriage . A former spokesman for the Republican Party and senior GOP candidates has come out as gay and says he wants his party to legalize gay marriage. James Richardson, from Georgia, has worked for the likes of Jon Huntsman and Haley Barbour and at one time served as communications manager for the Republican National Committee. He has previously campaigned for legal same-sex marriage, but now he has come out as gay, he hopes his example will be enough to help persuade other Republicans to change their minds. Writing in the Washington Post, he said: 'My partner and I are envious subscribers to the conventional, conservative family model. 'Yet together, as two men wishing to grow grey and ornery in matching rocking chairs, we are consigned to 'cohabitation' as a consequence of law. That's unjust, and it's uniquely painful.' Richardson argues that, since straight couples are abandoning marriage, the inclusion of gay people will only serve to strengthen the institution. Richardson said that coming out will hopefully make his argument more persuasive, adding: 'It brings some personal heft when you are convincing people that what they are doing is going to hurt you.' There are currently six openly gay members of the U.S. House, and one member of the Senate, all of whom are Democrats. However three gay Republican candidates are running in the November elections - Richard Tisei of Massachusetts, Carl DeMaio of California and Dan Innis of New Hampshire. Richardson's new confession puts him at direct odds with former employer Hayley Barbour, who is strongly opposed to same sex marriage. Mr Richardson worked with Jon Huntsman (pictured) on his presidential campaign. Mr Huntsman has also embraced the policy of allowing same-sex marriage . Despite that, Richardson says he respects her position while 'strongly disagreeing' with it. In his article, he admits that he will probably lose friends now that he has come out, and may be viewed as a 'liability' by conservative clients, but says the sacrifice will be worth it if he converts even one person to his way of thinking. As well as working as a spokesman for high-profile Presidential candidates, Richardson has also written opinion pieces for various newspapers and websites. He now works as the vice president of Hynes Communications after considering a White House bid of his own, and attends an evangelical church.","James Richardson has worked with several senior GOP candidates .

"By . Pete D'amato for MailOnline . One more casualty of the VA hospital system. Edward Laird, a 76-year-old Navy veteran, was kept waiting at the Phoenix VA hospital for a biopsy to determine whether a blemish on his nose was cancerous. Two and a half years later, the cancer had progressed so far that 70% of his nose needed to be removed, Laird told CNN. Scroll down for video . Neglected: Edward Laird, 76, was repeatedly denied a biopsy at the dermatology clinic of the VA hospital and his nose was taken over by cancer . Laird first learned he might have a problem when his physician at the Phoenix VA hospital referred for a biopsy at the VA dermatology clinic. At the clinic, the biopsy was repeatedly delayed. The cancer spread through much of the nose, requiring immediate surgery. The reconstructive surgery left Laird using a popsicle stick to prop open his left nostril. The Phoenix VA where Laird went for treatment was at the center of a scandal in April after CNN connected the deaths of 40 veterans to hidden waiting lists. Dr. Sam Foote, a former VA doctor, blew the whistle on the facility for keeping two waiting lists, one with the actual list of patients awaiting care, the other with patients ready to receive care in the next 14 days. Foote says the dummy lists were sent to Washington to create the illusion that the hospital saw patients within an acceptable waiting time, which is normally considered 14 to 30 days. An investigation of the delays by the Department of Veteran Affairs' Office of Inspector General blasted 'clinically significant delays' for dozens of veterans but did not conclude the delays led to any deaths. Laird says he relies on VA care since his only other insurance option now is Medicare Part A, which does not cover outpatient care. Laird says that in spite of the lines, he feels proud to go to the VA hospital if it means standing among fellow veterans. 'When you go, there you feel like you're walking along with a bunch of champions,' Laird said. 'It'll jerk a tear from you sometimes.'","Edward Laird, 76, uses a popsicle stick to prop open his left nostril after reconstructive surgery .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A working mother is today fighting cervical cancer after ignoring smear tests, because she was 'too busy' juggling her job as a lawyer and life at home. Jenny Croston, from Leeds, is receiving treatment for stage two - where stage four is the most severe - cervical cancer after doctors detected a tumour the size of a satsuma. The 38-year-old has today urged other women not to ignore their smear tests, after admitting she struggled to find the time to attend her appointment. With two sons, Tom, five and George, two, as well as a part-time job as a medical lawyer, Mrs Croston said she forgot to rebook her test. Scroll down for video . Jenny Croston, mother to George, left and Tom, right, was diagnosed with cervical cancer this summer after missing her routine smear test because she was 'too busy' juggling being a working mother . The 38-year-old went to see her GP at the behest of her husband Andy, left, after noticing bleeding after sex. She told MailOnline: 'Not going for a smear is my biggest regret' Now she has to wait until the end of December to find out if her treatment has worked. She told MailOnline: 'Not going for a smear is my biggest regret. 'My time outside work was hugely precious and not something to 'waste' on things like visiting the doctor, particularly when I was feeling well. 'Although the firm I worked for would have had no issue with me taking time from work to attend a GP appointment, I always had work that seemed to be a priority.' She urged other women to think before cancelling their smear tests, prioritising their health over their busy schedules. Mrs Croston eventually visited the doctor this summer on the advice of her dentist husband, Andy, after noticing bleeding following sex. Medics referred her to hospital and within three weeks she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer which had spread to connective tissues. Mrs Croston is now undergoing chemo-radiation and brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy) because the tumour cannot be safely removed through surgery. Doctors have told her she has a 60 per cent survival rate over the next five years. 'Being given a four in 10 chance when you've got two young children is devastating,' Mrs Croston, who studied at university in Leeds, said. 'I think my chance of survival would've been much higher if I'd had smears earlier. 'But when you're a mum with young children, unless there is something seriously wrong with you then you don't focus on yourself. 'I've always been quite healthy so there's an element of thinking cancer would never happen to me. I presumed a smear would be a waste of time, as in my mind it would certainly come back as negative. After visiting her GP, Mrs Croston was referred to hospital and within three weeks tests revealed she had a tumour the size of a satsuma on her cervix . 'Now I might not see my children grow up. I'm frightened. 'I won't know if the treatment has worked until Christmas.' Mrs Croston told how her last routine smear, which came back normal, took place in 2008 before having her son Tom. In March 2013, she received the usual reminder from her GP inviting her to make an appointment for another. Mrs Croston did schedule a date with her doctor but subsequently cancelled it because of childcare arrangements. 'I remember thinking I needed to rebook a smear, but I just didn't get round to it,' she told MailOnline. 'Mid 2013 I started noticing what I now know to be symptoms but didn't think anything of them at the time. 'I'd had a very watery discharge which I put down to post birth changes. 'On a couple of occasions I had bleeding after sex but again didn't think an awful lot about it. 'However, one weekend where there was a lot of blood my husband encouraged me to go to my GP. 'The following day I felt my cervix and immediately thought it felt peculiar. 'I went on Google and searched 'mass on cervix'. At that point I hadn't even considered cancer but the first thing that appeared in the search results was cervical cancer. 'I read the symptoms associated with it and realised I had all of them. The following day I went straight to my GP. 'On examining me, there was a lot of blood but the GP did try and put my mind at rest by stating that it was probably something benign.' Mrs Croston is now undergoing chemo-radiation and brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy) because the tumour cannot be safely removed through surgery. She has urged other women to make sure they make the time to have routine smear tests, adding: 'If I had a smear test early last year things would have been different' A week later, Mrs Croston attended the colposcopy clinic, and two weeks after that she received her diagnosis. 'I was very matter-of-fact at first,' she said. 'I thought I was dealing with it well. But about a fortnight later I lost it. I worried I wasn't going to be here. 'I picked myself up and decided I have to get through it. The treatment was very intense and now it's coming to an end. 'I'm likely to suffer the menopause early and suffer permanent changes to my bladder and bowel. 'I've always been fit. Now I won't necessarily be able to play with the boys like I used to. 'Looking back I think I was foolish for putting off a smear. If I had  a smear early last year things would have been different. 'I initially put it off because I was busy. I thought, ""I'm never going to be diagnosed with cancer"". 'But if you don't go when prompted it's easy to put off. Bleeding after sex is a red flag for cervical cancer. 'I think if employers shone a spotlight on cervical cancer prevention like they do, for example, eye tests and well woman programmes then I absolutely think I would have made it more of a priority.' Mrs Croston has spoken out to encourage other women to make time for smears. She is supporting Time to Test – a cervical cancer awareness campaign set up by GSK and supported by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. Time to Test calls on businesses to show their commitment to female employees having the flexibility to attend cervical screening during working hours if they are not able to get an appointment in their own time. Ten businesses and professional organisations have already signed up to take the Time to Test pledge including global beauty brand Bare Escentuals (bareMinerals) and IHG – Intercontinental Hotels Group. Around 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in the UK and the disease causes around 970 deaths annually. Cervical screening aims to pick up and treat abnormal cells before they develop into cervical cancer and is estimated to save around 5,000 lives a year. Statistics have shown that, apart from an increase in 2009, the uptake of cervical screening has either fallen or remained unchanged for the past decade. Around one in five women do not attend screening when invited and many delay it for more than a year. More than a quarter (26 per cent) of women would be encouraged to attend if their company was more flexible and they did not have to take holiday for an appointment. It is estimated that early detection and treatment through cervical screening can prevent up to 75 per cent of cervical cancers from developing in the UK. Not going for cervical screening is one of the biggest risk factors for developing cervical cancer. Recent surveys by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust reveal that only 16 per cent of women recognise non-attendance of cervical screening as a risk factor [for cervical health problems] and that on average young women delay screening for 15 months while 60-64 year olds delay for an average of 33 months. Furthermore one in 10 said they had not attended a screening for over 10 years. Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said: 'The number of women delaying or ignoring their cervical screening invitation is now on the rise and worryingly cervical cancer incidence is also rising. 'We know from our research that a barrier to attendance can be being able to take time off work and so it's crucial that employers ensure their female staff are given time to attend what is a simple five minute test that could potentially save their lives. 'We're delighted that so many companies have already shown their commitment to cervical cancer prevention and hope that many more follow suit.'","Jenny Croston is receiving treatment for stage 2 cervical cancer .

"By . Mark Prigg . The giants of the technology world have revealed just how often they hand over information to the government on their users - and it runs into the tens of thousands. Freed by a recent legal deal with government lawyers, the major technology firms revealed for the first time how often they are ordered to turn over customer information for secret national security investigations. The publications disclosed by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, LinkedIn and Tumblr provided expanded details and some vented criticism about the government's handling of customers' Internet data in counter-terrorism and other intelligence-related probes. Freed by a recent legal deal with government lawyers, major technology firms released new data on how often they are ordered to turn over customer information for secret national security investigations . The figures from 2012 and 2013 showed that companies, such as Google and Microsoft, were compelled by the government to provide information on as many as 10,000 customer accounts in a six-month period. Yahoo complied with government requests for information on more than 40,000 accounts in the same period. The companies earlier provided limited information about government requests for data, but a new agreement reached last week with the Obama administration allowed the firms to provide a broadened, though still circumscribed, set of figures to the public. Seeking to reassure customers and business partners alarmed by revelations about the government's massive collection of Internet and computer data, the firms stressed details indicating that only small numbers of their customers were targeted by authorities. Still, even those small numbers showed that thousands of Americans were affected by the government requests approved by judges of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The data releases by the five major tech firms offered a mix of dispassionate graphics, reassurances and protests, seeking to alleviate customer concerns about government spying while pressuring national security officials about the companies' constitutional concerns. The shifting tone in the releases showed the precarious course that major tech firms have had to navigate in recent months, caught between their public commitments to Internet freedom and their enforced roles as data providers to U.S. spy agencies. In a company blog post, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith scolded the U.S. and allied governments for failing to renounce the reported mass interception of Internet data carried by communications cables. Google is one of the firms to reveal the number of FISA request it receives . The new figures were released just a week after major tech firms announced a legal agreement with the Justice Department. The companies can only reveal how many total requests they receive every six months, with the numbers in groupings of 1,000. And even those general numbers must be concealed for at least six months after any reporting period ends. That restriction means the FISA requests for the final half of last year can't be shared until July, at the earliest. Top lawyers and executives for major tech firms had previously raised alarms about media reports describing that hacking by U.S. and UK spy agencies and cited them during conversations with U.S. officials during President Barack Obama's internal review of planned changes to the government's spying operations. 'Despite the president's reform efforts and our ability to publish more information, there has not yet been any public commitment by either the U.S. or other governments to renounce the attempted hacking of Internet companies,' Smith said in a Microsoft blog release. Smith added that Microsoft planned to press the government 'for more on this point, in collaboration with others across our industry.' The new figures were released just a week after major tech firms announced a legal agreement with the Justice Department. But lawyers and executive for the companies openly vented their discomfort with the government's continuing insistence that they could only provide broad ranges instead of the actual numbers of government requests. The companies said they would press for narrower data ranges that would offer more details. 'We will also continue to advocate for still narrower disclosure ranges, which will provide a more accurate picture of the number of national security-related requests,' said Erika Rottenberg, LinkedIn's general counsel. A spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the companies' releases and comments. The spokesman pointed to a late January statement by DNI James Clapper and Attorney General Eric Holder that said the agreement would allow the firms to 'disclose more information than ever before to their customers.' Google and all the other companies denied that they gave any government unfettered access to their users' info. The companies are worried more people will reduce their online activities if they believe almost everything they do is being monitored by the government. A decline in Web surfing could hurt the companies financially by giving them fewer opportunities to show online ads and sell other services. Yahoo listed the highest number of people swept up in FISA requests for online content during the first half of last year. The orders seeking user content spanned 30,000 to 30,999 accounts, according to the company.The requested content could have included emails, instant messages, address books, calendar items and pictures.

And even those general numbers must be concealed for at least six months after any reporting period ends. That restriction means the FISA requests for the final half of last year can't be shared until July, at the earliest.The data coming out Monday indicated the U.S. government is digging deeper into the Internet as people spend more time online.Most of the companies showed the number of government requests fell between 0 and 999 for each six-month period. But the numbers of customers affected by those searches ranged more widely.Google, for instance, has seen the number of people affected by FISA court orders rise from 2,000 to 2,999 users during the first half of 2009 to between 9,000 and 9,999 users during the first half of last year. The company showed an unusual spike in the number of Americans whose data was collected between July and December 2012. During that period, metadata was collected from between 12,000 and 12,999 users. Under the restrictions imposed by the government, no explanation was provided for that anomaly.

The orders seeking user content spanned 30,000 to 30,999 accounts, according to the company. The requested content could have included emails, instant messages, address books, calendar items and pictures. All the companies also received FISA requests that weren't aimed at scooping up online communications or photos. Those demands sought things such as billing information and locations of where people made an Internet connection. Google described Monday's disclosure as a positive step while promising to keep fighting for the right to provide more precise numbers about the FISA requests and more specifics about the data being sought. 'We still believe more transparency is needed so everyone can better understand how surveillance laws work and decide whether or not they serve the public interest,' Richard Salgado, Google's legal director of law enforcement and information security, wrote in a blog post. Even if the companies can share more information about the FISA requests, they still might face doubts raised by other National Security Agency documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden asserting that U.S. government has found ways to tap into the lines transmitting personal information between data centers. The companies are trying to thwart the hacking by encrypting most, if not all the data, stored on their computers. 'The limited information that can be gleaned from the reports suggests that the government is using its spying powers extremely broadly, likely infringing on the privacy rights of many innocent Americans,' said Alex Abdo, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. Meanwhile, a conservative lawyer who has challenged the constitutionality of the NSA's daily collection of phone data said he had filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and review his case. Attorney Larry Klayman said he had mailed a petition to the top court asking it to intervene in the case, which is already under appeal. Judge Richard Leon, the presiding U.S. district judge in the case, ruled last December that the NSA program had constitutional flaws. Leon has held off shutting the program down pending court appeals.","Recent legal ruling allowed the information to be revealed for the first time .

"By . Sara Nathan . Katie Holmes is on the hunt to buy a new apartment in New York City - as she continues her new life as a single mom to daughter Suri. The stunning actress, 34, who is currently on a sunshine break with Suri at Disney World in Orlando, secretly rented a two-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea Mercantile building weeks before filing for divorce from Tom Cruise last June. With the end of the lease looming, Katie has started planning a move from the $12,500-a-month apartment she and six-year-old Suri have made home - and is looking to buy her own lofty apartment in Manhattan, MailOnline has learned. 'Come on Mum!': Suri Cruise seemed very excited about being at Disney World on Sunday with her mother Katie Holmes . Happy: Katie Holmes, seen here in Manhattan earlier this month, has made a new life for herself and daughter Suri since her split from Tom Cruise. The dark-haired actress recently mounted a comeback by starring in Broadway play Dead Accounts, but the play closed ahead of schedule. However, Katie loves the city and the security it has given both her and Suri since her divorce from Hollywood star Cruise, and sources say she wants to put down firm roots by buying her own property - as the actress also admitted that she would like more children. Cruise, 50, owned a $15 million brownstone in Manhattan, but Katie moved into her own place following their split. Her divorce settlement is believed to have barely left a dent in Cruise's estimated $250 million fortune. Moving out? Katie Holmes is believed to be house hunting in Manhattan as the lease for her apartment in the Chelsea Mercantile building comes to an end. Allegedly, she did not receive a lump sum payout, which was consistent with her pre-nuptial agreement with Cruise. Although she does not receive spousal support, she does get money in child support for Suri. According to the settlement, Cruise will pay Katie $400,000 a year in child support, totaling approximately $33,000 per month. At the time of their divorce, which was finalised in August - just weeks after Katie stunned Cruise by serving him with divorce papers - TMZ reported that Cruise must pay support for Suri for the next 12 years, until she turns 18. In total, it comes to around $4.8 million. Cruise will also pay Suri’s expenses, including her schooling and extracurricular costs. One stipulation in their settlement is that Suri will not attend a “residential school,” which means she won’t be sent to a Scientology boarding school. Suri is now happily at school at the private Avenues school in New York City. Earlier this month, Katie told Allure magazine that although there's no man currently in her life, she would like to expand her family, adding: 'I don’t know. I’m open to it.' Though she doesn’t talk directly about her divorce, she admitted, “A lot of people have gone through a lot of stuff,' as she said she’s hoping for a more “peaceful year for a lot of the people in the world.” “When you look back on the last year, there were a lot of tragedies — Hurricane Sandy, the Connecticut shooting. I … I just hope it’s a good year for everyone,” she said. Katie also played coy about rumors that she may be going to law school. Well, my brother and father are attorneys, and — we’ll see. I like the practical thinking of attorneys,” she told the magazine. Following Katie's move into the Mercantile, broker Ryan Serhant said the new tenant had ramped up attention from buyers. He said: 'We went from showing once or twice a week to five showings today, four on Thursday and seven on Friday so far.' Inspiration? Belle from Beauty And The Beast famously wears a yellow dress not too dissimilar to Suri's .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . North Korean test fired three short range missiles into the sea in advance of a major public holiday on both sides of the border. South Korean defence officials confirmed that the weapons flew for 130 miles before landing in the water. The unnamed defence official was unable to confirm the exact type of missile used by the North Korean military. Scroll down for video . A South Korean solider looks out over no-man's land which is littered with millions of land mines and wire . North Korea test-fired three unidentified missiles sending the projectiles into the sea on Friday . North Korea routinely test-fires missiles and rockets, but it has conducted an unusually large number of weapons tests this year, including the launch of a short-range projectile on Monday. Pyongyang has expressed anger over US-South Korean military drills and various policy initiative from the Seoul government. North Korea claims that the military exercises are a prelude to war . The launch came as the Korean Peninsula begins celebrating a major holiday, similar to Thanksgiving in the United States. The three-day holiday starts Monday, but many people were already traveling to visit family over the weekend. Separately, on Friday, North Korea said it would send back a South Korean man who entered the North illegally, in an apparent conciliatory gesture. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Kim Sang-geun entered North Korea through a third country after having unspecified difficulties living in the South. It said Kim asked to live in North Korea and bring his family members from the South but the country decided to repatriate him next Thursday. Both North and South Korea celebrate a major national holiday this weekend, similar to Thanksgiving in the US . On the southern side of the border, visitors leave ribbons and medallions calling for the reunification of Korea . Dictator Kim Jong Un, pictured right,  has accused South Korea and the US of wanting to invade North Korea . South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement it has informed North Korea that it will take custody of Kim. About 27,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea to avoid poverty and political suppression since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but South Koreans defecting to North Korea are uncommon. Kim's repatriation suggests that impoverished North Korea is still interested in improving ties with South Korea, said Chang Yong Seok, a senior researcher at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies. In the past North Korea has been accused of using foreigners who crossed its borders as a propaganda tool by bringing false espionage and other charges against them. North Korea is sending its athletes to the Asian Games being held in South Korea later this month. And in recent months North Korea has proposed a set of measures it says would reduce tension, but South Korea has rebuffed the overture, arguing that North Korea must first take steps toward nuclear disarmament. Outside analysts say the North is pushing for better ties with South Korea to help attract foreign investment and aid to revive its economy. In May, North Korea sentenced a South Korean Baptist missionary to hard labor for life for allegedly spying and trying to set up underground churches. Three Americans are also being detained in North Korea for alleged hostile acts and other charges.","North Korea test fired three missles which landed 130 miles off the coast .

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Spargo for MailOnline . The deadly albino cobra that was captured yesterday after slithering around a California neighborhood for days could have given a potentially deadly bite, this according to a snake expert. 'There's no indication that it's had its venom glands removed,' said Ian Recchio, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the Los Angeles Zoo, of the snake, caught in Thousand Oaks, California. The venom of the albino monocled cobra can kill a human within hours of a bite. Scroll down for video . Caught: This albino cobra was caught Thursday afternoon in Thousand Oaks, California . The snake, about 3 feet long, was captured after being on the move since Monday. Reports that it had bitten a dog that evening raised concerns, and authorities warned people to watch their children and keep their pets indoors. A veterinarian later said it appeared the dog was simply injured while trying to get away from the snake. Deadly: With intact venom glands, the bite of this cobra can kill a human within hours . Animal control officers found the snake hiding in a lumber pile in the backyard of a house, and snared it using a long hook before packing it into a box. The snake  was transferred Friday to the San Diego Zoo, which has a supply of antivenom for Asian cobras. A monocled cobra gets its name from the ring-like mark on the back of its hood, but the cobra found in California lacked the mark because it is nearly pure white. The blue-eyed snake lacks pigment, a condition known as leucism, Recchio said. The snake probably was raised in captivity because its color would make it an easy dinner for predators in the wild, Recchio said. Recchio also said the snake appears to be healthy, and probably chowed down on rats and mice while it was loose. 'It looks pretty fat,' he said. Trapped: Officers found the snake in a wood pile . The zoo didn't try to determine its sex. 'We don't have the antivenom here so putting your hands on it wouldn't be in the cards,' he explained. Cobras are illegal in California without a permit to keep one for scientific or educational purposes. Authorities are searching for the owner. There is a thriving black-market trade around the world in dangerous and exotic wildlife, but Recchio said he couldn't understand the motivation of the owner. 'I can't get into the person's head who would put their neighbors and their family at risk,' he said.","The albino monocled cobra was captured in Thousand Oaks, California after four days on the move .

"By . Reuters . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . Friends and fellow tennis players Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki will play against one another on Sunday in the U.S. Open's women's final. 'She's a good friend of mine,' said former world number one Wozniacki, who has never won a Grand Slam title. 'We were saying when the tournament started, 'We're in separate sides of the drawing, so hopefully we can meet in the finals. It would be great if that were to happen.' Williams said she had the same thought when the draw was made. 'She obviously wants to win and go for her first grand slam, and I want to win and try to make a little history,' said Williams, who wants to end a disappointing grand slam season on a happy note by claiming her 18th slam singles to tie Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for fourth on the all-time list. Scroll down for video . In it to win it: Caroline Wozniacki won her match against Peng Shuai, who broke down in scary distress due to heat illness and retired in the second set, while trailing 7-6(1) 4-3 . Go for it! Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark is set to play in the women's final for the US Open against her good friend Serena Williams . In June, the two women were seen hanging out together in South Beach - as part of the same trip in which Williams crashed a beach-side wedding. They also seemed to be close after Wozniacki's fiance Rory McIroy called off the couple's engagement this spring. 'It's a hard time for me right now,' Wozniacki tweeted in May. 'Thanks for all the sweet messages!Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I'll never walk alone.' In reply, Williams wrote 'I'll always walk with you,' including face and footprint emojis, along with the hashtag '#friendsforever.' Wozniacki told The Guardian in June 'She's always been there for me whenever I've needed her. 'It's great that you have such an amazing competitor … after everything that she's achieved in her professional career, that she finds time. She wants to help out a friend who needs it sometimes.' On Friday, top-seeded world number one Williams beat Russian left-hander Ekaterina Makarova 6-1 6-3, who is the 17th-seeded player. Wozniacki advanced when China's Peng Shuai broke down in scary distress due to heat illness and retired in the second set, while trailing 7-6(1) 4-3. The opening semi-final produced some scary moments as China's Peng fell victim to the severe conditions during an energy-draining, groundstroke battle with Wozniacki. The match was still very much in doubt with Wozniacki serving at 4-3 and facing break point when the unseeded Peng suddenly grabbed her thighs and stumbled to the back wall of the center court with what appeared to be severe cramping. In obvious distress, the 28-year-old doubles specialist was eventually helped off the court to be evaluated by doctors. A valiant Peng, playing her first career grand slam singles semi-final, refused to quit and returned in 11 minutes after a medical examination. Six points later, Peng curled up in agony on the baseline, and officials called the match and Peng was lifted into a wheelchair and taken from the court to a standing ovation after the abbreviated two hour four minute battle. Tough fighter: Top-seeded world number one Williams overpowered Russian left-hander Ekaterina Makarova 6-1 6-3 . Victory: Serena Williams is all smiles after her win Friday . 'The doctor, she said to me, ""You are not able really go out to fight, compete, because look is not really well,""' Peng said about the medical evaluation when she met reporters after two hours of treatment. 'I said, ""No, no, no, I don't want to give up. I want to try one more time,""' added Peng. '""And then I come back.""' Williams, the two-times defending champion, came on the center court next and seemed determined to spend as little time as possible in the heat and succeeded, trouncing Makarova in 60 minutes. The American blasted 24 winners, including five aces. Makarova hit six. 'I'm just really excited to be in the final. In the beginning of the week I definitely wasn't sure I would make it this long. So I'm just elated,' said Williams, who failed to reach the quarters in any of the year's previous three slams. Vacation pals: Williams and Wozniacki holidayed in June together this summer, posing for photographers . Makarova, playing in her first slam singles semi-final, praised the victor. 'Serena, she's a great, unbelievable player. Today she was so aggressive.' Friendship will be set aside in Sunday's final between the players who earlier this year spent a beach holiday together in Miami with some serious chips on the line. 'I'm in the finals, which is obviously great,' said Wozniacki, who lost the 2009 final to Kim Clijsters. 'It's been five years for me since my last one here, so I'm extremely happy to be back. 'I would love to win it and have a grand slam under my belt. It would definitely have the media stop talking about my lack of a grand slam, so that would be nice. 'The friendship, while we are on court, is put aside. We are both competitors,' added the Dane. 'After the match, one of us is going to congratulate the other and we're going to be friends again. Williams was in agreement. 'Regardless, I'm going to be happy with the outcome,' she said.","Tennis players Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki are going to play against one another in the women's final at the US Open .

The 69-year-old actress, who won an Oscar for her portrayal in The Queen (2006), said she was disappointed not to be among those targeted because 'you weren't anybody if your phone hadn't been hacked'. Her comments come after nude images of up to 101 famous faces including Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence, model Cara Delevingne and former Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay were circulated on the internet. Scroll down for video . Actress Dame Helen Mirren, who won an Oscar for her portrayal in The Queen, said she was 'insulted' not be among those to have nude pictures stolen because 'you weren't anybody if your phone hadn't been hacked' In an interview with Magic FM, to be broadcast tomorrow, Dame Helen said: 'I was rather insulted my phone wasn't hacked, actually. 'I kept desperately looking at the list of people whose phones were hacked, hoping to see my name. 'Who on earth would put nude photos of themselves on their phone anyway? That I don't quite get.' However, she also described the hacking as 'infantile' and 'offensive', saying: 'It's insulting and stupid to hack phones. 'The best thing is to be superior and not take it too seriously.' Her comments come after she questioned earlier in the week whether privacy was something of the past for A-list celebrities. The 69-year-old (pictured in Love Ranch in 2010) described the hacking of celebrities' photos as 'offensive', saying: 'It's insulting and stupid to hack phones. The best thing is to be superior and not take it too seriously' As she walked the red carpet at the premiere of upcoming movie, The Hundred-Foot Journey, at the Curzon Mayfair in London on Wednesday, she said: 'I think privacy is almost a thing of the past, isn't it? It's been a thing of the past for a while.' She later added: 'I think we're all in a learning curve about what is appropriate to put on your phone and what isn't and I think people will be far more careful in the future. 'And also I think the protections will get stronger, I presume.' It comes after Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz, who is currently promoting a new film about a homemade sex tape going public, described the leak of explicit images as 'a major violation'. The 42-year-old said members of the public should consider how they would feel if they had been targeted and said: 'If these guys can do it to this group of people then everyone's vulnerable to it.' Compromising images of dozens of celebrities emerged online last Sunday after hackers gained access to their iCloud accounts and stole their pictures. Dame Helen appeared alongside Sergio Peris-Mencheta (above) in Hollywood drama Love Ranch in 2010 . The actress, who went nude in 1969 for her role in Age of Consent (above), was not targeted by the hackers . Apple said it was 'outraged' by the attacks, and said they were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. In a statement, the technology giant said: 'When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilised Apple's engineers to discover the source. Our customers' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. 'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet. 'None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple's systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone. Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Cara Delevingne were among those who had photos stolen . Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz, 42, (above) described the leak of explicit images as 'a major violation' 'We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.' Apple has now advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said it was 'aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high-profile individuals, and is addressing the matter'. Other stars said to have been affected include Avril Lavigne, Cat Deeley and Rihanna, with actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose movies include A Good Day To Die Hard, already acknowledging pictures in which she is featured are genuine.","Dame Helen Mirren spoke out after 101 celebrities were targeted by hackers .

"By . Chris Pleasance . In March 2011 the world watched in horror as a powerful earthquake rocked Japan, before a deadly tsunami swept ashore, washing away any boats, cars, homes and people unfortunate enough to be in its path. But while the initial reports of 19,000 dead shocked viewers around the globe, that news would soon be superseded by the terrors to come from the then-unknown town of Fukushima as its nuclear power plant was overcome by floodwater before going into meltdown. Now, nearly three years on from the natural disaster, a very unnatural catastrophe is still unfolding in the central prefecture while the villagers who used to live around the plant are still suffering. Scroll down for video . Fallout: There is still a 12-mile exclusion zone in place around Fukushima which contains hundreds of bags of radioactive soil which cannot be removed due to opposition from those outside . No way back: Some 22,000 former residents of Namie (pictured) are being allowed back to their homes, but can only go once a month and cannot stay overnight . Cleanup: In December Tepco, the company which owns the Fukushima plant, announced it had reached a state of 'cold shutdown' allowing a cleanup operation to begin . In total 80,000 people were evacuated because of the disaster as a 12-mile 'no go zone' was put in place around the stricken facility. Tepco, the owner of the plant and Japan's largest power company, insist that the situation is under control and announced in December that the plant is now in a state of 'cold shutdown' allowing a cleanup operation to start. As a result of that operation exclusion zone lines may be redrawn, allowing some former residents of the towns around Fukushima to go home. In the town of Namie more than 20,000 former residents are allowed to visit their homes once a month with special permissions but are not allowed to stay overnight. In the town of Futaba residents were once so proud of their nuclear plant that they erected a sign . across the promenade saying the technology made them prosperous. Now . their town lies in ruins. These temporary housing structures were erected for workers at J-Village, a soccer training complex now serving as an operation base for those battling Japan's nuclear disaster . Long process: The clean-up involves moving 400-tonnes of uranium and is expected to take a year. Only after this is completed can areas such as this hospital - pictured with wheelchairs outside - be repopulated . Contaminated: After the cleanup exclusion zone lines will be redrawn allowing some people to move home, however others may need to wait five years to find out if they can go back . But they are the lucky ones. Some other residents may have to wait five years before they will know if their . houses are safe, others may have to wait a decade, and a few many never . be allowed to return. The Tepco cleanup operation involves moving 400 tonnes of uranium from a storage tank inside reactor number four of the plant to a safer location. It is expected to take a year, and is an extremely delicate process as the highly volatile fuel is prone to reigniting. While the work has proceeded without incident so far, past leaks of contaminated water, an initial attempt to downplay the disaster, and continuing secrecy about the site have lead many to be wary of Tepco's handling of the many problems to come from the catastrophe. Destroyed: It has been nearly three years since tsunami waves swept these defences aside and flooded the Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing a meltdown . Unstoppable: The devastating wave was caused by a 9.0 earthquake, the most powerful ever to strike Japan, and killed nearly 19,000 people as it swept ashore . Pride: Decades ago, the citizens of Japan's Futaba town took such pride in hosting part of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex that they built a sign over a promenade proclaiming that atomic power made their town prosperous . For example, within the exclusion zone hundreds of bags filled with radioactive soil lie piled up next to road and fields because opposition from those outside the zone means there is nowhere to move them to. Across the other side of the Pacific Ocean, the US state of California is also concerned about the effect of the disaster as water contaminated with radiation is expected to start washing up soon. The exact amount is unknown, and Tepco say there is no way to accurately measure how much has leaked away. Even after the nuclear cleanup has finished, it will be just the beginning for anyone who decides to move back, as the devastation caused by the tsunami has still not been repaired after people fled. Abandoned: Tomioka town is another which falls inside the exclusion zone, put in place to try and contain the world's worst atomic crisis in 25 years . Devastated: Once the nuclear clean-up has finished, it will be just the beginning for former residents of towns like Tomioka, who must then repair their homes .","Nearly three years after the tsunami which caused a nuclear meltdown at Fukushima the fallout continues .
In December the power plant was said to be in a state of 'cold shutdown' meaning the cleanup can begin .
Now 400 tonnes of uranium rods must be moved out of damaged reactor four to a safer location .
After that is done some people evacuated from the 12-mile exclusion zone may be allowed to return home for good .
In the meantime residents of some of the less exposed towns are allowed home once a month, but cannot stay long ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A scientist has become the talk of the town at a popular tech conference this week as he unveiled his own 'invisible cloak' technology that's straight out of a Harry Potter novel. The cloak is the work of Dr Baile Zhang, who says he developed the cloak more as a fun hobby than a serious physics breakthrough. Dr Zhang showed off his invention, the 'macroscopic invisibility cloak at the prestigious TED2013 conference in Long Beach, California on Monday. Scroll down for video . Now you see it...: The box was made by attaching two pieces of calcite - a common mineral that can bend light . Now you don't: The rolled-up Post-It note in this video cannot be seen as it passes behind the box in this demonstration posted on YouTube . Though Dr Zhang's device is more of a box than a cloak, the purpose is just the same - bending light around an object so that it cannot be seen. He told BoingBoing that the came up with the idea in 2010, and constructed the device 'just for fun.' In a video posted to YouTube, Dr Zhang demonstrates it by passing a rolled-up Post-It note by the box. Scientist: The 'cloak' is the work of Singapore physics professor Baile Zhang, who showed it off at the TED2013 conference on Monday . Whenever the note is behind the cloak, it cannot be seen. The demonstration in the video is not the same as the one presented at TED2013. Dr Zhang told the tech blog that he developed the box by attaching two pieces of calcite - a carbonate mineral that can bend light - together. BoingBoing's Carla Sinclair, who spoke to Dr Zhang on Monday, writes: 'The idea came to him in 2010, and today was the first time he's shown it to a live audience.' Dr Zhang, 31, is currently an assistant professor of physics and applied physics at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Last year, Dr Zhang was listed in the MIT Technology Review's '35 Innovators Under 35' list. Dr Zhang's device is not the first invisibility cloak - which was made famous in the Harry Potter book and film series. Other designs are being worked on in places like London's Imperial College, Duke University and University of Texas. Dr Zhang is not the only innovator at TED2013. Sugata Mitra was awarded the conference's $1million prize for his 'Hole in the Wall Experiment,' his vision for the future of education where students teach themselves. Life imitating art: The technology was made famous by Harry Potter - but now researchers at various colleges have been working on their own versions .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A Satanist nurse who posted pictures of herself next to dead and dying pensioners at the care home where she worked has been fined £800 by a Swiss court. Blaze Binder published the photos next to messages saying she was the 'soul thief' and 'Hail Satan'. She asked her 2,000 friends on Facebook, where she goes by the name Ghostinthedark Satania Blaze, to guess if the pensioners were dead or alive. Sickening: Satanist nurse Blaze Binder smiles next to a dying pensioner at the Swiss care home where she worked in an image which she then posted on Facebook . After the day job: Binder also advertises her services as a dominatrix on her Facebook page, describing herself as the 'queen of pleasures' The Filipino-born 37-year-old, branded the devil nurse by local media, also posed in a nurse's uniform outside an ambulance and in other images as a latex-clad dominatrix. Binder, who is married to a Swiss man, had been working at the care home in Mogelsberg when she took the pictures, but only published them after the facility closed. In one comment, she wrote: 'Gonna send them to Hell where some belong, the rest in the compost pit for fertilizers - hehehe'. In response to a comment suggesting the posting was improper, the woman wrote: 'I can put anything I want in my Facebook (page) it's mine. 'People who doesn't want what I post they can juz up and die death is normal people die all the time!' Brought to justice: A court in St Gallen in Switzerland, around 85km from Zurich, found her guilty of 'violating the peace of the dead' and breach of trust . Twisted: When interviewed by daily newspaper Blick when the case was first revealed, the tattooed Binder called the pictures 'beautiful pictures' and said death was part of everyday life at the nursing home . The Swiss Association of Nurses said it was 'shocked and upset' by the pictures. A court in St Gallen in Switzerland, around 85km from Zurich, found her guilty of 'violating the peace of the dead' and breach of trust. In addition to the £800 fine, the court issued a suspended fine equivalent to 120 days of pay. When she was interviewed by daily newspaper Blick when the case was first revealed, the tattooed employee called the photos 'beautiful pictures' and said death was part of everyday life at the nursing home. 'I do not understand that people are upset about the photos.' Perverse: Binder posing next to an ambulance (left) and (right) some of her whips and other dominatrix tools .

'I do not understand for the life of me how such a thing can happen in a retirement home.' Adding to the scandal were additional pictures on the internet of the Filipino as a 'dominatrix', her other profession. On her Facebook home page, she advertised her services in the Saint Gallen area as the 'queen of pleasures'. Other photos showed the whips and other 'tools' that the woman uses for her work.","Filipino-born Blaze Binder, 37, referred to herself as the 'soul thief'

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A good Samaritan has smashed a stranger's windshield to pull a baby boy from a sweltering hot car while his father shopped in a nearby supermarket. Angela Radtke, from San Antonio, Texas, saw the one-year-old child locked in a car in the parking lot of an H-E-B supermarket just off Interstate 10 on Saturday afternoon and raised the alarm. Despite being warned by passersby and security guards that she could be arrested for damaging the car, she smashed through the windshield with a tire iron, KENS5 reported. She then climbed inside the car to pull out the tot - slicing her arms, legs and back on broken glass in the process. Scroll down for video . Quick-thinking: Angela Radtke demonstrates how she smashed a car's windshield after seeing a one-year-old boy overheating inside. She said she broke the window even though she was told she might be arrested . 'I don't care if I get arrested, I'm going to save this baby,' Radtke told witnesses. When she pulled him out, she said the baby was running a temperature and looked red. Radtke, who was not charged because of Texas' 'good Samaritan' act, said she did not hesitate to help the young child. 'I felt like some people were kind of scared,' she told KENS5. 'They didn't want to be liable because the security guard was yelling that I could possibly be arrested for breaking the window.' Damage: An image shows the smashed window, which Radtke then climbed through to retrieve the boy. His father had been inside the supermarket for 40 minutes and told cops he had forgotten about his son .

"By . Phil Barnett, Press Association . Mo Farah already has one eye on next year's World Championships and the other on the 2016 Olympics as he looks to put his 'toughest year' behind him. A difficult 2014 has seen the Olympic superstar disappoint on his London Marathon debut before illness forced him out of the Commonwealth Games. He bounced back with double gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at the recent European Championships in Zurich to set himself up for a brighter 2015 centred around the Worlds in Beijing. Back on home soil: Mo Farah poses on the track ahead of the Sainsbury's Birmingham Grand Prix . 'It's been an up and down year but I'm back on top now,' said Farah. 'It's been very difficult, from the London Marathon, where I wanted to do better, to then getting ill and missing the Commonwealth Games. It's been a struggle but now I'm back. 'I learned a lot from the marathon and I'm not ready for that yet, but after Rio we'll try again but for now I'll concentrate on the track. 'It's been the toughest year of my career for sure, certainly the toughest I've had for many years. I hadn't been injured for many years and this season was tough. Stars of the show: Farah (right) sits alongside Ashleigh Nelson (left), Lynsey Sharp (centre) and Matthew Hudson-Smith at the Alexander Stadium . 'I'm already looking ahead to Beijing but in long distance running you can only take one year at a time, you can't look two years beyond. But yes, it's obviously there.' Much was made of the double Olympic champion missing the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer but he accepts the spotlight he is under. 'There's always pressure and as an athlete you put more pressure on yourself,' he said ahead of Sunday's Sainsbury's Birmingham Grand Prix. 'There's never going to be the level that there was at the London Olympics so you just get on with it.' Down the home straight: Farah approaches the finish line to win the 5,000m at the European Championships . After Beijing next year, Farah is desperate to match his achievements of 2012 at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and he admits that competition takes precedence in the long term. 'Rio is the most important thing,' he said. 'If you ask any athlete ""Olympics or Worlds?"" anybody would say Olympics. 'That's the big one. But at the same time you still have to go out there and deliver at the World Championships too.'

"By . Helen Collis . Charged: Tracey Lynn Garner pleaded not guilty Tuesday, June 18, 2013, to killing an Alabama woman by giving silicone injections as a buttocks enhancement . A 'fake' doctor in the U.S. has pleaded not guilty to a second murder charge for the death of a woman following buttock-enhancing injections. Tracey Lynn Garner, from Jackson, Mississippi, has been arrested and charged with one count of depraved heart murder of an Alabama woman, which means she had a callous disregard for the life of her victim. Garner, 53, formerly known as Mr Morris Garner, was arrested last Thursday and charged with the offense. If found guilty she could face a potential life sentence. The Mississippi state attorney general's office says Garner injected 'a silicone substance' into Marilyn Hale of Selma, Atlanta, on January 13, 2010, and Hale later died. It is the second murder charge Garner faces, relating to illegal butt implant injections, with no training or licence. In September last year, Garner was charged with the death of Karima Gordon, who travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Morris's Jackson, Mississippi home to receive the treatment. Ms Gordon, 37, died several days after the injection took place in late March 2011. At the time of the hearing, Garner, who worked as a floral and interior designer alongside her makeshift cosmetic business, was described as a cross-dressing man and had entered the court registered as a man. Tracey Lynn Garner, formerly known as Morris Garner, pictured in September at Hinds County courtroom in Jackson, Miss., during a bond hearing . Records show this week that Garner was in the Hinds County Detention Center on Monday.

"By . Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . A Philadelphia civil forfeiture law has reportedly allowed the government to take away citizens' homes - and much of it funds city prosecutors. CBS Philadelphia reported on the story, saying homeowners Christos Sourovelis, Norys Hernandez and Doris Welch have filed a lawsuit, which 'claims property owners do not get to go before a judge before their property is seized, which violates the due process clause of the constitution.' The home Sourovelis shares with his wife, Markela Sourovelis, was snatched 'because their son was caught selling $40 worth of drugs outside the house,' according to the affiliate station. Homeowners: Christos and Markela Sourovelis say their home was snatched after their son dealt drugs in front of their home - and that they've been struggling to find a judge hear their case . 'I didn’t do nothing wrong…I didn’t bother anybody, but still they came in and moved us out of our house,' Christos Sourovelis told CBS Philadelphia. 'I have rights and we are still fighting for our house - no owners of houses in Philadelphia deserve that.' Markela Sourovelis alleged to the affiliate station 'We keep getting sent to this 478 room and for months, we go there and fill out papers.' Their attorney Darpana Sheth told CBS Philadelphia 'Courtroom 478 is no courtroom at all. There’s no judge, there’s no jury, there’s not even a court reporter to transcribe these so-called hearings– instead it’s the prosecutors that run Courtroom 478.' '[The money from civil forfeiture] goes to pay salaries, including to prosecutors who wield an enormous amount of discretion to bring forfeiture claims,' Sheth also said. The city gets $6 million from civil forfeiture each year, she told CBS Philadelphia. Norys Hernandez stands with the Sourovelis at at a August 12 news conference . The Phildelphia Inquirer reported that the civil forfeiture law was meant to punish drug dealers, and that  'Philadelphia has brought in more than $64 million in seized property during the last decade.' 'Proceeds make up almost 20 percent of the annual budget of the District Attorney's Office. Forty percent pays for prosecutor salaries, including those of the lawyers involved in forfeiture proceedings,' the newspaper pointed out. The Sourovelis are inside the home again, but legally cannot keep their son there, The Inquirer reported. District Attorney Seth Williams' spokesperson, Tasha Jamerson, told the newspaper 'in all efforts, we follow applicable law to protect the rights of all of those involved - not only drug dealers... but the law-abiding citizens who are negatively affected by them.' The Sourovelis' lawyer has said Philadelphia receives $6 million each year through civil forfeiture .","A Philadelphia civil forfeiture law has reportedly allowed the government to take away citizens' homes and fund city prosecutors .

"By . David Mccormack . and Ruth Styles . A mother of two who lost her hands and feet and nearly her life after a silicone filler procedure went horribly wrong says she is a living example of what can happen when you put your life in the hands of rogue cosmetic surgery practitioners. Apryl Brown, from Los Angeles, was a successful hair stylist who owned her own salon, but had always wanted to fix what she saw as her ‘flaw’ – her flat bottom. Instead of a curvier behind, Apryl was left in agony and eventually had to undergo 27 surgeries to have her buttocks, legs and arms amputated after a black market practitioner injected her with industrial grade silicone of the sort commonly used in bathroom sealant. Scroll down for video . Apryl Brown, 47, lost her hands and feet and nearly her life after a silicone filler procedure went horribly wrong . Since recovering from the horrific ordeal the 47-year-old has devoted much of her time to speaking out and encouraging others to think twice about what they let someone inject in their bodies and seek out skilled professionals . Since recovering from the horrific ordeal the 47-year-old has devoted much of her time to speaking out and encouraging others to think twice about what they let someone inject in their bodies and seek out skilled professionals. ‘All I would ask them to do is, when you have that first thought, make sure they have a second thought about it and do a little research. And if they still want to do it, go for it,' she told CNN. 'They won’t be blindsided, saying, “Oh, my God, I had no idea that a simple procedure like that can leave me with no hands, no feet and no butt cheeks.'"" It is a growing problem, with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons warning that more and more people are putting their lives at risk by bypassing doctors just to save some money on basic medical procedures. In 2007 Apryl was rushed to hospital, where surgeons discovered that a massive infection caused by the impure silicone had caused her body to go into severe shock . ‘I think that’s awfully seductive to a person who doesn’t know there’s a problem,’ said Dr. Richard Glogau, a clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco. At 47, Apryl has had to learn to do everything all over again with prosthetics and has learned to live on her own with the help of an aide who comes in to help her for a few hours a day. In recent years she has even competed in the Pasadena Triathlon and while she doesn't want people's pity, she does want them to listen to her cautionary story. Her problems began in 2005 when a woman claiming she could provide buttock injections walked into her salon. Instead of telling her to leave, Apryl, who says she always wanted bigger buttocks, was thrilled and immediately agreed to have the treatment. At first, everything seemed fine but just months after having the injections, the pain began. At 47, Apryl has had to learn to do everything all over again with prosthetics and in recent years she has even competed in the Pasadena Triathlon . 'They [Apryl's buttocks] started to get hard, and then they started to get discoloured,' she explains. 'By 2006, it was starting to itch and by 2007, the pain started. 'One thing about pain is that you can't turn it off. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't even concentrate.' But things continued to get worse. ''I had gone to this party one Saturday night and woke up Sunday morning and thought ""oh my God, Apryl!"". I just couldn't pull myself together,' she remembers. 'That night was the roughest night of my life. I literally scratched all of the skin off my buttocks. My nails pulled all of the skin off my body. And when my sister came in, and she saw that, it freaked her out.' Apryl was rushed to hospital, where surgeons discovered that a massive infection caused by the impure silicone had caused her body to go into severe shock. 'The only end point on silicone injections is removal,' explains the doctor who saved Apryl's life, James Jens Black. Despite the heavy price she paid for cheap surgery, Apryl says that she's recovering and is determined to enjoy the rest of her life . Instead of a curvier behind, Apryl was left in agony and eventually had to undergo 27 surgeries to have her buttocks, legs and arms amputated . 'Removal when it's not infected or removal when it is infected and about to kill you.' After a month in a coma, Apryl awoke to a very different world. The drugs that saved Apryl's life had diverted blood flow to her essential organs, keeping her heart beating and liver functioning as her body fought off the infection. But her hands and feet, starved of oxygen while the drugs did their work, had died. 'I just moved the cover and I saw my right foot and I thought ""oh my God"" and it was that moment, that's when it got real,' remembers Apryl. 'They were just black and swollen and necrotic and there was gangrene, and one [of Apryl's family members] said: ""just look at your hands"" and I looked and that's when it got really real. Along with her buttocks, too damaged and infected from the injections to remain, her hands and feet had to be amputated. Despite . the heavy price she paid for cheap surgery, Apryl says that she's . recovering and is determined to enjoy the rest of her life. 'Now . it's just my new normal,' she explains. 'Now it's just different. Now I . don't just wake up and jump up on my legs, I wake up and snap on my . prosthetics. Gruesome: The damage to Apryl's backside following the botched jab. Her buttocks were later amputated . 'The hands, that's more challenging because you don't really realise how much you do with them until you don't have them.' She also hopes others will learn from her story and offers this advice to those contemplating surgery: 'Don't ever do anything without researching it and definitely don't ever do anything on the black market. 'It's not about how you fall down. It's not about making choices that are not catastrophic. It's about knowing how to get up. 'And the only thing that will ever make you feel better about yourself is feeling loved. That you are enough, no matter how it looks, what it is or how it feels, that it's enough.'

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . We're used to seeing them parade along our television screens, happily singing Hakuna Mutata or humorously saying 'simples'. But it seems Aleksandr Orlov, Timon and their meerkat pals have a secret dark side. A new study has found the cuddly creatures are 'nasty, brutish and short' - and are actually callous killers. Dark side: They might look 'cute and fluffy', but meerkats have a dark side and are 'nasty and brutish', experts claim . The study, carried out by a group of British and South African universities, found the dominant female meerkat uses violence to survive and often abandons other females once they give birth. It then brutally kills and eats their offspring to ensure they have enough food for their own pup and their pool of meerkat 'babysitters'. The study's leader, Dr Matthew Bell, from the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, said the findings were all the more shocking because meerkats are 'cute and fluffy'. He said: 'Since meerkats are cute and fluffy, and have been saccharine, anthropomorphized poster children for happy family life, it comes across as more shocking. 'Contrary to the public perception meerkat lives are ""nasty, brutish and short"".' Meerkats have been used as loveable creatures on the Compare the Meerkat adverts since 2009 - but researchers say that, in reality, they are not as nice as the advert would have you believe . Timon, pictured here with Pumba in the Lion King, a Disney cartoon film, is also seen as a loveable creature . The study, published in July in Nature . Communications, looked at the effect of giving contraceptive jabs to . female helpers in groups of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. The jabs . ensured the helpers could not reproduce for six months. During that period, dominant females were less aggressive towards the helpers, foraged more, gained more weight and had bigger pups. The female helpers provided more care and food for the dominant female's offspring. Dr Bell wrote: 'We've done the first clear experiment that measures the value that dominants gain from suppressing their subordinates. 'Such benefits have always been assumed, but never clearly confirmed.' Dr Andrew Young, an evolutionary biologist at Britain's University of Exeter, who was not involved in Bell's study, said: 'That's sort of the niche in which meerkats fit as a nice model, because there's very strong hierarchy but subordinates do still try to breed.' Meerkats are also competitive in captivity, according to Agnes Maluleke from the Johannesburg zoo. The zoo, which has 20 meerkats, has previously had to split up a group when a young pup challenged a dominant female. It turned into a vicious scrap that Maluleke described as 'fighting for life or death'.","New study shows the creatures are not as 'cute and fluffy' as they seem .

"By . Eve Mcgowan . At first the laughs are, perhaps understandably, nervous. But then Lee Ridley is far from a conventional stand-up comic. For a start, he doesn’t utter a single word on stage. Lee, who has cerebral palsy, cannot speak so he uses a text-to-speech iPad app to deliver his lines. During his show, Lost Voice Guy, lines are delivered in the  synthetic tones of a computer-generated male voice. ‘When I realised I’d never be able to talk again, I was speechless,’ he jokes, to chuckles from the audience. In a recent stunt at the X Factor auditions, he used an iPad to deliver a rendition of R Kelly’s I Believe I Can Fly. Unfortunately, the judges didn’t see the funny side, and he was cut short after a few verses. Still, the experience has made ripe material for his act: ‘I used to be in a disabled Steps tribute band. We were called Ramps. We faced an uphill struggle.’ At this the audience erupts with laughter. Keys to success: . Cerebral Palsy stand-up comedian Lee Ridley working on new material on his iPad at his flat in Newcastle upon Tyne . Last night, Lee was in London for a gig  in Covent Garden. Our interview is conducted via a specialised computer called a Lightwriter rather than the iPad app, which is ‘more fun for the show, but harder to type on – this is what I use in everyday life’, says Lee. The Lightwriter is portable and has two screens so I can see the words as Lee writes them. I ask a question and after a few taps of the keypad, the computer voice replies. He says: ‘I’ve always loved stand-up but I never thought about trying it myself until friends suggested that  it might work and that I’d be unique. ‘I’m comfortable making fun of myself. People don’t expect it and there’s that awkward feeling in the room initially when I get on stage. But when I’m funny that goes away.’ Lee’s first gig was at a friend’s comedy night in Sunderland in February and he has been overwhelmed at the positive response so far – he recently supported Ross Noble on tour, while Little Britain star Matt Lucas is a fan. Now he is planning a tour of his own next year. ‘I was very nervous. I thought no one would understand me,’ explains Lee. ‘After a few minutes of it going well I started to enjoy it. It was a massive  buzz knowing people were laughing at stuff I’d written. I managed only two hours’ sleep afterwards because I was on such a high.’ Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term covering a range of neurological conditions that affect movement, co-ordination and speech. It is caused by damage to the brain that can happen during pregnancy, birth or soon after. About 2,000 children a year are affected in the UK. Tools: Lee Ridley uses his iPad or a Lightwriter device(left) to communicate . Aged six months, Lee contracted the brain infection encephalitis – triggered by a cold sore – which put him in a coma for two weeks. It left him with hemiplagia, a common type of cerebral palsy. Lee’s right side is much weaker than his left, which means he walks with a limp. He finds it hard to swallow and the  muscles in his mouth and tongue are too weak for him to speak – despite years of working with a speech therapist in early childhood. About three-quarters of people with cerebral palsy suffer from some  sort of speech difficulty. Lee, who grew up in Co Durham, attended a specialist primary school where he learned sign language. Aged 12, he was given his purpose-built Lightwriter. Despite its American accented voice, you can still detect  a hint of Geordie in his syntax and  with words such as Mam, which he spells phonetically. ‘I take the Lightwriter for granted now, but it changed my life and made me a lot more independent,’ says Lee, who works at Sunderland City Council’s press office. ‘It’s frustrating that I can’t just instantly say something, that I have to type it out first – although if I’m angry that can be a good thing.’ Despite his disability, teachers at his   primary school realised Lee was very bright and needed to be challenged.When he was old enough, he was able to attend many lessons at a mainstream secondary school, and he went on to gain a place at the University of Central Lancashire to study journalism. ‘Luckily I had a really good English teacher who pushed me to my limits. I’ve always loved writing and English and until now journalism was all I ever wanted to do,’ says Lee, who has had stints as a sports reporter for his local newspaper and the BBC. ‘I always seem to choose strange careers for someone who can’t speak.’ He is able to do most of his research via email but uses his Lightwriter device to conduct interviews over the phone. ‘Some people just assume I’m an answering machine or get impatient but I’m used to it and it’s turned into great comedy material,’ he says. Sandra Hartley, a trustee of the charity Communication Matters, which offers support to people who use augmentative  communication, says: ‘There’s a huge range of ability among those with cerebral palsy, going from those whose speech is clear but laboured, to those who are unintelligible and rely on speech aids.’ The charity campaigns for better recognition and support for people such as  Lee and is lobbying the Government to protect speech-therapy services. Sandra says: ‘Thirty or 40 years ago before devices such as iPads were developed, people had to rely on parents and carers to talk for them. Those with cerebral palsy were thought to be stupid. Lee is part of the first generation to grow up with more options open to them. ‘It’s very courageous to put himself up there as different – that takes a certain personality. His show is funny. But what Lee is doing is more than that – he is breaking down barriers.’","Lee Ridley has cerebral palsy and cannot speak - but still managed to become a stand-up comic .

"By . James Tozer . and Louise Eccles . The surgeon who carried out Britain’s first hand transplant last night praised the donor’s family for bringing about good from the ‘awful tragedy of a loved one’. Professor Simon Kay, who led the complex eight-hour procedure at Leeds General Infirmary, said their permission had to be sought soon after their relative’s sudden death on Boxing Day. There is no tick box for ‘limbs’ on donor register forms so next-of-kin must be consulted ‘individually by the hospital’. Scroll down for video . Life changing: Mark Cahill, pictured with wife Sylvia, underwent the first hand transplant on Boxing Day . The plastic surgeon said: ‘I really . think we have to acknowledge the circumstances that this hand was given, . at Boxing Day, at a time of enormous tragedy and loss. I would like to . acknowledge the extraordinary gift. ‘Organ donation of any kind plucks something positive from that awful tragedy of a loss of a loved one.’ It is not known what tragedy befell the donor but sources say it was most likely to have been a car crash or a stroke. Professor Kay spoke as the recipient, . Mark Cahill, continued to recover in hospital and revealed that his next . milestone is to be able to hold his three-year-old grandson’s hand for . the first time. Immediate success: Mr Cahill, pictured with Sylvia and surgeon Simon Kay,said he wonders who his new hand came from but will never know for data protection reasons . The 51-year-old former pub landlord, . who lost the use of his right hand five years ago, said the implications . of his surgery were still sinking in. As he continued to marvel at being . able to wiggle the fingers of his new hand, he said he hoped to regain . his independence and enjoy family life to the full. Speaking of his grandson Thomas, he said: ‘Anything I can do will be a bonus. Holding his hand is going to be great.’ Mr Cahill, from Greetland, West . Yorkshire, lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – . when it became infected during a severe attack of gout, a condition he . had suffered for 20 years. ‘I had to go into hospital to cut the infection out and it left me with a paralysed hand,’ he said. He and his wife Sylvia, 47, had to . leave their beloved village pub, the Shears Inn near Halifax, and he has . been unable to work since. ‘It made it virtually impossible to do . anything,’ he said. ‘My wife had to help me dress and cut my food up. You can imagine without any hands it’s very difficult.’ A friend told yesterday how so far, . for all of Thomas’s life, Mr Cahill has had to settle for ‘just . observing’ the little boy, rather than be able to play with him. ‘He’s . the apple of his eye,’ the friend added. Pioneer: Consultant plastic surgeon and professor of hand surgery, Simon Kay, began investigating the possibility of carrying out the UK's first hand transplant ten years ago . Mr Cahill’s operation nine days ago . became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same . procedure. While there have been 70 hand transplants world-wide, in . those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery. Yesterday Professor Kay said it could . be 18 months before the operation is considered a success. ‘If all goes . well, I would hope he has quite strong grasp, and have good sensibility, . a good ability to feel, and he’ll have a precision pinch,’ he said. Mr Cahill, who has had psychological . help to enable him to accept the new hand as his own, continues to be . kept in isolation at hospital to reduce risk of infection. ‘The feelings . are starting to come back and everything’s looking very good,’ he said. ‘It feels like my hand.’ By John Stevens . After celebrating Christmas with his family, Mark Cahill was all set for a holiday with his wife in Goa. But shortly after 8pm on Boxing Day he received the phone call telling him he was to undergo a hand transplant. By 1pm the next day he was preparing for the eight-hour landmark surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. New lease of life: Mark Cahill, pictured before the operation with wife Sylvia and grandson Thomas in 2011, hopes that the days of a useless hand are over and that he can return to employment . Mr Cahill had been unable to use his . right hand for five years after it became infected owing to severe gout, . an acute form of arthritis caused by a build-up of uric acid in the . blood. He and his second wife Sylvia, who . celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary last year, were forced to give . up their beloved village pub, the Shears Inn in Greetland, near . Halifax, because of his disability. Mr Cahill, a former rugby league player, was also left wheelchair-bound at one point when the gout affected his spine. He said: ‘Anything I have now is . better than what I had before this operation. I’m hoping to eventually . get back to work – I’m already moving my fingers and the doctors say I’m . making quicker progress than they expected.’ Photographs posted by Mr Cahill on his . Facebook page show his swollen hand before the operation and a painful . infection on one of his fingers. Mr Cahill said he was shocked when he . was offered the ground-breaking surgery less than three months after he . was added to the transplant register. ‘After a lot of tests, Professor . Kay (the plastic surgeon who performed the operation) told me I could be . a candidate for a hand transplant, and asked me to give it some . thought. Before the operation: Mark suffered from gout and his hand was left paralysed after becoming infected . ‘I discussed it with my family and . came back to Professor Kay in about October and told him I wanted to go . ahead with it – so when I got the call on Boxing Day to say there was a . donor I was gobsmacked. ‘I really expected quite a wait, and . it was a bit of a gulp moment. Sylvia and I were meant to be going on . holiday to Goa this week, but this is obviously a much better turn-out.’ When doctors learned that a hand . suitable for transplant had become available they called in Mr Cahill . for tests to check how his tissue matched with that of the donor. He said: ‘I was called into the . hospital along with another recipient, and they tested us to see which . was the stronger match – and I was.’ Within hours the doctors began the . gruelling surgery, which saw his hand removed and the replacement . attached in the same operation. Brand new hand: The eight-hour . surgery involved attaching his arm to the new hand using titanium plates . Mr Cahill added: ‘It didn’t feel real . until I woke up after the operation. It felt like a dream, even when I . was going into theatre.’ He added: ‘It’s how I expected it to . look, because I’ve done a lot of research about hand transplants. But . you can do all the research you want and you don’t know how you’re going . to feel – I’ve had a lot of help from psychologists because the biggest . thing is afterwards, whether I would accept it as mine.’ Mr Cahill, who has one daughter, Danielle, is full of gratitude to the family of the donor. His wife added: ‘It was a wonderful . thing to do. It must have been really difficult for them but I’ll always . be grateful for the choice they made.’ Professor Norman Williams, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: 'This is yet another example of . life-changing surgical advancements that are now possible. 'New surgical . techniques together with a greater understanding of organ rejection are . making an ever wider range of transplants possible. This presents opportunities . for treating conditions and improving quality of life in ways that . simply were not possible in the past. 'As with all procedures that improve the quality of life rather than . save it, there is an ethical balance to be struck – especially as the . lifelong anti-rejection medication that the patient would . need to take carries its own risks. 'Care always needs to be taken in . choosing suitable patients who understand the risks and benefits. This . selection should be by a multi-disciplinary team of doctors which . includes a psychologist or psychiatrist as a core-member of the . selection team.' Hand transplants have already been carried out by doctors in the United States, Austria and France leading the way for other transplant operations of such organs as the face, abdominal wall or larynx. The first major organ to be transplanted successfully was a cornea, by Eduard Zirm in Olmutz, Czech Republic in 1905, but not until nearly 50 years later, in 1954, did doctors in Boston successfully transplant a kidney. The first successful heart transplant was by Dr Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967, and was followed by the first heart and liver transplants in the UK the following year. Not until 1983 did Britain see the first combined heart and lung transplant. In 2005, the first partial face transplant was carried out, in Amiens, France where Isabelle Dinoire, a 38-year-old woman who had been mauled by her dog, was given a new nose, chin and lips. Five years later the first full face transplant was carried out, in Barcelona, Spain, on a farmer known only as Oscar who had been injured in a shooting accident. He received the entire facial skin and muscles - including cheekbones, nose, lips and teeth - of a donor. In October 2006, surgeon Peter Butler at London's Royal Free Hospital was given permission by the NHS ethics board to carry out a face transplant. His team will select four adult patients for operations.","Mark Cahill, 51, suffered gout and developed infection, causing paralysis .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Psychopaths are defined as ruthless people who suffer from a chronic mental disorder that can manifest in abnormal or violent social behaviour. But one diagnosed psychopath says they're not all violent murderers - they could even be your boss. She believes people who have the condition like she does are more likely to get ahead in life. Thanks to her manipulative streak, combined with a lack of empathy for others and excessive self-esteem, she's become a high-flying attorney earning £150,000 a year. The woman, who is in her thirties, has written a book about herself, called Confessions of a Sociopath: A Life Spent Hiding In Plain Sight, under the pen name M.E Thomas. Secret psychopath: A high-flying lawyer, known as Miss Thomas, said having the mental condition has not held her back in life . She will also appear, without being identified, on a Channel 4 show this Saturday - Psychopath Night - that will try to unravel the mystery of . this minority, with the help of leading experts. The programme reveals some familiar faces who are high on the psychopathic scale, including a star of the England football team. Doctors on the show found Miss Thomas displays many psychopathic traits such as egocentrism, interpersonal dominace, verbal aggression and excessive self-esteem. She said: 'I think I always knew that I wasn't quite like other people. I've always known that my heart is a little blacker and colder than most people's. During college I recognised that I was a very manipulative cunning person who was unable to connect to anyone on more than a superficial level.' Diagnosis: Psychologist Dr Eden describes Miss Thomas as a 'successful psychopath' Miss Thomas admits she has an 'obsession with power and willing to do anything to get ahead' but unlike some psychopaths (many are responsible for about . half of serious crimes committed), she's not a murderer or a criminal. In fact she said: 'You would like me if you met me, I am quite confident about that because I have met a statistically sample size of the population and they were all susceptible to my charms.' She said she prefers to call herself a 'sociopath' because of the negative connotations of psycho in the popular culture (fuelled by fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter and real life psychopaths such as Ted Bundy). She admitted: 'Sometimes it feels that I am in the movie Blade Runner and any slip up or indication that I am different will draw suspicion. I do feel a little bit like a misunderstood minority, the only thing that you can sort of hope if you're a sociopath is that you are going to lie well enough and wear the mask well enough and hide in plain sight such that nobody will find out that you're a sociopath.' She added: 'I may have a disorder, but I am not crazy.' Dr John F Eden, a psychology professor from Texas A&M University diagnosed Miss Thomas can be described as a 'socialised' or 'successful' psychopath because of her academic and profession achievements. He said: 'Her presentation in many regards could be considered that of a prototypical psychopathic personality... such as a pronounced lack of empathy, a ruthless and calculating attitude towards social and interpersonal relationships, and a relative immunity to experiencing negative emotions. 'Most notable in Ms. Thomas's clinical presentation … were pronounced elevations on scales tapping antisocial and psychopathic traits (particularly egocentricism and sensation-seeking characteristics), interpersonal dominance, verbal aggression, and excessive self-esteem, as well as very low scores on measures tapping negative affective experiences (e.g., phobias)' Secret of success: Miss Thomas said psychopaths make good bosses because of their ruthlessness and lack of empathy (posed by models) He added: 'Although cognizant that she is ""different"" from most people she knows in terms of her personality structure, Ms. Thomas does not view herself as ""disordered"" in the sense of suffering from a form of mental illness per se. Quite the contrary, she seems content with her lifestyle and its current trajectory and rather blasé about many issues and concerns that might cause others some degree of uncertainty or distress. Of course, such attitudes are emblematic of individuals who are highly psychopathic. 'By all accounts Ms. Thomas has thus far experienced relatively few objective (or subjective) negative consequences associated with being highly psychopathic - and in many regards appears to have excelled across various life domains (e.g., academic, occupational). This suggests that one might describe her as a ""socialized"" or ""successful"" psychopath.' Miss Thomas believes there are many other secret psychopaths like her and that they are 'the grease making the world go round'. She added: 'People sometimes say that we lack remorse or guilt like it's a bad thing. They are sure that remorse and guilt are necessary to being a ""good"" person. But there is probably no universal, and certainly no objective, morality.'

"By . Ollie Gillman . A huge haul of marijuana has been found by police in California - hidden behind boxes of Barbie dolls. Around 10,000lbs of cannabis was found stuffed inside the boxes, police say, with the drugs thought to be worth $5million. The cannabis was seized by officers who found the stash inside cardboard boxes in the back of a truck at a San Bernardino depot. The cannabis was hidden behind decoy boxes of Barbie doll camper vans, San Bernardino police say (file pic) Police do not know whether the truck depot was the haul's final destination, or whether it was meant to be picked up by local dealers (file pic) The marijuana was hidden in unmarked cardboard boxes behind decoy Barbie deliveries, according to The Blaze. Inside the boxes of toys were Barbie Sisters: Go Camping Campers - doll-sized camper vans that come with two hammocks and a swimming pool. The deluxe vans cost $74.32.

They are yet to make any arrests but say they have a lead on the suspects, who are thought to have brought the drugs in from abroad. Lieutenant Travis Walker, District Commander for San Bernardino Police Department, said he did not know whether dealers had planned to pick up the truck later. He said: '[Officers] were working an investigation that led them to this truck depot. 'They found a truck that looked suspicious… and located the 10,000 pounds of marijuana. 'Indications are that it was not grown within… the United States. 'It appears the truck was dropped here. Whether this was the final destination … is unknown. 'Although marijuana is legal in the state, the illegal sale of marijuana creates additional safety concerns for police and the community.' The exact location of the drugs bust was not revealed for safety reasons. Not so holy water: Horse tranquilizer ketamine was found inside 100 bottles of holy water in New York in 2010.

"By . Jo Mcfarlane . Updated: . 12:27 EST, 15 January 2012 . The cosmetic surgery boss who is demanding the taxpayer pay to replace faulty breast implants was appointed by the last Labour government to advise on patient safety and regulation of private firms. Mel Braham, chairman of Harley Medical Group (HMG), was asked to join a Department of Health steering committee that supported the then-chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson in tackling misleading advertising and increasing regulation of Botox injections. The committee met nine times during 2005 and 2006 and planned to introduce tougher penalties for rogue plastic surgeons and an academy to accredit and train cosmetic doctors. 'Profit motives': Mel Braham . This week, Mr Braham, 70, was accused of failing the 13,900 women his company fitted with PiP (Poly Implant Prosthesis) implants by claiming that removing them would put hmg out of business. Braham, a multi-millionaire who made his fortune in macadamia nuts and hair transplants in Australia, lives in a £1.6 million London apartment.HMG is owned by a financial trust, Praxis, based in Guernsey. Records show Praxis owned all of the shares, which has tax advantages. Its relationship with HMG is unknown, but Praxis is not involved in the day-to-day running of the company. Tory MP Dr Daniel Poulter, who sits on the Health Select Committee, said: ‘It is unacceptable for  cosmetic surgery companies to put profit motives before the best interests of patients.’ HMG says the responsibility lies with the Government. Praxis Group did not return calls for comment. A spokesman for Mr Braham said: ‘We are unable to comment further as this information is with HMG’s lawyers.’ 'Scapegoat': The Harley Medical Group, claims it is the victim of a conspiracy by surgeons who want to see it out of business . Mr Braham wants the taxpayer to foot the bill to help its patients. The multi-million-pound cosmetic surgery business, which fitted more PIP implants than any other British firm, also claimed it will need a Government loan if it is to help the NHS. Mr Braham said his firm had been made a ‘scapegoat’ in the saga and was the victim of a conspiracy by other surgeons who want to see him out of business. The chain is currently deluged with around 2,000 calls a day from women, most of whom want their implants removed. The . group, which had a turnover of more than £30million in 2009, fitted . around one in three of the 45,000 PIP implants sold across the country. Mr . Braham said the business did not have the money, time or space to . remove and replace all the implants – and the NHS should step in. Booming business: The group fitted PIP implants in 13,900 women between September 2001 and 2010 . He . said the chain of 31 clinics, like its patients, was an ‘innocent . victim’ of a regulatory failure, and said it was ‘outrageous’ of the . Government to call on private clinics to take responsibility. His comments have caused fury among MPs, patients, surgeons and lawyers, who say a clinic’s first duty is to its patients, not its profits. They came as Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced spot checks on plastic surgery clinics and a wide-ranging review of cosmetic surgery practices from nose jobs and laser surgery to injections used to iron out wrinkles. When Anntina Maughan had her  breasts enlarged, she was thrilled with the results. Now, four years later and pregnant, the mother of two couldn't be more unhappy with them. Scans show that one – or both – of the PIP implants have ruptured. But, at five-and-a-half-months pregnant, Miss Maughan, 39, of Crawley in West  Sussex, has been advised against surgery to have them out. Miss Maughan paid Harley Medical Group £5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self-esteem due to her small bust. Last year she started experiencing burning pains, and then found lumps in her breasts, raising fears of cancer. She now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant. Miss Maughan believes the Harley Medical Group should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby. She added: 'It is their fault this happened. I went there in full confidence. If it was up to me, I'd have the implants out right now. I worry because I don't know what was in them.' Mr Lansley also pointed the finger at Germany, by naming it as the country that approved the French-made PIPs for use in Europe. Industry experts say that the combination of cut-price implants and low payments to surgeons would have allowed clinics using PIPs to make an extra profit of up to £1,000 per patient. Tests have confirmed that PIP . implants, which are extra-fragile and filled with industrial-grade . silicone believed to have been made for mattresses, do not cause cancer. However, the Department of Health . admits they should never have been put in the human body and the Health . Secretary has cleared the way for all women who want them removed to . have it done. Last Friday, . Mr Lansley said private clinics have a ‘moral duty’ to take them out and . if they don’t, the NHS will step in. However, the pledge doesn’t . include the replacement of implants. Many . private chains have agreed to help their patients free of charge but . two of the largest groups have ignored Mr Lansley’s call. Transform, . Britain’s biggest cosmetic surgery group, is ‘reviewing its options’. But as it stands, it is charging patients £2,800 to replace PIP . implants. The Harley Medical Group has so far removed and replaced . ruptured implants for free – but only if they were fitted in the past . two years. Mr Braham, who previously ran a travel . agency in Australasia, said his business couldn’t cope with the panic . from its patients. He said: ‘We don’t have the number of surgeons, the . hospitals and the anaesthetists and we don’t have the financial capacity . to do it for nothing. ‘We . do roughly 5,000 to 6,000 operations a year and are not capable of . adding another 13,900 on top of that.’ Instead, he wants the NHS to take . the implants out – and put new ones in when the woman is on the . operating table. Mr Braham . wants the Health Service to pay for the bulk of the costs. The firm . would pay for new implants – but would need a loan from the Government. The Government however said it would be ‘irresponsible’ of the Harley . Medical Group not to help its patients. Fazel Fatah, president of the British . Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘We find it . outrageous…when women’s peace of mind is at stake, some clinics are . refusing to honour their ostensible commitment to duty of care, . particularly when they made a profit by using cheaper products and . resources.’ Dutch authorities have reversed their earlier advice on PIPs and said women who had the implants should have them removed.","Harley Medical Group chairman was asked to join a Department of Health steering committee in 2005 .

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian photographer has been inspired to bring back to life black and white images found on a Flickr archive, the Costică Acsinte Archive. The original 5,000 images were taken by a Romanian photographer Costică Acsinte, who died in 1984 and since been digitised by photo enthusiast Cezar Popescu from 2013. It was the photographer Jane Long's fascination with the post war images and their subjects, that prompted her to give each character a story through her new series 'The Dancing with Costica'. Artist, Jane Long admits to having a favourite from the series; Innocence, which took the longest to become a character in the tales of her own invention . 'I thought I needed some practice with restoration work so I did a search and that’s where I came across the Costica Acsinte Archive,' Ms Long told Daily Mail Australia. 'They were hauntingly beautiful.' The Brisbane based conceptual photographer has worked as a graphic designer for 20 years, but over the past two years she has found herself only working in photography. 'I missed the photo-shop element, photography wasn't enough. 'Once I coloured up the original images I felt they looked quite real,' she said. 'I didn't want them to look too real, I didn't want people to think it was shot as a colour image. Working with historical images and restoring them was a concept completely foreign Ms Long, but the beauty and mystery of the images drew her in, giving the artist freedom to create anything she envisioned. The image, Fresh, was one of 5,000 images taken by by a Romanian war photographer Costică Acsinte . 'I like ambiguity so it made sense for it to look real and then to create a fantasy scene around them. 'What people think is real is not, and what they think is not real actually is.' Ms Long describes the concept of her series as the complete opposite to the original images. 'I was free to create anything I wanted, making them beautiful and happy. Many of the images are  post war so it was still a dark time for them.' The artist admits to having a favourite from the series; Innocence, which took the longest to become a character in the tales of her own invention. 'Innocence was the first image that jumped out for me. 'It took me a long time to find a story for her, I kept going back to her asking myself ""What would I do?"", she said. 'She is close to my heart.' Jane Long plans on continuing restoration of images and is currently working on a similar shot to Innocence. Said said, 'restoring and recolouring the images is only part of the process, the rest is the dance.' The post war images have since been digitised by photo enthusiast Cezar Popescu.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A search and rescue team on Saturday found the wreckage of the small private plane that passed its Florida destination and crashed in the sea off Jamaica when its pilot lost consciousness. Officials from the Jamaica Defense For Air Wing say they spotted 'what is believed to be debris' from the aircraft, the Miami Herald reported. 'Our pilots are very confident that the fighting is consistent with that . of a high impact debris field, and this has been corroborated by a U.S. Coastguard C130 Aircraft involved in the operation,' Maj. Basil . Jarrett, a spokesman with the Jamaica Defense Force, told the newspaper. The plane on Friday crossed into Cuban airspace — triggering a U.S. security alert — and crashed in the water off Jamaica after twice asking for permission to fly at a lower altitude before the pilot lost consciousness. Larry Glazer, a real estate developer in Rochester, New York, was seen slumped over the controls by a fighter jet sent to escort the plane. He and his entrepreneur wife Jane, both died in the crash. Their plane, which took off from New York on Friday morning, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida. It continued flying south for several hours at an altitude of 25,000 feet before entering Cuban airspace and heading towards the Caribbean, eventually crashing 14 miles North East of Port Antonio in Portland on Friday afternoon. In total, it traveled more than 1,700 miles. Scroll down for videos . Debris: Jamaican authorities say this is the spot where a small private plane crashed after its pilot lost consciousness . Killed: Rochester real estate developer Larry Glazer and his wife Jane, both 68, were aboard the aircraft that lost contact with air traffic controllers and flew 1,700 miles before crashing in the water off Jamaica . Experienced pilot: Glazer, 68, a father-of-three and a grandfather, is pictured in front of another small plane . Search party: Jamaican Marine Police return to the Port Antonio Marina after a fruitless search for a plane that crashed into the ocean near Port Antonio, Jamaica, Friday, Sept. 5, 2014 . Two fighter jets had been sent to the plane earlier on Friday after air traffic controllers were unable to make contact with the pilot. The jet pilots noted that Glazer was slumped over his controls, perhaps from oxygen deprivation. One of the fighter jet pilots said he could see the pilot of the small plane, a SOCATA TBM 700, which has a pressurized cabin, was still alive. 'I can see his chest rising and falling,' he said in a recording of his dispatch. 'Right before I left... we could see that he was actually breathing.' The plane also had 'frosted windows', an indication of a sudden loss of cabin pressure and officials said they suspected hypoxia - a deprivation of oxygen - could have caused them to pass out. According to ABC, the pilot requested to fly lower during two calls to air traffic control, however when they asked if he wanted to declare himself in a state of emergency, he said no. The plane was flying at 28,000 feet at 10 am when Glazer asked to descend to 18,000 feet because of an issue with the plane, ABC reported. He was cleared to drop to 25,000 feet but then asked to go lower. Air traffic control denied the second request because of the traffic traveling below Glazer. They said if he made a left turn he could bypass the traffic and descend. He made the turn, but then stopped responding. Route: Their single-engine plane, which was traveling from New York to Florida this morning, failed to land, entered Cuban airspace and headed towards the Caribbean. It crashed just off Jamaica on Friday . Site: The small plane eventually went down in the water 14 miles North East of Port Antonio in Portland . Killed: The turboprop was flown by Larry Glazer and his wife Jane Glazer of Rochester, New York. They were en route from Rochester to Naples, Florida . The unresponsive plane flown by Larry Glazer was a SOCATA TBM 700, a single-engine turbo-prop with a pressurized cabin that is used as a light business and utility aircraft. Seats: Seven including pilot and co-pilot . Max cruising speed: 345mph (300 knots) Max certificated altitude: 30,000ft . Wing span: 41 feet, 6 inches . Length: 34 feet, 9 inches . History: Built by American and French engineers. Been in production since 1988 but periodic upgrades have boosted its horsepower and speed . Production: More than 125 worldwide . The fighter jets that found the plane were eventually forced to break off once they entered Cuban airspace. They were in contact with Cuban authorities, who have said the aircraft did not violate its airspace rules. After passing Cuba, it reached the Caribbean where it crashed, Jamaican authorities said. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 will search for the plane's wreckage, while Jamaica said a search and rescue team had been dispatched to the area. The plane, a Socata TBM-700 light business and utility aircraft, was registered to a development, Buckingham Properties, which is owned by Glazer. A company bio for Glazer notes: 'Larry spends some of his spare time on the ground - gardening around his house with his wife, Jane; and some in the sky - flying his plane.' An article about Glazer in the Rochester City Newspaper called him 'downtown's patron saint'. His company 'owns, co-owns, or manages nearly 13 million square feet of real estate space', it says. Response: Two F-15 fighter jets (file picture) were dispatched after the pilot of a private plane failed to respond but when he entered Cuban airspace, they were forced to break off . The Glazers were possibly affected by hypoxia, a condition where the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply in high-flying aircraft. If the cabin loses pressure and passengers don't use supplemental oxygen quickly, they can become unconscious or possibly die. When hypoxia develops slowly, symptoms can include light-headedness, tiredness, numbness, tingling and nausea. If it comes on quickly, it can cause confusion, behavioral chance, headaches, breathlessness, disorientation or heart palpitations. Jane Glazer was herself an entrepreneur, setting up and running QCI Direct, which delivers home care items through catalogs and websites. The couple, who met at camp at Seneca Lake when they were both counselors in 1964, had been married for more than 45 years and were considered stalwarts of the community. 'The City of Rochester has lost two heroes,' Mayor Lovely Warren and City Council President Loretta Scott said in a statement. 'It is difficult to put into words how much Larry Glazer has meant to our community. Larry worked hard to return a sense of vitality and excitement to our Center City. 'His efforts helped to lift our spirits and restore our sense of optimism. He has been a treasured friend and partner. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Glazer family, the partners and employees of Buckingham Properties, and all of Larry's many friends.'","Jamaica Defense Force Air Wing says they have spotted and photographed 'what is believed to be debris' from the crashed aircraft .

"By . Associated Press . Abandoning his pledge to act by the end of summer, President Barack Obama has decided to delay any executive action on immigration until after the November congressional elections, White House officials said. The move instantly infuriated immigration advocates while offering relief to some vulnerable Democrats in tough Senate re-election contests. Two White House officials said Obama concluded that circumventing Congress through executive actions on immigration during the campaign would politicize the issue and hurt future efforts to pass a broad overhaul. Scroll down for video . In this June, President Obama gave a speech at the White House (pictured) promising to take executive action  on the issue of immigration by the end of summer. The president is now waiting until after the November mid-term election to make that move . The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president's decision before it was announced, said Obama made his decision Friday as he returned to Washington from a NATO summit in Wales. They said Obama called a few allies from Air Force One to inform them of his decision, and that the president made more calls from the White House on Saturday. The officials said Obama had no specific timeline to act, but that he still would take his executive steps before the end of the year. In a Rose Garden speech on June 30, Obama said he had directed Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder to give him recommendations for executive action by the end of summer. Obama also pledged to 'adopt those recommendations without further delay.' Obama faced competing pressures from immigration advocacy groups that wanted prompt action and from Democrats worried that acting now would energize Republican opposition against vulnerable Senate Democrats. Among those considered most at risk were Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina. President Obama made the decision on his flight back from Wales Friday night, where he attended a NATO conference. Pictured above arriving back at the white house on Friday . Obama advisers were not convinced that any presidential action would affect the elections. But the officials said the discussions around timing grew more pronounced within the past few weeks. Ultimately, the advisers drew a lesson from 1994 when Democratic losses were blamed on votes for gun-control legislation, undermining any interest in passing future gun measures. White House officials said aides realized that if Obama's immigration action was deemed responsible for Democratic losses this year, it could hurt any attempt to pass a broad overhaul later on. Immigration advocates blasted Obama and Senate Democrats over the decision, saying both have shown a lack of political will. 'We are bitterly disappointed in the president and we are bitterly disappointed in the Senate Democrats,' said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice. 'We advocates didn't make the reform promise; we just made the mistake of believing it. The president and Senate Democrats have chosen politics over people, the status quo over solving real problems.' Cristina Jimenez, managing director of United We Dream, said the decision was 'another slap to the face of the Latino and immigrant community.' 'Where we have demanded leadership and courage from both Democrats and the president, we've received nothing but broken promises and a lack of political backbone,' she said. Partisan fighting erupted recently over how to address the increased flow of unaccompanied minors from Central America at the U.S. border with Mexico. The officials said the White House had not envisioned such a battle when Obama made his pledge June 30. Obama asked for $3.7 billion to address the border crisis. The Republican-controlled House, however, passed a measure that only gave Obama a fraction of what he sought and made it easier to deport the young migrants arriving at the border, a provision opposed by Democrats and immigration advocates. In the end, Congress adjourned without a final bill. The number of minors caught alone illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States has been declining since June. That decrease and Congress' absence from Washington during August has taken attention away from the border for now. This summer, a mass of unaccompanied minors from central America crossed into the U.S. leaving immigration authorities with the difficult task of figuring out what to do with the children. Above, some of these young illegal immigrants in Texas . Still, the dispute over how to deal with the surge of Central American border crossers threatened to spill over into the larger debate over immigration and the fate of 11 million immigrants in the United States who either entered illegally or overstayed their visas and have been in the U.S. for some time. The Democratic-led Senate last year passed a broad overhaul of immigration that boosted border security, increased visas for legal immigrants and a provided a path to citizenship for immigrants illegally in the country. But the Republican-controlled House balked at acting on any broad measure and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, informed Obama earlier this year that the House would not act in 2014. That led Obama to declare he would act on his own. During a news conference Friday in Wales, Obama reiterated his determination to act on his own even as he avoided making a commitment on timing. He also spelled out ambitious objectives for his executive actions. Obama said that without legislation from Congress, he would take steps to increase border security, upgrade the processing of border crossers and encourage legal immigration. He also said he would offer immigrants who have been illegally in the United States for some time a way to become legal residents, pay taxes, pay a fine and learn English. 'I want to be very clear: My intention is, in the absence of ... action by Congress, I'm going to do what I can do within the legal constraints of my office, because it's the right thing to do for the country,"" he said. The extent of Obama's authority is a matter of debate among legal experts and in Congress. Some Democrats say it would be best for Obama to let Congress act. But pro-immigrant groups called on Obama to stick to his end-of-summer deadline and weighed in with a strongly worded appeal to him on Friday. 'Being a leader requires making difficult and courageous decisions,' said the letter, whose signers included the National Council of La Raza and the League of United Latin American Citizens. 'It is your time to lead, Mr. President.'","The president pledged in June to act on immigration by the end of summer .

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . Nasa has revealed a stunning animation that put viewers right in the heart of a massive solar storm. It reveals an explosion of solar particles, seen as white static, as they were ejected from the solar surface. The 2005 solar storm was incredibly powerful - but baffled researchers by barely affecting power on earth. Scroll down for video . A coronal mass ejection on Jan. 20, 2005, produced an extreme amount of solar particles, seen as white static in this imagery from ESA/NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Closer to Earth, it created a solar storm with an unusual combination of strong and weak effects. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. Using new data and the animation, they were able to piece together what happened. The space weather storm from the sun engulfed our planet on Jan. 21, 2005. The event got its start on Jan. 20, when a cloud of solar material, a coronal mass ejection or CME, burst off the sun and headed toward Earth. When it arrived at our planet, the ring current and radiation belts surrounding Earth swelled with extra particles, while the aurora persisted for six hours. Both of these are usually signs of a very large storm – indeed, this was one of the largest outpouring of solar protons ever monitored from the sun. But the storm barely affected the magnetic fields around Earth – disturbances in these fields can affect power grids on the ground, a potential space weather effect keenly watched for by a society so dependent on electricity. Janet Kozyra, a space scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, thought this intriguing combination of a simultaneously weak and strong solar storm deserved further scrutiny. In an effort to better understand -- and some day forecast -- such storms and their potential effects on human technology, an unusual event like this can help researchers understand just what aspects of a CME lead to what effects near Earth. 'There were features appearing that we generally only see during extreme space weather events, when by other measures the storm was moderate,' said Kozyra. A filament of cold dense solar material moved toward the front of a Jan. 20, 2005, coronal mass ejection, which led to an unusually large amount of solar material funneling into near-Earth space during a Jan. 21 solar storm. 'We wanted to look at it holistically, much like terrestrial weather researchers do with extreme weather. 'We took every single piece of data that we could find on the solar storm and put it together to see what was going on.' With observations collected from ground-based networks and 20 different satellites, Kozyra and a group of colleagues, each an expert in different aspects of the data or models, found that the CME contained a rare piece of dense solar filament material. This filament coupled with an unusually fast speed led to the large amount of solar material observed. A fortuitous magnetic geometry, however, softened the blow, leading to reduced magnetic effects. These results were published in the Aug. 14, 2014, issue of Journal of Geophysical Research, Space Physics. The researchers gathered data from spacecraft orbiting in Earth's ionosphere, which extends up to 600 miles above the planet's surface, and satellites above that, orbiting through the heart of Earth's magnetic environment, the magnetosphere. Twelve spacecraft in Earth’s magnetosphere – in addition to other missions -- helped scientists better observe and understand an unusual January 2005 solar storm. The four Cluster spacecraft were in the solar wind, directly upstream of Earth. The massive amount of data was then incorporated into a variety of models developed at the University of Michigan's Center for Space Environment Modeling, which are housed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, a facility dedicated to providing comprehensive access to space weather models. With the models in hand, the team could put together the story of this particular solar storm. It began with the CME on Jan. 20, 2005. The European Space Agency and NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, captured images of the CME. In this case, however, it seems that the dense filament sped forward, past the leading edge of the CME, so as it slammed into the magnetosphere, it delivered an extra big dose of energetic particles into near-Earth space. 'Within one hour of the impact, a cold, dense plasma sheet formed out of the filament material,' said Kozyra. 'High density material continued to move through the magnetosphere for the entire six hours of the filament's passage.' Despite the intense amount of plasma carried by the CME, it still lacked a key component of a super storm. The magnetic fields embedded in this CME generally pointed toward Earth's north pole, just as Earth's own magnetic fields do. This configuration causes far fewer disruptions to our planet's system than when the CME's fields point southward. When pointing south, the CME's fields clash with Earth's, peeling them back and setting off magnetic perturbations that cascade through the magnetosphere. The magnetic field orientation is what kept this solar storm to low levels. On the other hand, the extra solar material from the filament catalyzed long-term aurora over the poles and enhanced the particle filled radiation belts around Earth, characteristic of a larger storm. 'This event, with its unusual combination of space weather effects really demonstrates why it's important to look at the entire system, not just individual elements,' said Kozyra. 'Only by using all of this data, by watching the event from the beginning to the end, can we begin to understand all the different facets of an extreme storm like this.'","Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost .

The estate agent selling the 5ft by 12ft room says it is perfect for someone looking for more storage at a price he believes will save the buyer money. The walk-in cupboard can only be bought by a resident already living in the Brentford Dock Estate, which sits on the Thames in west London. Scroll down for video . All yours for £7,500: This cupboard in Brentford is being put on the market as Londoners scramble for more storage space . Advert: The particulars on Right Move says: 'This baggage store is perfect for those who are seeking some additional space' The adverts says the cupboard 'sits idly between' two blocks and is 'just a short walk from the marina and local corner shop'. It continues: 'This baggage store is perfect for those who are seeking some additional space. 'The storage cupboard is a good size, perfect for a pushchair or pieces of furniture'. Much like investors who are selling garages in prime spots for up to £500,000 others are buying up space to cash in on those desperate for storage. Sales negotiator Jordan Williams from Quillam Property Services told the Standard: 'People use them as airing cupboards, or to store suitcases or bicycles or memorabilia – things like photographs which they don’t want to throw away but which they don’t have room for at home. 'If they have a cupboard they know their things are safe and secure and close by. Everybody loves a bit of extra storage.' The cupboard symbolises the struggle for most Londoners who are unable to afford a property, if at all. Symbolic: The cupboard is only available to people already living in the estate but represents how people are making money from the lack of space most Londoners have . In London, the average price is now £499,000 – putting it on the brink of a landmark £500,000. Data also shows that first-time buyers must find an average of £204,000 – a 12 per cent rise and the highest annual increase for nearly four years. Young home-seekers on a typical full-time salary of £21,200 would now need a mortgage of nine times their income with a five per cent deposit. Even if they do get on the property ladder, storage is likely to be at a minimum in most homes. But agents maintain that buying a cupboard offers good value because many pay in excess of £100 a month for storage with nothing to show for it. Mr Williams said: 'If you add up what you could spend on storage compared to buying a cupboard space you might be surprised'.","Walk-in room measures 5ft by 12ft and is being sold as storage .

The funeral passed off without incident. Mr Connors was murdered in front of his wife and children last week. Gangster 'Fat' Andy Connors, was gunned down in front of his family in Dublin last week . Connors was laid to rest yesterday in a gold coffin which is thought to have cost in the region of £25,000 . 'Fat' Andy Connors, left, was a major target of the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau and a team of detectives . Yesterday parish priest Fr Enda Cunningham told the hundreds of mourners that the Connors family wanted no retaliation for his death. Fr Cunningham also said that the Lord would forgive ‘any sins’ the gang boss committed in this life. Connors led a highly organised Traveller gang that travelled the length and breadth of Ireland carrying out burglaries. While never directly involved in the robberies himself, he ‘directed operations’ and was ‘extremely wealthy’ as a consequence. Mr Connors was buried at St Michael’s Cemetery, Gorey, Co. Wexford, following the funeral mass. Investigating detectives have three main lines of inquiry. One is that he was shot dead by the IRA for refusing to hand over £40,000 protection money. The second is that he was murdered by a well-known south Dublin businessman who was laundering huge sums of cash for him. The third is that he was murdered by other Traveller criminals in a feud. The father of six was a major target of Operation Fiacla, an Irish police crackdown on burglaries nationwide. He was also a target of the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau who wanted to seize some of his property. Connors built a £3 million mansion on the outskirts of Dublin which had its own indoor swimming pool. The house had five bedrooms and sat on 1.6 acres of land. Connors rented out up to 20 pitches on the land to fellow travellers to park their caravans for up to £100-a-week each.","Gangster 'Fat' Andy Connors was shot dead in front of his family last week .

Three Australian men who are believed to be fighting for the Islamic State after joining the Syrian conflict, have been identified as previously living in Brisbane and Melbourne. Their identification comes as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that the government is considering sending military support to US troops in Iraq, while Britain raised their terror level to 'severe' and British Prime Minister David Cameron announced more police will patrol the streets. Brisbane man Abu Yusseph, also known as Zia AbdulHaq, left his ex-wife and child in Brisbane before joining up with the Islamic State in Aleppo, the Weekend Australian has revealed. Abu Yusseph is one of three Australian men who was recently revealed to have joined the Islamic State in Syria . Yusseph, aged in his 30s, was known to be a strong supporter of the Islamic State before he left Australia, and claimed to have been taught to fight by one of the groups' members from Gaza. The Islamic extremist actively shares his activities over social media including photos of himself and other jihadists – some from Canada and France - being trained to use firearms. 'Every #IS #Mujahid need to carry a big knife for slaughtering the enemies. It's more fun to slaughter,' one post from Yusseph on August 18 stated. 'All foreign forces coming to Ash-Shaam and Iraq to fight #IS , our advice to them, bring dead body bag for each of your soldiers,' another post form the extremist read. Melbourne man, Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, is another Australian man revealed to be actively participating in Islamic State activities, according to the Weekend Australian.

Two British doctors drowned during a holiday in Tenerife after they were sucked into a whirlpool as they battled to stop their children being swept out to sea, an inquest heard. Dr Uma Ramalingam, 42, and GP Barathi Ravikumar, 40, went to grab the two youngsters after they were suddenly hit by a succession of freak waves as they paddled on rocks near their holiday villa. But as they did so all four slipped on the wet rocks and slid into the water and were swept out due to the strong waves and currents. Tragic: Dr Uma Ramalingam a consultant obstetrician from Altrincham in Cheshire, drowned at the Playa Paraiso resort, Tenerife after trying to rescue two children from a succession of freak waves . Scene: The group of four were washed out to sea after a large wave knocked them from a rock on this beach. The two children, aged 10 and 14 at the time, were safely pulled from the water . The children were rescued but Dr Ramalingam, a consultant obstetrician, from Bowdon, Cheshire and Dr Ravikumar, a well-respected family doctor, drowned. An inquest in Stockport yesterday was told there had been no warning signs about paddling on the rocks at the time of the tragedy in April this year. The two female doctors were among four families, including five children aged between five and 13, who were holidaying in the popular Playa Paraiso resort in Tenerife. Initially the families spent the first couple of days relaxing around the family villa and spending time around the pool. But disaster struck on the second day of the holiday when the women and children went for a stroll along the beach whilst their husbands or partners went shopping in preparation for a barbecue that evening. In a statement, Dr Ravikumar’s twin sister Dr Poorami Chandrasekaran said the group had set out exploring around 5.30pm and initially had no intention of going in the water. Victim: Dr Ramalingam (pictured) was a consultant obstetrician. Reports at the time said her husband, Palanichamy Chandra, a 49-year-old consultant gastroenterologist, dived in after them but could only save their ten-year-old son Hari . The inquest heard the group had clambered onto some rocks and had made their way to a large plateau area near to the water’s edge. Dr Chandrasekaran said there were no warning signs or flags and the children were playing, letting the waves lap at their feet as their mothers took photos. She said one of the other women in the group, Dr Indu Sivanandan had stayed further back on the rocks as she was frightened of water. The doctor told the inquest that rocks behind the group were wet which indicated a wave had passed behind them and after taking photos they had decided to make tracks. Rocky: The two doctors were on the second day of their holiday in Tenerife among four families, including five children, when the incident took place . No warning: The inquest in Stockport heard there were no warning signs or flags telling people not to swim and that the children were playing, letting the waves lap at their feet as their mothers took photos. But, she said, just as the group was ready to leave, a ‘very large’ wave came and hit them at knee height, causing them to lose balance. The adults tried to grab the children but another powerful wave crashed into the shore and the current dragged both the adults and children into the sea. A third wave followed causing a whirlpool current next to Dr Chandrasekaran and she said there was nothing to hold on to and they were unable to swim against the current. Unable to see her son or daughter, she managed to see her sister, Dr Ravikumar, struggling in the water some distance away and the next thing she remembered was the coastguards arriving in diving equipment. She said: ‘It felt a very long time to me but I had no idea. Straight away I told him my sister was there. I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The second diver came and joined the first one.’ Location: The families were staying at Playa Paraiso in south west Tenerife. The resort is about five miles west of the popular Playa de las Americas complex . Dr Chandrasekaran had to be taken to hospital for exhaustion and her 13-year old daughter who is diabetic was also treated for cuts and bruising. She was then told that both her sister and her friend, Dr Ramalingam, had not been saved and had drowned in the horrific accident. Reports at the time said Dr Ramalingam’s husband, Palanichamy Chandra, a 49-year-old consultant gastroenterologist, dived in after them but could only save their ten-year-old son Hari. Post mortem examinations confirmed that both the South Indian-born doctors had died from asphyxia due to drowning. Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner John Pollard said: ‘If death had occurred at a British resort I would be writing to the resort about warning signs. It was quite clearly a calm day, with nothing unusual. It was completely unexpected.’ He added that he would write a letter to the Tenerife authorities to bring the case to their attention but would be unable to send a Regulation 28 report because the incident had happened outside the jurisdiction. Dr Ramalingam suffered tragedy seven years ago when her first husband, Dr Kannan Palaniswamy, 35, was killed in a car crash near the Dundee hospital where they both worked.","Barathi Ravikumar, 40 and Uma Ramalingam, 42 were in Playa Paraiso resort .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Convicted: Kimberly Gale, 30, got behind the wheel of her Jeep after a night out in Plymoyth, Devon, before mounting the kerb, hitting a van and flipping her 4X4 . A drunk mother who was arrested for driving on a pavement and flipping her Jeep told police they should be 'out catching real criminals'. Kimberly Gale, 30, got behind the wheel after a night out in Plymouth, Devon, before mounting the kerb, hitting a van and tipping her 4x4 on to its side. She then clambered out of her wrecked vehicle before telling officers they 'should be out catching real criminals'. The mother-of-two was more than twice the legal limit when she tried to drive home from a pub, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Handing Gale a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, Judge Paul Darlow told her that people who drive large vehicles dangerously count as 'real criminals'. He said: 'You drove your 4x4 erratically and it ended up on its side, in my judgement causing a real and present danger to anyone else in that residential street.' The court heard Gale had been drinking wine at her local pub on April 25 when she decided to drive home after an argument with the father of her children. Prosecutor Alistair Verheijen said an off-duty police officer watched her climb into her vehicle before swerving from side to side as she pulled away. As he followed behind he watched her mount a kerb at about 25mph before driving 'half-on, half-off' - two wheels in the road and two on the pavement - for 40 metres. Mr Verheijen said the Jeep then clipped a parked van and rolled over on its side. Gale, who is expecting her third child in February, was not badly hurt but the car was written off. She had 85 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, more than twice the legal limit of 35. However the court heard that when she was arrested for drink driving she told officers they 'should be out catching real criminals'. Nigel Hall, defending, said Gale had only drunken two large glasses of wine before deciding to drive rather than walk. He said: 'She tells me this court will not see her again. She feels incredibly ashamed of what she did. 'She realises what could have happened and thank goodness nobody was injured, including herself. It was that close she could have walked home from the pub but she made a bad decision.' Gale, of Plymouth, Devon, admitted dangerous driving and driving while over the legal alcohol limit. She was also banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay £500 in prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Rant: The mother, who is expecting her third child in February, clambered out of the wrecked vehicle and told police officers they should be out catching 'real criminals'. She was then found to be twice over the legal limit . Scene: Gale was seen getting into the car by an off-duty police officer who then followed her as she drove along Radford Park Road in Plymouth .","Kimberly Gale, 30 got behind the wheel after a night out in Plymouth, Devon .

"By . Lydia Warren . Wiping away tears before sharing a passionate kiss for the cameras, new NFL pick Michael Sam and his boyfriend were the picture of joy on Saturday. As the photograph of their embrace quickly spread across the internet, Sam celebrated being the first openly-gay player drafted to the NFL - and viewers wondered about the identity of his man. He has now been named as Vito Cammisano, a 23-year-old fellow University of Missouri alum, who starred on the school's swim team - and who apparently comes from one of the state's most infamous mobster families. Online records indicate that he is the grandson of William 'Willie Rat' Cammisano. The mob leader served time in prison for extortion and contempt of Congress in the 80s, AP reported. Who's that boy?

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . The former Conservative Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson, sacked from the role by David Cameron last month, has been 'treated to lunch' by a millionaire Ukip donor, it has been claimed. Mr Paterson, who was axed by the Prime Minister as Environment Secretary in July, reportedly dined with Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss. The lunch meeting was revealed just days after Tory MP Douglas Carswell defected to Ukip and resigned from Parliament - sparking a crunch by-election. Scroll down for video . Owen Paterson (left) reportedly dined with Crispin Odey (right), a hedge fund boss, along with seven other Eurosceptic Conservative MPs . According to the Mirror, Ukip-backer Stuart Wheeler believes a further two Tory Eurosceptics are giving serious consideration to following suit and joining Nigel Farage's party. In the past, Mr Odey, of Odey Asset Management, has criticised David Cameron claiming he 'doesn't understand power and he doesn't use it'. The Mirror quotes Mr Wheeler as saying he had asked eight anti-Brussels Conservatives about their views, adding: 'But I didn't say ""will you defect?"" I would say ""would you like to meet Nigel Farage?"". 'Some of them said yes, and Douglas Carswell was one, and he's the only name I can give you.' The lunch meeting was revealed just days after Tory MP Douglas Carswell (right) defected to join Ukip, led by Nigel Farage (left) He told the newspaper that if Mr Carswell were to triumph in the Clacton by-election 'other Conservative MPs who are on the brink will be encouraged to defect as well.' Mr Paterson was still Environment Secretary when the lunch is said to have taken place last autumn with Mr Odey, a former Tory donor. This afternoon the North Shropshire MP's office confirmed that he had a 'private dinner with Crispin Odey, who he knows from his days in the leather trade.' The spokesman added: 'It was just the two of them, there were no other MPs present and he would reiterate that the only way of securing an EU referendum is to vote Conservative.' Mr Odey's company has been contacted for a comment this morning.","Owen Paterson reportedly dined with a millionaire Ukip donor, it is claimed .

"By . Marielle Simon For Daily Mail Australia . Schapelle Corby has told her parole officer that she is spending her outside prison time reading and on the beach rather than searching for work. Corby’s parole officer, Ketut Sukiati, spent 10 minutes with the convicted drug smuggler, whose face was covered by a black scarf the entire time. Ms Sukiati told News Corp Australia Corby gave no explanation as to why she wasn't searching for a job but said she wasn't bored being unemployed. Scroll down for video . Schapelle Corby attended her monthly parole meeting wearing a black head scarf (above, left) and told her officer she is enjoying spending time on the beach and reading, rather than search for work . Former Shark's player, Todd Carney, was pictured with the Corby's during a night out in a bar in Bali . The parole officers comments come just weeks after she was photographer partying with sacked  Cronulla Sharks rugby league player Todd Carney and her sister, Mercedes. ‘I told her that it is not polite to cover her face like that, especially because she is in the Government office,’ Ms Sukiati said, according to news.com.au. But Corby insisted to Ms Sukiati she was covering her face to avoid the media from photographing her. The Sydney Morning Herald cites a parole document signed by Schapelle Corby that  ‘If I [Corby] cannot fulfil those requirements, I’m ready to be sent back to prison to undergo the rest of the sentence.’ Until 2017, Corby is required to stay in Bali, and report monthly to the Bali corrections board, dress respectfully for the officials and not use or distribute drugs in Bali. The approved parole application also highlights Corby’s ambitions to design bikinis for her brother-in-law’s Kuta surf shop.

A month after her release in February, Corby’s parole was on the line, following her sister’s controversial interview with Seven Network program, Sunday Night. Pressure for Schapelle’s re-arrest mounted, as Indonesian media networks criticised the Corby family over the interview which speculated that the 4.1 kilograms of marijuana in Schapelle’s boogie board bag ‘could have been from Indonesia’. Mercedes talks to journalists in Bali, Indonesia, Thursday, March 6, 2014. She apologies for offending Indonesia in the Seven Network Program, Sunday Night. Mercedes ignored Indonesia's warning against an interview, which caused a review in Schapelle's parole. Mercedes Corby apologies to Indonesian media ‘from the bottom of my [Mercedes] heart’ for any offence caused. During that time, Corby showed signs of suicidal tendencies, with the prospect of returning to jail due to parole breach. At the time, Corby’s brother-in-law, Wayan Widyartha, told Fairfax media that she was suffering from depression and hallucinations. ‘It’s like illusion of peoples… If she goes out, it’s like she’s still seeing people (crowding her). She’s still traumatised,’ Mr Widyartha said. Schapelle Corby was convicted of smuggling marijuana in 2004 and jailed in Bali’s Kerobokan prison for nine years. Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby was found guilty in 2005 for smuggling 4.1kilograms of marijuana into Bali, Indonesia. While imprisoned, Corby claimed she suffered from extreme depression and shared with a psychiatrist her thoughts on suicide. She was 36 years when released. Corby’s parole officer was told she is currently still living with brother-in-law, Wayan Widyartha. Schapelle Corby, 36, was released from Bali jail February 10.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Determined: Omar Gonzalez, 42, managed to get past five rings of security to reach the White House . The homeless Iraq veteran who jumped over the White House fence  last week got past five rings of security as he stormed the executive mansion, it has emerged. Omar Gonzalez, 42, was eventually subdued by the sixth ring - a plainclothes guard - after the other measures failed, including a slow-moving SWAT team and an attack dog that wasn't released. Gonzalez, who served three tours in Iraq, was carrying a small knife and did not express any wish to harm the president, instead claiming he just wanted to tell him that the 'atmosphere was collapsing'. Still, his successful attempt on the White House raises serious security questions. A day after Gonzalez's first court appearance on charges of unlawfully entering restricted grounds while carrying a weapon, details have emerged revealing the repeated failings of the security measures. As he left the public sidewalk and headed towards the White House, he could have been stopped on five different occasions, according to a report in the Washington Post. First, a plainclothes surveillance team was supposed to spot anyone jumping over the seven foot fence and warn teams inside. But on Friday, the team did not notice Gonzalez as he climbed over. Next there was a Secret Service officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. The guard on duty spotted Gonzalez but could not catch him. Thirdly, an attack dog, a Belgian Malinois, was supposed to stop him, but the animal was never released. In a video of the incident, a dog can be seen running towards him too late. Dash: A video of the incident shows Gonzalez running towards the White House after getting past plainclothes security guards outside the fence. SWAT teams and an attack dog failed to stop him on the lawn . Next, he was supposed to be stopped by a heavily-armed SWAT team that moves around the grounds, but they failed to react in time, the Washington Post reported. Finally, a guard was meant to be at the door to the White House, but there was no one there, allowing Gonzalez to run through the door and gain entry to the mansion. At that point, he was stopped by another agent on patrol inside. President Obama and his family were not in the building when the incident occurred. Gonzalez's successful storm on the White House after simply hopping over the fence has raised serious questions about how well the Secret Service is prepared for an attack. High-ranking officials told the Post it is lucky Gonzalez did not have an explosive device on him, while other Secret Service agents said they were surprised he had not been shot at, as per protocol. Troubled: In an undated photograph, Gonzalez poses with his former wife Samantha before an overseas deployment. She explained she split up with him due to his deteriorating mental state . Serving his country: Gonzalez, pictured with then-sister-in-law Nancy Hoover and her husband, served three tours in Iraq before suffering injuries in an IED blast. He has been homeless for the last three months . When he stormed the White House on Friday, he eluded these five rings of security, according to the Washington Post: . 1. A plainclothes surveillance team outside the gates spotting people jumping over the fence . 2. A Secret Service officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn . 3. A Belgian Malinois, an attack dog . 4.  A heavily-armed SWAT team . 5. A guard on the door of the White House . He was eventually stopped by an agent inside the White House. The agency is now conducting an internal review of the incident and a second fence has been erected along part of the White House grounds. The waist-high barricade, which closes off part of the sidewalk on Pennsylvania Avenue, went up late Monday or early Tuesday and stands about eight feet away from the regular spike-topped fence. 'This temporary closure is in effect while the Secret Service conducts a comprehensive review of the fence jumping incident,' agency spokesman Brian Leary said in an emailed statement. The House of Representatives oversight committee has also scheduled a September 30 hearing on the security breach. After Gonzalez successfully entered the White House, he was detained and authorities carried out a search of his car, finding 800 rounds of ammunition, a machete and two hatchets inside. Relatives have insisted that Gonzalez, from Copperas Cove, Texas, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder after serving three tours in Iraq. He retired after losing part of his foot in an IED blast. Samantha Bell, Gonzalez's ex-wife, said she split up with him in 2010 because of his worsening mental condition. She added that after his second tour in Iraq, he began carrying a .45 on his hip at all times and would keep three or four guns in their home. Increased security: A second fence (seen in the foreground) has been placed around the White House following the incident last week. It stands eight feet away from the regular spiked-top fence . 'Omar is a good guy, he's just got some issues that he needs help with,' she said in an interview. 'I think this is a cry out for help, what he's done. He really does need help. I just hope he can get it.' His former stepson, Jerry Murphy, added to NewsWest9: 'He's got a fun loving personality about him. He's an all around good guy.' He said he thinks PTSD is to blame for last week's outburst. 'I think after he probably had to put a kid or two down running at you with a grenade or a machine gun it would take a toll on any human being that has a heart,' he said. 'Obviously in his mind he was on some sort of a mission to warn people about something... He's never forsaken or turned his back on his country. He gave his mind and his family for this country.' According to criminal complaints obtained by ABC News, D.C. authorities already knew of Gonzalez after he had been stopped on two occasions with apparent intentions to target the White House. On both occasions, he was interviewed by the Secret Service, but they found no cause to arrest him. In July, Virginia authorities found 'several assault rifles' in a vehicle when he was arrested after speeding and eluding state police. After nearly crashing, Gonzalez was eventually pulled over. Questions: The Secret Service is now conducting an internal review of the incident at the White House . Virginia State Police said he had a map of D.C. with a circle drawn around the White House when he was arrested. They also allegedly found 11 different weapons in his car. Then on August 25, he was stopped while walking along the fence of the White House. In that incident, authorities found he had a hatchet in his waist band, according to ABC. But when he allowed cops to search his car, they found no further weapons or ammo and he was not arrested. Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008. He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation, but Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served until his retirement in late 2012. He will next appear in court in October. If convicted, he could get 10 years in prison.","Omar Gonzalez 'scaled the fence outside the White House, dashed across the lawn and entered the executive mansion with a knife on Friday'

And Judge David Hale said it was 'inevitable' that she would be have to spend time in jail. A 31-year-old woman was found guilty of child cruelty and sexual touching by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court . Meirion Jones, for the defence, said the woman - who had no previous convictions - had been involved in a 'uniquely horrible event'. A court heard how the worried father put his BlackBerry mobile phone under his daughter's bed and left it to record. He then listened back to the recording and heard his daughter crying and screaming. The following evening, he left the phone in between cushions opposite the bed and activated the video camera. A second mobile phone was placed under the bed to record the noise. That night, the father recorded his girlfriend pulling his daughter up from the bed by her hair and slapping her. The three-year-old girl was screaming, sobbing and left bruised by the incident. Her father said in a statement read to the court that he was 'shocked' and sickened' by what had happened. After the incident, he telephoned the police and ordered his partner to leave the house. When he did so, she claimed to have done nothing wrong and said: 'Sorry, it was only once'.

Prosecutors say that Easter made a 911 call in February 2011 claiming that Kelli Peters, a PTA volunteer at his son's school, appeared to be under the influence of drugs and that he saw her hide the drugs in her car. Easter, of Irvine, planted prescription painkillers, marijuana and a marijuana pipe in Peters' car according to the district attorney's office. Easter was in constant contact with his wife, Jill Easter, by cellphone and text message as he did so, prosecutors said. Police responded to the call, and found the drugs in Peters' car. She was interviewed for two hours but officers turned their attention to the Easters when they realized that the school volunteer was in class at the time Kent Easter accused her of hiding drugs in her car, authorities said. Peters also vigorously denied knowledge of the drugs and a subsequent search of her home turned up no evidence of any other drug use. Husband and wife: Kent and Jill Easter were arrested after police realized the drugs they found in Kelli Peters' car were planted . Traumatic experience: Before the drug-planting incident, the Easters had tried to sue Peters and Jill Peters tried to take out a retraining order against her . Prosecutors say the Easters disliked Peters because they felt she didn't properly supervise their son. Easter and his wife, also an attorney, had previously had a run-in with Peters when they sued her in March 2010 after she locked their son, then a first-grader, out of the school for less than 20 minutes, an act they said was intentional. The case was dismissed. Jill Easter, 40, also requested a restraining order against Peters, claiming she was psychotic and unstable and tried to kill her. The request was denied. A video surveillance camera captured Kent Easter calling Irvine police from a business center in a hotel near his legal office, prosecutors said. Easter testified during his first trial that his wife became obsessed with getting the Peters fired as a volunteer from the school, reports OC Weekly. His defense team claims that Easter was merely trying to please his wife, who was the mastermind of the plot. Jill Easter pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 120 days in prison and 100 days of community service for her part in the incident. She is the author of a book called Holding House, under the pen name Ava Bjork, according to the Los Angeles Times. Promotional information for the book, including a video that details its plot, asks readers, 'If you knew how to commit the perfect crime, would you do it?'Watch more news videos | Latest from the US .","Kent Easter, 40, is being retried on charges of false imprisonment by fraud or deceit .

"By . Ashley Collman . and Lydia Warren for MailOnline . The night before they disappeared and tried to cross the border into Canada, three Afghan soldiers went out to a Massachusetts strip club, where they ordered lap dances and tried to touch the women. Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar went missing from Cape Cod on Saturday, where they were participating in a joint military exercise at Camp Edwards. Immigration officials arrested them two days later, on the New York-side of Niagara Falls, trying to make their way into Canada. Scroll down for video . The three Afghan soldiers who went missing from Massachusetts over the weekend, visited Cape Cod strip club Zachary's Pub (interior pictured) the night before they went AWOL . Found! Major Jan Mohammad Arash (left), Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada (center), and Captain Noorullah Aminyar (right) were caught on Monday, trying to cross into Canada near Niagara Falls in New York . On Friday night, the three soldiers were part of a larger group that visited Zachary's Pub, a strip club in Mashpee. The group stayed at the club until early Saturday, and the bar's staff say they acted pretty normal. 'They were nice, they tipped, they were very generous, they were sweet respectful,' dancer Melissa McNeely told WHDH. 'I ended up doing a lap dance for one of the guys and he stayed as still as a statue,' Ms McNeely added. Awkward: Zachary's stripper Melissa McNeely says she gave one of the officers a lap dance and that he 'stayed as still as a statue' Boys night out: The three soldiers were part of a larger group that went out to Zachary's Friday night, into early Saturday. Some of the group seen leaving the strip club on surveillance footage . Hands off: Zachary's owner Richard Halpern says the group 'acted like everybody else' but didn't seem to understand that they could't touch the women . Free advertising: Halpern says the club has been getting a lot of attention no TV broadcasts because of the Afghan soldiers, which is good for business . McNeely said the Afghan soldiers stood out because they looked foreign, but that it's not uncommon to get soldiers in the club due to its proximity to the military base. 'We get military all the time' Zachary's owner Richard Halpern told Buzzfeed. 'We get people who can’t speak English all the time. It’s not anywhere out of the ordinary — they’re just typical people.' Halpern said that the group 'acted like everybody else' but did face some challenges getting a handle of the strip club rules. 'From what I understand from some of the entertainers, they acted like they’ve never been in a place like this before,' Halpern added. 'They didn’t exactly know the rules and what’s going on.' He says some of them asked to touch the dancers, and they had to be told that it is illegal in the state of Massachusetts. Late Saturday, Halpern says he got a call from someone at the military base, asking if the three men were there. Crossing place: They were caught on the Rainbow Bridge near Niagara Falls as they tried to enter Canada . 'He said: ""We’re missing three people. They didn’t show back up. Are they at your place?’""' Halpern recalled to the Boston Globe. 'Which I thought was very strange.' Ms McNeely was also surprised when she saw the three men had been captured on Monday. However, their stop at the strip club appears to have helped in drumming up business for the Massachusetts bar. Halpern told Buzzfeed that several news stations have come out to do stories about the Afghan soldiers at his bar. 'To get TV advertising and not take any money out of the advertising budget is always good,' Halpern said. The three officers are currently in federal immigration custody in Batavia, NY and will likely be transported back to Afghanistan.

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Almost 80 members of Congress are asking federal regulator to keep in-flight cell phone calls banned, calling the calls an outright hazard to a the safety of everyone on board. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed allowing in-flight phone calls with modern technologies now able to deliver such mobile services. That proposal doesn't argue for or against the results of allowing calls, only the technical merits. Almost 80 members of Congress are asking federal regulator to keep in-flight cell phone calls banned, calling the calls an outright hazard to a the safety of everyone on board . Artstechnica reports that the proposal is being viewed as a way to 'lift outdated rules.' But Congressmen opposed to the change say there's more to consider than just the technical aspects. In a statement written Monday to the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, the Justice Department, and the Federal Communications Commission, the Congressmen detailed the many ways in which in-flight phone calls could be a hazard for passengers. 'The nature of an aircraft cabin would make it impossible for passengers to remove . themselves from loud or unwanted conversations and disputes, they wrote. 'Instead of . focusing on required safety-related tasks, flight attendants may be . forced to intervene in or mediate disputes between passengers on . appropriate content and volume of voice calls, thus distracting their . attention from other passengers and job responsibilities. Congressmen warn the calls could aggravate nearby passengers unable to keep from overhearing the conversations and exacerbate the already tense environment of a cramped airplane . 'Additionally, . when noise and distraction levels rise because of talking passengers, . the ability to hear important safety announcements, either from the . cockpit or cabin, will be impaired and crucial information may be . missed,' they concluded. Lawmakers also worry that phone calls could aggravate an already tense environment. 'Arguments in an aircraft cabin already start over mundane issues, like seat selection, reclining seats, and overhead bin space,' they wrote. 'And the volume and pervasiveness of voice communications would only serve to exacerbate and escalate these disputes.'","FCC proposal could allow in-flight calls calling bans 'outdated'

Scroll down for video . No laughing matter? Local news anchor Larry Potash appeared in a promo for 'WGN Morning News,' which purportedly featured complaints submitted by viewers . 'But we're not for everybody,' he continues. 'We got this message from Kenny Aaron. '""You're giggling like a moron at people's pain and ruin."" Sorry, Kenny.'

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Angel Sanches, 17, has been arrested on suspicion of strangling cousin Katherina Gonzalez, five, to death and hanging her body in a closet . A 17-year-old illegal immigrant who is accused of  strangling his five-year-old cousin to death before leaving her body hanging in a closet has admitted raping her. Angel Sanches-Zenteno was arrested earlier this month after Katherina Gonzalez's body was found inside a vacant apartment in Lake Highlands, Dallas. Sanches-Zenteno told police he was with the girl, but said another man who he identified only as 'Carlos' was responsible for her death. According to police Sanches-Zenteno told them his cousin followed him into the building after he was taken hostage 'Carlos'. Sanches-Zenteno claimed 'Carlos' forced him into the building at gunpoint before shutting him in the closet. He had initially told police that he 'did not rape' Katherina, according to police documents, reports Dallas News. He told another investigator that he did sexually assault the girl for 'less than a minute,' but did so because the other man was holding him at gunpoint and told him to. Police took DNA samples from Sanches-Zenteno and sent them away to a lab for analysis. The lab matched his DNA to some found in the girl’s underwear, reports the news website. Gonzalez' body was found in an abandoned property in this block of apartments (pictured). Sanches claims he was taken hostage by a man named 'Carlos' before his cousin followed him in and he escaped . A police officer takes photos at the building where the body of Katherina Gonzalez was found . But witness Freddie Washington says he saw Sanches-Zenteno lure Gonzalez into the abandoned housing block, telling the girl 'Come on, come on,' before the pair disappeared inside. Mr Washington told WFAA 8: 'I think he waited for me to leave around the corner and then took her into the vacant apartment.' Tributes are left to the little girl who was found dead September 2 following a search for her after she was reported missing by her family . According to reports, Gonzalez was staying with her uncle at the time of the attack because both of her parents were at work. Officers were called to reports that Gonzalez had gone missing, and after a thorough search found her body hanging in the closet. He has now been charged with aggravated sexual assault in addition to capital murder. Police said in an arrest warrant affidavit: 'At this time, the alleged second suspect has not yet been located.' Police said he is an undocumented immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for six months to a year.","Angel Sanches, 17, arrested after Katherina Gonzalez's body was found .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A fraternity at Texas Tech University has been suspended after posting a banner reading 'No Means Yes' at a party. The sick slogan was displayed at a Phi Delta Theta party in Lubbock, Texas at the weekend, along with other misogynistic posters, including one of a woman's genitals acting as a working sprinkler. After the images emerged on social media and fraternity websites, the chapter's activities were suspended and officials at the university said they are investigating. 'We are deeply concerned by the images provided from the alleged event,' Sean Wagner, Associate Executive Vice President, said in a post of Phi Delta Theta's website. Sick: A fraternity at Texas Tech University has been suspended after members displayed this rape slogan, 'No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal', at a party at the weekend. The fraternity has apologized . 'Phi Delta Theta has zero-tolerance for any behavior that promotes misogyny or promotes a sexually hostile environment.. Anyone found to be directly involved in the severely misguided decision will be held accountable, and education in this area will be provided.' It added that the event had been 'unsanctioned'. Texas Tech spokesman Chris Cook added: 'Sexual misconduct is a serious issue, and an investigation into this incident is ongoing.' Trey Hudgins, president of the Tech chapter of the fraternity, apologized for the incident in a statement on Tuesday, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported. 'On behalf of the men of Texas Epsilon, I want to apologize for the inappropriate signage displayed during a social event this past weekend,' he said. 'The images and statements do not represent the values of Phi Delta Theta or the feelings of the Texas Epsilon chapter towards women. It was a terrible error in judgment. We are cooperating with Texas Tech and General Headquarters officials in an investigation regarding this matter.' Investigation: Officials from the university, pictured, are investigating, while the fraternity's national organization is also looking into the claims . Posts about the incident have now been removed from Facebook and websites, including Total Frat Move, which first posted about the images. The fraternity was temporarily suspended in 2001 after a former member was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and intoxicated assault at a party, according The Daily Toreador. The slogan, which reads in full 'No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal', was also used at Yale in 2011, where it sparked a major controversy when pledges chanted it as they walked around campus. The fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, was banned from campus for five years. The incident appeared in a federal complaint against Yale for being 'sexually hostile', which led to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.","The rape slogan appeared at a party hosted by Phi Delta Theta this weekend .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Virgin Australia will beef up the comfort of air travel  next year as the airline moves to introduce additional leg room for each class of traveller. In an announcement which aims to put it on top of Australia's list of air carriers, the company launched its new look cabins for 2015 across its Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 aircraft's on Wednesday. Three classes - economy plus, business lite and the futuristic looking business first - will be part of the re-design with each category equipped with loads of additional leg room. Scroll down for video . The futuristic looking business first bed offering 80 inches of leg room will be rolled out from next year . 'Business  lite' passengers will enjoy a three-inch upgrade from 38 to 41  while those opting for the more expensive-style bedding have been luxuriously catered for with  80 by 28 inch dimensions making it 'the business class to beat.' The extra-wide and extra-long flat beds will debut on Virgin's Airbus 330 in March 2015, with all six of the twin-aisle transcontinental jets upgraded by July. Virgin will position the new seats as a 'business first' product, although it hasn't yet settled on a marketing moniker for the seats. The 1-2-1 layout on both the A330s and Boeing 777s will provide direct aisle access for every passenger. Business class passengers will see a newly-designed business class bar with face-to-face service for up to four seated guests . Virgin Australia CEO John Borghetti said Virgin is moving in to uncharted territory as it looks to trump rival Qantas. 'We've taken the fight to Qantas, this will widen the gap in our favour,' he said. 'I would classify this as more 'business first' than business class.' Details on the company's economy plus seating are yet to be revealed but all three classes will see seats removed in order to make way for the additional room. A prototype of the new business class bed was launched today by CEO John Borghetti . As well as being 80 inches wide the bed will also offer 28 inches of space in width . Mr Borghetti said premium economy has been designed for budget business passengers  looking for a more comfortable journey. 'This is going to be a more exclusive cabin' he said. 'The intention isn't economy plus but 'business lite', so while we pitch our new business class at halfway between business and first, premium economy will be halfway between economy and business but certainly closer to business class.' This will also include an upgrade of the meals with consulting chef Luke Mangan 'already working on a new menu for us.' The announcement looks to move Virgin Australia atop the list of Australia's air travel companies trumping Qantas . The 1-2-1 layout on both the A330s and Boeing 777s will provide direct aisle access for every passenger. However, the premium economy bar will be axed as part of the make-over and a new bar introduced for business class guests that will offer face-to-face service. The redesign at the pointy end of the plane is based on the Super Diamond bed design from B/E Aerospace and customised by London-based design agency Tangerine. Decked out in contemporary charcoal with brushed aluminium trimming, the bed is 80 inches long and 28 inches wide. Installing the new seats will see Virgin's business class cabin on the A330 shrink from 24 seats to 20, but Borghetti promised the fares 'will remain competitive' against Qantas. 'Everywhere we've operated we've always brought fares down, so they have to be competitive, but that said, people will be prepared to pay for this product,'  he said.","New look cabins for air carrier look to make it Australia's best .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Cadillac wants a jolt from the city that never sleeps. General Motors' 112-year-old luxury car division, founded in Detroit and named for the city's founder, is moving its headquarters to New York. Man with a plan: Johan de Nysschen, who joined Cadillac from Nissan last month as its new president, said the move was a necessary part of restoring the struggling brand . Cadillac, which has been steadily losing sales to its German rivals, wants to get closer to its ideal buyers. Executives and marketing staffers will set up shop in a loft office in Manhattan's trendy SoHo neighborhood starting next year. 'There is no city in the world where the inhabitants are more immersed in a premium lifestyle than in New York,' Johann de Nysschen, the brand's new president, said in a statement issued Tuesday announcing the move. 'It allows our team to share experiences with premium-brand consumers and develop attitudes in common with our audience.' Cadillac will become a separate business unit, giving it more freedom to chase global growth. Most product engineering and design will remain in Detroit. Cadillacs will continue to be built at plants in Michigan, Texas, Canada, Mexico and China. The company is still evaluating which employees will go to New York, but spokesman David Caldwell said it's likely fewer than 100 people will move in the first phase next year. General Motors employs 46,000 people in Michigan. Allen Adamson, managing director of branding firm Landor Associates in New York, said the advantage of New York is its proximity to the luxury market. 'You have to catch trends closer to potential buyers,' Adamson said. 'There are more hedge fund billionaires in NYC than there are in Detroit. The team will be closer to the luxury market and luxury users.' Relocation: Cadillac will move its business unit, made up of mostly marketing, from Detroit, Michigan (pictured) to New York in 2015 . Adamson said it's also less important today for car brands to be linked to manufacturing centers like Detroit. Fiat Chrysler's new global headquarters will be in London, for example. 'Cars today are less about the functionality of wheels and transmission and more about total experience: music, computer integration, the experience driving it,' he said. 'I don't think the expertise is necessarily tied to a particular geography.' Right now, New York is Cadillac's fourth-best U.S. market, behind Texas, Florida and Michigan. That could change, although analysts say most consumers won't know where the brand is headquartered. GM is also the maker of Chevrolet, Buick and GMC. Corporate moves are something of a specialty for de Nysschen, who became Cadillac's chief in August. He was head of Audi's U.S. division when it moved its U.S. headquarters from suburban Detroit to Virginia in 2007. In 2012, he took over Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand, which had just moved its headquarters from Japan to Hong Kong. Infiniti struggled immediately after the move, but new products helped its sales jump 30 percent in the first half of this year. Cadillac sales are up 10 percent worldwide through August. Sales are up 70 percent in China, where the newly revamped CTS sedan just went on sale. But in the U.S., Cadillac isn't performing as well. 'Trendy': The new HQ will be at a yet-to-be-disclosed site in Manhattan's hip SoHo district . Sales have slumped nearly 5 percent this year despite well-reviewed new vehicles like the ATS coupe and XTS sedan. U.S. luxury car sales have grown at more than double the pace of non-luxury car sales so far this year. But Cadillac is missing out on those buyers. Audi sales are up nearly 15 percent, BMW is up almost 12 percent and Mercedes-Benz is up 9 percent, according to Autodata Corp. Toyota's Lexus luxury brand posted a 16 percent increase through August. GM's product development chief, Mark Reuss, said Tuesday that Cadillac's sales have been disappointing. Reuss said Cadillac is making good products but needs better support from marketing. The move to New York should help that, he said. 'We need to get some fresh thinking into that brand,' he said. Eric Ibara, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said Cadillac has discovered that making competitive products isn't enough. He thinks the move will help Cadillac rebrand itself in a way that better suits the sleek vehicles now in its showrooms. Slump: Cadillac's U.S. sales are down nearly 5 percent this year, even though luxury vehicle sales and the overall U.S. market are growing . Cadillac isn't the first Detroit brand to leave the Motor City. Ford's luxury Lincoln brand moved its ad agency, Hudson Rouge, to New York in 2011.

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Alistair Darling today accused defeated SNP leader Alex Salmond of having ‘lost the plot’ for claiming Scotland could declare independence without a referendum . The former Better Together chairman said Mr Salmond had not been able to accept last week’s crushing rejection of independence. It came after Mr Salmond claimed ‘a referendum is only one of a number of routes’ to independence. But addressing the Labour Party conference in Manchester today, Mr Darling said: ‘Apparently, the First Minister of Scotland said today while he'd lost the referendum, never mind, he might be able to seize power some other way.’ He added: ‘I just say to Mr Alex Salmond - you lost the argument, you lost the referendum, you've lost office, and now you've lost the plot. The people of Scotland are sovereign and the people of Scotland have said “no thanks” to separation and you must accept that result.’ Former Chancellor Alistair Darling, who led the campaign against independence, said Alex Salmond had 'lost the plot' Mr Darling’s remarks came as Labour leader Ed Miliband snubbed Gordon Brown’s role in helping turn around the ‘No’ to independence campaign after publicly thanking every major political figure who fought for the Union – apart from the former Prime Minister. Mr Brown’s intervention– bringing together the main Westminster political leaders to sign a joint ‘vow’ promising new powers for Scotland – has been hailed across the political divide. Even Mr Salmond said the No campaign’s last minute promise of more powers for Holyrood had swayed voters. But the outgoing First Minister, who dramatically announced he was stepping down from the job on Friday, has accused David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband of reneging on their word. Mr Salmond said despite last week’s referendum defeat the ‘writing is on the wall’ for the Union. Mr Salmond said: ‘I think the destination is pretty certain, we are only now debating the timescale and the method.’ Interviewed yesterday on Sky News, Mr Salmond said: ‘There are a whole range of ways Scotland can improve its position in pursuit of Scottish independence.’ He added: ‘I think referendums are great, they have been my policy and even I have been surprised by an 85 per cent poll and the degree of public engagement, but of course for many years there was a “gradualist” attitude to independence. ‘That is to say you establish a parliament, you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent. Many countries have proceeded through that route. ‘There is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well - so a referendum is only one of a number of routes. ‘I think it’s the best route incidentally, that’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many.’ Ed Miliband (centre) praised Labour MPs involved in the Scottish 'Better Together' campaign- but did not mention Gordon Brown . Outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that Scotland could become independent without a referendum . Mr Salmond's remarks came amid mounting nationalist fury over the perception that Westminster was wobbling over honouring its promise to devolve more powers to Scotland. The three main Westminster party leaders made a ‘vow’ to Scottish voters that new powers over tax, welfare and spending would be transferred to Edinburgh. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there could be a vote in the Commons on the proposals by March next year. He said: 'Of course, the Parliamentary timetable is not in Labour's hands. I would like to see a Second Reading of the Bill by Easter but we will seek to ensure that it is brought in at the latest in the first legislative week of the new Parliament in June.' But the Prime Minister shocked Westminster on Friday morning – just hours after the result was announced – by revealing that any new devolution of powers to Scotland would have to go hand in hand with ‘English votes for English laws’. Mr Cameron’s demand sparked an angry backlash from Labour MPs – with Ed Miliband accusing the Prime Minister of playing politics with Westminster’s pledge to transfer powers to Scotland. The Prime Minister has insisted that the timetable for further devolution would be met.","Former Better Together chairman says Mr Salmond has not accepted result .

"By . James Chapman for the Daily Mail . Ed Balls will announce today that child benefit cuts will be extended for another two years under Labour . Child benefit cuts will be extended under a Labour government, Ed Balls will announce today. The Shadow Chancellor will pledge to keep the cap imposed on millions of families by George Osborne for another two years. But critics pointed out that he has spent the past four years opposing the Chancellor’s successful debt reduction strategy. With polls suggesting Labour trails the Conservatives by 25 points on the economy, Mr Balls will use his conference speech to insist the party can be trusted to balance the books if it wins power in next year’s election. He will say that Mr Osborne’s cap of one per cent on child benefit increases – a cut in real terms – would be extended into 2016/17, saving a further £200million. Winter fuel allowances would be stripped from better-off pensioner. Incoming Labour ministers would take a five per cent pay cut and have their pay frozen until its deficit targets are met – mirroring a pledge by Mr Osborne when the Coalition came to power in 2010. Senior Conservatives said Mr Balls’ announcements involved ‘tiny’ savings in terms of the vast budget deficit that needs to be plugged. Analysis published today claims that Labour tax policies could cost the UK 300,000 jobs and more than £25billion in GDP. The Centre for Policy Studies report analyses ten major tax announcements made by the Opposition, including an increase in corporation tax for most firms from 20 per cent to 21 per cent, a new top rate of income tax of 50p, a mansion tax on expensive homes, and a new financial transactions tax. In his speech, Mr Balls will insist: ‘Labour’s economic plan will balance the books. But an economic plan must do much more than that. We also need to change the way our economy works. Because while our economy is growing again most working people are still not seeing any benefit from the recovery. ‘This is our task: not to flinch from the tough decisions we must make and to show the country that there is a better way forward. Labour’s plan for Britain’s future: to build an economy that works for the many, and not just a few – for all working people in every part of our United Kingdom.’ He will insist Labour ‘won’t duck the difficult decisions’ on the economy, adding: ‘Working people have had to balance their own books. George Osborne’s cap of one per cent on child benefit increases was imposed on millions of families . ‘So Labour will balance the books in the next parliament. These will be our tough fiscal rules. We will get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next parliament. ‘The next Labour government will get the deficit down. And Ed Miliband and all my Shadow Cabinet colleagues are clear it will mean cuts and tough decisions and we will take the lead.’ Announcing the extension of the cap on increases in child benefit, he will add: ‘We will have to make other decisions which I know will not be popular with everyone. ‘At a time when the public services that pensioners rely on are under such pressure, we will stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners. ‘I want to see child benefit rising again in line with inflation in the next parliament, but we will not spend money we cannot afford. So for the first two years of the next parliament, we will cap the rise in child benefit at one per cent.’ Tory MP and Exchequer Secretary Priti Patel said: ‘This speech isn’t a serious plan for the economy – Labour would put the deficit up, not down. ‘For all his bluster, Ed Balls still refuses to admit that Labour spent too much and he’s opposed every decision we’ve taken to cut the deficit. All a Labour government would offer is more inefficient spending, more taxes and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ n Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to scrap elected Police and Crime Commissioners, branding the policy ‘fundamentally flawed’. The move would save £50million which could be ploughed back into frontline policing, she said.","Shadow Chancellor will pledge to keep cap imposed on millions of families .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Ed Miliband today publicly snubbed Gordon Brown after thanking every Labour MP who campaigned against Scottish independence – apart from the former Labour leader. Mr Miliband made an impromptu speech at the Labour Party conference to hail the efforts of those who defeated Alex Salmond last week. He welcomed onto the stage in Manchester a host of MPs while heaping praise on Labour activists and trade unionists who campaigned for the ‘No’ to independence group. But Mr Miliband pointedly failed to mention the former Prime Minister, whose intervention has been credited with helping to shore up leaking support for the Union in the final weeks of the campaign. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was credited with helping to get the 'No' to independence campaign back on track . It came after Mr Miliband yesterday shot down the suggestion of a return to the front bench for the former Prime Minister following his political come back during the referendum. Mr Brown was acknowledged by Margaret Curran, the shadow Scottish secretary, who said he had ‘electrified this campaign’. Mr Brown intervened in the final week before polling day to bring together the main Westminster political leaders to sign a joint ‘vow’ promising new powers for Scotland. Alex Salmond has since claimed that the No campaign’s last minute promise of more powers for Holyrood, orchestrated by Mr Brown, was crucial in winning the referendum for the ‘No’ campaign. But Labour leader Mr Miliband refused to acknowledge his predecessor’s impact. Speaking in Manchester this afternoon, he said he particularly wanted to thank ‘all of the people in the Scottish Labour party’ who helped defeat independence. He praised Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, her deputy Anas Sarwar and Better Together chairman Alistair Darling. Mr Miliband also thanked shadow ministers Margaret Curran, Jim Murphy and Douglas Alexander – as well as the Scottish Labour party and the Scottish trade unionists in general. Mr Darling, who led the Better Together Campaign, also spoke during the session to attack Mr Salmond for failing to accept the result of last week’s referendum. He also accused defeated SNP leader Mr Salmond of having ‘lost the plot’ for claiming Scotland could declare independence without a referendum . It came after Mr Salmond claimed ‘a referendum is only one of a number of routes’ to independence. Better Together chairman Alistair Darling was applauded for his efforts keeping the Union together at the Labour conference today - but Mr Brown was absent and unacknowledged . BBC presenter Andrew Marr performed an impression of Mr Brown during his interview with Ed Miliband yesterday. He asked the Labour leader if he would be prepared to give the former Prime Minster a job - but Mr Miliband said it was not on the cards . But addressing the Labour Party conference in Manchester, Mr Darling said: ‘Apparently, the First Minister of Scotland said today while he'd lost the referendum, never mind, he might be able to seize power some other way.’ He added: ‘I just say to Mr Alex Salmond - you lost the argument, you lost the referendum, you've lost office, and now you've lost the plot.

"By . Ian Poulter . The Ryder Cup gets underway on Friday as Europe look to retain the trophy after their sensational comeback in 2012 in the so called 'Miracle of Medinah' on US soil. Englishman Ian Poulter tells Sportsmail all you need to know about his European team-mates who will be in action at Gleneagles. (Top row L-R) Lee Westwood, Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, (middle row L-R) Ian Poulter, Thomas Bjorn, Stephen Gallacher, Justin Rose, Martin Kaymer, (front row L-R) Henrik Stenson, Rory McIlroy, Europe team captain Paul McGinley, Graeme McDowell and Sergio Garcia of the 2014 European team pose . Rory McIlroy . Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 4-3-2 . Honestly, is there anything more to say? Who wouldn’t want to partner Rory? I never thought I’d see the equal of the golf Tiger played in the summer of 2000 but Rory’s 12 rounds in July and August (at The Open, USPGA and Bridgestone) were every bit as good. Rory McIlroy will spearhead Europe's Ryder Cup charge . Martin Kaymer . Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 3-2-1 . He’s very German, isn’t he? Very efficient and like a machine when he’s on a roll. If he gets close to how he played in winning the US Open it’s bad news for the Americans. He blew everyone’s mind that week. Thomas Bjorn . Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 3-2-1 . I guess it’s because he’s chairman of our Tournament Players Committee, but I always think of him as the headmaster. Is it okay if I call him the old warrior? Big Liverpool fan but we won’t hold that against him. Denmark's Thomas Bjorn will act as Europe's 'headmaster' Victor Dubuisson . Ryder Cup record: Debut. Here’s something you didn’t know about our mystery Frenchman. He’s a huge petrolhead like myself. I like him a lot and I’ve got high hopes for him this week. He’s fearless, just like all the best Ryder Cuppers. Sergio Garcia . Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 16-8-4 . Isn’t it fabulous to see the old Sergio back among us this year? Finally settled off the course, and I’ve a feeling he’s going to deliver big time this week. Loves the Ryder Cup with a Poulter-like passion. Sergio Garcia is back to his best in time for the Ryder Cup . Justin Rose . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 6-3-0 . My oldest mate on tour. Vulnerable in the past but fulfilled all his potential now and I can’t see it ever going away like it did once. I don’t think it’s giving away any secrets to say I expect to partner him at some stage. Jamie Donaldson . Ryder Cup record: Debut. Looks to me like his game changed completely after winning against a high-class field in Abu Dhabi in January last year. From that point he became so strong and consistent. Welcome to the club, Jamie. Jamie Donaldson is making his Ryder Cup debut at Gleneagles . Henrik Stenson . Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 2-3-2 . It’s a good job it’s not an arm-wrestling contest because the Americans would have no chance against this man: 6ft 4in, 220lb of pure muscle — man, he is seriously strong. A funny guy, too. Graeme McDowell . Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 5-5-2 . We’ve seen it in majors and in Ryder Cups — G-Mac personifies guts. And, boy, can he putt. You could pile 11 men on his back and he would warrior through it, he’s that type of guy. Graeme McDowell personifies guts, according to Ian Poulter . Lee Westwood . Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 18-13-6 . Nine Ryder Cups and 40-odd wins around the world? Are you serious? I tell you, all those people who throw the major thing at him because he hasn’t won one haven’t a clue what they are talking about. Stephen Gallacher . Ryder Cup record: Debut. What a special week for him. His play in the qualifying process was so impressive he fully deserved his wildcard. He’s got a great record around Gleneagles as well. Do you think the home support for him might be quite impressive? Ian Poulter . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 12-3-0 . He’s been beyond useless all season but look at that Ryder Cup record. I can promise you this: he’s pumped, he’s ready and the postman is keen and eager to make another delivery. Ian Poulter was part of the Ryder Cup side who performed the 'Miracle of Medinah' in 2012 .

"By . Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . The Georgia Department of Public Health is facing a federal complaint from a man who allegedly suffered religious discrimination when his job offer was rescinded. 'I was shocked at what happened,' complainant Dr. Eric Walsh told WSBTV. 'I didn't know in the United States of America that something like this could happen when your work record is stellar.' The doctor and lay minister made remarks on both evolution and homosexuality in his video sermons, the affiliate station reported. 'If two adults agree to do something, then it's not wrong, because they're both consenting adults,' Walsh said in one clip obtained by the station. 'That is - that is doctrine from the pits of hell.' Scroll down for video . Complaint: Dr. Eric Walsh, pictured, says the Georgia Department of Public Health rescinded a job offer when they learned of his video sermons . In another, he said '...Because of evolution and this Satanic belief that man evolved from lesser beings.' In a sermon titled 'Culture, Sex and the Fight for Purity,' Walsh argued the devil used television to increase acceptance of gay marriage. Those videos are the reason Walsh is not employed with the Department of Public Health, Walsh told WSBTV. The Los Angeles Times reported the videos emerged in the wake of a decision by Pasadena City College to name Walsh its 2013 commencement speaker over a gay candidate.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A new 24-hour Tube service at weekends will begin in the early hours of September 12 next year to coincide with the start of the Rugby World Cup. The launch of the 'Night Tube' will see six trains operating every hour across central London lines including the Northern, Piccadilly and Jubilee lines. The Rugby World Cup tournament will be hosted in 13 venues around the country, including three in London - Twickenham Stadium, Olympic Stadium and Wembley Stadium - and the new service will provide fans attending these matches, and the expected 400,000 overseas visitors into England, with additional transport options. The 24-hour tube service was first promised by Mayor of London Boris Johnson and London Underground last November. Scroll down for video . The 24 hour weekend service will feature six trains running every hour through central London on the Jubilee, Victoria, Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines . The service is expected to reduce night time journeys by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour. It will also support London's businesses, jobs and leisure opportunities. In order to meet expected demand, there will be six trains per hour through central London on all Night Tube lines, including the Jubilee, Victoria and most of the Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines. On the Northern line, there will be eight trains per hour to meet demand at busy stations between Leicester Square and Camden Town. Mr Johnson said: 'London is a bustling, 24-hour global city and by this time next year we'll have a 24-hour Tube service to match. 'Running trains all through the night was once thought impossible, but with the huge investment we've put in and upgrades that have been delivered we stand ready to take the Tube to the next level. London mayor Boris Johnson said: 'London is a bustling, 24-hour global city and by this time next year we'll have a 24-hour Tube service to match' A map of south east London showing where the Bakerloo line may be extended past Elephant and Castle as far as West Wickham . 'As well as creating vital new jobs and giving a huge boost to our economy, the Night Tube will help millions of people to get around our city more easily and quickly. The evolution of the Night Tube will without doubt make London an even better place to live, work, visit and invest.' It comes as Mr Johnson recently released proposals for a large extension to the Bakerloo line beyond Elephant & Castle through south-east London. Possible new stops south could include Old Kent Road and New Cross to Lewisham, Catford, Beckenham and Bromley. Earlier this year Mr Johnson was accused of breaking promises he had made stating there would be no London Tube ticketing office closures. The planned office closures this year - which were strongly opposed by the unions - were one of the key issues that led to strikes widely condemned by Mr Johnson and London Underground leaders. Mr Johnson has said he hopes to prevent such strikes occurring in future by introducing rules requiring a majority of union members to vote in favour of the strike. Existing rules mean unions can order industrial action be securing only a majority among members who vote in a ballot. However, his proposed extension to the Bakerloo line has been highly anticipated. The upgrade, which will extend past Elephant & Castle into south-east London, is expected to relieve congestion on National Rail routes into the City and generate about £400 in annual economic benefits. However the upgrade would not occur until 2040. However, if it were to go ahead it is not expected to be upgraded until 2040. Mike Brown, managing director of LU, said: 'We are now less than a year away from the first ever 24-hour services operating on London Underground. Already over half a million Londoners use the Tube after 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays, and the introduction of the Night Tube, which will cut journey times and open up new possibilities across the night time economy, is a historic step in our modernisation of the Underground. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said the organisation welcomed the 24-hour service but wanted to ensure it was not going to be a 'low cost, low maintenance' service. He said: 'With Boris still wanting to axe 900 jobs and close all ticket offices, we want to ensure that the new service is properly staffed to ensure safe and secure travel for all passengers and that weekend maintenance work is not postponed to disrupt weekday services.' News of the 24-hour was met with cynicism from Mick Cash, Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary, who claimed it was a 'diversion' from the mayor's 'massive cuts and closures programme that will axe a thousand staff and decimate services and safety'. Relations between RMT and London Underground have been tense in recent months with a series of strikes organised. In May, a three-day strike that would have crippled parts of the train network was called off at the last minute following constructive talks.","New 24-hour weekend Tube service will begin on September 12 next year .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . Celtic were dealt a Glasgow derby in the quarter-finals of the League Cup — despite missing out on a long-awaited clash with Rangers once again. The Parkhead side notched their first clean sheet in nine games by beating Championship leaders Hearts 3-0 before a crowd of around 18,000 in the last 16. And their reward is a home clash with Partick Thistle as Rangers were pitched up against St Johnstone at Ibrox instead. John Guidetti fires Celtic into the lead against Hearts . Celtic were aided by a dreadful penalty miss from Osman Sow . Rangers join their Glasgow rivals in the quarter-finals with Ian Black getting on the scoresheet . ‘I said I would take whatever was coming and now we get Partick Thistle,’ said Deila. ‘That’s a difficult match as well, but the good thing is it’s at home. ‘We love to play in front of our fans in our stadium and you could see tonight how much the players enjoyed expressing themselves in front of them. Rangers v St Johnstone . Hibernian v Dundee United . Aberdeen v Hamilton Academical . Celtic v Partick Thistle . ‘I think tonight was a very good performance and I’ve been delighted to see a team which works very hard.’ Deila also praised new striker John Guidetti, who is on loan from Manchester City, after he scored his first goal for the club. Two penalties in a minute then saw Osman Sow waste the chance to level for Hearts before Kris Commons put the game beyond the Tynecastle men. Insisting his team would have won even if Hearts had levelled, however, Deila added: ‘I am very pleased with the performance and I think we look much stronger now.

But Guidetti’s first goal for Celtic was the highlight for a sparse home crowd, with Deila predicting many more for the Swedish striker. ‘John is a fantastic personality and someone we are looking forward to having here,’ added the Norwegian. ‘He has a big talent.

"By . Matt Chorley, Political Editor for MailOnline . Labour leader Ed Miliband tonight faces revolt from his English MPs over his refusal to bar Scottish MPs from voting on policies which only apply south of the border. Former Cabinet ministers Ben Bradshaw and John Denham have formed a new group dubbed English Labour to challenge the party leadership's refusal to admit it is 'unfair' for Scots to vote on English matters. Mr Miliband is under pressure for refusing to back home rule for England, and David Cameron said it should form part of the response to Scotland rejecting independence in last week's referendum. Former Labour Cabinet ministers John Denham (left) and Ben Bradshaw have challenged the party leadership's refusal to say it is unfair for Scottish MPs to vote on English laws . The Labour leadership is struggling to hold the line on the English votes issue, insisting it could 'drive our country apart'. Mr Cameron has said reform at the Commons should be carried out 'in tandem' with the further devolution to Holyrood promised by the leaders of the three main Westminster parties in the final days of the referendum campaign. Mr Miliband's chances of being able to form a Commons majority after the next general election are likely to depend on the votes of Scottish MPs. He has called for constitutional convention to consider wider issues of reform, and was asked 13 times by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether he backed the idea of 'English votes for English laws', but refused to give a direct answer. To add to the sense of confusion, Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman tonight told LBC: 'We do have to recognise there's an anomaly and look at different ways we can address that.' Now it has emerged that Labour MPs in England have formed a rebel bloc to challenge the leadership. Former Culture Secretary Mr Bradshaw told the Western Morning News: 'Our leadership has to be much clearer that there's a problem that needs addressing. 'They've very good at talking about devolution, they're very good at talking about powers to communities and local government. 'We need to be absolutely crystal clear there is an imbalance and unfairness in our constitutional settlement.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband have refused to say it is unfair for Scots to vote on policies which do not affect their constituencies . William Hague, the Leader of the House of Commons, said English votes for English laws 'could not be avoided' Commons leader William Hague tonight fired a warning at Labour that banning Scottish MPs from voting on English laws 'cannot now be avoided'. The former Foreign Secretary, emerging from a summit with Tory MPs at the Prime Minister's countryside retreat at Chequers, said 'English votes for English laws' was 'something we have to face up to' in the wake of the Scottish independence referendum. He said handing more devolved powers to Holyrood had to go hand in hand with less Scottish influence over English laws. But Mr Hague held out an olive branch to the Labour Party – insisting that it would be prepared to hold talks on the issue in the coming weeks. He said: 'We will be open to discussions - of course we will be - with the Labour Party and other parties as well.' However he stressed that the issue had to be dealt with and that if the Westminster parties - including the Liberal Democrats - could not reach agreement they would have to set out their rival positions at the general election in May. He said: 'This issue of fairness for England - as well as for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - I think is one that cannot now be avoided. That is now something we have to face up to. 'It has been discussed for a very long time. The time has now come to make some decisions about this.' Mr Bradshaw, who attended the inaugural meeting of the English Labour Party, with MPs, council leaders and representatives of the church and civic leaders, added: 'We have to acknowledge an unfairness where Scottish MPs vote on exclusively English matters. The question as to whether this is unfair has to be a 'yes'.' However, today shadow chancellor Ed Balls dodged questions about whether the system is fair six times. He told BBC Radio 4 only that he wanted a 'fairer' solution to the problem, but said: 'I think David Cameron is just trying to dupe people with an idea that he's got some easy, quick political fix which him and William Hague and George Osborne sorted out. 'You can't play political games with our constitution. I want fairness, but I'm not going to say there's an easy and fair solution to the question you're raising.' He continued that the Prime Minister was 'playing fast and loose with the whole of our Union'. Speaking at a fringe event in Manchester, Labour MP Simon Danczuk said Mr Miliband has to come out with substantial 'road map' to English devolution or he's in 'real trouble'. He added: 'If he doesn't address it tomorrow then he's got a real problem...then we are really on the back foot. 'Why we couldn't have had a good offer ready...just beggar's belief in my opinion.' Meanwhile Mr Denham, a former Communities Secretary, said the offer more powers to Scotland had to mean more autonomy for England too. He told The Telegraph: 'I think there's no doubt England needs to decide what it wants and that means you have to find a way that laws just affecting England have the consent of English MPs. 'So I don't have a problem with the principle that [says] as the powers of the Scottish Parliament increase the role of Scottish MPs in English affairs is bound to decrease.' London Mayor Boris Johnson said proposals to hand sweeping new powers to Edinburgh were being introduced at a 'blisteringly fast' pace - despite claims by Scottish nationalists that Westminster was 'reneging' on its campaign promises. But he warned that the 'basic unfairness' of allowing Scottish MPs to vote on legislation which does not apply north of the border needed addressing. He said this 'can be done while keeping the Union together', but added: 'It is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight.' Prime Minister David Cameron Mr Cameron said the 'English votes for English laws' measure should be introduced 'in tandem' with handing new powers to Holyrood. The PM today held talks with senior backbenchers at his official country retreat, Chequers, to win support for his proposal.","English MPs including ex-Cabinet ministers form new rebel group .

Palmira Silva, 82, died after she was allegedly attacked with a machete by Nicholas Salvadore, 25, in the garden of her home in Edmonton, north London earlier this month. Today her loved ones said their final goodbyes to the Italian-born mother-of-two, gathering outside one of the London cafes that she ran with her family.

Tragedy: Mrs Silva, 82, (left) died after she was allegedly attacked with a machete by Nicholas Salvadore, 25, (right) in the garden of her home in Edmonton, north London earlier this month . Funeral procession: Today her loved ones said their final goodbyes to the Italian-born mother-of-two, gathering outside one of the London cafes in Edmonton, that she ran with her family . Other local traders and shoppers lined the street outside Silva's Cafe in Edmonton, many of them bearing bouquets of flowers as the hearse carrying Mrs Silva's body drove slowly past. Around 150 people turned out to see the funeral cortege pause at the cafe before it went on to a nearby church. Her coffin was accompanied on one side by a pink floral arrangement spelling 'Mum', and on the other the arrangement read 'Nonna' - the Italian for grandmother. A vibrant bouquet of sunflowers and roses had been placed atop the coffin, as mourners stopped next to the cafe to pay their respects. In memory: Her coffin was accompanied on one side by a pink floral arrangement spelling 'Mum', and on the other the arrangement read 'Nonna' - the Italian for grandmother . Sombre: Many of the mourners had dressed in black, and stood with their heads solemnly bowed as the cortege rolled past . Many of the mourners had dressed in black, and stood with their heads solemnly bowed as the cortege rolled past. For others, the sombre occasion became too much, and many shed tears, or embraced one another in grief. Mrs Silva, who was known as Pam, and her husband Domenico moved to separately to London from their native Italy in the 1950s to start a new life. Emotion:Friends and family members were joined by neighbours and local traders as they gathered to say goodbye to Mrs Silva at today's funeral . Sorrow: Mourners, many of them bearing bouquets of flowers gather as the funeral cortege travels past . The couple ran a restaurant business together and had two children, a daughter, Celestina, and a son, Rino. Mr Silva died in 2008 but in Edmonton, the family continued the business with Silva’s Cafe building up a solid base of regular customers who enjoyed Mrs Silva’s friendliness as much as her food. She had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe, a few minutes walk from her home, having handed over the running to Rino, now 53, after her husband died.

Mr Silva died in 2008 but in Edmonton, the family continued the business with Silva’s Cafe building up a solid base of regular customers who enjoyed Mrs Silva’s friendliness as much as her food. She had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe, a few minutes walk from her home, having handed over the running to Rino, now 53, after her husband died. Mrs Silva had only returned from a family holiday in Italy in the week before her death. Friends today recalled the woman who had no enemies. John Morris, 64, a retired carpenter, lived in the flat above the cafe for up to eight months four years ago. He said: 'I didn’t believe it when I heard it. I thought it might be someone of the same name. I couldn’t sleep for two nights about it. She was a beautiful person. 'I can’t think she’d had a holiday in 30 years, she lived for the cafe. She was very hard-working. 'She had time for everyone, I think she thought there was no such thing as an enemy.' Roger Turley, 72, a retired businessman, said: 'She cooked my meals for 20 years. Rino, her son, rang me and he could hardly speak. He said ‘My mother’s had her head cut off’ - what can you say to that? 'She could run that cafe on her own - didn’t take notes, took the orders, remembered what people wanted, how they liked it cooked, and who they all were. 'She was a remarkable woman. This is a very sad day.' Brenda Eberson, 73, said: 'I knew her well, she was a really beautiful lady. When my husband Peter and I would go past, she’d say ""Would you like to come in and have a cup of tea?"" 'I’m so sad, I couldn’t sleep when I was told.' Speaking after her death, Celestina said: ‘It’s just the most horrendous thing to do to another human being. We simply can’t make any sense of it.’ Scene: Police investigate the scene where Mrs Silva was found dead earlier this month . Mrs Silva was found dead at her home on September 4, and the cafe became a focus for tributes, with hundreds leaving messages of condolences and flowers. The house in the busy street where the Italian widow's body was found was the scene of a major police operation after officers were called to the scene initially to reports that a man had beheaded an animal. Scotland Yard said that its officers distracted the man after he was seen going through back gardens in Nightingale Road to prevent him attacking anyone else, while they evacuated people from nearby homes. Unemployed Salvadore, of Enfield, north London, was staying with a friend a few doors from the Italian widow at the time of her death. He is charged with murdering Mrs Silva and assaulting a police officer, PC Bernie Hamilton. He has not yet entered pleas to either of the charges.

"By . Ian Poulter . The Americans have a score to settle after surrendering the Ryder Cup back in 2012 after a sensational comeback from the Europeans. Englishman Ian Poulter gives Sportsmail the lowdown on the opposition as he aims to retain the trophy on home soil. (Top row L-R) Phil Mickelson, Keegan Bradley, vice captain Andy North, Bubba Watson, Matt Kuchar, vice captain Steve Stricker, (middle row L-R) Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Hunter Mahan, vice captain Raymond Floyd, (front row L-R) Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Tom Watson, Jimmy Walker and Jim Furyk of the US Ryder Cup team pose . Bubba Watson . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-5-0 . So unorthodox, but you have to say it’s impressive the way he gets it around. Don’t think he will be getting the crowd to applaud on the first tee this week, will he? It was great last time, though. 'Unorthodox' Bubba Watson says he won't be goofy in Gleneagles . Jimmy Walker . Ryder Cup record: Debut. Don’t know a lot about him, to be honest. Played with him recently and he seems quiet and shy. Certainly hits it a long way. One of those swings where you wouldn’t think he’d be long, but he is. Plenty of short game, too. Zach Johnson . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 6-4-1 . I admire him a lot. Done it his way since day one. Shut at the top of his backswing and hits it with a big draw but look how much he’s won. And he’s like G-Mac in the Ryder Cup — never knows when he’s beaten. Phil Mickelson . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 14-18-6 . The most accomplished member of this American team. I just love the fact he’s only ever had one caddie and what discussions they have! Sometimes it’s like they’re auditioning for the United Nations. Phil Mickelson (right) and his long-time caddie Jim Mackay . Jordan Spieth . Ryder Cup record: Debut. Reminds me a lot of the young Sergio Garcia in the way he has burst on the scene and looks so at home out there already. I think it’s brilliant the way he keeps churning out results. I don’t think he was ever off a leaderboard for his first 15 months on tour. Rickie Fowler . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 0-1-2 . Can be risky changing your swing but Butch Harmon has turned it around and Rickie was just amazing in the majors, with the lowest average score of anyone. A gutsy guy and one to watch this week, that’s for sure. Patriotic Rickie Fowler has had 'USA' shaved into the side of his head for the Ryder Cup . Matt Kuchar . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-2-2 . The 20-teeth plodder! Sorry Kooch, I mean it in the nicest sense. Another who does it his way and another who makes it work. Hardly ever misses a fairway and while his putting stroke is pretty unique, it gets the job done. Jim Furyk . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 9-17-4 . It’s not going to be easy for him after last time, is it? There must be some scar tissue in there, but you have to say his play over the last six months has been fantastic. Relies on his wedge play and there’s plenty to rely on. A dejected Jim Furyk after his loss on the 18th in Medinah in 2012 . Patrick Reed . Ryder Cup record: Debut. I’ve barely spoken to him but he’s won three times so he’s obviously got a very decent game. Would he hold it against me if I said that claiming to be a world top five player is probably stretching it, though? Keegan Bradley . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-1-0 . You won’t be surprised to learn I love the fire he brings to the Ryder Cup. Okay, the caddie went over the top last time, swirling the flag above his head, but Keegan gets it and that’s great to see. Keegan Bradley practised alongside Phil Mickelson,  Rickie Fowler and rookie Jimmy Walker on Wednesday . Webb Simpson . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 2-2-0 . Gotta be honest — I can’t remember anything he’s done this season. But he’s steady, he’s a major winner and putting is his strong suit, which is never a bad thing at a Ryder Cup. Hunter Mahan . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-2-3 . Will be itching to make amends after Celtic Manor. An understandable wildcard pick, given he won a tournament this month. Makes lots of birdies, so watch for him in the fourballs.","US out for revenge after Europe pulled off the 'Miracle of Medinah' in 2012 .

"By . Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail . It was from Gleneagles four years ago that Justin Rose received the most disappointing phone call of his professional career. A recent two-time winner on the PGA Tour, he received the depressing news that he had been overlooked for a wildcard for the Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor. There’s something poetic, then, about the fact his first home Ryder Cup should be taking place here, of all places. Justin Rose is all smiles again - four years on from his Ryder Cup snub at Celtic Manor . Justin Rose takes a look at Rickie Fowler's new haircut at the 2014 Ryder Cup Gala Dinner . Justin Rose talks tactics with Ian Poulter during a practise session on Wednesday . ‘Funny how things turn out,’ he said, smiling. ‘Given the weather at Celtic Manor and the fact it didn’t finish until Monday, I’d imagine it would have been somewhat disappointing for a debut. But you can’t ask for anything better than this for your first one, and in front of a Scottish crowd.’ Rose underlined his affinity with these parts with a links masterclass at Royal Aberdeen in July to walk away with the Scottish Open. It will earn him some extra kudos from the locals and he’s certainly looking forward to that after what happened at Medinah. The Englishman’s stirring victory over Phil Mickelson in the singles and the three clutch putts he holed on the final three holes to snatch a win on the 18th were an essential part in the making of the miracle. Justin Rose is looking forward to playing on home soil after a frosty reception in Chicago . But it was what happened outside the ropes that has left him looking forward to playing in front of a home audience for a change. ‘Chicago is a rough, tough sports crowd, that’s for sure,’ he said. ‘There were definitely some occasions on that final day where you were thinking to yourself, “Woah, too far”. But it made it all the more enjoyable the way it turned out. ‘The crowd can definitely have a big impact on the outcome. When the place went silent it really was a case of it being deafening for the Americans. Hopefully, we can avoid that.’ The belief that coursed through Rose following that win over Mickelson has been evident in his wonderfully consistent form since, plus that breakthrough major victory at the US Open last year. Justin Rose's belief has grown since his US Open victory last year . ‘It’s fair to say it was the making of me in a way,’ he said. ‘It’s definitely one of those things you draw upon in the pressure moments. ‘Straight after Medinah I won a matchplay tournament in Turkey against players like Tiger and Rory and it has just gone on from there.’ He has been watching highlights of Medinah in recent weeks. ‘I always know when it’s been on at home because I get about 50 tweets from people saying how much they love watching it over and over,’ he said. ‘If someone had said to me growing up that I’d be part of perhaps the greatest Ryder Cup of all time, I’d have gone, “Wow, that’s amazing”.’ Justin Rose practised with Ian Poulter, who he is likely to partner in foursomes . Rose practised on Wednesday with the two players who will almost certainly be his partners over the weekend — Henrik Stenson in fourballs and old mate Ian Poulter in foursomes. It’s a lovely story how these two have gone from sharing rooms on the Challenge Tour in their formative days to sharing the biggest stage at the Ryder Cup. Could he have imagined it, back then? ‘I’m sure Poults would have had no trouble imagining it,’ he said, laughing. ‘I was just trying to hit the next fairway. No, it’s great for us obviously to see how far we’ve come.’ Anything different he notices about Poulter at the Ryder Cup? Ian Poulter, Justin Rose, Paul McGinley and Sergio Garcia chat on the green . ‘In a regular event he gets in and does his business and leaves but at the Ryder Cup he’s a lot more vocal,’ said Rose. ‘He’s not scared of being the leader in that environment and speaking his mind. With his record, he’s now even more confident of saying what he feels and that makes him a great team-room man. ‘A lot of guys might have good things to say but might just hold it back.’ Rose’s two appearances, in 2008 and 2012, have resulted in a fine record from nine matches that has seen him win twice as many games as he has lost, and he’s surely been assigned a key role this time. Here in Scotland, the Scottish Open champion is ready to feel the love. The best performance I’ve seen? Twist my arm and I’d settle for Ian Poulter last time over Seve in 1987, Monty in 2002 and Lee Westwood in 2004. But one other might top them all when you factor in the emotional context and that was Darren Clarke at the K Club in 2006. As he played on following the death of his wife little more than a month earlier, everyone was in bits. Big Darren completed three matches against Tiger and the rest and emerged with three victories. Then he broke down and cried ...and drank a pint of Guinness in about five seconds flat.","Recent two-time PGA Tour winner was overlooked at Celtic Manor in 2010 .

"By . Paul Newman for MailOnline . James Taylor and Ravi Bopara have been named in an England one-day squad laden with experience to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the World Cup. Sportsmail exclusively revealed the 16-man squad England will take to the sub-continent which is heavily reliant on the tried and trusted with Alastair Cook in charge. There is no place for Surrey’s big-hitting Jason Roy, who England believe is not yet ready for 50-over international cricket, but there are reprieves for Taylor and Bopara who both missed out on the 3-1 one-day series defeat by India. James Taylor will be handed a late World Cup opportunity when named in the ODI squad to face Sri Lanka . Probable  squad for Sri Lanka: Cook (capt), Ali, Anderson, Bell, Bopara, Buttler (wkt), Finn, Gurney, Hales, Jordan, Morgan, Root, Stokes, Taylor, Tredwell, Woakes. The unlucky Taylor has been consistently overlooked but is finally rewarded for prolific runscoring for Nottinghamshire, particularly in limited-overs cricket, while Bopara is welcomed back after his controversial omission. Ian Bell, despite only three hundreds in 148 one-day internationals, makes the cut for a seven-match series in Sri Lanka that will provide testing preparation for England in November and December ahead of February’s World Cup. The retention of Cook as captain was far less certain in one-day cricket than for the Test arena but the vote of confidence from the selectors now is confirmation of their desire for him to lead England in the World Cup. Ravi Bopara (pictured playing for Essex in the County Championship on Wednesday) will also be included . Alastair Cook will lead England at next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand . Eoin Morgan's form in the 50-over game has been a source of concern for the England selectors . Ian Bell has made the cut despite scoring just three hundreds in 148 one-day internationals . Cook has his detractors in limited-overs cricket but the fact remains that he has five one-day hundreds, is one of the top 10 runscorers in world 50-over cricket since the last World Cup and has a strike-rate as captain comparable to Michael Clarke’s. He has silenced doubters before and is determined to do so again, as he told Sportsmail in an exclusive interview where he said he would be 'devastated' to miss out now, before almost certainly handing over the one-day reins after the World Cup. The difficulties encountered by Alex Hales on his step up to 50-over international cricket against India, where he was quickly worked out by Indian seamers using two new white balls, convinced the selectors that there is still more chance of Test-class batsmen in Cook and Bell scoring centuries than an exciting Twenty20 rookie like Roy. There have been more concerns among the selectors about Eoin Morgan’s form than Cook’s but he made a welcome return to something close to his best in the Twenty20 international that finished the international season. Morgan remains a key figure if England are going to upset the odds and compete for their long overdue first World Cup title, something they have not come even close to since losing the 1992 final to Pakistan in Melbourne. England have under-achieved in limited-overs cricket for much of the 22 years since but they did briefly reach the top of the world one-day standings two years ago and reached the final of last year’s Champions Trophy under Cook’s captaincy and using the traditional one-day methods they continue to advocate now. That means they will look to the likes of Cook, Bell and Joe Root to provide the anchor role and try to bat throughout the innings, leaving wickets in hand for Morgan, Bopara and Jos Buttler to explode in the final overs. There have been selectorial concerns over the one-dimensional nature of Harry Gurney but he survives now in a largely unchanged bowling attack because of coach Peter Moores preference for a left-armer and with there being few viable alternatives. The England Performance Squad, which will be based in Sri Lanka at the same time as the one-day series, will provide Roy with one last chance to stake his claim but time is running out for him and other aspirants to gatecrash England’s World Cup party. Surrey's big-hitting Jason Roy looks set to miss the cut as England don't believe he's ready for 50-over cricket .","Alastair Cook will lead England for the one-day series starting in November .

"By . Richard Gibson . Newly-appointed Leeds head coach Darko Milanic insists he does not fear the axe at Leeds despite the ruthless reputation of the club’s owner Massimo Cellino. Slovenian Milanic has signed a two-year contract at Elland Road after being headhunted by Leeds sporting director Nicola Salerno. The 46-year-old left Austrian Sturm Graz on Sunday just weeks into his second season in charge, having previously taken Maribor to multiple league tiles and participation in the Champions League. Slovenian Darko Milanic has been appointed as manager of troubled Leeds United . Leeds owner Massimo Cellino, speaking with Brian McDermott, has a reputation for sacking managers . Cellino sacked 36 managers in 22 years at his previous club Cagliari, and terminated Milanic’s predecessor Dave Hockaday’s reign after just six matches and 70 days. However, Milanic shrugged off the statistics, reflecting that managerial life expectancies are short anyway. “Our job is at risk on every game, I have to do my best. It doesn’t worry me,” he said, at his unveiling this morning. “I’m very motivated and excited about the new job at Leeds United. I know this is a big traditional club with great supporters and they have very good quality in the team.” Former Leeds manager Dave Hockaday lost his job after only six games in charge at Elland Road . Salerno, who flanked Milanic at the press conference, hinted at further recruits from the continent after revealing multilingual qualities as one of the new coach’s biggest attractions. “We need an international coach because we have an international team,” Salerno said. However, Milanic confirmed that Leeds’ habitual caretaker manager Neil Redfearn, who steered the Championship club to three wins and a draw in his recent stint in charge, will remain in the dugout for Saturday’s match against Brentford and beyond. “In the first moment, it’s important to keep the ethusiasm. But I want to make some changes tactically,” said Milanic, who took his first training session on Tuesday. “I will speak to Neil over the next few days because he knows the team very well. If I need to know something I will talk to him.” Souleymane Doukara (C) scores against Huddersfield during Leeds god run under Neil Redfearn . Milanic is the eighth permanent managerial appointment Leeds have made since they dropped out of the Premier League 10 years ago and his primary task is to return them there with haste. “When we talked last Sunday he told me my job is to make the squad better to stay better on the field and to be prepared to play in the Premier League,” he said, of his conversations with Cellino. “I made a great job with Maribor but not in one month. I have no time limit. I have to do a great job as soon as possible.”","Darko Milanic has been named new manager of Championship club Leeds .

City were the club hit hardest by UEFA for breaching FFP rules - they and Paris St Germain were each fined £49million and handed both restrictions on transfer spending and a reduction in Champions League squad size. Manchester City supporters have joined legal action against financial fair play rules . Despite a fine and restrictions, the Premier League champions still bought Eliaquim Mangala for £32m . The action claims the FFP rules contravene European Union (EU) laws including the right to free competition. A statement from MCFC Supporters Club, which has almost 15,000 active members and 168 branches worldwide, said: 'Our members are consumers of the football product and it is as such that they denounce the EU competition law infringements caused by the UEFA break-even requirement. 'Far from implementing a true 'financial fair play', this rule is in fact a prohibition to invest that prevents ambitious owners to develop their clubs, that therefore shields the established European elite from being challenged (this elite being unsurprisingly the main sponsors of the UEFA rule) and that, consequently, puts additional financial pressure on supporters (higher prices and lower quality). Big spending Paris St Germain have also been hit heavily by UEFA's new regulations . 'With this UEFA rule, it is now almost impossible for any ambitious investor to take over a 'sleeping giant' and to turn them into the next Manchester City or Paris St Germain. 'In other words, the UEFA rule may be bad news for MCFC supporters, but it is even worse news for supporters of all clubs that do not today belong to the established European elite.' The legal action was brought by agent Daniel Striani and is being led by lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont, part of the legal team that won the Bosman ruling in the 1990s.","MCFC Supporters Club have joined legal action against UEFA's FFP rules .

"By . Robin Cottle for MailOnline . Fernando Torres scored in his first start for AC Milan as his side came back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at promoted Empoli in Serie A. After early goals from Lorenzo Tonelli and Manuel Pucciarelli, Torres found the target with a header in the 43rd and Japan midfielder Keisuke Honda equalized with a shot from the edge of the area in the 58th. Milan had a chance to win when Torres, who joined Milan last month in a two-year loan deal from Chelsea, set up Jeremy Menez in the 62nd but the Frenchman's shot hit the crossbar. Fernando Torres celebrates his first AC Milan goal . The former Chelsea striker's brilliant header brought his new side back into the Serie A clash . 'He's a real professional,' Milan full back Ignazio Abate said of Torres, 'I'm sure he'll bring us many satisfactions.' Empoli finished with 10 men after Mirko Valdifiori picked up his second yellow card in the 86th for a foul on Nigel de Jong. Milan moved level with Hellas Verona in third place, two points behind leaders Roma and Juventus, which both play Wednesday. Roma visits Parma and Juventus hosts Cesena. Empoli has only two points from four matches and is back in the top division after a six-year absence, But it came out full of energy while Milan, which was coming off a draining 1-0 loss to Juventus, appeared to lack organization in defense. In four matches this season, Milan has conceded eight goals . 'We started too softly and this was a match full of dangers,' Abate said. 'There's a lot of room for improvement and we've got to start with what we showed in the second half tonight.' Fernando Torres gets a high five from Nigel de Jong on his first Milan start . And Keisuke Honda's late strike earned Milan a point . Tonelli took advantage of Milan's defensive lapses by heading in following a corner in the 13th after being left unmarked inside the box. Empoli's second goal was a perfectly executed free kick, as Francesco Tavano's smart touch left Pucciarelli with only the goalkeeper to beat. Simone Verdi had a chance to make it 3-0 in the 31st but his header sailed just high. Shortly after Torres found the far corner of the net, Empoli coach Maurizio Sarri was sent off for protests. Tavano had a chance to restore Empoli's two-goal lead in the 55th but he couldn't finish off a counterattack - shooting wide as defenders Daniele Bonera and Cristian Zapata trailed behind him. Honda's equaliser came from a shot that went through a defender's legs.","Fernando Torres heads his first AC Milan goal at Empoli .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . At some point, Osman Sow’s spot-kick will re-enter Earth’s atmosphere, scattering debris in its wake. When it returns to terra firma Hearts will still be reflecting on the chances they blew to send Celtic into a tailspin. It was comfortable for the league champions in the end. On-loan John Guidetti’s first goal for the club brought an early birthday present for his watching father Mike. But the outcome of this game undoubtedly hinged on two penalties early in the second half. Sow, the gangling Hearts matchwinner against Rangers on the opening day of the Championship season, struck a dubious award high into the heavens in the 54th minute. Osman Sow blazes a horrendous penalty over Craig Gordon's crossbar . It was a real head in hands moment for Sow as he wasted the chance to drag Hearts level . And moments later Kris Commons showed Osman Sow how it's done from 12 yards . Within 60 seconds another Willie Collum award at the other end was thumped past Neil Alexander by Kris Commons. The contrast between the execution of the penalties was stark. For Hearts the game was up. Celtic: Gordon; Izaguirre, Ambrose, Van Dijk, Denayer (O'Connell 45); Brown, Johansen; McGregor (Tonev 72), Stokes; Guidetti (Scepovic 64) Subs not used: Zaluska, Bitton, Griffiths, Kayal . Goals: Guidetti (24), Commons (57 pen), Eckersley (61 o.g) Booked: Denayer, O'Connell . Hearts: Alexander; Paterson, Wilson, Ozturk, Eckersley; Walker (Keatings 78), Gomis, Buaben, Nicholson, Carrick (Holt 64); Sow (El Hassnaoui 78) Subs not used: Gallacher, McHattie, Robinson, McGhee . Booked: Ozturk, El Hassnaoui . Referee: Willie Collum . Attendance: 15,522 . Asked if there was a lack of conviction to Sow’s lofted, awful attempt Robbie Neilson took solace in black humour. 'I think there is a lot of conviction in it. It’s still coming down. 'He has gone up there and smashed it and I would rather someone went up there with a bit of conviction than flaff it or try to chip it. 'At least Osman has had the strength to go up and take it but that’s the small margins in football. 'The boys rallied round him at the end. He is a big character and we move on. You miss some, you score some. 'At 1-0 down you score that and it’s a different game. You miss it, Celtic go up the park and score.' The penalty was hardly an isolated chance. Jamie Walker struck the crossbar with a great chance at the end of the first half. Adam Eckersley’s own goal handed Celtic a cheap third goal and merely confirmed the feeling that Hearts were architects of their own downfall once again against Celtic. There were plenty pre-match who fancied the Edinburgh side. The Championship leaders were available at a generous 11/1 at one bookmaker. Against an unconvincing Celtic side of late that looked a very decent bet. Yet Guidetti, on loan from Manchester City, had a motivation of his own driving him on. The striker’s father celebrates his birthday today and after opening his account last night the player said: 'I have good people around me, not only my father but many people that are good. On-loan Manchester City striker John Guidetti fires in his first goal for Celtic . The Swedish hitman wheels away to celebrate his powerful strike . John Guidetti is delighted to get off the mark for his temporary club . Aleksander Tonev (27) thought he had also scored his first Celtic goal - but it's chalked off for offside . “Since it’s his birthday he is my dad that was a birthday present for him. 'He was here tonight as always and I am trying to get him tickets for Paolo Nutini – he is a big fan. 'I heard Paolo was a Celtic fan but he is sold out and I am not getting a follow back on Twitter. I am disappointed. 'Maybe after the goal tonight we can sort it out. This is what I want to give dad for his birthday.' The Swede blew a golden chance for his first goal in Celtic colours when Alim Ozturk’s efforts to usher a Callum McGregor through ball back to Alexander was poor, allowing Guidetti to nip in and slot wide. Kris Commons and Scott Brown – with a thumping half volley from 18 yards – forced Alexander into further resistence before Guidetti justified the decision to hand him the number nine shirt. Emilio Izaguirre had one of his best nights in some time here, unfortunate to lose the man of the match award to Scott Brown. The Honduran foisted a series of inviting crosses into the area and his first, a piercing, curling effort, was headed unconvincingly up in the air by Danny Wilson - dropping invitingly for Guidetti to thump the ball into the net. Adam Eckersley is floored after putting through this own net . Hearts keeper Neil Alexander can't believe Adam Eckersley's own goal that killed off any hopes of a comeback . John Guidetti earns a handshake with his manager after his second half substitution . Celtic captain Scott Brown slides in on Hearts' Jamie Walker . Yet Hearts weren’t dead. Not by a long way. Izaguirre’s attacking heroics are often cancelled out by a defensive rush of blood and so it proved before half-time when his slack, aimless pass across his own 18 yard line deceived his team-mates and sent Jamie Walker in on goal. It was a glorious chance. One the winger almost tried too hard with, his thumping over-hit shot rattling off the face of the crossbar when he only had to guide the ball past Craig Gordon. With the booked Jason Denayer taken off before he was sent off after an early booking, Hearts sensed a renewed vulnerability in their hosts and earned their reward for a strong start to the second half with the Sow spot-kick. It was a distinctly soft award, the Swede caught by Virgil van Dijk in the area as he sought to control the ball. But everything about Sow’s spot kick was wrong. His run-up, his shooting action, the lax leaning back finish which flew over the crossbar, soaring towards Celtic’s Park’s deserted top tier. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon watches as Osman Sow blasts his penalty into orbit . Just moments later Alim Ozturk brings down John Guidetti for a Celtic penalty . And Kris Commons made no mistake from 12 yards with a cool finish . Anthony Stokes tried to get in on the act but he's off target . Kris Commons smashes his penalty past a static Neil Alexander . Emboldened Celtic made Hearts pay for their wastefulness. Racing onto an Efe Ambrose long ball Guidetti was clattered wildly by the upper arm of Ozturk. The central defender was booked, but the greater punishment came from the boot of Commons, last season’s top scorer rasping his spot kick low into the net for 2-0. From Walker’s shot against the crossbar to Sow’s penalty atrocity, Hearts had cause to wonder how it had come to this. They had blown it. Their wounds became gaping in 62 minutes when left-back Eckersley scored a mildly farcical own goal. Celtic goalscorers Kris Commons and John Guidetti celebrate . Scott Brown clears the ball ahead of Margaro Gomis . The former Manchester United and Aarhus defender made the bold decision to turn an Anthony Stokes corner back to Alexander with his chest, but succeeded only in guiding it into the bottom corner of his own net for 3-0. For Celtic a first clean sheet in nine games made this an unexpectedly comfortable night. 'I was happy that Guidetti got his first goal,' said Deila afterwards. 'He has been out for a long time and not played that many matches and that’s why we don’ t use him for 90 minutes. 'He made a huge impact tonight and that was good. 'We gave away some chances but they were down to individual mistakes and they are things that we can work on. We had plenty of opportunities to score and I felt we were well worth our win.'","Strikes from John Guidetti, a Kris Commons penalty and Adam Eckersley's own goal completed a comfortable victory .

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . Watching Cristiano Ronaldo slam home two more penalties on his way to eight goals in three games on Tuesday night it occurred to me just how much of a certainty it is that he will score every time Real Madrid are awarded a spot-kick. You could hang a couple of car tyres from the cross-bar, tell him the goal will only count if he puts the ball through one of them, then put two goalkeepers on the line… and he would still bury it. ‘It’s not normal’ is what so many rival coaches have said about him since he embarked on his one-man quest to become Real Madrid’s all-time top goal scorer five years ago. And no, it isn’t normal. Cristiano Ronaldo (right) is congratulated by Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale after scoring against Elche . Ronaldo scores from the penalty spot to put Real Madrid 2-1 up against Elche on Tuesday night . Ronaldo rises above the Elche defence to head the ball into the net for Real Madrid's third goal . Luis Enrique, long before he was Barcelona manager, once commented that what made Lionel Messi so incredible was not so much what he did, because all players are capable of a mazy dribble and a clever lobbed finish; especially in training or when they are developing as youngsters playing against players who are far inferior and who will never make the grade. No, the incredible thing about Messi was that he did it against great players in big games and he did it all the time, every week. He made fellow professionals look like the ‘not-very good’ kids in the playground. That is exactly what Ronaldo does. Take a top-flight keeper who week-in, week-out makes great saves and against the Portuguese football becomes a game of fetch – fetch the ball from the back of the net. Commanding central defenders are reduced to spectators in the penalty area as he leaps to head home another cross. Full backs look slow as he powers past them. That ability to be the perfect winger and the perfect centre forward in one player is another thing that makes him stand out. Ronaldo scores another goal from the penalty spot in Real Madrid's 5-1 La Liga victory over Elche . Ronaldo's four goals against Elche took his tally this season to 12 in eight games . Ronaldo points to the sky after scoring his fourth goal at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday night . Here are just some of the records Cristiano Ronaldo currently holds: . Forget for one moment the debate about him being the greatest player, is there a better header of the ball in world football at the moment? Almost definitely not. Some players have the spring, some have the direction in the header, the timing, the ability to hang in the air – Ronaldo has the lot. Then there is the desire to score as many goals as possible in every game. The fury when he misses a late chance to score a fifth. The wild celebration that greeted his insignificant fourth in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon last year. But for Ronaldo there is no such thing as an insignificant goal. Each one counts, every strike is another chip chiselled out of the block of stone from which he is making a statue of himself that will stand outside the Bernanbeu long after he retires. Only injury or a move away in the next couple of seasons will prevent him from becoming the club’s all-time top scorer and if he wins another European Cup someone who is every bit as important to them as Alfredo Di Stefano was. Ronaldo waves to the Real Madrid supporters at his unveiling in 2009 as Eusebio (back) watches on . Ronaldo walks out in front of a a packedBernabeu in 2009 as thousands turn out to welcome him .

Is he the club’s greatest goalscorer of all time? If he scores more than anyone else surely that argument will be settled? There will always be those who argue it is easy to score in the current Spanish league with its huge gulfs in budget between teams. But Spanish football has dominated European competition in recent years with Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao all making their mark. In the last 10 years six Europa League-winning clubs have hailed from Spain. It’s not a two-team affair and Ronaldo has scored against everybody. Ronaldo takes his shirt off in celebration after scoring to seal Real Madrid's Champions League victory in May . Ronaldo receives the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or award at the Kongresshaus in Zurich at the start of this year . It’s true there are a couple of featherweights at the bottom of the table, sides against which the last 10 minutes of matches can resemble Monday morning shooting practice but, all the same, such opponents still need to be beaten into submission and invariably it’s Ronaldo who has gleefully performed that task. With stories of a possible return to Manchester United some commentators last week raised eyebrows at the idea of signing Ronaldo aged 30 (as he will be next year). Can anyone see the decline? Does he not look physically just the same as he did five years ago. There is no reason why he can’t remain at his peak for another five years. Five more frightening years to add to the 25 hat-tricks and the 264 goals in 254 games. Raul is the club’s current top scorer on 323 goals. It took him 15 seasons and 741 games.

Angel di Maria doesn't often need to be carried by his team-mates, but on Friday Manchester United's British record signing hitched a lift to the training pitches with Juan Mata and David de Gea. The former Real Madrid star, who moved to Old Trafford for £60million, has made a strong impression since arriving from Spain, with a goal in a superb  display in the win over Queens Park Rangers last weekend. And the winger seems to be settling in well to life at United, joking around with his Spanish-speaking team-mates at United's Carrington training ground ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash against Leicester City and getting on the shoulders of Mata and then De Gea. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Angel di Maria gets a piggyback from his Manchester United team-mate Juan Mata as United trained at Carrington before Sunday's trip to Leicester . The Argentina winger and the Spanish playmaker appeared to be getting on well after both scored during the 4-0 thumping of QPR last weekend . Goalkeeper David de Gea also gave Di Maria a lift during Friday's session, and United's record signing seemed to be having a great time . Loan signing Radamel Falcao looked eager to kick-start his Manchester United career with a goal and could be set to make his first start at the King Power Stadium . Falcao and Marcos Rojo prepare for Friday's training session as United look to make up ground on pace-setters Chelsea at the top of the league . Louis van Gaal's side will be keen to show that their dominant win against QPR was not only a one-off by being head and shoulders above Nigel Pearson's side at the King Power Stadium. However, the Dutchman will know his team need to be at their best against a Leicester side who held Arsenal to a draw at home and beat Stoke City at the Britannia in their last outing. The attacking display against QPR at Old Trafford was certainly impressive, with Di Maria to the fore, but centre back Jonny Evans insists that United have improved defensively as well, after a shaky start. Falcao looks delighted to be training with Louis van Gaal's side but will have an even wider smile if he can grab his first goal for the club against Leicester . Robin van Persie takes a drink of water during the training session and the Dutch striker may see his first team place under threat after the arrival of Falcao .

Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney share a joke. The England captain and the Manchester United assistant manager played together for 10 years before Giggs' retirement . Evans told United Review that the club's new defensive signings can have a major impact as the club look to continue a run of consecutive clean sheets. Luke Shaw, a £27million signing from Southampton, is expected to make his debut on Saturday, while Marcos Rojo had his first outing against QPR, and Evans is certain that they possess the quality to succeed at Old Trafford. 'I had the chance to work with Luke in pre-season,' said Evans. 'There is no doubt he is going to be the best left back in the world,' 'I watched Marcos at the World Cup and thought he was excellent for Argentina whether he played at left back or left wing back - and he can play centre back too,' he said.

It didn’t matter, of course, that only two of them supported Manchester United; that rival clubs including Liverpool, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich all had their supporters. Sir Alex Ferguson meets the European team ahead of the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles starting on Friday .

Martin Kaymer jokingly gives his friends from the US team a gesture as he sets up to practice on Tuesday . Kaymer then has a chuckle to himself and carries on hitting balls after giving the 'friendly' wave to his rivals . How could it not help to swap stories, enjoy a little banter and hear some inspirational words from arguably the greatest British manager of all time? ‘I met him first at the JP McManus Invitational in Ireland 15 years ago and when I became captain, for a number of reasons, I asked him,’ said McGinley, before they all gathered. He loves his golf and there were a number of things that he was particularly good at as a manager where I thought he would be a natural fit. 'But this is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them. This is about fun.’ McGinley said the conversation with Ferguson would be about having fun, not a headmaster's preaching .

Europe are looking for their third straight success over USA, having won in 2012 and at Celtic Manor in 2010 . It continues a recent tradition that saw rugby legend Gareth Edwards speak at Celtic Manor four years ago and Bayern manager Pep Guardiola say a few words at Medinah. ‘There’s a lot to be gained from hearing different voices from different sports,’ said McGinley. ‘It’s relaxed and it is a conversation. I thought Gareth was brilliant and I know Sir Alex will be fantastic with the players.’ Day two of Ryder Cup week and big crowds turned up to watch the first official day of practice. Many of the players got their first look at the fabulous grandstand around the first hole that will be such a feature of the three days of competition. McGinley sent his players out in threes, which might seem a strange way to prepare for fourballs and foursomes but, as ever with this deep thinker, carried logic. Rory McIlroy, Victor Dubuisson, Lee Westwood, Martin Kaymer, Stephen Gallacher, Justin Rose, Europe team captain Paul McGinley, Henrik Stenson, Thomas Bjorn, Ian Poulter, Jamie Donaldson, Graeme McDowell and Sergio Garcia form the European team looking for a third straight success .

VIDEO McGinley taking you through the closing holes at Gleneagles . ‘It was so they could play quicker, because I didn’t want them on the course for six-and-a-half hours, as they were at Medinah,’ he argued. Both captains are acutely aware that a lot of players are coming into this contest on the back of a heavy workload of eight tournaments in 10 weeks. Indeed, American captain Tom Watson said he was concerned that a lot of his players are tired, which seemed a bizarre thing to flag up before the Ryder Cup had even started.

He was the villain for America at Medinah and he’s relishing the chance to play the role again.’ US team members Zach Johnson, Jim Furyk, Patrick Reed and Hunter Mahan wait patiently on the 15th green .

"By . Tom Roddy for MailOnline . Laughter and jokes seemed to surround Lukas Podolski's trip to Borussia Dortmund for Arsenal's Champions League clash. The German striker was in good spirits before the game, laughing with the Gunners' opponents in the warm up and signing autographs for local fans - but there was nothing funny about his cameo later in the match, at least from the forward's perspective. With Arsenal already 2-0 down and heading for defeat, the 29-year-old was called on by boss Arsene Wenger to enter as a substitute - only for the his introduction to comically be delayed.

"By . Pa Reporter . Wayne Rooney insists the future is bright for Manchester United despite their inconsistent form under manager Louis van Gaal. Striker Rooney, who was appointed captain by the Dutch boss in the summer, could not prevent Leicester turning over the Red Devils on Sunday. A 3-1 lead for United slipped away as Leicester claimed a stunning 5-3 victory at the King Power Stadium. Wayne Rooney took to Facebook to respond to the criticism of Manchester United after they lost to Leicester . Rooney (centre) lost his temper with his  team-mates during their embarassing defeat at Leicester . Daley Blind (left) was another team-mate to be on the receiving end of Rooney's outburst during the 5-3 loss . The 28-year-old was appointed Manchester United captain at the start of the season by  Louis van Gaal . United stand 12th in the Barclays Premier League after five matches, already eight points behind leaders Chelsea. Expectations of a major improvement after last season's seventh-placed finish have been formed on the basis of the appointment of the experienced Van Gaal and the recruitment of players including Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind, Radamel Falcao, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera. And Rooney is convinced the blossoming of the team will materialise, taking issue with those doubting United's ability to respond to their current frustration. Rooney wrote on his Facebook page: 'There seems to be a lot of people who have written us off because of Sunday's result but I don't see it that way. 'When I look around our dressing room and see the quality we have and the manager's unbelievable attention to detail I have no doubts this team will be successful.' Earlier, former United defender Phil Neville predicted this summer's big spending would need to be repeated in future transfer windows before the club can again be seen as title contenders. The England striker has praised new boss Van Gaal (centre) for his 'unbelievable attention to detail' The Red Devils' threadbare defence will be further weakened by the absence of Jonny Evans, who is out for a month with an ankle injury . Defenders like Chris Smalling (right) have struggled for United this season, with the team leaking goals . United have struggled in central defence this season as Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans battle for form and fitness and youngster Tyler Blackett seeks to establish himself. And Neville believes that is the biggest issue still to be addressed. 'I know United have spent £150million,' Neville told BBC Radio 5 live. 'I think there's another two transfer windows of similar amounts of money needed - maybe £100million - before they can even think about winning the title. 'There are still key positions in the team that need filling. I think the centre-back position is obviously the key area. Holding midfield or centre midfield needs addressing too. 'There were no world-class centre-backs out there (this summer). I think that's why in the next two transfer windows, United might still be looking for that world-class defender.' However, he backed England internationals Jones and Smalling to eventually prove their worth to the club. 'I am certain Chris Smalling will come good and I have full faith in Phil Jones as well,' Neville said. 'They've bought of a lot of foreign players, you don't get rid of your English spine.'

Magath's reputation took a knock during a troubled seven-month stint in the Cottagers' hotseat, but he insists he still has something to give - and that his future lies in England. 'I'm going to stay in England and I will see what comes,' said the 61-year-old, who left Craven Cottage a week ago, with the team at the foot of the Sky Bet Championship. 'I still believe my methods can still help at some clubs.' Magath looks dejected as he walks off the pitch at full-time after Fulham's championship clash with Wolves . Magath's methods have been heavily criticised, but the German insists he can still offer something in England . He added in Germany's Sport Bild magazine: 'I certainly don't doubt myself.' Magath previously led Bayern Munich to back-to-back Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal doubles, before arguably topping both by guiding an unfancied Wolfsburg to their first ever Bundesliga title in 2009. His most recent success was a second-place finish with Schalke in 2010, but a return to Wolfsburg did not work out and he oversaw Fulham's relegation from the Barclays Premier League last season.
