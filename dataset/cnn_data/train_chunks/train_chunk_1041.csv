"At the end of the best year of her career, Jordanne Whiley's return to the Olympic Park this week gives her the chance to put the cherry on the cake. Whiley, a bronze medallist at the London 2012 Paralympics, competes on home soil this week at the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters not just as a Grand Slam champion, but as the first ever British player to complete a calendar Grand Slam. The 22-year-old was victorious in the women's wheelchair doubles with Japanese partner Yui Kamiji this year at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and then handled the pressure to make history at the US Open. Jordanne Whiley (left) and Yui Kamiji celebrate with their trophies after winning the US Open in September . Whiley competes in the Wimbledon ladies' wheelchair doubles final at the All England Club in July . Whiley said: 'That was the most pressure I've ever felt because during the couple of weeks leading up to the US Open there was a lot of media attention around me saying ""oh, if you win it's going to be history"". 'It was going to be really disappointing if I got so far and didn't win the calendar Grand Slam. There was a lot of pressure and I definitely felt it but we managed to overcome it so that was good.' Whiley admits the calendar Grand Slam was discussed with Kamiji at the start of the year but it was more in jest rather than it being a serious goal at that point. She said: 'I said to Yuri going into the Australian Open that we could do the calendar Grand Slam but it was a bit of banter, a bit of seriousness. 'It was only really when we won the Australian Open that we really had that in our minds that that was going to be our goal this year.' Whiley considers herself fortunate to have the opportunity to play at the four most iconic tennis venues in the world in Melbourne Park, Roland Garros, the All England Club and Flushing Meadows. And part of the fun also is bumping into some of the professionals in the locker room. Whiley (right) and partner Lucy Shuker bite their medals after winning bronze at the London 2012 Paralympics . Whiley said: 'I have said hello to a few of the guys. I met Martina Navratilova when I was a kid and I saw her at the changing rooms at the Australian Open this year and I said hi to her and had a little conversation. 'They are always really pleasant and you can always approach them to say hello, so it's really nice.' Whiley returns this week to the venue formerly known as Eton Manor where she won bronze with Lucy Shuker in the women's doubles at the 2012 Paralympics. This week, Whiley faces a tough task against the rest of the top eight women's wheelchair singles players but she is relishing the opportunity to play at a venue which means so much. She said: 'The court that we won on is now a hockey pitch. We are playing on the indoor courts but it's the same venue so it will be nice to go back and relive some memories.' The NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters takes place at the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park from November 26-30.

"Dan Cole is a prop and a born-and-bred Leicester stalwart, so making a song and dance about having neck surgery is not the done thing. He settles for: ‘It’s not ideal.’ No fuss — as ever. The 27-year-old broke off from preparations for the Tigers’ European Champions Cup clash with holders Toulon at Welford Road on Sunday to reflect on his decimated year and he was typically matter of fact, despite the extreme circumstances. Having become a fixture up front for his club and for England, and having shown remarkable physical resilience at the sharp end of the scrum duel on a weekly basis, Cole’s serene progress was abruptly and worryingly interrupted at the start of this year. A loss of power alerted medics to a problem which turned out to be very serious. Dan Cole (right) made his comeback from neck surgery in November, earlier than scheduled . Leicester prop Cole talks to Sportsmail's Chris Foy during a break in preparations for match against Toulon . Cole missed most of the year after he required surgery on a bulging disc in his neck . He said: ‘I had a stiff neck after we played Ulster in the European Cup. When I woke up the next morning I was even more stiff than usual. I went away with England and played a couple of Tests but when it got to the third week I tried to do a bench press in the gym and basically had no power in my left arm. That flagged up something neural so I was sent off for a scan which showed I had a bulging disc in my neck. ‘You don’t really want to have surgery on your neck so I went to the specialist, who recommended three months of rest. I did that but it didn’t really do anything so they operated in May. It was meant to be a six-month recovery period but I’ve come back a bit quicker.’ Having made his return ahead of schedule last month, Cole insists he feels ‘better than ever’ following his extended break. But being forced to address the grim fact that his job had caused spinal damage was not a comfortable process. Cole said that he was nervous about his return, but only that he would be rubbish after the lengthy lay-off . The England international said he 'feels better than ever' after rest and rehabilitation . ‘It’s not ideal,’ he said. ‘I understand the forces that come through your neck. You don’t want to mess around with it. But a fair few people have had the surgery I had. The surgeon has operated on most of the Leicester team! He’s done Tom Youngs’ back, Tom Croft’s neck, Miles Benjamin’s neck, Geoff Parling’s neck... Seeing them come back and play, you know you’ll be all right. It’s reassuring because it’s your livelihood.’ Rest and rehab was a new and unwelcome scenario for Cole. The disruption to his daily routine was hard to take. There was little motivation to climb out of bed in the mornings. He would go to the club, watch video footage of matches, sit in on team meetings and enjoy a free lunch. In hindsight, he admits he could have made better use of his time off but he didn’t know then just how much of it he would have. ‘I wasn’t doing weights and you can’t really do any rehab on your neck at that point because they don’t want you to activate your neck muscles, so it was… boring — massively boring,’ said Cole. ‘Everyone says, “Why don’t you go away travelling?” but you can’t just go abroad for three months. I’m not really a beach person anyway!’ Cole gets stuck into the scrum during the Aviva Premiership match between Leicester and Saracens . Cole sat out England's summer tour of New Zealand and admitted it was difficult to watch . The slog of rehab has been worthwhile. Having spent a lot of time this year helping Leicester’s other props, notably Logovi’i Mulipola and Fraser Balmain, Cole began to focus on his own game again. Due to carefully monitored resumption of contact work, he had no concerns about subjecting his neck to set-piece pressure again, but he was slightly on edge before his comeback in the 29-13 LV Cup win against Sale on November 9. ‘Before the game there was a bit of nervousness, not about the neck but about being rubbish!’ he said. ‘You’ve been out for 10 months and you don’t have a clue. Thankfully, I got thrown straight into a scrum and after that you’re on auto-pilot. You just get on with it. Since then I’ve played 65 minutes and 80 minutes.’ Cole had been missed by the Tigers, with director of rugby Richard Cockerill suggesting that his Lion at No 3 spreads ‘fear in opposition teams’. England have also felt the loss of their premier tighthead, although David Wilson has done a sterling job in his absence. The 27-year-old has been capped 45 times for England and he knows a return to the squad is not guaranteed . Cole is tackled by France's Jules Pisson during the Six Nations match in February this year . For his part, Cole found it tough to watch the national team’s June tour of New Zealand from afar. ‘It was difficult because I wanted to be involved,’ he said. ‘I was sat on my backside, doing nothing, feeling a bit sad because I was sat on the sofa, watching England play.’ In recent weeks, England’s forwards stood tall against their rivals from the southern hemisphere, despite losses against New Zealand and South Africa. Cole feels that the Red Rose pack is now one of the leading set-piece units in the world and he knows that his return to the starting XV for the Six Nations will be no foregone conclusion. But that personal battle can wait. Sunday's clash with Toulon will be a club match with the intensity and class of an international. ‘You can come across international packs at club level, but it’s very rare you come across an international squad from 1-23,’ said Cole. ‘It could be as good as a Test match and knowing the way the French play, it’s potentially more forward-dominated, so in some ways, it could be tougher than a Test match.’ Cole will relish that challenge. He has a chance to end his less-than-ideal year in fine style.","Dan Cole had surgery in May after scans revealed bulging disc in his neck .

"Northampton secured maximum points from a 38-15 European Rugby Champions Cup demolition of Treviso in Italy. Scores from Samu Manoa, Alex Waller, Ben Foden, Luther Burrell, George Pisi and a penalty try ensured it was a job well done by Jim Mallinder's side against their struggling Pool Five rivals. Saints number eight Manoa opened the scoring after nine minutes when he finished off a patient build-up by forcing his way over from close range. Northampton's Ben Foden touches down for his side's third try of the game against Treviso in Italy . Samu Manoa (centre) of Saints celebrates after scoring a try during the comfortable win . It was a fifth try of the season for the United States international, who is expected to join French champions Toulon in the summer. Outside-half Stephen Myler added the conversion to give Saints a solid early lead. A change of referee due to an injury to Peter Fitzgibbon delayed the game for several minutes and he was replaced by Leo Colgan. Former Worcester and Wasps outside-half Joe Carlisle then got Treviso on the scoreboard with a penalty. Treviso lost lock Francesco Minto to the sin-bin when he tackled Sam Dickinson in an offside position and Saints immediately grabbed a second try. Northampton's Luther Burrell scores Saints' fourth try as they take maximum points . Northampton and Treviso players scum during the European Champions Cup match . Myler kicked the penalty to touch and the Saints' eight were too strong for the Treviso pack, with prop Waller almost powering his way over. The visitors secured the bonus point within nine minutes of the restart with two quick scores from Foden and Burrell. The latter was the provider in the first try with a superb pass to set Foden free and he produced a smart finish, with Myler kicking the difficult conversion. Almost immediately, Saints went over for their first try after excellent work by Tom Stephenson and Jamie Elliot allowed Burrell to finish. Saints players celebrate after marching to a comfortable victory against Treviso . Treviso did get back into the contest when fly-half Carlisle sent a long pass to wing Ludovico Nitoglia to go over in the corner. Saints' fifth was a penalty try when Treviso popped up at the scrum and the home side went down to 14 men for the second time when replacement Romulo Acosta was shown a yellow card. Treviso did, however, manage a second try when the impressive Carlisle intercepted Stephenson's pass and raced home from 60 metres. But there was still time for Saints to get their sixth when replacement Pisi touched down with two minutes to go.","Samu Manoa and Alex Waller scored first-half tries for Northampton .

"Ross Fisher sits two shots clear at the top of the leaderboard after an impressive first day at the Nedbank Golf Challenge. Beginning the 2015 Race to Dubai in style, the 34-year-old Englishman completed a six-under-par 66, dropping just one shot in the first round. That fine start gives Fisher daylight to South Africa's George Coetzee, Marcel Siem of Germany and Frenchman Alexander Levy, who all shot 68s, at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City.

Fisher said: 'One bogey and seven birdies for a round of six under on this golf course - I'll definitely take that and run. 'I didn't miss many fairways out there and played exactly how I wanted to. 'I hit one loose shot on the 16th and made bogey, but you can't be too disappointed with one bad shot in 18 holes.'

"Newcastle Falcons maintained their 100 per cent start to their European Challenge Cup campaign with a 30-23 victory against Stade Francais on Friday. Wins over Newport Gwent Dragons and Bucuresti meant Newcastle topped Pool Three ahead of Friday night's encounter at Kingston Park, and the Falcons ran in four tries on their way to a bonus-point triumph over the French side, who are flying high in third in the Top 14 standings. Tries from Chris Harris and Simon Hammersley helped Newcastle to a 14-9 lead at the break, with South Africa fly-half Morne Steyn slotting a trio of penalties to keep Stade Francais in the game. Newcastle Falcons' Chris Harris points out instructions to his team-mates during their match on Friday night . Simon Hammersley scores a try for Newcastle in the first half which contributed to their 14-9 lead at half-time .

"US Open champion Martin Kaymer is looking to finish off a long but personally successful year on a high. The German, who won his second major at Pinehurst in June, is actually starting out on the 2015 European Tour schedule in the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City, South Africa, this week.

With the Raiders (1-10) trailing 20-17 in the fourth quarter, Carr marched the team 80 yards downfield in a drive that took seven minutes off the clock and culminated with a nine-yard touchdown pass to James Jones.

"A woman with a rare genetic condition is so allergic to protein that eating burger and chips could leave her brain damaged. Kreseda Smith, 36, suffers from phenylketonuria which means a build-up of protein could leave her with devastating brain and muscle damage. She has never eaten meat and receives most of her food on prescription from her GP. Rare condition: Kreseda Smith, 36, suffers from phenylketonuria which means build-up of protein could leave her with devastating brain and muscle damage . And as potatoes and bread count towards her daily protein intake, chips and buns are a no go as well. Ms Smith, from Wellington, Shropshire, said: 'A burger is always out of the question, and just going to McDonald's is a big no no because I can't eat anything. 'Even though it's a bit weird picking up my weekly shop from the doctors I know I'm safer this way!' After being diagnosed at just a few days old, PhD student Ms Smith has kept to a strict vegan diet. Phenylketonuria (PKU) means her body cannot break down one of the amino acids found in protein: phenylalaine. Strict diet: She has never eaten meat and receives most of her food on prescription from her GP . Too much gives her chronic migraines and aching muscles so Ms Smith has to limit herself to just 10g of protein a day. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic condition that's present from birth. The body is unable to break down a substance called phenylalanine, which builds up in the blood and brain. High levels of phenylalanine can damage the brain. PKU is treated with a special low-protein diet, which reduces the levels of phenylalanine in the body and prevents brain damage. The condition doesn't usually cause any symptoms if treatment is started early. If PKU isn't treated, damage to the brain and nervous system can lead to learning difficulties, behavioural difficulties and epilepsy. Source: NHS Choices . And if she continued to snack on meat, dairy or nuts, or even bread and pasta which also contain the offending amino acid, she would face developing epilepsy, brain damage, and severe muscle problems. Instead she must eat specialist pasta and bread which has had the phenylalaine removed and take a cocktail of supplements every day to keep her healthy. She says eating out is a nightmare and claims she was even bullied as a child for her unsual diet. But she knows it's a small price to pay for avoiding the horrific dangers of too much protein. She added: 'It was really hard growing up - I was bullied by other kids at school because my packed lunch always looked a bit funny. 'When I went to birthday parties I took my own little bag of food instead of leaving with a piece of cake! 'Even though I went through a rebellious phase and bought chocolate after school with my pocket money I had to stop because it made me so tired and achy. 'I can only have 10 grams of protein a day - it's the equivalent of five bags of crisps - so I have to weigh absolutely everything. Ms Smith, pictured with the with fast food that could give her brain damage and the food prescribed to her by the doctors . 'For the last six years or so I've been supported by a dietician at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham which has been incredible. 'Before that my diet wasn't quite right and I had horrific headaches. 'PKU is very rare - it affects one in every 10,000 babies born - so I'm lucky they caught it when I was young - even if it means missing out on a takeaway and chocolate!'","Kreseda Smith, 36, from Shropshire, suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU)

"There have been some memorable winners in the 58 renewals of the Hennessy Gold Cup but few have sparked the raucous and heartfelt emotion that flooded through the Newbury winner’s enclosure after Many Cloud’s win. Focus of the adulation was trainer Oliver Sherwood, who must have feared his days in the spotlight were history. It is 50 years since the great Arkle landed the first of his two wins in this prestigious steeplechase. Many Clouds (right) ridden by Leighton Aspell won the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury . Many Clouds (left) beats Houblon Des Obeaux (right) over the line at Newbury . You don’t have to delve that far back for the Sherwood glory days but, until a revival was reignited in the last two years, memories of Sherwood big-race stars like Coulton, Large Action, Young Snugfit and Arctic Call, his previous Hennessy winner in 1990, were beginning to gather dust. Rising stars like Puffin Billy and Deputy Dan have injected fresh optimism into the Sherwood set-up and Many Clouds, brought down when still going well at last season’s Cheltenham Festival, had suggested a big prize was within his scope. It all came together as the 8-1 shot, with jockey Leighton Aspell in the colours of owner Trevor Hemmings, collared gallant top weight Houblons Des Obeaux at the last and forged three and a quarter lengths clear. A length back in third was Merry King as the Hennessy remained one of the few prizes to elude champion jockey AP McCoy. Well-backed Willie Mullins-trained 5-1 favourite Djakadam faded from two fences out to finish eighth and Aspell later picked up a seven-day ban and £1,800 fine for excessive use of his whip. An emotional Sherwood said: ‘There have been a few bare patches in the last 10 years. When things go bad you doubt yourself and wonder whether you are doing things right. ‘But I remember Fred Winter telling me years ago if you have been successful what you have been doing don’t change it.’ Many Clouds (right) jumps over the last fence before heading to victory in the Hennessy Gold Cup . Having had a hard race, Sherwood said Many Clouds might not run again until the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March, for which sponsors Betfred make him a 14-1 shot. To complete a good afternoon for the Sherwoods, Oliver’s nephew Jack landed the Bet365 Handicap Hurdle on Paul Nicholls-trained Silsol. Nicholls-trained Rocky Creek never threatened in the Hennessy but Nicholls could still reflect on the day with satisfaction as Nick Scolfield-ridden Irving won the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle, the 100th grade one success of his training career.","Many Cloud, ridden by Leighton Aspell, won the Hennessy Gold Cup .

"Anjelica Huston ended her relationship with actor Ryan O'Neal after the actor viciously attacked her at a Hollywood party, the Oscar-winner has claimed in a new memoir.

"Snooker legend Stephen Hendry claims that too many players are treating tournaments ‘like stag weekends’ to ever do themselves justice. The seven-time world champion retired two years ago — though he has hinted that there may be a comeback, and some more competitive play left in the tank. But the 45-year-old Scot has his ear close to the ground through former peers still on tour and in his capacity as a BBC analyst for the major events. Stephen Hendry has claimed that too many players are treating tournaments ‘like stag weekends’ Hendry, who enjoyed a long and fierce rivalry with Ronnie O’Sullivan, insists players like the Rocket and Stuart Bingham back up their ability with hours of dedication and toil. Hendry made huge sacrifices to be the best, leaving no stone unturned to become a better player, and he respects O’Sullivan’s move to seek a breakthrough with Dr Steve Peters three years ago. He said: ‘To other players out there frustrated with their form or careers, I would say look at Ronnie compared to where he was a few years ago — or Stuart Bingham. ‘Stuart has worked very closely with his coach Steve Feeney, and sometimes you just need one thing to trigger it for you or kick-start things. Just something, anything, whatever it is that does it for you as a player or gives you some extra belief. ‘And when you consider the likes of Stephen Maguire perhaps they just need that something, whether it is talking to someone, anything that can give him an extra edge. ‘Perhaps in Stephen’s case he is more the man’s man type and dealing with sports psychologists and sports psychiatrists or whatever might be seen as wimping out, he tries to do it all himself. Hendry said he was impressed that Ronnie O'Sullivan had sought the help of Dr Steve Peters . ‘But if it is good enough for some of the other top sports people in the world, and we can all name them in other sports, then it must be good enough for him. But some of these players need to look at what they are doing. I am not on tour any more but I hear things, and there are stories that some players are not as dedicated as they should be, and treating some of these PTC events in Europe as stag weekends rather than tournaments. Every player has to look at himself and what he is doing.’ O’Sullivan was drawn against Ricky Walden for the first round of his Masters defence next month, representing an awkward tie against the recent International Championship winner in China. The match of the first round at Alexandra Palace in north London looks to be world champion Mark Selby against Shaun Murphy, who has specifically targeted the prestigious invitation event title this season. O’Sullivan was awkwardly caught short without enough underwear before last night’s Coral UK Championship final. Hendry also praised Stuart Bingham and said younger players could learn from his attitude . The 39-year-old has endured a challenging week in York after breaking his ankle while running in Epping Forest days before the event. After hobbling through his first match, a distracted O’Sullivan did his best to ease the pain as he slipped through the draw, going on to make a 147 in the last 16 against Matthew Selt. But hours before the live BBC showdown against Judd Trump, O’Sullivan had to rush in to a city packed with Christmas shoppers on a mission to find some pants. ‘I only brought about five pairs, because with my ankle the way it was at the start I couldn’t see myself going that far in the tournament,’ admitted a sheepish O’Sullivan. ‘So I have got to go into town, over to Marks and Spencers or somewhere, to get myself some new ones for the final.’ An in-form O’Sullivan raced into a 5-1 first-session lead in the best-of-19 frame UK final, an event he has won four times. But Trump kept the match alive by reducing the arrears to 5-3 before the evening session.","Stephen Hendry has criticised the attitudes of some snooker players .

"The National Football League believes the Adrian Peterson child punishment case has an important ripple-effect, but his lawyer insists Commissioner Roger Goodell is making the Minnesota Vikings running back a scapegoat. NFL executive vice president and general counsel Jeff Pash on Wednesday defended Goodell's decision to suspend Peterson for at least the rest of the season for an 'incident of abusive discipline' on his 4-year-old son. Pash told ESPN Radio the NFL had a responsibility to players 'unfairly tarnished by the misconduct of a few,' and to the fight against domestic abuse. Peterson pleaded no contest in a Texas courtroom earlier this month to a misdemeanor assault charge . Peterson gives his son Adrian Jr. a kiss following an NFL football training camp practice in August . 'One thing that Commissioner Goodell is absolutely committed to is to upholding not only the reputation of the league but the reputation of the thousands of men who play in the league and who are good, hard-working, decent, law-abiding citizens,' Pash said. Rusty Hardin, who represented Peterson in the Texas criminal case over injuries his son sustained from discipline he administered, said Peterson's no-contest plea to a misdemeanor assault charge did not rise to domestic abuse. 'A father believed he had the right to discipline his children. He made a mistake. In unintended consequences, his son was hurt,' Hardin said earlier on Wednesday to ESPN Radio. According to the Houston Police Department, these are injuries Peterson allegedly inflicted on his  son. 'He pled to a court and accepted punishment and wanted to resume his career, and now the NFL has decided they're going to be the arbiter of what's appropriate discipline for a child and whether a person is or is not feeling significant remorse.' Peterson, originally charged with a felony, was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine by the court and perform community service. In an open letter to Peterson, Goodell said Peterson had 'shown no meaningful remorse.' 'They looked bad in the earlier things with Ray Rice,' Hardin said about the domestic abuse case by the former Baltimore Ravens running back captured by hotel security cameras. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson (left) is tackled by Chicago Bears safety Chris Conte . 'They handled things badly publicly and now they just decided to make Adrian the scapegoat for all their past failings.' Hardin said Goodell was 'hypocritically self-righteous about Adrian not showing sufficient remorse. Who in the hell does he think he is?' Pash said reaction to the Rice case had galvanized the NFL into action. 'We're not prepared right now to hold ourselves up as the paragon for all of society,' Pash said. 'But we do think that the NFL has a role to play. We can set a good example.'","Adrian Peterson has been banned for the rest of the NFL season for an 'incident of abusive discipline' on his four-year-old son .

"Seattle Seahawks media-shy running back Marshawn Lynch has been fined $50,000 for not speaking to reporters after Sunday's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

"Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of 2014 season, the National Football League said on Tuesday. Peterson will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15, the league said in statement, for violating the NFL Personal Conduct Policy in an 'incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his 4-year-old son.' A six-time Pro Bowler, Peterson was arrested in September for disciplining his son by striking him with a switch; a thin tree branch with its leaves removed. The switch left cuts and bruises over much of the child's body. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson (left) is tackled by Chicago Bears safety Chris Conte . Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest in a Texas courtroom earlier this month to a misdemeanor assault charge and must pay a $4,000 (£2,550) fine and perform community service. In a letter to Peterson, NFL Commission Roger Goodell said: 'You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct.' 'When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not ""eliminate whooping my kids"" and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother,' Goodell wrote in the letter.

"One of the most authoritative anti-doping figureheads has blasted the governing body of global athletics, the IAAF, for failing to act upon serious allegations of systemic state doping in Russian sport first revealed 16 months ago by this newspaper. Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said. ‘I don’t find it surprising they didn’t respond to your report. I find it sadly typical.’ The allegations resurfaced this week, as German TV station ARD and French sports paper L’Equipe reported Russia’s Liliya Shobukhova, who came first in the London marathon before being stripped of the title, had paid €450,000 (£355,000) to the Russian athletics federation. Dick Pound has lambasted the IAAF for not acting on allegations of systematic Russian doping . Lilya Shobukhova came first in the London marathon but was then stripped of her title . ARD also showed Olympic 800m champion Maria Savinova admitting to doping, and reported that coaches, athletes and even the anti-doping authorities are involved in doping and cover-ups. The Russian Athletics Federation has called the ARD claims ‘lies’. In light of the ARD allegations, the IAAF say an investigation is already ongoing, without providing any detail. Pound added: ‘If the allegations are proved with sufficient certainly, the IAAF, WADA and IOC could say the Russians are non-compliant (with the WADA code) and that they’re suspended from all competitions until they clean up. ‘What I don’t know is if there are sufficient balls within these organisations to make that happen.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dick Pound says it is 'sadly typical' of IAAF to not follow up the allegations .

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche has warned the Football Association's new England DNA programme must not promote a corrosive 'elitism' in the next generation of players. The FA blueprint, which was launched on Thursday, calls for joined-up thinking in international player development, from under-15 level upwards, with youngsters encouraged to buy into 'the England way' through initiatives such as digital wristbands for reference. But Dyche is already sceptical about some of the comforts and amenities available to school-age children at Premier League academies and believes it is important not to wrap the stars of the future in cotton wool from the start. Burnley boss Sean Dyche is concerned the England DNA Programme must not promote corrosive 'elitism' George Boyd scored for Dyche's team on Tuesday night to get a point in a 1-1 draw with Newcastle . Burnley face Harry Redknapp's QPR on Saturday as both teams look to creep out of the relegation zone . 'It's diluting to get this elitism,' said Dyche. 'We know they're going to get enhanced coaching and better facilities at almost every level but you can't get so drunk on that that you forget about the passion, pride, belief, desire and will. 'It's fair to say this elitist thought doesn't guarantee an elite outcome. In fact it can take it away. 'When you get these elitist groups sometimes the rawness of a player is lost and I think they've got to understand that. 'It's not just the technical, tactical, physical...there still needs to be that rawness and some of the best have got it. 'They get treated unbelievably well. Sometimes, farcically well. 'You get a 14-year-old needing a rub down before training. I can't accept that. 'I spoke to an eight-year-old who told me he had done his hamstring. I said, 'I can't believe you know what your hamstring is, son. Now go out there and get running'. 'People might say it's an archaic view but I think the moral fibre of footballers is as relevant now as its ever been.'","Sean Dyche said the DNA programme mustn't promote a corrosive 'elitism'

"Ronnie O'Sullivan gained the upper hand in the Coral UK Championship final but there was still hope for Judd Trump at York's Barbican Centre. Four-time UK champion O'Sullivan, who landed his first major title in this tournament 21 years ago when it was played in Preston, looked to be racing towards victory when he built a 5-1 lead. Trump by that stage looked to be hopelessly off his game, even writing on Twitter during the mid-session interval that his performance had been 'absolute poop', and adding that he would 'need to play 10x better to have a chance'. Ronnie O'Sullivan lines up a shot during the final of the UK Championship at the Barbican Centre in York . O'Sullivan reacts after Trump plays a shot (left) while Trump looks on disappointed with his performance (right) But by sneaking the final two frames of the afternoon to trail O'Sullivan only 5-3 in the best-of-19 contest, Trump would consider himself to have earned a major let-off. The pair contested a classic final at last month's Champion of Champions event in Coventry, where O'Sullivan fired four centuries in a 10-7 victory, and this contest had a long way to go to match that standard. O'Sullivan, who suffered a broken ankle on the eve of this tournament, has never lost a UK final, adding titles in 1997, 2001 and 2007 to his 1993 trophy, which he landed days before his 18th birthday. Trump plays a shot during the Coral UK Championship final at the Barbican on Sunday afternoon . York was where Trump landed his first major success, becoming UK champion three years ago, yet for the opening six frames of this final he was looking likely to suffer a thrashing. Breaks of 82, 41, and 81 allowed O'Sullivan, himself some way short of prime form, to power four frames clear. Trump, spending most of the time in his chair, was frequently pawing at his eyes, appearing either tired or unable to understand what was happening. He made 46 in pinching the scrappy eighth frame and scrambled over the line in the next, meaning he was back in the match, without playing anything approaching his best snooker, ahead of the 7pm resumption.","Ronnie O'Sullivan is playing Judd Trump in the UK Championship final .

"Birthday boy Ronnie O'Sullivan clinched a 6-4 come-from-behind victory against Anthony McGill to move into the semi-finals of the Coral UK Championship on Friday. Four-time champion O'Sullivan, celebrating his 39th birthday, overcame a sluggish start to the quarter-final encounter with John Higgins conqueror McGill to clinch victory with one frame to spare at the Barbican Centre in York. O'Sullivan, playing on a broken left ankle sustained while running last week, quickly found himself two frames down before two breaks of 38 got him on the board. Four-time UK champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in action against Anthony McGill in their quarter-final . McGill, who had defeated John Higgins in the last 16, led O'Sullivan 2-0 before the Rocket's comeback . Further breaks of 98 and 125 in the fourth and fifth frames helped O'Sullivan, who compiled a 147 break to cap off a 6-0 last-16 whitewash of Matthew Selt on Thursday, into a 3-2 lead. McGill levelled at 3-3 with breaks of 38 and 25, before O'Sullivan responded with a 57 and a follow-up 20 to retake the lead, and then won the next frame with a 33 and a 25 to close to within a frame of victory. McGill was not about to throw in the towel and reduced his opponent's lead to 5-4 with a superbly-crafted century break in the ninth frame, but his resistance finally ended when O'Sullivan hit back with a 97 in the 10th to win the match and keep his hopes of winning a fifth title alive. McGill watches on as O'Sullivan attempts to build another heavy break at the UK Championships in York . O'Sullivan, who is playing with a broken ankle, pulls a trademark face during his match against McGill . O'Sullivan was quick to pay tribute to McGill in a post-match interview, tipping the 23-year-old Glaswegian to win major tournaments in years to come. 'I just said to him afterwards, ''you got playing mate, you'll win tournaments playing (like) that'',' O'Sullivan said on BBC2. 'What a lovely personality, what a lovely guy and for snooker they're lucky to have someone who is a real eccentric, a bit like (Steve) Davis. 'He's just a lovely boy and I just hope he goes on to play snooker for years to come because snooker is lucky to have him.' O'Sullivan, playing a shot with the rest, managed to beat McGill 6-4, coming back from 2-0 down . O'Sullivan will face fellow Essex native Stuart Bingham on Saturday for a place in Sunday's final after the Basildon man fought back from 4-1 and 5-3 down to beat Graeme Dott in another entertaining quarter-final. Bingham, who thrashed Ricky Walden in the last-16 on Wednesday, made an encouraging start by winning the first frame but breaks of 68, 68 and 92 helped Dott race into a 4-1 lead and seemingly into the last four. Bingham hit back with scores of 31 and 108 to take the next two frames and reduce his opponent's lead to 4-3, but Dott moved to within a frame of victory by winning the eighth courtesy of breaks of 54 and 65. Stuart Bingham came back from 4-1 and 5-3 down to Graeme Dott to set up a semi-final with O'Sullivan . Breaks of 32 and 64 in the next two frames helped Bingham level the match at 5-5 and he completed a remarkable comeback victory in fine style by winning the deciding frame with a break of 103 to leave Dott stunned. Bingham won the Shanghai Masters and the Haining Open leading up to the UK Championship, but he admitted that victory here would cap off what has already been a very successful season for the 38-year-old. 'This is what you dream of, trying to win one of the big ones, and you still class this as one of the big ones.

"Ronny Deila insists he’ll never ban his players from taking to social media – but has warned them against expending too much energy getting involved in online spats. On Wednesday, Celtic striker Anthony Stokes took to Twitter to respond to Hearts supremo Ann Budge’s condemnation of the behaviour of a small minority of visiting fans during Sunday’s Scottish Cup tie at Tynecastle. He Tweeted: ‘Maybe Ann Budge should worry about her own fans, never had so many Sectarian comments directed at me in a ground like Tynecastle the other day.’ Celtic manager Ronny Deila said he would not ban his players from using social media . Anthony Stokes got into an online Twitter spat after Celtic's match against Hearts . Stokes had an exchange with Hearts supremo Ann Budge about the behaviour of supporters . The Irishman was subsequently subjected to a volley of online abuse, with one individual claiming he deserved to be shot. Asked about the incident yesterday, Deila said there was nothing wrong in principle with players interacting through such forums. However, he stressed that their actions shouldn’t detract from their capacity to concentrate on their jobs on the field. ‘I think it is a democracy and players have opinions and it is their right to speak,’ Deila stated. ‘But I think the players have to think about what they are doing - it is about using energy. If you are starting a fight with people, you are using your energy in doing that instead of playing football. ‘This is something that is happening more and more and we have to be aware of it. We have to educate the players from youth level of the effect this has on every individual and what they can do. ‘If I were them, I wouldn’t do it. But these are the players’ opinions, rather than the club’s opinions.’ Asked if he favoured educating players on the dangers of such media as opposed to introducing a blanket ban, the Celtic manager replied: ‘Yes. I think that’s the way you have to do it. That is the way it is now.’ Deila takes his side to Motherwell tomorrow having opened up a three-point lead over the chasing Premiership pack with a slender win over Partick Thistle on Wednesday. Deila has taken his Celtic team to a three point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership . Virgil van Dijk (second left) scored Celtic's winner against Partick Thistle on Wednesday . And with his side still in the hunt for four trophies, he has warned that his fringe players face a battle to become part of his plans in the coming months. ‘We have so many important games coming up, we are in all three cups and we are fighting for the league – which is the most important thing – and there is great competition for places in the team so I don’t think there will be any problems,’ he added. ‘Everyone wants to play in the important matches and some games are more interesting than others but you have to perform to play in these games. ‘It’s a culture at Celtic that we have to win every game and I enjoy that culture. Now we have to keep that momentum going.’","Celtic striker Anthony Stokes   in a Twitter row after Ann Budge comments .

"Saido Berahino has been backed to return to scoring ways by Alan Irvine after five Premier League games without a goal. The 21-year-old striker has not found the net for West Bromwich Albion since converting a late penalty against Crystal Palace in October. Irvine refuted the suggestion the spotlight from Berahino's England call-up or arrest for drink driving had affected him and revealed he is studying clips of Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa in an attempt to improve. Saido Berahino has not scored for five Premier League matches after a blistering start to the season . Berahino's outstretched leg tried to block the cross of West Ham's Carl Jenkinson . Berahino has seven Premier League goals this season and is keeping record signing Brown Ideye out of the team. 'We’ve asked a lot of a young player,’ said Irvine. 'He had a very, very good start to the season, there was a lot of interest in him, a lot of talk about him. 'He last scored against Man United and that proved to be a vital point as far as being selected for England squad – it’s been a lot of focus on a young player. He’s handled it well overall. 'But I don’t think any of us would be surprised to see Saido dropping off a bit. But I believe he will come back. He’s a good finisher with both feet. The goals will come again.’ Hawthorns boss Alan Irvine has backed the young star to emerge from the slump . Asked if he might bring in an experienced striker in January, the West Brom head coach replied: 'You’re always looking to see if you can bring in players who will make you’re group better. 'Experienced players will help Saido, if he plays enough with Victor (Anichebe) he’ll pick up things too. 'We talk to him about movement of Aguero and Costa. He looks at that himself. He’s a young player and like any other striker he goes through spells when not scoring.’","Berahino has not scored for five Premier League games .

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr may be undefeated in the ring - but he more than met his match in a south London barbers. The undefeated world champion, who retained his welterweight title last month, was in Brixton on Tuesday night for a trim. But he was accosted by a female customer who told him she had no idea who he was, infuriating Mayweather and his 'Money Team' crew. Scroll down for video . Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr was shocked when a woman told him she didn't know who he was . Mayweather beat Marcos Maidana (right) for a second time in their rematch in Las Vegas last month to retain his welterweight title . Mayweather did his best to convince the woman that he was the biggest name in boxing, but she did not buy it . 'I don't know you,' she said in a video posted on SpiffTV. 'What's the big deal? I just don't watch boxing. I know about Mike Tyson.' Mayweather, who was accompanied by several members of his 'Money Team' inner circle of friends, appeared stunned and retorted: 'You know what? I need to Google you!' But the woman refused to back down, saying: 'I just want to know what the biggest fight you ever fight is? 'I like big fights, I like exciting fights,' she says. 'If it's not big, I don't watch it.' At this point, one of Mayweather's team interjects: 'He's the biggest in the world.' Unrelenting, the woman takes another dig when she says: 'I know Usain Bolt', to which Mayweather responds: 'Who?'. Multi-millionaire Mayweather posted this picture on Twitter of him lying in bed with piles of money . The woman said she had heard of Mike Tyson, who was the undisputed heavyweight world champion and one of the most feared boxers on the planet . Floyd Mayweather (Boxing): $105m . Cristiano Ronaldo (Football): $80m . LeBron James (Basketball): $72.3m . Lionel Messi (Football): $64.7m . Kobe Bryant (Basketball): $61.5m . Tiger Woods (Golf): $61.2m . Roger Federer (Tennis): $56.2m . Phil Mickelson (Golf): $53.2m . Rafael Nadal (Tennis): $44.5m . Matt Ryan (American Football): $43.8m . The 37-year-old, by now struggling to convince her, tries one last time: 'Do you know what Forbes Magazine is? Well you go and pull up one of those. 'You know the Money Man? He makes over $100m in 60 minutes.' According to Forbes, Mayweather made $105m (£65m) from his first fight with Maidana and his clash with Saul Alvarez last year, a total of 72 minutes in the ring. Usain Bolt saw the funny side, however, tweeting: 'I had to laugh..well I should take comfort in the fact that she know Usain Bolt.' Mayweather has been on a whirlwind tour of Europe, having been in Paris last weekend before heading for Istanbul and London. He then delivered a boxing masterclass in Moscow on Wednesday. He is expected to return to the ring in May with Briton Amir Khan among those clambering for a pay day.","Mayweather was having a hair cut in Brixton when a woman approached him .

"There were five thousand people in Macksville, double the population of this New South Wales country town, for the funeral of Phillip Hughes. But the words of just one of them resonated around the cricketing world. Michael Clarke proved himself more than the Australian captain as he addressed prime minister Tony Abbott and the family and friends of Hughes. He was a statesman. Clarke was immense, as he has been ever since the tragic accident last week that rocked the cricket world and claimed the life of the close friend and team-mate he called his ‘little brother’. Michael Carke delivers an emotional eulogy to his friend and 'little brother' Phillip Hughes on Wednesday . Clarke pauses to kiss the coffin of Hughes after delivering a touching tribute to his former team-mate . Clarke made as moving and poignant a speech as any sportsman can ever have mustered. His words conveyed the perfect mix of grief, disbelief, warmth and inspiration in the still surreal aftermath of Hughes’ death at 25. ‘I don’t know about you but I keep looking for him,’ said Clarke as he gulped deep breaths and choked back tears. ‘I know it’s crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see him around the corner. Is this what we call the spirit? If so then his spirit is still with me and I hope it never leaves. His spirit has brought us closer together. He always wanted to bring people together and he always wanted to celebrate his love for the game and its people. ‘Is this what we call the spirit of cricket? From the little girl in Karachi holding a candlelight tribute to masters of the game like Tendulkar, Lara and Warne showing their grief to the world, the spirit of cricket binds us all together. ‘We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on. So rest in peace my little brother. I’ll see you out in the middle.’ Clarke also served as a pall bearer as the coffin left the Macksville Recreational Centre . Clarke (centre) was joined by Hughes' brother Jason (second left) and father Gregory in carrying the coffin . The funeral of Hughes took place in Macksville on Wednesday as Australia remembered the batsman . A gathering which included the Australian team and greats such as Shane Warne, Ricky Ponting, Brian Lara and Sir Richard Hadlee applauded an Australian captain who was joined in speaking by members of the Hughes family. Clarke was also a pall bearer at the service, as were Australian batsman Aaron Finch and South Australia’s Tom Cooper, who was batting with Hughes when he was struck on the back of his neck by a routine bouncer from Sean Abbott and collapsed at the SCG crease. The hugely popular Hughes never regained consciousness after suffering catastrophic brain damage. Abbott was in the congregation, too, and it is the hope of the cricketing world, not least Hughes’ parents and his brother and sister, that he should in time be able to adhere to Clarke’s words and play on himself. He has already taken the small step of resuming training with New South Wales. Clarke consoles friends of Hughes in the NSW country town of Macksville . Cricket legends Brian Lara (left) and Shane Warne (right) attended the funeral after the tragic cricket death . Ricky Ponting, Hughes' first Australia captain, and his wife Rianna arrive at the service . For now an Australian team that would have included Hughes will attempt to play on in the first Test next week against India, who were represented in Macksville by stand-in captain Virat Kohli and coach Duncan Fletcher. There was no-one at the funeral, though, representing England. Nick Compton, a close friend of Hughes from their time at Middlesex, attended privately, as did Sam Robson, but there was no official ECB presence. Hughes’ family wanted the majority of seats to be given to friends and Macksville residents so the ECB were told by Cricket Australia, in common with all the other Test boards, that it would be better if they attended the state memorial service that will be held at the SCG in the new year. Former England batsman and close friend of Hughes, Nick Compton, travelled to pay his respects . Flowers are laid on the pitch of the Sydney Cricket Ground as the funeral is broadcast live . Mourners stand with 63 bats, the score Hughes was not out on when he was struck down by the bouncer . A crowd gathers on the outfield of the SCG, where a memorial service will be held at a later date . Instead, David Richardson, the International Cricket Council’s chief executive, represented the Test nations at a service at the Macksville Recreation Centre that opened to the song Forever Young by Youth Group and ended with Elton John’s Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me. Meanwhile, at the famous old SCG, which Clarke said will forever remain sacred as the ground where Hughes fell, the service was broadcast on a big screen and 63 bats were laid out on the turf to represent the score he had moved on to before his final innings was cut tragically short. Cricket will never quite be the same after this. Certainly there will be a huge shadow over the forthcoming World Cup in Australia and next year’s Ashes. But, as Clarke said, cricketers will play on around the world. They have to. And the Australian captain will always be respected for his handling of a situation that no sportsman should ever find themselves in.","Phillip Hughes' funeral held in his home town at Macksville High School .

"When Sean Geddes is not helping make components for Lewis Hamilton’s car he scores goals, plenty of them, and sometimes in great style. Not content with the two goals that knocked former winners Coventry out of the FA Cup first round, the Worcester City forward followed that up last weekend with a wonder strike that drew unlikely comparisons with Erik Lamela and Lionel Messi. The opposition might only have been Barrow in the FA Trophy but his ‘rabona’ chip of the goalkeeper was a breathtaking piece of skill that has proved a viral internet hit the world over, with nearly two million hits on social media. Sean Geddes (centre) celebrates scoring the first goal for Worcester City against Coventry City . Geddes pictured outside his work where he has made components for Formula One cars . It has all added up to a slightly disconcerting few weeks for the 22-year-old former Manchester United trainee, who works as a turner at specialist engineering firm A&M EDM Ltd in the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands, down the road from West Brom’s Hawthorns stadium. In the reception area is a Mercedes poster, signed by Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, sent out to the contractors who made contributions to this year’s F1 championship success. Yet if they thought their contribution to the sporting world would end with doing some bodywork on Hamilton’s winning car, they reckoned without the magnetism of the FA Cup, which sees their employee travel with Worcester to Scunthorpe today for the second round. And then there was the footage of the Barrow goal going global. For Geddes, who lives a short cycle ride to work, notoriety has taken some getting used to. ‘Suddenly I’m getting messages from all over, from a mate who lives in Norway, where they’ve been talking about it apparently, and a friend who is at university in America,’ he says. ‘There has been a lot about it on Twitter. I’m on Twitter but don’t really know it works. ‘The rabona is just something I’ve played around with since I was about eight. If I try it in training, a few people tell me to stop messing about. But I didn’t really think about it last weekend, it was just something I did on instinct. ‘It has been a bit weird and I’m not really used to this. I’m used to just living a quiet life and getting on with my work and my football.’ The day after knocking out Coventry in front of more than 3,000 travelling Worcester fans, Geddes was back in the factory for his shift, which begins at six o’clock each morning. Geddes (right) pictured alongside his mother Jo (left) who also works for the same company as her son . Geddes pictured operating some machinery at his workplace, AME Ltd in Smethwick . In an era when even non-League players can live off their wages, and sometimes opt not to do much outside their training more strenuous than PlayStation, he is decidedly old school, a proper working man. He helps operate the complex moulding machines, learning the trade at the factory where his mum, Jo, has worked for seven years, and will sometimes work on Saturday mornings before a home fixture. ‘We got back from Coventry and I went to my local pub for a pint but I couldn’t really celebrate because I knew I was getting up early in the morning,’ he says. ‘That doesn’t bother me. I enjoy working and I know that whatever happens football can be a short career. ‘I could probably live off my football money but I’m saving for a deposit to buy a house. Everyone in the factory is football mad and talks about it all the time but, to be honest, I’m not that interested in the game other than I just love playing it. I don’t watch much or follow a team.’ How much longer he will happily toil away on the shopfloor is unclear because his goalscoring record and what happened against Barrow has alerted a host of League clubs. ‘I’d still love to get back into the professional game and I’m aware that this weekend is another chance to be in the shop window,’ he says. Geddes is preparing for Worcester's FA Cup second round game against Scunthorpe . His previous experience of the big time was two years spent at Old Trafford as a teenager, where he played in the same teams as Danny Welbeck and Ravel Morrison. ‘Danny was a quiet lad, he was a bit older than me but I was always playing two years above myself so I didn’t know him that well. Ravel was totally the opposite. ‘I shared a room with him a few times, they put me in with him because I’m fairly quiet and sensible and they thought I would calm him down. It didn’t work. He just wanted to do practical jokes all the time. He used to cut my socks off and things like that but I liked him. ‘Danny was something different, you could tell he was going to be very good. Ravel is also one of the best I’ve seen. If only he knew how good he could be, the way he goes past players and reads the game, he could be playing for England by now.’ Having started at Coventry, Geddes was at Manchester from 14 to 16 before moving closer to home for a three-year contract with Walsall. ‘I fell out with the manager there. He said we were playing well when we were losing a game 4-1 to Preston and we had an argument. He sent me away on loan.’ Geddes is a former Manchester United trainee and grew up alongside the likes of Danny Welbeck (centre) He also grew up with Ravel Morrison (left) who has since moved on to play for West Ham and Cardiff . After ending up at Stourbridge, earlier this season he moved to Conference North Worcester, where he has already scored nine goals in 17 games. They lie eighth in their league, although these have been uncertain times at the club, who are currently having to groundshare with Kidderminster. Despite that there is a new enthusiasm around and they will not lack for support at Scunthorpe, who are fourth from bottom in League One. ‘At Coventry the fans were unbelievable, singing from start to finish,’ says Geddes. ‘It was the definitely the best moment for me in football and it makes us believe we can go further.’","Sean Geddes scored a rabona goal for Worcester against Barrow .

"QPR boss Harry Redknapp believes 'a gulf in class' makes it almost impossible for this season's relegation battlers to compete with the top sides in the Barclays Premier League. Rangers secured a well-deserved 2-2 draw at home to Manchester City last month but have failed to earn another point against teams currently in the top half of the table. The three promoted sides all find themselves in the relegation zone ahead of this weekend's fixtures, with QPR sandwiched between Leicester, who are bottom, and Burnley. Harry Redknapp bemoaned the 'gulf in class' that separates his QPR side from the top teams in the league . Joey Barton (centre) trains with Rangers teammates ahead of crucial tie with Burnley on Saturday . Redknapp (left) will hope Charlie Austin can add to the seven goals he has scored this season this weekend . 'Leicester beat Man United in September and you thought they would finish in the top half, that's how it goes in this division, it is so hard to win games, there's a gulf in class,' Redknapp said. 'Man City have beaten Sunderland 4-1 and Southampton 3-0 (in the last week) - they're on another level, they can go away with 10 men and win 3-0. 'That tells you the difference in quality between Man City, Chelsea, even Arsenal - they've got massive budgets and top players. 'It is hard for clubs like Leicester, Burnley and QPR. 'Eight players that played for us against Swansea on Tuesday played in the Championship last year and came up through the play-offs.' Thirteen points separated sixth place from eighth at the end of last season but the likes of West Ham, Swansea and Southampton are all threatening to upset the established elite. Redknapp believes the bottom half will remain tight throughout the campaign but expects the usual suspects to fill the top spots come May. 'At the start of the year you can predict those challenging for the Champions League and I think it will still be four from the seven we expected to be there,' Redknapp said. Redknapp (left) looks glum while in discussion with former England manager Glenn Hoddle . Austin (centre) stretches out at QPR's Harlington training ground ahead of their game against Burnley . 'There's not much in it at the bottom, if you look at the teams - Burnley are very much the same team that came up last year and we're the same. 'Leicester were definitely the best team in the Championship last year and they're down with us as well. 'We're going okay, we need to pick up some points away but our home form has been excellent. 'It's going to be tight, it'll be a tight bottom third of the league this year.' QPR are the only team in England's top four divisions who have failed to pick up a point away from home this season. Rangers have fared far better at Loftus Road, where they host fellow newcomers Burnley on Saturday, but Redknapp admits his side's away form must improve. 'It's been difficult, we've played good teams and we've found it hard - there's not too many teams down the bottom who have got results away from home,' Redknapp said. 'The games we've played have all been against good clubs who have been up there in the top eight. 'Maybe we have to find a system that will get us a result somewhere but we've tried everything, every system in the book. 'You have to keep going, it'll turn, we'll pick up a result away from home when you probably least expect it. 'First and foremost though we have to concentrate on our home form this weekend and get a result against Burnley.'","Harry Redknapp says it's impossible for QPR to compete with  top teams .

"IT used to be unfortunate centre-backs who felt the brunt of Chris Sutton’s directness in a challenge. Now it is the financial powerbrokers at Celtic. To Sutton, doing everything to retain both Kris Commons and John Guidetti is essential for the Parkhead club if they are to begin enticing supporters back through the turnstiles. Enough is enough, he insists, when it comes to star quality drifting away from the east end of Glasgow. A key figure in the Martin O’Neill era, Sutton accepts the monetary environment is far more demanding for Celtic in the present day. Yet he would also contend that it doesn’t provide a permanent excuse. Kris Commons, Scotland’s reigning Player of the Year, is out of contract at the end of the season . ‘I do think there comes a time when you look at the crowds, and the stadium is half full, where Celtic are going to have to show some intent at some stage,’ argued Sutton, who will be back at Parkhead as part of the BT Sports presenting team for Thursday's tie with Red Bull Salzburg. ‘They need to draw a line in the sand because fans go to football matches to watch players. ‘Top players get bums on seats. If Commons goes and if Guidetti doesn’t sign then what message does that send out to the Celtic fans? ‘I think it is important that Celtic show intent and do try to get Commons and Guidetti signed up, and then add to that if possible. I know we have to be realistic in the marketplace that Celtic are buying from, but that is the challenge.’ Celtic manager Ronny Deila keeps a close eye on John Guidetti during training on Wednesday . Commons, Scotland’s reigning Player of the Year, is out of contract at the end of the season. Discussions over an extension have so far failed to bear fruit and English clubs — including Crystal Palace and Leicester City — are circling ahead of the January transfer window. At 31, Commons is hardly in the first flush of youth. There will be precious little resale value — the commodity which helps fuel Celtic’s business plan — if he were to stay for another couple of seasons. Sutton, however, is adamant that accepting a fee next month — or watching him exit as a free agent — would be the falsest of economies. ‘I don’t think Celtic can afford to let him go,’ he maintained. ‘Because who do they get to replace him? ‘I know this season he has not really got going through no fault of his own but he has still shown, in the Zagreb game for example, that he has the class to turn a game. ‘Now Celtic don’t have enough of those players. Whatever you say about Stefan Johansen, he is not as good a footballer — he might have better legs but Commons can still change a game at the top level. Celtic team-mates John Guidetti (top) and Anthony Stokes joke around in training . ‘Why would you want to let him go? It’s common sense — unless his wage demands are off the planet, which I doubt they are. Celtic are making an enormous mistake if they don’t get him signed. ‘The longer it goes, you can imagine Kris sitting there thinking: “Well, if they are not going to show willing to me — a player who has given good service, Player of the Year last year, 32 goals and the most aware player Celtic have... ” ‘It did happen in my time, it happened to me, and there is a point where the player wants something back. ‘I am not party to what has happened in the talks but it looks to me like Celtic are going to lose Kris Commons. ‘I hope they don’t but the longer it goes, the more it looks like he will be heading down south.’ Guidetti’s future is open to equal speculation. With 10 goals in 11 appearances since joining on loan from Manchester City, the super-confident Swede is the kind of striker Parkhead season-ticket holders have hankered after for years. The problem, of course, is that this return to the prolific form he once exhibited at Feyenoord is attracting attention south of Gretna Green. Guidetti has scored 10 goals in 11 appearances since joining on loan from Manchester City . It seems likely that more lucrative offers will be available elsewhere, but Sutton believes there would be wisdom in compromising financial interests. ‘Both parties suit each other,’ he said. ‘It’s been good for John Guidetti coming to Celtic and they are a different team with him in it. ‘He has that goal-scoring threat which maybe no other centre-forward at the club has. ‘He can score all different types of goals. Imagine Celtic getting through to the latter stages of the Europa League and they have him to come in? That’s a massive boost. ‘Guidetti might have other options. But sometimes when you have it good, and I know this from my own experience, you should not underestimate that. I hope he does sign, I think on balance he will sign — he would be stupid not to.’ Celtic may have to stretch their existing wage structure to reach a happy outcome. Sutton sees no issue with that and is dismissive of the argument that it could cause dressing-room unrest. ‘Listen, Henrik Larsson deserved to be the best-paid player at Celtic in my time because he was the best player,’ said Sutton. Former striker Chris Sutton has warned Celtic board they must send a strong message to fans . ‘It’s ridiculous for players to bother about what other players are on. If John Guidetti comes in on a big wage and he scores a few goals and does well for Celtic, at home and in Europe, then he deserves his wages. I don’t think that is an issue. ‘If it is an issue then you have the wrong people in the dressing-room.’ Sutton has been fiercely critical of some of Celtic’s displays under Ronny Deila this term, branding the laboured home win over Astra Giurgiu last month as ‘pathetic’. Thursday, he feels, will bring a stern test of the progress made since then. Sutton would not be surprised to see Salzburg make the Europa League Final in Warsaw. ‘I have just been truthful,’ argued Sutton. ‘In terms of where Celtic should be judged, for me it is the Europa League. ‘It would be an enormous achievement for them to qualify. When you look at recent domestic games, including Saturday’s win over Dundee, they have enough to play mediocre games and still win the Scottish league. ‘But if they don’t put on a performance in this one then they will get drubbed because they (Salzburg) are the best team Celtic will have played this season. ‘Salzburg have improved a lot since Celtic played well in Austria. I think they lost a game after that 2-2 draw but since then they have won 11 out of 13. I know Celtic had a tough time against Legia Warsaw but I think Salzburg are a better team.’ BT Sport have live coverage of UEFA Europa League games throughout the group stages and beyond, as well as live coverage of four SPFL games before the end of next month, including Dundee Utd v Celtic (Dec 21).

"A High Court judge in London has removed a jail threat which had been hanging over former Rangers owner Craig Whyte following the launch of civil court proceedings. An arrest warrant had been issued after he failed to attend a High Court hearing relating to a dispute with a ticketing firm. But Mr Justice Newey on Friday discharged an order after Mr Whyte appeared in court. Ex-Rangers owner Craig Whyte,  arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice Rolls Building in London on Friday, admits he is still a supporter of the club and believes it is 'inevitable' they will return to Scottish Premiership .

Proceedings were adjourned. Mr Whyte, 43, failed to attend a hearing after being ordered to pay more than £17 million to Ticketus following a civil court dispute, Mr Justice Newey heard. He was made the subject of a 'suspended committal order' - under which he could have been jailed if found to be in contempt of court. A judge issued an arrest warrant. But Mr Justice Newey discharged that order today - lifting the threat of jail - after Mr Whyte appeared before him. Whyte (centre) leaves Glasgow Sheriff Court after being released on bail from his fraud trial last month . Lawyers for Mr Whyte said he had been out of the country and he would co-operate with proceedings. And Mr Justice Newey said complaints about Mr Whyte would be examined at a later date. Ticketus claimed that Mr Whyte fraudulently or negligently made representations which induced the company to enter into agreements related to the sale or purchase of Rangers season tickets, and claimed damages. The former Rangers owner (left) is accompanied our of the court following his preliminary hearing . Mr Whyte, who took control of Rangers in May 2011, disputed the claim. Ticketus has said that current proceedings are part of the company's 'continued activity to enforce' a judgment 'for damages of £17.7 million' against Mr Whyte. As he left the court, reporters then asked if he thought that Rangers would return to the top. He said 'inevitably'. And asked if he was still and fan and would always support the club, he replied 'of course' and 'yes'. Mr Justice Newey said complaints against Mr Whyte would be examined at a later date.

Montoya signed a new contract earlier this year believing that he was in line to replace Dani Alves as the club's regular right back, but his chances have been limited and he now appears to be fourth in the pecking order.

Brazilian Douglas played in the King's Cup win on Wednesday over lower league Huesca, while utility man Adriano also seems to be ahead of Montoya in Luis Enrique's plans. But Barca coach Enrique, who oversaw training on Saturday morning ahead of Sunday's La Liga clash with Espanyol, denied that he has given up on the home-grown talent. 'I know Martin very well and it is difficult for me to rule out players and so imagine what it would be like for a player that I had with me in the youth team,' Luis Enrique told a news conference.

'I don't want to talk about the possibility of players leaving.' Montoya's agent Juan de Dios Carrasco, however, told Spanish radio on Friday that the player has had enough. 'Montoya will leave, 100 percent, in the winter transfer window,' he told Radio Marca.","Martin Montoya is reportedly a target for Everton in January .

"John Collins believes Celtic must produce their best performance of the season to secure a place in the last 32 of the Europa League. Thursday night’s opponents Salzburg have already qualified from Group D and Celtic spurned a glorious chance to follow suit when they could only draw against minnows Astra in Romania earlier this month. They can, however, progress with a win over a side Collins regards as the best pressing team in Europe, although he has warned standards must be raised after Saturday’s narrow win over Dundee. John Collins (right) has said Celtic may struggle to sign players in January if they don't qualify for the last 32 . ‘If we don’t play well we won’t get a result. It won’t be like the SPFL, where we can be average and still win,’ Collins said. ‘That’s the reality, with no disrespect meant to the other teams. ‘But against this calibre of opposition everybody will have to be at it on Thursday night. Without a doubt, it’ll have to be our best performance of the season. ‘They play with a real intensity and lots of energy and pace. They’re a really fit team who obviously do a lot of good work on the training pitch. That’s where performances come from. ‘They’ve a new coach but it’s the same principles. They’ve got the potential to be in the latter stages. ‘They don’t have “great” names as individual players but they are a team. Everyone knows their jobs and they work hard together from the first minute to the last. They hunt in packs.’ Collins talks to Celtic and Scotland captain Scott Brown during a training session . Central defender Jason Denayer remains a doubt after sustaining a kick to his ankle which saw replaced against Dundee. That is a concern and Collins added: ‘We want our strongest defence available. Salzburg are a very good team. I watched their game from the weekend again on Monday night. They’re probably the best pressing team in Europe. ‘They don’t give you a minute on the ball, so it’s going to be completely different to what we’re used to in the Premiership, where teams sit off us. They just keep pressing you so our players will have to be on their toes and move the ball quickly. ‘If you dwell on the ball against teams like that they’ll take it off you in dangerous positions. ‘It should be a great game for us and that’s what we want — to learn and develop and keep stretching ourselves. We know we’re going to have to have a top performance to get a result. An average performance won’t get a result.’ Defender Jason Denayer said he believes Celtic could reach the semi-final or even final of the Europa League . Failure on Thursday would mean a nervy night in Croatia against Dinamo Zagreb in the final group game in two weeks’ time although Celtic can lose tomorrow and still advance if Astra beat Dinamo. Collins is keen to take care of business with a game in hand however and added: ‘That would be the ideal scenario and that’s the objective on Thursday night. Can we get the job done? ‘Then we could look forward to the last game in the group with no pressure.’ Collins meantime dismissed talk linking him as a potential successor for outgoing SFA Performance Director Mark Wotte and insisted he is happy with his current job. ‘It’s nice of Mark Wotte to say that — but I’m the Celtic assistant manager,’ he said. ‘I’m very happy here and it wouldn’t interest me at this stage.’ Celtic could qualify from their Europa League group when they take on Red Bull Salzburg on Thursday . Collins is an advocate of the SFA’s performance schools strategy implemented by Wotte. The Dutchman’s abrasive style did not win wholesale approval, but the former Scotland international says the nationality of the new man is less important than his ability to deliver results. ‘I don’t think nationality matters at all. It’s about whoever is best for the job,’ said Collins. ‘It’s about quality, not nationality. ‘It’s an important role, a very important role. You need to have someone overseeing it and pushing things on. It keeps everyone on their toes if they know they are being assessed. ‘When someone knows they aren’t being assessed then people can get complacent. There’s no-one springs to mind for me, but I’m sure they’ll be scouring the country and Europe. It has to be a football person, 100 per cent without a doubt.’","Celtic could qualify from their Europa League group on Thursday .

"It has been 16 years since Hearts and Rangers have arguably played in a match of such magnitude. It’s mere coincidence that the game would also be Ally McCoist’s last appearance as a player in the Light Blue. The Tynecastle club triumphed 2-1 on that occasion, lifting the Scottish Cup to end a 36-year trophy drought. Tomorrow, the stakes are rather different — as are the circumstances of both clubs. A win for either could go a long way to deciding the destination of the Championship title and an automatic ticket back to the top flight from which they had plunged in varying states of disarray. This fixture against Hearts is one Rangers boss Ally McCoist will see as a must-win victory for the Light Blues . Danny Wilson of Hearts scores his side's opening goal against Rangers in their 2-1 win at Ibrox in August . Gary Naysmith, who played in that victory for Hearts at Celtic Park back in 1998, knows the rival bosses well. He played alongside Robbie Neilson at Tynecastle, while Ally McCoist coached him at international level with Scotland. And the 36-year-old, currently player/manager of East Fife, believes a victory for his former side would pretty much seal the title before November is out. ‘It’s those two teams fighting it out at the top of the league and if Hearts win, I don’t see them losing a nine-point lead,’ said Naysmith. ‘It’s a massive game for Hearts because they have a great chance in front of 20,000 people to go nine clear after just more than a third of the season gone. But it’s an even bigger game for Rangers, because they know losing would see them fall so far behind. ‘I wouldn’t say Rangers have got a better squad and, with the players Robbie has assembled at Hearts, he would be disappointed not to win the league. ‘His priority at the start of the season would have been to get Hearts up but after such a good start, he will be wanting to go up as champions. ‘It’s all in Hearts’ hands and I think even a draw would suit them. Rangers need to win. So it’s going to be a cracking occasion and a definite sell-out. Ally McCoist looks on as his side prepare for what could be Rangers' biggest game of the season . John Robertson and Colin Cameron celebrate Hearts' cup win against Rangers at Celtic Park 16 years ago . ‘Depending on the result, though, the games between Hearts and Rangers later on in the season could be even bigger than this one as the points may be closer. ‘But you have to make Hearts favourites because they’re six clear and playing at home.’ Should his side lose tomorrow, there are those speculating it may signal the beginning of the end of McCoist’s colourful tenure as manager of the club he loves. In a three-year spell, the all-time Rangers record scorer has been lauded for his off-the-field firefighting while facing regular questions over his ability to lead his side on the park. Asked if he fears for McCoist’s future should they lose, Naysmith countered by insisting the 52-year-old has experience of dealing with such pressure. ‘The speculation is just the nature of the job,’ said Naysmith. ‘Rangers won seven on the bounce, then they draw against Alloa and all of a sudden Ally’s in the last-chance saloon. I think he’s probably immune to it by now. Water off a duck’s back. ‘While Rangers are in turmoil, they’re going to be front and back-page news. But Ally was used to being in the headlines as a player and it’s probably not that hard for him to cope with it. Hearts skipper Wilson will be looking for another win against Rangers in the return fixture at Tynecastle . ‘He doesn’t let it affect him. When we played them recently, he came in before the game for 40 minutes for a cup of tea and a chat. Ally always makes time for you. I don’t know if that’s normal or that he just likes me because of our time with Scotland but he’s just a guy I really respect. ‘I think he’s done a good job because he has been the glue that’s held that club together. I’m not sure anyone else could have done that. ‘Also, they are second in the league behind a very good Hearts side and, if they cut it to three points on Saturday, then it’s all to play for.’ Naysmith worked alongside Neilson at East Fife before he was headhunted by the Tynecastle club and the East Fife boss believes Hearts’ start to the season – 11 wins, two draws, no defeats – clearly marks him out as the coming manager of Scottish football. ‘It’s a fantastic achievement to be 13 games unbeaten,’ he said. ‘They have only conceded seven goals and scored 35 goals so it’s working for Robbie at both ends. ‘Gary Locke and Billy Brown deserve credit, too, for giving the younger players experience of the Premiership last season. Robbie is getting the benefit from that, as well as the changes he has implemented himself. ‘Undoubtedly, his director of football, Craig Levein, will have advised him to sign guys like Prince Buaben and Morgaro Gomis, who he has worked with before at Dundee United. But Robbie Neilson’s his own man and he’s gone up and up in coaching and deserves all the credit in the world.’ *Gary Naysmith was speaking to promote and H2-) event at Mountfleurie Primary School in Fife, in conjunction with Scottish Water and the SPFL Trust .","Hearts take on Rangers in Scottish Championship top of the table clash .

"Livingston have been hammered with a five-point deduction and £10,000 fine for non-payment of tax. At a SPFL disciplinary hearing on Monday, the club admitted rule breaches after failing to advise the governing body that it had previously been in ‘default of its tax obligations in relation to payments made to players’. Had the league hierarchy been made aware of the issue, Livingston would have been banned from signing players during past transfer windows. Bottom club Livingston have been deducted five points in the Scottish Championship after failing to pay taxes . Livingston chairman Gordon McDougall said the club are figuring out how much tax is still owed . The stringent punishment handed down by the SPFL pushes the West Lothian outfit seven points adrift of Cowdenbeath at the foot of the Championship. Livingston chairman Gordon McDougall attended the hearing and said: ‘The club are working with their accountants and HMRC to establish exactly how much tax is due to be paid. We will be making no further comment on the situation.’ SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: ‘The tax default and reporting rules are an integral part of maintaining a fair league competition.’ Manager John McGlynn faces a struggle to keep his side up after only two wins from 14 games this season . Livingston are already operating under a registration embargo because of the case, having volunteered information in August. In an open letter to the SPFL, the board alleged that former chief executive Ged Nixon, who resigned from the club last October, paid undeclared bonuses to players and then manager Gary Bollan in 2010 and 2011. Both the players and Bollan deny receiving such money. Prior to that release, Nixon had launched legal proceedings against the club in a bid to recoup a £311,000 director’s loan. That case is due to be heard in March 2015. Livingston's Myles Hippolyte (right) battles for possession during a cup tie with Stranrear in October . Livingston could face yet more turmoil on Friday when the SFA is expected to finish hearing evidence in the complex case surrounding the shareholding of Neil Rankine. Rankine owns 50 per cent of the shares in the company which owns the club. Livingston have been charged by the governing body of breaching five rules relating to ownership after Rankine was accused of holding interests in both fellow Championship outfit Dumbarton and League Two side East Fife. Rankine has said publicly that he is owed money from Dumbarton after selling the business in 2008 for £1.6million. He denies having any influence at East Fife.","Livingston have been deducted five points and fined £10,000 by the Scottish Professional Football League over tax breaches .

"Embattled Rangers boss Ally McCoist insists he will only walk away from Ibrox if the mounting professional crisis tips over into his family life. It is widely understood that only an inability to fund the seven-figure pay-off guaranteed in his contract has stayed the hands of at least some Rangers powerbrokers eager to dispense with the manager’s service. Yet McCoist publicly declared yesterday that he had ‘absolutely no reason’ to doubt the board’s support for him – while also claiming that he retained the confidence of supporters. Pressure is mounting on Ally McCoist after Rangers suffered a shock defeat to Alloa on Wednesday . McCoist throws his arms out as he protests a decision during their match on Tuesday . He also said that personal abuse directed at him in the aftermath of Wednesday night’s catastrophic late collapse against the part-timers of Alloa was easily brushed aside. However, asked how he would react if the pressure of the situation began to affect his family, McCoist said: ‘Completely different. That’s completely different, there’s nothing more important than my family.’ Pressed on whether he would have a decision to make if his children, in particular, were to be affected, he conceded: ‘One hundred per cent. But there is no sign of that, no. ‘I think the older ones - I can’t speak for them, I can only speak to them - are sensible enough to see the bigger picture and I’m hoping the younger ones are too young to see it. ‘I’m very, very hopeful that I don’t take it (the pressure) home. I’m saying that, you would have to ask people at my home, but I don’t think I take it home. And I think it is very, very important that I don’t take it home.’ Part-time Alloa came from two goals down to beat Rangers 3-2 in the semi-final of the Petrofac Training Cup . Alloa players celebrate wildly after equalising against Rangers during their shock win . McCoist admitted that he hadn’t spoken to anyone on the Rangers board - including the Easdale brothers believed to be pushing for his dismissal - since the Petrofac Training Cup semi-final upset in Clackmannanshire. Yet he insisted: ‘I’ve got absolutely no reason to doubt that I have their support. And until I hear otherwise then I couldn’t comment on it. I’ve got absolutely no doubt at this moment of time that I have their support because I haven’t heard otherwise. ‘I imagine that question has been asked following some of the comments in some of the newspapers this morning. ‘I haven’t read them all but nobody has told me otherwise that I don’t have the support of the board. I don’t feel the need to seek reassurance. ‘Have I lost the confidence of the fans? No. But you always get a reaction from poorer results.’","It is understood that Ally McCoist is only still in a job because Rangers cannot afford his £1million pay-off .

"Nigel Pearson is set to apologise for his foul-mouthed abuse of a Leicester fan — but also reiterate his belief that the club needs the backing of supporters amid this troubled run. The Leicester manager reacted furiously when taunted by a home fan towards the end of the loss to Liverpool on Tuesday night and is understood to have sworn. Leicester have launched an investigation into the incident. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson positions himself in the stands, where he is surrounded by supporters . Leicester lost 3-1 against Liverpool on Tuesday night in the Premier League as they remain bottom . Pearson: 'I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming' Pearson is under pressure with his side bottom following a winless streak stretching to nine games — but his job is not believed to be in jeopardy. He has a good relationship with the club’s Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and signed a three-year contract last June. It is recognised, however, that using an expletive to verbally attack a Leicester supporter, within earshot of children, is not acceptable. Leicester took the lead after Leonardo Ulloa shot rebounded off the post and in off Simon Mignolet's back . The advantage didn't last, though, as Adam Lallana hit back with this left-footed strike . Pearson is expected to use Friday's scheduled press conference to apologise for any offence caused by the flashpoint, which came next to the tunnel after he left his customary seat in the stands for the final few minutes. In the immediate aftermath of the defeat Pearson admitted to a ‘spat’ saying: ‘I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn’t like what he sees, then don’t bother coming.’ He then added: ‘Maybe they ought to think about staying at home. We’ve worked hard and will continue to do so. I don’t like the commitment of my players being questioned.’ Cliff Ginetta, the chairman of Leicester’s supporters club, believes an apology is warranted and would enable Pearson to move past the incident and retain the support of a majority of fans. He said: ‘He should put his hands up, admit he was out of order, apologise to the people and move on, that’s all everyone wants. We don’t want to play it out like a pantomime, we just want to get on with winning games. People are worried and moaning but that’s football fans.’","Leicester boss Nigel Pearson exchanged angry words with fan .

"He might not be speaking the same language as most of his players but David Moyes has had no trouble getting his message through to them in his first full week of training. They all go into Friday night's game against Elche knowing that intensity is the watchword and with the sound of him shouting 'go go go!' at them on the training pitches of Zubieta. 'The coach has told us he wants us moving the ball quicker' says defender Gorka Elustondo who also admits that Moyes wants his team to lose their lightweight pushover tag and become more difficult to play against. They played decent enough football under sacked Jagoba Arasate but the tempo was slow and when they lost the ball they lacked the aggression to win it back quickly. David Moyes is adapting to life as Real Sociedad manager ahead of Friday night's match against Elche . 'We are not the biggest team and we know we have to compensate for that by getting close to the opposition, by upsetting them, and by being a nuisance', he said. The Moyes message appears to be sinking in with the players responding well to the new man despite the demands and the double training sessions that have come with them. Last week was a welcomed first point for the new boss and now they want a winning start at Anoeta against Elche. Once again Moyes will be without central defender Iñigo Martinez who pulled out of the opening fixture against Deportivo just before kick-off. He has the quality to be one of the pillars of Moyes' team and he has also taken on-board the message despite it being delivered in his new coach's broad Scottish accent. Moyes is determined to get his side making life more uncomfortable for their opponents . Despite the language barrier, Moyes is already beginning to get his message accross . VIDEO David Moyes pleased with Sociedad debut . Zubikarai; Carlos Martinez, Elustondo, Ansotegui, De la Bella; Bergara; Vela, Granero, Xabi Prieto, Chory Castro; Agirretxe . 'There is no problem with understanding him,' he says. 'The translator is there for that and you get plenty of your message across with gestures too. We know he wants 100 per cent from us in every game in every tackle.' Moyes will hope that if Barcelona are allowed to sign a player to cover Thomas Vermaelen's likely five-month absence (they are currently investigating the possibility) they do not look to Martinez who has been a target in the past. He will want the Spain U-21 international when he returns to fitness. 'When we played against Manchester United last season we noticed that they were physically much stronger than us' Martinez adds on the subject of Moyes' efforts to toughen up the group he has inherited. Mark Bergara (back) is already becoming a crucial player for Moyes as he establishes his values . Sociedad looked harder to beat than previously this season in their first game under Moyes . The former United and Everton manager will pick an unchanged defence from the one that kept a clean sheet in Riazor and will once again have Markel Bergara in front of the back-four shielding the defence. He is another who looks like becoming one of the cornerstones of this team. 'The training sessions are short but very intense,' says the midfielder. 'He wants us on top of the opposition and he wants us making challenges.' So far supporters are happy with the direction Moyes has taken. 'La Real' had become too easy to beat this season and fans saw against Deportivo that that will no longer be the case. Tonight the visitors are Elche who have yet to lose this month but are still in the bottom three. Moyes is likely to bring experienced playmaker Xabi Prieto into the team at the expense of Sergio Canales but will ask for the same again from his players: intensity, and the first victory of a new era.","Moyes earned a draw in his first game in charge of Spanish club .

"The Louis van Gaal revolution has already started in earnest at Old Trafford - but the Manchester United boss is set to lavish another £150million on new recruitments next summer. Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind all arrived in the summer for upwards of £150m but Van Gaal is nowhere near finished with reshaping his squad just yet. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the five players who top the United manager's wishlist for next summer... KEVIN STROOTMAN (Roma) - Likely fee: £30m . Age: 24 (D.O.B. 13/02/90) Position: Defensive midfielder . Teams: Sparta Rotterdam (2008-11), Utrecht (2011), PSV (2011-13), Roma (2013-) Club appearances: 216 . Club goals: 34 . Holland caps:25 . International goals: 3 . The Roma midfielder, 24, might have been a United player already had he not suffered a knee injury in March and the club have retained a strong interest. Van Gaal is a huge fan of the box-to-box midfielder and even resorted to completely overhauling Holland's formation at the World Cup to 3-5-2 from 4-3-3 due to the absence of who he considered to be the linchpin of his side. Strootman still remains very much a part of Van Gaal's plans going forward and, at just 24, he could become a mainstay in the United midfield. His strong, powerful style should be perfectly suited to the Premier League and he is still being strongly courted by United. Kevin Strootman of Roma is a transfer target for Manchester United next summer . Louis van Gaal is a long-term admirer of Strootman (left) and believes he will excel in the Premier League . DIEGO GODIN (Atletico Madrid) - Likely fee: £28.5m . The experienced Atletico Madrid central defender, 28, is on United’s list of targets but they would have to trigger the £28.5m release clause in his contract if they want to sign him. Godin was a mainstay in the Atletico side who won La Liga last season - as well as reaching the Champions League final, in which he scored. The Uruguay star would bring some much needed knowledge and experience to a United back four which is seriously lacking in those departments. MATS HUMMELS (Borussia Dortmund) - Likely fee: £32m . Despite having been rebuffed in their advances for the Germany centre back last summer, Old Trafford paymasters are ready to try again. Hummels is calm on the ball and, like Godin, would slot straight into the United side at the heart of their defence. Dortmund have struggled this year, however, and sit bottom of the Bundesliga - so Hummels may soon look for pastures new. Age: 25 (D.O.B. 16/12/88) Position: Centre back . Teams: Bayern Munich (2006-07), Borussia Dortmund (loan 2008-09, 2009-) Club appearances: 280 . Club goals: 25 . Germany Caps:38 . International Goals: 4 . Age: 28 (D.O.B. 16/02/86) Position: Centre back . Teams: Cerro (2003-06), Nacional (2006-07), Villareal (2007-10), Atletico Madrid (2010-) Club appearances: 390 . Club goals: 26 . Uruguay Caps: 85 . International Goals: 4 . Diego Godin (left) of Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels (right) are also targets . Godin (left) helped Atletico Madrid to win the Spanish title from centre back last season . Hummels (left) has been playing in a Dortmund team who are bottom of the Bundesliga this season . DANI ALVES (Barcelona) - Likely fee: Free . United want elite players and signing the 31-year-old Brazil right back, out of contract at Barca next summer, would be a coup. Defensive reinforcements are what Van Gaal desperately needs and he could fill the problem right-back position for the club. He is the ultimate modern-day full back - bombing forward at will and far strong going forward than in defence. ARJEN ROBBEN (Bayern Munich) - Likely fee: £20m . Van Gaal has made little secret of his desire to be reunited with the Bayern Munich winger, 30, who was a key member of his Holland squad at the World Cup. Robben is settled in Munich and it remains to be seen whether he would be willing to up sticks and leave an established, dominant Bayern side under Pep Guardiola. A midfield containing both Robben and Angel di Maria at United could be potentially mouthwatering, though. Age: 31 (D.O.B. 06/05/83) Position: Right back . Teams: Bahia (2001-02), Sevilla (2002-08), Barcelona (2008-) Club appearances: 580 . Club goals: 38 . Brazil Caps: 74 . International Goals: 6 . Age: 30 (D.O.B. 23/01/84) Position: Centre back .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has leapt to the defence of Simon Mignolet after the Reds goalkeeper continues to come under heavy criticism for his displays this season. Mignolet was under the microscope of scrutiny once more as the Anfield outfit battled back from a goal down to win 3-1 at Leicester in their Premier League encounter on Tuesday. The 26-year-old nearly gifted the hosts an early lead when his sloppy back-pass found Esteban Cambiasso, but the midfielder could only shoot wide with the goal at his mercy. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Simon Mignolet: 'It's a big step forward' (Archive)Â . Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's displays have been defended by Reds boss Brendan Rodgers . Minutes later the Belgian international did concede at the King Power Stadium, in one of the unluckiest of ways, as Foxes' striker Leonardo Ulloa's shot rebounded off the the post before hitting Mignolet on the head as he scored an own goal. Despite his indifferent display on Tuesday, Rodgers believes his first-choice stopper is improving on a daily basis at the club. 'Simon Mignolet is working very hard on the training field to improve,' he told reporters ahead of their home clash with Sunderland on Saturday. The midweek win saw the Merseysiders complete successive league victories for only the second-time this season and Rodgers believes thier upturn in form is a testament to the character within his squad.

The former Watford manager held discussions with Motherwell and Crystal Palace about managerial and coaching positions but was keen to link up with Moyes on his Spanish adventure.

"It was half past midnight on Saturday night when David Moyes made his way to the Real Sociedad team bus and he admitted: 'Normally I would have watched Match of the Day and gone to bed by now.' That apart, the culture shock was minimal for Moyes on his managerial debut in La Liga on what seemed like a very British night in north-eastern Spain. There was foul weather, feisty challenges, a touchline row that ended in a red card, and even a Saltire flag flying among the pocket of travelling supporters, to make the new coach feel at home. Moyes said he was pleased with his team's first half display and said the signs were encouraging that his players can take on board his demands for greater intensity. David Moyes saw Real Sociedad pick up a point in a goalless draw against Deportivo La Coruna . He said: 'Some people might think you can come here and you are only going to find tiki-taka style but there is intensity to the Spanish game too.

'I have got some incredibly talented footballers here and the playing style is good but they also want to play with intensity and pressing and they also don't have a problem with hitting a longer pass when it's right to do so. 'Intensity doesn't mean that you just run around a lot, your intensity can come from the way you pass the ball or if you have one player who can beat someone one on one. It depends on what you have and I need to find out how we will express our intensity as I get to know my players.' Moyes enjoyed a very British start to has career in Spain . That will become increasingly easier as Moyes spends more time with them on the training ground. He admitted after his first game: 'It is not easy at the start because the players probably aren't even understand how I'm shouting their name at the moment in my broad Scottish accent. 'I've given myself a big challenge. I could have taken other jobs in the Premier League but I wanted to show that I could come out here and do well.' Moyes was also looking to the future when he said he hoped to turn several members of his new squad into Spain internationals emulating the success he had with individual players as Everton coach. Moyes says there are some very talented footballers at Real Sociedad . At Goodison Park he helped players such as Seamus Coleman, Leigthon Baines, Phil Jagielka and Leon Osman to play for their countries and after drawing his first game in charge on Saturday he said: 'I would like to think that my reputation for making players better and in some cases turning them into internationals is pretty good. 'I have got some good young players here and the academy here is really good. [Ruben] Pardo is a good young player and Inigo Martinez is another. My challenge is to turn them into international players in the coming 18 months. I have done it with one or two others so hopefully I can do it with them as well.' Real Sociedad's Esteban Granero competes for the ball with Toche of Deportivo during the goalless draw . His debut might not have given Real Sociedad their first away win of the season but it was memorable from the moment the team plane touched down… and then took off again at La Coruña's airport. 'The weather was so bad the plane couldn't land – it came down and went back up again twice,' said Moyes. 'We ended up having to land at a different airport.' Moyes watches on as Chory Castro comes off during the draw with Deportivo La Coruna . The rain kept up throughout a hard-fought goaless draw marred in the first half by the sending off of Deportivo assistant coach Roberto Cabellud who reacted furiously as Moyes gestured for him to calm down as he made his way down the tunnel. Moyes said afterwards. 'I joked to my assistant when the referee made the sending off that I could see myself getting in trouble on my debut. There was a British feel to it with the rain coming down and the way the tackles were flying in during the first half.'","Real Sociedad drew 0-0 with Deportivo La Coruna in David Moyes' first game .

"Steven Gerrard must take his time before deciding whether to commit his future to Liverpool, according to his former England team-mate Gary Neville. The Reds skipper is out of contract next summer and is yet to sign a new deal despite being offered a contract beyond this season by Brendan Rodgers. But Neville, who has forged a successful media career since hanging up his boots, insists that both parties must not rush into a decision before Christmas. Steven Gerrard, pictured celebrating against Leicester, is out of contract at Liverpool next summer . Gerrard (centre) is yet to sign a new contract at Liverpool despite being offered one by Brendan Rodgers . The former Manchester United defender admits that he is only just starting to have a clear idea of what he wants to do in the future as he juggles his role as a Sky Sports pundit with coaching duties for the Three Lions.Â . Writing in his column for The Daily Telegraph, Neville said: 'Steven Gerrard has entered the 'storm phase' of his career, when big decisions are unavoidable. I can empathise because I'm still in a fact-finding stage of life where he will eventually join me. 'A footballer's life is divided into two halves. From 35-40 the player almost becomes a 16-year-old again, with a blank space stretching out in front. Only now am I starting to feel clearer about how I want the second half of my own life to be. Liverpool's captain is entitled to think about his future with his main focus on what's best for him. 'This week Gerrard told Liverpool fans that he would speak to them when the time was right, which was a sensible stance. I can't quite understand where the fire is coming from on this issue. The idea that a 34-year-old can decide his future before Christmas seems odd to me. My take on it would be that both parties should sit back and relax. There are no flames.' Gary Neville (right), pictured with Jamie Carragher, has become a respected pundit with Sky Sports . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is hoping to keep Gerrard at the club beyond this season . Gerrard can agree a free transfer to a club outside of England from January but Neville sees no reason for Liverpool to panic about losing their captain for nothing. 'The fuss over the decision-making seems counterproductive,' he adds. 'Gerrard and Liverpool Football Club should be making a decision, I would say, around March or April next year. The club should have planned already (or be planning) for life without him. That would be true for any 34-year-old, however illustrious. Gerrard, on the other hand, is approaching post-career mode in his thinking. As so many footballers find, there is no manual and no right or wrong path.'","Steven Gerrard has been offered a new deal at Liverpool .

"Jimmy Bullard and Kendra Wilkinson bit off more than they could chew in Thursday night's 'I'm a Celeb' Bush Tucker Trial. Sitting down at a table-for-two the duo nervously checked in to the make-shift pub named the 'Terror Tavern', where you'd be more likely to be served a gin-and-vomit than a spritzy cocktail. In order to collect the ten stars up for grabs, the former Premier League midfielder and the ex-glamour model were told they must each eat five courses of unappetising bush-themed dishes. Jimmy Bullard showed he had the balls as he tucked into five servings of gruesome bush-themed meals . The former Wigan, Hull and Fulham midfielder winced as he tried to swallow a sheep's testicle . Ex-Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson fought to keep oozing fish eye liquid from dribbling out of her mouth . In keeping with the pub theme, the pair were instructed to throw darts at a specially designed board in order to determine the size of the portions they would eat. With the board divided into 'small' and 'large' sections, Jimmy Bullard was confident his skills with an arrow would help him in the task. 'I'm hoping that a bit of the fear has gone since the first (Bush Tucker Trial),' he said. Stepping up to the oche first in the 'jungle's finest gastro pub' was former Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson, who threw off-centre to be faced with a large portion of the aptly named 'prawn cocktail'. Served with a side of salad, Wilkinson had to eat two sections of bush deer penis. 'Is that a pubic hair? There’s a pubic hair on it,' she squealed. 'The penis is in my throat right now!' she added. The trial included the infamous Witchetty grub, which Bullard had the pleasure of facing (dips included) Next up was Bullard, who hit a double top to receive a small portion of 'ham, egg and (cow's) lips'. Downing in one, Bullard and his cultured palate noted a 'bit of a beef taste'. Hitting small on her second shot with a dart, Wilkinson had to devour a morsel of blended cockroaches, crickets, meal worms and cheese fruit, served on a bed of rice. She did so with aplomb. With the accuracy expected from a former professional footballer, Bullard hit another double top and successfully necked a live Witchetty grub, not without wincing as it slithered down his throat. Following suit with another small portion of 'mixed gill' (fish eye), the American Wilkinson popped her way through the unusual fishy dish: 'I don't even eat seafood,' she squirmed. Bullard then saw off a large serving of 'pig eye steak', working his way through four pig eyes served on a platter with chips, peas and a grilled tomato. No pub would be worth it's salt without the presence of pork scratchings, but in this case Wilkinson got her serving in a packet labelled 'pork snifflings', or more bluntly, a pig's nose. 'It tastes like I'm swallowing farm,' the American moaned. The pair were made to test their throwing skills on the specially designed 'large or small' dart board . The foul trial proved too much for Bullard, who got on all fours to try and get over his disgusting dinner . Former Playboy model Kendra couldn't help but giggle as Bullard tried some Hump Steak - a camel's hump . With another double top, Bullard faced a round of 'mixed nuts', but in this quirky version of the classic pub dish the former Wigan man had to swallow a sheep's testicle. When asked how it tasted by host Ant McPartlin, Bullard replied: 'that's just f****** filth!' With the final round of grizzly meals to come, Williamson chowed down on a large helping of 'cheesy nach-toes', or ostrich foot to be precise. With the offer of an alcoholic drink for all camp-mates on the cards, Bullard's last task took on an added incentive. True to form, the ex-Fulham joker hit small, and begrudgingly nibbled at two pieces of camel hump from a cocktail stick as the matted mounds of camel fur sat in front of him. McPartlin again quizzed the ex-footballer: 'Would you come back (to the Terror Tavern)?' Bullard didn't leave much to the imagination when he responded, 'no its a f****** s***hole!' With 10/10 stars, the successful partnership went back to camp with a big smile. 'I ain't leaving a tip,' Wilkinson joked.","Jimmy Bullard and Kendra Wilkinson took part in gruesome eating trial .

"Sergio Aguero’s super strike to make it 1-1 was Manchester City’s first at the Stadium of Light in more than four-and-a-half years. The last City player to find the back of the net on Wearside was a certain Adam Johnson, now of Sunderland. He curled a delightful equaliser in the final minute of a 1-1 draw in March, 2010.

"It was half past midnight on Saturday when David Moyes made his way to the Real Sociedad team bus after his post-match press conference and admitted: ‘Normally I would have watched Match of the Day and gone to bed by now.’ One of the culture shocks for anyone new to La Liga is that just as the rest of Europe is going to sleep, the Saturday night late kick-off in Spain is just going into injury time. Moyes had just seen his team secure a point against Deportivo La Coruna. It wasn’t the win Terry Venables, Sir Bobby Robson and Howard Kendall all managed on their La Liga debuts, but it did match the point John Toshack picked up in his first game in charge of Real Sociedad, and he went on to win the Copa del Rey there, so the omens are not all bad. David Moyes took charge of his first game since becoming Real Sociedad boss earlier in November . Moyes looked focus as he entered the Riazor Stadium as his Sociedad side travelled to Deportivo La Coruna . The 51-year-old gave a wave to the cameras as he prepared for his first game managing in Spain's top flight . Moyes was involved in a heated exchange with Deportivo assistant Roberto Cabellud in the first half . Sociedad winger Chory Castro (right) dribbles past two Deportivo defenders during the La Liga clash . Real Sociedad had the better of the first half with former Arsenal forward Carlos Vela and one-time QPR midfielder Esteban Granero both going close. The visitors didn’t have it all their own way, though, and goalkeeper Enaut Zubikarai was called on to keep out efforts from Deportivo left back Luisinho and on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Jose Rodriguez. Moyes’s side tired after a testing second period, desperately throwing their bodies in front of shots to earn a draw. But Moyes was positive that the 90-minute intensity he demands from his teams will come. ‘Some people might think you will only find the tiki-taka style here but there is an intensity to the Spanish game, too,’ said Moyes (above). ‘You see that with Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona. As well as moving up the all-time scoring charts during Real Madrid’s 4-0 win, Ronaldo reached 20 league goals before the end of November — becoming the fastest player ever to reach the total, taking just 11 games. It was the 11th consecutive game in which he’d scored and at this rate he would finish with around 70 for the season, beating Messi’s record of 50 in 2012-13. Elsewhere in La Liga, champions Atletico Madrid beat Malaga 3-1 in a fiery encounter at the Vicente Calderon, in which both sides had a man sent off. The result keeps them within four points of top spot. ‘I have some incredibly talented footballers here and the playing style is good, but they also want to play with intensity and pressing and they also don’t have a problem with hitting a longer pass when it is right to do so.’ Progress will become easier as Moyes spends more time with his squad. He admitted after his first game: ‘It is not easy at the start because the players probably aren’t even understanding how I’m shouting their names at the moment.’ He was also looking to the future when he said he hoped to turn several members of his squad into Spain internationals, emulating the success he had with individual players as Everton coach. At Goodison Park he helped players such as Seamus Coleman, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Leon Osman earn call-ups for their countries, and the Scot said: ‘I would like to think that my reputation for making players better, and in some cases, converting them into internationals, is pretty good. ‘I have some good young players here and the academy here is really good. (Ruben) Pardo is a good young player and Inigo Martinez is another. Cristiano Ronaldo reached 20 league goals before the end of November becoming the fastest player to do so . ‘My challenge is to turn them into international players in the coming 18 months. I have done it with one or two others so hopefully I can do it with them as well.’ His debut wasn’t quite the winning starts Venables, Robson and Kendall achieved at Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao respectively, though it did represent Real Sociedad’s first clean sheet since April. It was also memorable from the moment the team plane touched down...and then took off again at La Coruna’s airport on Saturday morning. ‘The weather was so bad the plane couldn’t land — it came down and went back up again twice,’ said Moyes. ‘We ended up having to land at a different airport.’ PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Lionel Messi breaks records at such a rate that it’s easy to get blasé, but this one really is special. His hat-trick in a 5-1 win over Sevilla brought him to 253 goals in 289 league matches, beating Telmo Zarra’s league record of 251. Zarrra, whose mark for Athletic Bilbao lasted 59 years, played until he was 36...Messi is 27. Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, with two goals against Eibar on Saturday, moved to 197 La Liga goals — ninth on the all-time list. The Real Madrid man is two years Messi’s senior but has achieved his total in around half the time as the Argentine.

"Jimmy Bullard almost became the third person to leave the 'I'm A Celebrity' jungle when a freak storm reportedly left him suffering from a panic attack. Whilst taking part in the show's 'Shed of Dread' Bush Tucker Trial alongside fellow former sportsman Carl Fogarty, the two found themselves cut off from the rest of camp when the storm hit. 'Jimmy was talking about leaving the show,' a source told the Daily Star, 'He said he felt unsafe.' Jimmy Bullard and Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty needed to be rescued after a freak storm hit the 'I'm A Celebrity' camp . As the rain lashed down, Bullard reportedly suffered an anxiety attack on his return to camp . To make matters worse, the torrential rain prevented the security team from reaching the duo by washing away all connecting roads. Bullard and Foggy were eventually saved from their bug-infested jail when qualified staff fought their way to them, according to the Daily Star. A favourite to win the show, Bullard reportedly suffered a panic attack when he rejoined the camp upon his rescue. Irish model Nadia Forde and rapper Tinchy Stryder had to give up their task after producers deemed it unsafe . The weather conditions were so adverse that producers were forced to put a stop to the tasks - including another involving Nadia Forde and Tinchy Stryder - due to safety concerns. In an act of kindness the show's bosses gave the celebrities their full ten meals in the hopes to keep them positive. With Gemma Collins leaving after three days and Craig Charles travelling home following the tragic death of his brother, producers did their best to reassure Bullard the storm was a one off. According to reports it would appear they have done the trick... for now at least.

"Mauricio Pochettino can be excused if he has Barcelona on his mind as he attempts to become the first Tottenham manager to win at Chelsea since Terry Venables, nearly a quarter of a century ago. Pochettino had been in charge of Espanyol for only a few games in February 2009 when he took his struggling team to the Nou Camp and ended his team’s 27-year winless run in the derby. ‘I don’t know how we did it,’ said the Spurs boss. ‘Espanyol were bottom and Barcelona were top, and all the people were saying Espanyol were dead and had no chance. Mauricio Pochettino brought his unfancied Espanyol side to the Nou Camp in February 2009 . That Barcelona team contained stars such as Samuel Eto'o (left), Yaya Toure and Lionel Messi . But two goals from Ivan de la Pena (above) secured a famous victory for Pochettino's men at Barca's home . ‘It was Pep Guardiola’s first year and they had Ronaldinho, Eto’o, Henry, Yaya Toure, Xavi, Iniesta, Abidal and Puyol. We had unbelievable players, too. I remember Ivan de la Pena scored two. ‘It was the third or fourth game I was in charge and I had started to set a different style on the team. The plan was to press high and surprise them. As always, you have to be a little bit lucky, too. ‘It was a special victory and an unbelievable memory. It was very satisfying for me because I had played at Espanyol for 11 years.’ Pochettino, the 15th Spurs boss since Venables, has not found it so easy to impose his high-energy style on the squad he inherited at White Hart Lane and there has been an absence of shock wins. Spurs have spluttered, especially at home, but have won their last three games with evidence during the 2-1 victory against Everton on Sunday that his message is finally getting through to the players. Chelsea, however, will provide a different test. Spurs have not won at Stamford Bridge since February 1990 and Jose Mourinho’s team are unbeaten in 20 games in all competitions this season. Terry Venables was the last manager to guide Spurs to victory at Chelsea nearly a quarter of a century ago . David Howells (left) celebrates with Gary Lineker after scoring Spurs' first goal against the Blues in 1990 . They have also kept 11 clean sheets in their last 14 Barclays Premier League home games. How best to crack this defensive stability will dominate Pochettino’s selection and his greatest puzzle is whether to recall Emmanuel Adebayor at the expense of Harry Kane or Roberto Soldado. Kane has been in terrific form and clocked more than 13 kilometres during the Everton game, when Soldado scored his first league goal since March. It would be harsh to axe either man for Adebayor, who was left out after a dismal display at Aston Villa and then reported after international duty with a hamstring problem. When that cleared up, he was out with a virus, but he is fit for selection now. Christian Eriksen nets the equaliser against Everton at White Hart Lane on Sunday . Roberto Soldado slotted home Tottenham's second as Pochettino's men clinched victory over the Toffees . Pochettino's (right) Spurs are now seventh in the Premier League as they gear up for their clash with Chelsea . Pochettino is cautious going into nine games in 30 days, though. ‘You have to analyse the fatigue as we are playing after three days,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you play with two strikers, as we did against Everton, and you say, “Let’s do the same”, but we need to understand a player may need a rest.’ He believes the Europa League campaign has made it harder for Tottenham to adjust to his demands because the gruelling cycle of travel and games limits training time and has prevented him from operating with a settled team. ‘If you are not ready, not smart to manage the squad, maybe the Europa League kills you,’ said Pochettino, and he claimed the recovery process was simpler if the team were winning every week, like Chelsea. ‘It is much easier to recover because you are happy,’ he said. ‘When you laugh, you recover easily. When you lose four games at home, it is difficult to recover easily because you are sad and you don’t sleep.’ Pochettino is weighing up whether to recall Emmanuel Adebayor to his startling line-up . Adebayor's call-up would come at the expense of either Harry Kane (left) or Roberto Soldado . By that token, Chelsea should be raring to go tonight, but Mourinho insists he will not let the dangling carrot of an unbeaten season disrupt Chelsea’s trophy hunt. Arsenal went the entire 2003-04 Premier League season without losing — but fell short in the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup. And Mourinho explained: ‘One thing is, I don’t think it’s possible (to go unbeaten). ‘The other thing is, we are not playing for that because, if you play for that, maybe you draw too many matches, you don’t take risks to try to win matches. ‘You are happy just to be undefeated. If you get 10 draws, you get 10 points. If you win five and lose five, you make 15 points. I’d prefer 15 points. If against Tottenham we have a 0-0 with 20 minutes to go, we are not going to play for the 0-0 to be undefeated. No way.

"Ashley Young thanked his lucky stars for goal-line technology after Manchester United’s win over Stoke – and revealed that his match-saving block from Mame Diouf came off his backside. Young somehow got in the way of Diouf’s last-gasp shot deep into added time to preserve United’s 2-1 win at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. The Goal Decision System was used to tell referee Jon Moss that the ball had not crossed the line. ‘We’re delighted that it has been brought in,’ said Young. ‘The referee was there with his watch, and as soon as the ball hit me and was cleared off the line I looked to see if he was whistling for a goal.

Young admitted he was lucky that goal-line technology was in place to confirm the shot hadn't gone in . ‘I’m not too sure what I was thinking beforehand. Diouf had the shot and I think it came off my bum and went the other way. It was just a reaction for me to turn around and run in that direction. I saw it fall to Mame and it was just a reaction to stick my leg out and hope for the best. ‘Luckily for me I cleared it, but I felt we were the team that could have got more goals. It wasn’t meant to be but we stand here now with the three points and we are looking forward to the next game.’ United went ahead through Marouane Fellaini’s header before Steven Nzonzi equalised for Stoke with a fantastic strike.

It was a nervy last 10 or 15 minutes, but we created chances in the second after scoring the second goal, and I thought we could have finished those chances off.

"Emile Heskey wouldn't think twice about completing a sensational return to Leicester City should he get a call from Nigel Pearson. The 36-year-old is currently without a club after a two-year stint in Australia with the Newcastle Jets. And, given the Foxes have room in their Premier League squad to add extra bodies, signing Heskey on a short-term contract could appeal. Emile Heskey (right), pictured scoring for Leicester against Tottenham, wants to return to the club . Heskey, pictured celebrating a goal for Newcastle Jets, is a free agent after leaving the Australian club . Appearances: 196 . Goals: 46 . Honours: League Cup (1997, 2000) It's something the striker has pondered and is receptive to. 'It goes without saying, I'd love to come,' Heskey told BBC Radio Leicester. 'It is a great club that allowed me to get to the platform that I got to. 'I was an England international when I was with Leicester so that was a great achievement.' Heskey left Filbert Street for £11million when Liverpool came knocking 14 years ago and ended up winning 62 caps for England, although supporters are split on whether a return is in the club's best interests. Foxes boss Nigel Pearson could be on the lookout for a new striker with his side struggling in front of goal . Heskey left Leicester to join Gerard Houllier (left) at Liverpool in an £11million deal in 2000 .

"Manu Tuilagi is the missing link for England according to Leicester, who expect their Anglo-Samoan centre to return from injury later this month and in good time to prepare for the Six Nations. The 23-year-old’s recovery from a groin problem will serve as a Christmas present for club and country. The Tigers and the national team have had cause to lament the absence of the wrecking-ball runner. Tuilagi has not played since suffering his latest setback at the end of October, during a European Champions Cup tie against Ulster. Manu Tuilagi could return in December for Leicester having been out with a groin injury since October . The line-busting centre's comeback will be a massive boost for an England squad struggling in the midfield . He was ruled out of the autumn Tests at Twickenham, amid initial fears that he may not re-surface until the new year, leaving him facing a rush to be ready for championship duty. Instead, Richard Cockerill, Leicester’s director of rugby, said: ‘Manu will hopefully be back by the end of December, give or take a week or two. He needs rest and treatment.’ Asked if the Tigers have been missing their forceful No 13, he added: ‘You’ve got to be able to dent the opposition line. When you are in stalemate, you need physicality - that is the reality of it. Manu gives you that. We have missed that bit of punch in our team.’ His spell of inactivity has been a problem for England, too. National coach Stuart Lancaster has been forced to continually rotate his midfield options in the search for a potent mix, but Cockerill is adamant that a fit Tuilagi provides 50 per cent of the solution at a stroke. Leicester’s director of rugby Richard Cockerill said Tuilagi has left a gaping hole in his club side . Cockerill says Tuilagi should be ready for the Six Nations after a faster than expected recovery . ‘Manu has been huge for England,’ he said. ‘When England have played at their best, Manu has been at his best. Hopefully, he will be fit and playing come Christmas time and he will be back into the England squad for the Six Nations. 'The midfield is the biggest problem England have got, isn’t it? Manu gives you that one position solved. He is their best 13. Then they have to solve who is best at 12 - thankfully that’s somebody else’s problem.’ Leicester endured a turbulent start to the season against a backdrop of multiple injuries, but their fortunes are on the turn. As they prepare for the visit of European champions Toulon on Sunday, England forwards Geoff Parling and Tom Croft are on standby to make comebacks, most likely as replacements. Repeated concussion had cast some doubt over Parling’s future but Cockerill reported that the Lions lock has made a complete recovery. Lions lock Geoff Parling is in consideration for selection for Leicester after a lay-off due to concussions . Parling has been slowly brought back into training and is an outside chance to face  Toulon on Sunday . Tom Croft is also on standby as a possible replacement in their European Champions Cup match . ‘Geoff has been training pretty much fully for the last couple of weeks and he is good to go,’ he said. ‘We’ve given his brain the rest that we’ve been recommended to give it. He has been symptom-free for several weeks now. Obviously he’s not been able to do any contact but he’s been doing full conditioning. ‘On the specialist’s advice we’ve slowly integrated him back into training — non-contact training first, then in the last week or so he’s been starting to do the live tackling and scrummaging. ‘This week he’ll train fully and he will be involved at the weekend.’ Croft was due to return from a knee injury last weekend but withdrew from the game to be at the birth of his daughter, Victoria. Now Cockerill believes the flanker and Parling will want to reclaim their places in the Leicester starting XV, to make a case for new contracts.","Manu Tuilagi is set to return for Leicester for first time since October .

"Mark Webber has praised Mercedes for their handling of the Lewis Hamilton-Nico Rosberg battle for this year's Formula One world title. From day one, when it became apparent Mercedes would be the dominant force this season, motorsport boss Toto Wolff made clear he would allow the duo to race. There were naturally fractious moments as occurred in Bahrain, Spain, Monaco, and especially Belgium where Rosberg chose not to pull out of a crash with Hamilton. Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the F1 title after driving to victory in the final race of the season . Mark Webber (right) was pleased to see Mercedes allowing Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg to race . Hamilton and Rosberg battled until the very last race of the season before Hamilton took the title . That resulted in the 29-year-old German being given a severe dressing down by Wolff who considered imposing team orders at that stage, only to determine it was the wrong approach to adopt. Webber, who like Rosberg missed out on the title in Abu Dhabi in 2010 to his then Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel, was on the receiving end of a number of dubious calls during his time with the team. Recognising the efforts made by Wolff and Mercedes, Webber told Press Association Sport: 'It has been handled impeccably through the whole year between the pair of them. 'It is everything the way it should have been done, and did happen in the end, with the team giving them both a chance. Webber (right) drove for Red Bull for seven seasons before retiring at the end of last year . Hamilton cruises home in Abu Dhabi and the chequered flag is waved to signal his success . 'It's been a good hard battle between two guys from the same team for the first time since (Ayrton) Senna/(Alain) Prost. 'They handled that advantage incredibly well, which is not easy.' Webber, now racing in sportscars with Porsche after retiring from F1 at the end of last season, believes Rosberg will bounce back. The Australian struggled to regain his form after coming so close to landing the title in 2010, added: 'We had other guys in the game that year with Fernando (Alonso) and Lewis there, so it was a bit more intense. 'I've openly said '11 was difficult for me to come back from what happened the year before because I was going to stop at the end of 2010, but I didn't. I kept going a bit. The triumph in the desert sealed a second world championship for British driver Hamilton . Hamilton celebrated with the Union Flag after winning in Abu Dhabi to clinch the world title . 'For '15 for Nico, he has every chance. He's at a different stage of his career than I was, and he's young, even though Lewis is in the ascendancy.' Webber, who attended the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, still concedes to loving F1, although feels it is lacking in certain areas. 'I've enjoyed this season,' added Webber. 'I enjoy watching the front few guys go at it, and I'm passionate about F1. It's the pinnacle, I want it to be the best. 'But the depth of the field, the quality of the drivers towards the back of the grid, has dropped off a bit purely because of team funding.'","Battle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg went down to last race .

"After a hollow winter of taking the positives from defeat, it would be churlish not to celebrate Saturday’s victory over Australia. It was built up as a must-win game, and England won. On a basic level they can do no more. Yet the reflections of Australia coach Michael Cheika in the aftermath contained the tiniest note of warning. ‘We’ve got to be able to deal with scrums, to deal with bombs, those high balls and the mauling,’ he said. ‘I’m not worried. We’ve got something we are going to be adding on down the line that will do that. There are clear areas we’ve got to sort out but if we do it we’ll be all right.’ England players jump for joy as their scrum crashes over the line to allow Ben Morgan to score his second try . Morgan gives out a scream after his first try - but England's game was very forward-dominated . Australia head coach Michael Cheika says his side will not repeat the same mistakes next year . England's scrum was dominant and Australia simply did not know how to deal with it on Saturday . Maybe he was whistling to keep his spirits up. The dominance of England’s forwards was such that it is hard to imagine Australia finding players of equivalent impact and stature in the next 12 months. With the nations due to face each other in World Cup Group A it was important England held the psychological advantage of maintaining supremacy over Australia at HQ - as they have done on three of the last four meetings - and they did. Yet what if Cheika does work his miracle? There is no doubt England were playing Australia at their least prepared and familiar under him. If he is the coach his track record suggests, they will improve. England players celebrate Morgan's second try - but they must adapt to a more expansive game . Stuart Lancaster (second right) celebrates with coaches (from left) Mike Catt, Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell after England's win - but they must know that the side needs to be more expansive to win a World Cup . And this was a victory earned in one facet of the game. It is an important aspect, and can drive a team to victory against the toughest opponents, but if Australia discover a way to match England’s scrum and maul - the vague add-on that Cheika hopes will bring change - what then? So take the positives by all means - they were deserved - but let’s not get carried away. England were the only nation of note to lose to South Africa this winter and Australia are the southern hemisphere’s work in progress. They have players missing - as have England - Cheika has been in the job one month and the team were at the end of a spiteful run of 15 Tests in 25 weeks. This is their worst winter in nine years and they have dropped to fifth in the world rankings, their poorest position since 2008. Brad Barritt (right) was brilliant and was bloodied and led off the Twickenham pitch by physio Phil Pask (left) Morgan was excellent for England and epitomised their decision to try and bludgeon Australia up front . Having been criticised for losing to New Zealand and South Africa, it would be harsh to deny England their due, but this was a win achieved in a very specific way. Australia’s running rugby was superior. Some better decision-making or tighter passing near the try line and it could have been very different. England’s performance was of the bloody, battered, fight-to-a-standstill variety. Courtney Lawes, along with Ben Morgan the man of the match, made 12 tackles in the first hour - a remarkable number for a second row. In total, England delivered 158 tackles to Australia’s 48 and if it didn’t feel like the Alamo that was because England’s forwards were so dominant the home team were behind for only three of 80 minutes and led for 68. England head coach  Lancaster (right) congratulates Courtney Lawes after a magnificent performance . Israel Folau (left) of Australia attempts to evade George Ford - England made a huge 158 tackles on Saturday . Sometimes all that matters, short-term, is victory and this was one of those days. Stuart Lancaster, the coach, pointed out that of England’s 26 tries in 2014, 21 had been scored by the backs, but the game told its own story. This was a nuts-and-bolts triumph. England had identified Australia’s weakness in Ireland last week - it was hardly the best-kept secret - and had ruthlessly exploited it. ‘If you can go through the middle, why do you need to go wide?’ Lancaster asked, and he is right. England powered through the heart of Australia’s defence and there is every likelihood the same tactic will work on October 3 next year. Its wider worth remains to be seen. The England scrum was dominant on Saturday and epitomised the formidable Red Rose pack . Quade Cooper (right) tries to offload the ball to Israel Folau (left) as he is tackled by England players . To win the tournament - and that has to be England’s aim as hosts - is likely to require more and even floundering Australia had the better backs on Saturday, as usual. Certainly, England have no equivalent of Israel Folau. Yet after being humbled by South Africa, Brian Ashton went back to basics at the World Cup in 2007 and England became unlikely finalists. It is perhaps no coincidence, then, that at the end of the game the most animated of England’s coaches was Graham Rowntree, marshal of the forwards. If England have been taking positives that many neutrals had barely glimpsed through the winter, the one consistent quality has been Rowntree’s group. Unfortunately England's back are not expansive enough and they do not have a quality star like Folau (left) Northampton and England blindside Tom Wood feeds Ben Youngs after a clean take at lineout time . The line-out has been consistent, the scrum solid and there will be those who argue that England should continue playing to these strengths and damn the critics. Right now, it would be foolish to pretend England’s backs are a match for the very best: not on the showing this autumn. So to Cardiff, for the opening Six Nations game on Friday, February 6. To say it will be a lively encounter rather underplays the mood and significance. Wales are also World Cup group opponents but few are calling this a must-win game - maybe because it is thought unlikely that England will deliver on the demand. And that puts Saturday’s game into the sharpest perspective. It was a necessary step, an important step, but with limitations. Not least because what England are best at, Wales are, too; plus several others. England's forward got through a huge amount of work against Australia at Twickenham on Saturday . Wales are up first in the Six Nations for England and they'll be formidable opponents after beating South Africa .","England beat Australia through a brute, fight-to-a-standstill performance .

"Ashley Young has urged his Manchester United team-mates to forget moaning about the chaotic festive fixture period and keep going the club's momentum. Boss Louis van Gaal has spoken about his belief that too many games are played over Christmas and the turn of the New Year, but Young insisted that it is the very time for United to leave their rivals trailing. Confidence appears to be rising under Van Gaal after strong recent results, which have left the club fourth in the Premier League. And Young wants United to make the most of their seven games in the next month by catching up with the three teams above them - Southampton, Manchester City and leaders Chelsea - starting with a win against Stoke at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

Sun 28 Dec - Tottenham vs Man Utd . Thu 1 Jan - Stoke vs Man Utd . 'This has always been when United teams come strong and get points on the board,' the 29-year-old winger told ManUtd.com. 'You look further up the table rather than looking around you. We hope to come strong after the Christmas period and that can only set us up for the rest of the season. 'It's a time when you play a game, have a cool down day afterwards and then you are back playing again. But that is what every player wants to do. You want to go out there and play matches and win. 'We have got some big games coming up and everybody wants to play. If you saw our training sessions, you would see that everybody wants to be in the team and playing.' Van Gaal has taken charge of just 13 competitive matches during his first four months in charge at United, but is now on a tough run of nine games in 36 days. United are currently four points adrift of third-placed Southampton, five behind Manchester City and 11 back from Chelsea. United produced this artwork featuring Michael Carrick to promote Tuesday's match against Stoke . ‘I’m not happy but I cannot change it,’ Van Gaal said. ‘I don’t agree with it because I don’t think that it is good for the players that they play another match within two days. In December, it shall be like that. ‘We also have families. I also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and I cannot see them this Christmas. 'But I want to work in the Premier League, I have to adapt and I shall adapt. But I don’t think it is good for players, neither for the families.’ Meanwhile, United midfielder Michael Carrick has backed Robin van Persie to get back to his best as the fear factor slowly returns to Old Trafford. United produced their most convincing display of the season as they overpowered Hull 3-0 in a one-sided contest on Saturday in which Van Persie responded to his critics with a fine goal. Van Persie's form has been indifferent this season and a week before scoring against Hull the Dutchman was heavily criticised for an awful and ineffectual display at Arsenal. 'We all get criticised at certain times and it's something you have to deal with,' said Carrick. 'The best way to answer it is the way he did it against Hull. 'Robin scored a great goal and hopefully that will be the start of a good run over the weeks to come.'","Manchester United face Stoke City at Old Trafford on Tuesday night .

"It’s a measure of how well Luis Suarez has played in his first five games for Barcelona that he is yet to score and there is not so much as a murmur of discontent from supporters towards the £65m striker. Marca dubbed him ‘El Generoso’ after he came off the bench at half time to set up both goals in a 2-1 comeback against Almeria recently and he has earned the ‘Generous One’ nickname with four assists in four league appearances. This is not the first time goals have been hard to come by at a new club. When he finally made it into the first-team of his boyhood club Nacional in Uruguay he struggled to find the back of the net. Luis Suarez has yet score for Barcelona since his £$65million move from Liverpool during the summer . Suarez set up Ivan Rakitic (above) for Barcelona's third goal during his side's recent 5-1 win over Sevilla . Suarez (right) made his Barca debut against Real Madrid and set up Neymar after only four minutes . In his autobiography Crossing the Line released last month he recalls: “At first, I missed chances. Lots and lots of them. It reached the point where people insulted me and whistled me. They called me burro meaning ‘donkey’. Even now I meet people who say to me: ""I used to insult you, I used to shout at you, I was one of those people who thought you were never going to score any goals"".' But at Barcelona there’s no such abuse from supporters because it’s not so much a case of missing chances as not having had them yet. His only clear-cut chance so far came against old club Ajax on an emotional night in the Amsterdam Arena when his shot was parried by the keeper after he ran on to a Lionel Messi pass. But for the most part the golden shoe has become the silver platter serving up goal scoring opportunities on a plate for team-mates. He set-up Neymar to score after only four minutes of his debut at the Santiago Bernabeu and then played Messi in to score what would have been the second only for the Argentine to see his shot saved by Iker Casillas. Suarez has struck up a great relationship, on and off the field, with Barca superstar Lionel Messi (right) Messi, now La Liga top score of all all time, is Barca's most prolific marksman with Suarez providing support . As well as the two assists in one half in that game against Almeria he created Barcelona’s third goal in their 5-1 win over Sevilla on Saturday with a run and cross for Ivan Rakitic to head in. Critics, and there are currently none among Barcelona supporters, will say he was signed to score goals but Messi scores the majority of Barcelona’s goals and has been doing so ever since Pep Guardiola converted him to a centre-forward in 2009. In that 2009-10 campaign he got 34 goals; 31 came in the following season; in 2011-12 he scored 50, he got 46 in 12-13 and last season he reached 28 league goals despite taking a month off mid-season. Zlatan Ibrahimovic could not adapt to playing alongside Messi and left Barcelona after just one season. Thiery Henry (left) and David Villa both saw their goal tallies drop after they moved to Barcelona . The two have struck up a good relationship off and on the field – both partial to the Maté herbal drink so traditional in Argentina and Uruguay – and both sharing a joke on Monday when the draw for next year’s Copa America pitted the two countries together in the same group although Suarez’ on-going international ban will prevent him from playing. Rather than take Messi’s top marksman’s job at Barcelona, the team needed Suarez to give them back the high-pressing intensity that has been lost in the last couple of seasons. He has been able to do that and the quality of some of his assists from his new position on the right of the front three have more than made up for the lack of goals so far. Even when he does start scoring recent history suggests it is unlikely the goals will come in the same quantities as at Liverpool. He will not be the first player to have been a record goalscorer elsewhere whose goal count drops at Barcelona. On top of all his achievements at club level, Suarez is top scorer in the history of the Uruguay national team . Neymar got 14 goals in 17 league games in his last year at Santos but only nine in 25 in his first season with Barcelona. Spain’s all-time top scorer David Villa fared the same. He scored 107 goals in 166 league games for Valencia but when he moved to Barcelona he netted only 33 in 77 matches. Thierry Henry’s goals return also dropped once he had left Arsenal to play alongside Messi. Suarez has adapted his game just as Henry and Villa did. Playing to the right of Messi there is licence to switch to a more central position but the change is usually initiated by the Argentine. Those who cannot or will not adapt to playing alongside Messi tend to leave the club with Zlatan Ibrahimovic doing so after just one season. Suarez might have broken his duck at the weekend but before the ball could reach him at the far post Messi had darted in ahead of him to send it over the line. It was the goal that saw Messi break the all-time league record and Suarez found himself congratulating a team-mate again, instead of taking the plaudits himself. Suarez, in action against Stoke for Liverpool, was top-assist provider in last seasons Premier League . Having scored over 100 times for Ajax, becoming the top scorer in the history of the Uruguay national team and, along with Cristiano Ronaldo, getting more league goals than any other player in Europe last season, it is no wonder his coach Luis Enrique says: 'I don’t think anyone doubts that Luis Suarez is going to score a lot of goals for Barcelona.' Suarez was top-assist provider last season in the Premier League and he is capable of repeating that in Spain. But he will not want to finish too far down the goal charts in his first season and Tuesday night, against Apoel, who are bottom of Group F with only one point, might be the perfect time to get started.

"Tottenham's upturn in fortunes and the absence of Diego Costa makes Harry Kane confident of causing an upset at title-chasing Chelsea this week. Mauricio Pochettino's honeymoon period at the White Hart Lane helm did not last too long, with the pressure ratcheting up thanks in no small part to four defeats in six league matches on home turf. It was a miserable record which looked set to extend when Kevin Mirallas put Everton ahead early in Sunday's match, although efforts from Christian Eriksen and Roberto Soldado secured Spurs a much-needed 2-1 win. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats from Tottenham against Everton . Diego Costa will serve a one-match ban when Chelsea host Tottenham at Stamford Bridge this week . Costa as booked in the stalemate at Sunderland last Saturday but Chelsea still sit top of the Premier League . That was their third straight win in all competitions, setting up Pochettino's side nicely for Wednesday's trip to in-form rivals Chelsea. Jose Mourinho's men have been mightily impressive this term, so much so that going through the season unbeaten looks realistic, but Kane believes the suspension of star turn Costa offers a glimmer of light. 'We're full of confidence,' the striker said. 'Obviously we are coming off three wins in a row now in all competitions, so we'll take that confidence into the game on Wednesday. 'We're looking to get the result. Obviously Chelsea are going to be trying to do the same at home, but they are missing their main man up front. So they have to change a few things, and we're feeling good. 'The Chelsea game is not the be-all or end-all, but it would add to the great momentum we have at the moment if we could beat them. 'That is what we want to do and we will give ourselves the best possible chance.' Harry Kane (left) is confident Tottenham can upset Jose Mourinho's team on Wednesday . As well as an upturn in results, Spurs head to Stamford Bridge buoyed by an improved team display. The Pochettino revolution has yet to fulfil expectations at a club symptomatic with style but on Sunday the team played in the high-pressing, attacking manner he became known for at Southampton. 'We have been working hard, getting our shape together and sliding together, pressing high up the pitch,' Kane said. 'I thought we did that well today and obviously it worked well because we got the result in the end. 'We have been working on it recently. We're getting used to it more, getting fitter. CLICK HERE to read the latest ahead of the big match at Stamford Bridge . 'I thought the lads worked very hard. You saw in the first half we were out of the blocks, trying to get the ball back high up the pitch and that's how we got our second goal.' That winning effort was a particularly important moment for everyone connected with Spurs, given it brought Soldado's 593-minute wait for a goal to an end. 'I am delighted for Roberto to get his goal,' Kane said of his team-mate. 'He has been a tad unlucky in the recent games, so it means a lot to him to get on the scoresheet. 'Obviously the lads are very happy for him and hopefully he can push on and get a few more.' While Spurs ready themselves for the short trip to west London, Everton will look to get back to winning ways when Hull visit on Wednesday. The defeat at White Hart Lane ended an eight-match unbeaten streak in all competitions, after which manager Roberto Martinez lamented a lack of fortune. Roberto Soldado (centre) scored against Everton to ensure Spurs are back in top form . Sylvain Distin offered no excuses, though, playing down the absence of injured midfielder James McCarthy and the influence of Thursday's Europa League match in Wolfsburg. 'We can't expect to win every game,' the Everton defender told the Liverpool Echo. 'It's a tough place to come. 'I don't think you can just point your finger at Thursday night - they are tired as well. 'It's easy to read it that way but this is the Premier League. Games are tough. 'We can change this feeling quickly. That's the beauty of the Premier League. We can't dwell on it too much. 'We have to learn from our mistakes and then move on and be ready.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic continued his return to form with his second goal in a week as Paris Saint-Germain beat Nice 1-0 on Saturday to stay within one point of Ligue 1 leaders Marseille. Ibrahimovic, who missed nearly two months of the season with a heel injury, slotted a penalty into the bottom corner in the 15th minute after Brazilian winger Lucas Moura had been bundled over.

Marseille beat Nantes 2-0 on Friday night and they sit top of the table with 34 points after 15 games. But 33-year-old Ibrahimovic has scored an array of spectacular goals during a distinguished career and he almost added another early on against Nice.

PSG faded in the second half, as has often been the case this season, and struggled to create a chance until Edinson Cavani headed over Serge Aurier's cross in the 74th minute.

"While Rory McIlroy was forced to put his champagne on ice in Dubai, Ian Poulter was seething in the rain in Turkey. For two rounds Poulter had looked to be back to his best after a horrible year, with a lead at one stage of six shots at the Turkish Airlines Open. On Saturday, he produced what he described as a ‘c**p’ performance, shooting a three-over-par 75 that left him level with Lee Westwood and a shot behind Australia’s Wade Ormsby, who leads on 12 under. Ian Poulter described his third round three-over-par 75 at the Turkish Airlines Open as 'c**p' Wade Ormsby of Australia leads by a shot on 12 under par at the Turkish Airlines Open in Antalya . Englishman Lee Westwood is level on 11 under par alongside Ryder Cup team-mate Poulter . More relevant to McIlroy’s interests is the fact that Poulter’s drop in pace allowed Marcel Siem back into contention, with the German also at 11 under par. That raises the possibility of Siem winning the storm-ravaged tournament on Sunday, which would threaten McIlroy’s coronation as the Race to Dubai champion. Siem remains one of only three players - along with Jamie Donaldson and Sergio Garcia, who are respectively 10 and eight shots off the lead here - with a mathematical chance of stopping the Northern Irishman from winning his second Race crown in three years. But to do so Siem needs to wins both this event and the season-ending tournament in Dubai next week, where McIlroy would need to finish outside the top 17. McIlroy is currently practising in Dubai ahead of his return to competitive golf after more than a month off, which has been spent preparing for the trial over his legal dispute with his former management company. Poulter struggles during the third round of the Turkish Airlines Open on SDaturday as he plays from the rough . Danny Willet of England is also in contention at the Turkish Airlines Open on 10 under par after three rounds . Poulter’s concerns were closer to home after a round containing three bogeys and a double at 15 when he miscalculated with a wedge and hit a tree. He has seemingly turned a corner after plummeting from 12th to 44th in the world rankings this year, but was furious about his performance. He said: ‘It was c**p. I’m going to get my head down and do the job. It was really disappointing to be out of rhythm after playing such great golf. As good as it was for two days, this was as poor as it was and disappointing. ‘It’s brought obviously a lot of players back into the fray. Their dinner is going to taste lovely and mine is going to taste horrible.’ Westwood, who shot a brilliant five-under-par 67 after his own struggles this season, said: ‘I’m just going to be enjoying being in contention really. It’s been a while since I’ve been up there, and I know what to do. Just enjoy it and enjoy playing well again.’ England’s Danny Willett is at 10 under, while 48-year-old John Daly is in the frame at eight under.

"Andrea Pirlo's last-gasp goal earned 10-man Juventus a dramatic win over Torino in the Turin derby on Sunday evening. The veteran midfielder struck at the death from 25 yards to break the visitors' hearts, following a heroic effort from Giampiero Ventura's side. The hosts took the lead early on with Arturo Vidal cooly converting from the penalty spot, before Bruno Peres' stunning long-range effort - their first goal in the Turin derby in 12 years and nine months - just seven minutes after looked to have earned Torino a valuable point.

But late drama from Pirlo means Juve have now extended their lead at the top to six points ahead of second-placed Roma's clash with Inter Milan on Sunday evening. Massimiliano Allegri's men started the game by far the brighter and were unlucky not to be ahead inside the opening six minutes as Patrice Evra found Fernando Llorente in the box, with the latter's header ending up just inches over the crossbar. The breakthrough did come soon after though as Juventus took a giant step towards taking maximum points from the month of November. Referee Daniele Orsato had already warned all the players to keep their arms down and when the ball struck Torino's Omar El Kaddouri's arm in the 15th minute, the Italian had no hesitation in pointing to the spot.

Vidal - who missed from the spot against Olympiakos in the Champions League earlier this month - converted from 12 yards, but had to retake it because of encroachment, with the Chile international this time slotting the ball into the opposite corner. The incredible goalscoring drought Torino have had against Juventus was clearly something they were keen to address though, doing so in spectacular fashion just seven minutes later as they got back on level terms. Peres picked up the ball on the edge of his own area before racing all the way up the other end and unleashing a unstoppable effort which went in off the inside of the far post. Both sides had chances to score as the game drew on, with Vidal having the ball in the back of the net for the third time of the evening, but it was correctly ruled out for offside. However, Juventus did go on to snatch the win with practically the last kick of the game, with Pirlo's long-range screamer finding the  bottom left corner to settle an enthralling contest.","Juventus extend lead at the top of Serie A to six points .

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes has every intention of adding to under-fire Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers' misery. A run of four straight defeats this month - including three in the Barclays Premier League - was finally ended with Wednesday's 2-2 draw in the Champions League at Bulgarian side Ludogorets. Next up for Rodgers and the Reds on Saturday is what appears to be a tough Anfield clash with a Stoke side that has already won away at Manchester City and Tottenham this season. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is enduring a tough spell as his side continue a poor run of results . Liverpool's fixtures in the next three weeks: . Stoke (h) Sat 29 Nov (Premier League) Leicester (a) Tue 2 Dec (PL) Sunderland (h) Sat 6 Dec (PL) Basle (h) Tue 9 Dec (Champions League) Man Utd (a) Sun 14 Dec (L) Bournemouth (a) Wed 17 Dec (League Cup) Arsenal (h) Sun 21 Dec (PL) Hughes feels some of the criticism heaped on Rodgers has been unfair given he has been without two players this season who scored 55 goals between them for Liverpool last term. With Luis Suarez sold to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge out for the last three months and not expected to return until the new year due to a thigh injury, it is no wonder Rodgers is feeling the heat. 'When people sense there is a little bit of pressure building then everybody jumps on the bandwagon and tries to add to it, which is unfair,' Hughes said. Stoke manager Mark Hughes hopes to add to Liverpool's miserable run at Anfield on Saturday . Jordan Henderson, Lucas and other Liverpool players look dejected after conceding late at Ludogorets . 'But that happens to all of us. It's not something Brendan is unaware of. He understands how it works. 'But when you lose the services of two strikers such as Suarez and Sturridge, then it's going to impact on you. 'There were only three players in the Premier League last season who scored more than 20 goals, and Liverpool had two of them. Brendan Rodgers cut a frustrated figure on the touchline against Ludogorets on Wednesday evening . 'So that shows where their season was built - on the back of two outstanding strikers. 'They haven't had their services this year so it's going to take a big part of their game away from them.' Naturally, for Hughes it is something to exploit, even if it means piling the pressure on Rodgers. 'They've a big squad that can manage any number of games they have ahead of them,' the Welshman added. Rickie Lambert, who joined in the summer, scored only his second Liverpool goal  against Ludogorets . 'I saw a picture in the paper the other day that showed the strength of their bench, worth something like £100million, so they do have resources they can use. 'The focus that seems to be on them at the moment is maybe something they need to deal with, and if we can add to that, then we will try to do that. 'But they're an outstanding team, with great players, and although it's a tough test for us we've proven this year we can go anywhere and get positive results, so that's our intention again.' Injured striker Mario Balotelli is yet to score a Premier League goal for Liverpool since returning to England . The trip to Liverpool sparks a tough stretch of fixtures for Stoke as they also face Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea in the run-up to Christmas. Despite that, Hughes said: 'We're looking forward to them. 'The big teams are always the test, but we're playing well, despite last week's defeat to Burnley when we didn't play poorly, we just made mistakes, which can happen. 'But confidence-wise we're in very good shape, and that's off the back of a very good performance against Spurs the week before where we won comfortably in my view.

"A high school football team achieved a feat considered almost impossible in the sport, after the ball bounced off a defender's helmet to score a freak 'own goal'. On an extra point attempt, kicker Keegen Hemenway was disappointed when the ball came out low and looked likely to land well below the crossbar. But to his surprise - and that of everyone watching - the ball slammed into a defender's head before bouncing off and sailing through the uprights. Scroll down for video . The ball slammed into a defender's head before bouncing off and sailing through the uprights . The lucky bounce took the Dell Rapids a 38-0 lead over their South Dakota rivals Milbank High School. Clearly, their luck didn't end there as the Dell Rapids went on to win the game 51-0. A video of Keegen scoring the lucky extra point has gone viral on YouTube, with close to 400,000 views. Big Sioux Media’s Matt Larson had live-streamed the game and realized that he had recorded a once in a lifetime play and immediately posted the clip online. Although relatively common in soccer, an 'own goal' is almost unheard of in American football. Milbank High School were already trailing 37-0 when kicker Keegen Hemenway lined up for the extra point . 'I didn't know how to react,' Keegen, an 18-year old in his senior year, told the Dell Rapids Tribune. 'Once they said it was good, I was just pumped. As long as it gets through (the goal posts) it counts.' Keegen said he was shocked by the surprise goal but added that his classmates think it's a bigger deal that he does. 'They won't stop talking about it,' he told the paper. 'People will come up to me and say 'Hey, you're famous.' But it was just one play.' The ball hit the crossbar and sailed through the uprights to give the Dell Rapids an extra point . Since play like this is so rare, there was some confusion initially whether the extra point should be allowed .","Freak 'own goal' seen in game between Dell Rapids and Milbank High School .

"The family of brain-dead teen Jahi McMath have released videos which they say prove she's still alive. In the two clips released on Friday, the 13-year-old is seen lying in her bed at a New Jersey hospital, moving on command. In one clip, her mother, Nailah Winkfield, asks her to move her leg and the girl's foot jerks in reaction. In the other clip, her mother asks her to move her arm, and the girl's hand grips an object before relaxing. McMath's family have been fighting with the state of California ever since December, when the girl was declared brain-dead following a routine tonsil surgery at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland, California. Scroll down for video . Sign of life? The family of brain-dead teen Jahi McMath claim she's still alive, and have released video showing her moving on command. In the above screen grabs, the 13-year-old's foot is seen moving, after her mother, Nailah Winkfield, asks her to move her leg . Tragic: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared brain dead last December following a routine tonsil surgery at a San Francisco, California hospital . Hold tight: In another video clip released by Jahi's family, the 13-year-old is seen gripping an object after being asked by her mother . At the time, three doctors agreed she was legally dead and applied to turn off her life support machine. But McMath's family refused to accept the prognosis and eventually won an injunction preventing the hospital from switching off the ventilator, and transferred the teen to a undisclosed facility in New Jersey willing to keep her alive. Now they're petitioning the court to reverse the death certificate, using the videos as evidence of Jahi's life. 'I always knew cause I'm her mother, and I talk to Jahi, she responds so I said, ""she can't be brain-dead if she's responding,""' her mother, Winkfield, said at a Friday press conference. Keeping her alive: The family won an injunction preventing the hospital switching off life support and agreed a 'protocol' with them in which the teenager could be transferred to another facility while on a ventilator. Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield (right) pictured with her husband Marvin outside Children's Hospital in Oakland in January . Jahi McMath's relatives wants want the teen to be declared alive again so she can be moved back to her home state of California to receive treatment . The family's attorney, Christopher Dolan, says experts are wiling to testify that Jahi's MRI shows sign of some brain activity. 'There's a difference between being brain-damaged and between being brain-dead,' Dolan said. The family will present their case in front of a California judge on October 9. If they win the case, and the death certificate is reversed, Jahi's family will be able to move her back to California where her care would be provided at state taxpayer's expense. However, Dolan insisted that the latest legal maneuver is not about money. Although he did acknowledge that 'she would be eligible for the same state benefits as every other person not brain dead on a ventilator, and who gets full medical care'. Still, many experts are dubious of the new video evidence that Jahi is alive. David Magnus, director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics and co-Chair of the Ethics Committee for the Stanford Health Center of Stanford University, says he hasn't seen the video but that it's common for brain-dead people to have random body movements. 'There's no evidence that patients who are brain dead can ever recover,' Magnus told ABC 7. 'There is no recovery from death.'

"Tottenham can be revealed as the team who play least often during the Saturday 3pm slot traditionally reserved for English league football matches. Spurs have kicked-off at that time in just seven out of 51 Premier League games played since the start of the 2013-14 season, whereas Stoke have played at that time on 31 occasions, the most of any top-flight team. Tottenham fans have also seen their team play just 14 of those games at any time on a Saturday - again the lowest number in the Premier League. The club's involvement in the Europa League, which is played on Thursday nights, can explain much of their absence from the Saturday fixture list as clubs require three days' rest following European fixtures. Roberto Soldado (second right) celebrates scoring during Spurs' win over Everton - on a Sunday, of course . Stoke were beaten by Liverpool at Anfield in their most recent fixture, which kicked-off at 3pm on Saturday . Sportsmail has investigated the kick-off times for each of the teams who have been in the top flight since the start of last season. The results are detailed in the tables below, where you can see on which days your club has played. West Ham are the side who have played most often on a Saturday, the day which was once reserved for the nation to watch their favourite team play. Live broadcasting of Premier League games has gradually eroded the number of matches which kick off at 3pm on Saturdays. Unsurprisingly it is the less fashionable teams which get closest to Stoke's number of 31 kick-offs at that time. Crystal Palace, Hull City and Southampton (all 30) and West Brom (29) have the next highest totals. West Ham, who beat Newcastle on Saturday, have played the most matches on that day in recent times . Diego Costa (centre) was unable to help Chelsea beat Sunderland on Saturday's evening kick-off . Of the established 'big four' clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United - it is Jose Mourinho's team which has played in the traditional slot the most with 13, while the Reds played just nine games at that time. Liverpool and champions Manchester City top the list of teams who have played in the early kick-off on Saturday at 12.45pm, with eight apiece.

"Carlo Ancelotti has now gone where no Real Madrid manager has ever gone before – winning his 16th straight match. Real Madrid’s 2-1 victory over Malaga took the team’s winning streak to a new record, going past the 15-match run that Jose Mourinho managed in the 2011-12 season and Miguel Muñoz in the 1960-61 campaign. Real beat Malaga with goals from Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale to move further clear at the top of La Liga ahead of Barcelona’s meeting with Valencia on Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Malaga 1-2 Real Madrid . Gareth Bale (left) celebrates with Karim Benzema (right) after the France striker put Real Madrid ahead on 18 minutes .

Bale (left) then scored six minutes from time with a cool right-footed strike to finish a Real counter attack . Bale celebrates his winner, a goal which meant Real have now won 16 consecutive matches in all competitions, a new club record . Malaga: Kameni 9; Rosales 6, Sergio Sánchez 6 (Angeleri 67), Weligton 7, Boka 6; Duda 7 (Juanpi 78), Recio 7 (Horta 65), Darder 6; Castillejo 7, Samu 6, Santa Cruz 6. Subs not used: Antunes, Ochoa, Rescaldani, Luis Alberto. Goals: Santa Cruz 90 . Real Madrid: Casillas 6, Carvajal (Varane 85) 6, Pepe 8, Ramos 7, Marcelo 6, Isco 6, Kroos 6, Rodriguez 6, Bale (Hernandez 89) 7, Benzema (Illarramendi 73) 8, Ronaldo 7. Subs not used: Fabio Coentrao, Navas, Nacho, Llorente. Goals: Benzema 18, Bale 84 . Malaga came into the game unbeaten at home and had only conceded two goals. But Madrid had Benzema on a run of scoring in four straight games, Isco going back where he shone for Malaga in the Champions League and scored 14 goals in 69 matches, and Ronaldo who had already scored 20 goals in 11 games and they were always going to prove to be their biggest challenge of the season. Real started strongly and Ronaldo almost scored on 12 minutes when played in by Bale on the edge of the six-yard box. The Portuguese striker got his shot away quickly but Carlos Kameni made the reflex save. Malaga responded with their first chance and Iker Casillas needed to be at his best to tip of a header from Roque Santa Cruz over the bar. Madrid took the lead on 18 minutes when Roanldo stormed down the left and crossed for Karim Benzema to poke the ball past Kameni. Benzema could have scored from another Ronaldo assist on the half hour when Ronaldo’s free-kick was saved by Kameni and ran to the Frenchman but Rosales reacted quickly and cleared. Five minutes before the break Ronaldo slipped a pass through for Bale but Kameni came off his line quickly to palm the ball away for a corner. The home side’s keeper was keeping Malaga in the game and just before the break they so nearly took full advantage of that when Duda hammered a free-kick against Casillas’ cross-bar. Ronaldo provided the assists for both Benzema and Bale as Real won 2-1 in Malaga . Ronaldo tries to make full contact with the ball through an acrobatic kick in Madrid's game against Malaga on Saturday evening . Real kept up the pressure in the second half with Bale heading just over from Kroos’ free-kick and Isco charging through only to see Kameni smother his shot. All the time there was just one goal in the game Malaga sensed they had a chance and Santa Cruz went close from a corner with a header that just cleared the crossbar. Malaga were also boosted by signs of fatigue from Madrid. Benzema went off exhausted with 15 minutes left to be replaced by Asier Illaramendi but any number of tired Madrid players could have made way. Madrid’s incredible winning run began back in October when they beat Basel 5-1 in the Champions League. They had won 10 games in the league and four more in Europe since then with two victories over Liverpool and big Clasico victory over Barcelona the standout results. But they came into the game with some concerns about fatigue. Midfielder Toni Kroos has played an incredible 88 games in the last year and a half and had to start this game with Madrid coping without the injured Luka Modric.

Ronaldo missed a great late chance to score a second when a defensive lapse allowed him to connect with a Bale cross but Kameni again made the save. That made for a nervous last ten minutes and a Casillas fumble almost let Santa Cruz in but Illaramendi cleared to prevent the goal. With seven minutes left Bale brought an end to the anxiety when Ronaldo flicked the ball into his path and the Welshman stormed through taking two touches to get the ball out of his feet before he hammered it past Kameni. There still some more late drama when Isco was harshly sent off for a second yellow card offence, Juanpi hit a post from a corner and Santa Cruz converted a 92nd minute header. It was, however, just a consolation as Madrid took the points and Ancelotti took the record.","Karim Benzema put Real Madrid ahead on 18 minutes, converting Cristiano Ronaldo's cross from close range .

"Graphic: A woman has filed a lawsuit claiming that a nurse took this photo, of her which has been pixelated, with pencils in her eyes following a failed suicide attempt . A woman who blinded herself by jabbing pencils in her eyes during a suicide attempt is suing Los Angeles County, claiming her photo was taken without her permission at a hospital and went viral online. The suit was filed Monday by David Bliss, the guardian of the woman who survived her suicide attempt but lost her sight. The plaintiff claims unauthorized disclosure of medical information, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, breach of duty and public disclosure of private facts. The woman, identified only as Jane Doe in the suit, was admitted to County-USC Medical Center in 2012 after she tried to end her life at another medical facility. The lawsuit says someone, believed to be a nurse, took an unauthorized photo of her with yellow pencils sticking out of her eyes and shared it with another person, who in turn sent it Joshua Shivers. Shivers used his mother Linda's computer to post the image to a ‘shock’ website, the suit stated, adding that the photo has since been viewed more than 192,000 times. The specific website to which it was posted was not disclosed. On the day the image was uploaded online, Shivers allegedly bragged about his handiwork writing: 'I finally made it in life. Please check out my shiz,' City News Service reported via Los Angeles Daily News. Treatment: The patient, Jane Doe, was taken to County-USC Medical Center in 2012 after she tried to end her life . ‘Everybody knows that as soon as someone gets their hands on something like this, it goes viral and the harm is done,’ said the plaintiff’s attorney, Douglas Johnson, who specializes in privacy cases. Johnson said that before filing the lawsuit against the medical center and Los Angeles County officials who administer the hospital, he asked them to have the picture taken down from the Web by exercising a copyright they hold over photo, since it was taken in their facility. County spokesman David Sommers said officials are investigating the allegations in the lawsuit, and he declined to comment further. The lawsuit also names as defendants Joshua Shivers and his mother, Linda. They could not be reached for comment. Mother-son duo: The lawsuit names Joshua Shivers (left), who allegedly used his mother Linda's (right) computer to upload the patient's photo, which he had received from a third party, onto a 'shock' website .

"Sergio Aguero does not have to be on the scoresheet to have a match-winning influence. Granted, there are not many games these days in which the Argentine fails to find the net, as an impressive tally of 17 goals already this season proves. But on those rare occasions when Aguero doesn't score, you appreciate his all-round contribution to Manchester City's cause even more. Sergio Aguero led the Manchester City line superbly in their 3-0 win at Southampton despite not scoring . Aguero takes on Morgan Schneiderlin (left), Jose Fonte (middle) and Toby Alderweireld during the match . Aguero was a constant menace for the Southampton back line all afternoon and influential in City's victory . Aguero scored a hat-trick in City's midweek win over Bayern Munich, taking his season's tally to 17 goals . Sunday's emphatic 3-0 victory at Southampton was a case in point. Aguero led the line magnificently, turning in one of his best performances of the season. He didn't score but still defined the outcome of the game, like Luis Suarez used to for Liverpool. Plotting his 42 touches of the ball on a map of the pitch, as Match of the Day 2 did in their analysis on Sunday night, showed how Aguero caused problems for the whole Southampton back line. He was here, there and everywhere. Left side, right side, through the middle. The striker spent the afternoon as a busybody, twisting and turning past challenges, drifting into space, orchestrating the attack, carving out chances. He set-up City's first goal for Yaya Toure and their third for Gael Clichy. He also should have won a penalty when brought down by Jose Fonte, only to be shown a yellow card for simulation in a senseless decision by referee Mike Jones. Match of the Day's Aguero touch map showed how he caused problems for the entire Saints back line . Aguero's heat map from the Southampton match shows how he led the City line right across the pitch . Aguero should have been awarded a penalty when Jose Fonte fouled him inside the box . VIDEO Aguero is no cheat - Pellegrini . But referee Mike Jones decided Aguero had dived and brandished a yellow card . Aguero celebrates with Yaya Toure after the setting up the midfielder to score City's opening goal . Aguero laid the ball back perfectly to Toure, who smashed the ball in from outside the box . Had Aguero not missed a straightforward chance at the far post in the 64th minute it would have been the perfect performance to mark his 100th Premier League game. No matter. His all-round contribution underlined - as if we needed further proof - that his priceless importance goes far beyond goals. Aguero's work-rate couldn't be faulted - he ran 9.7km during the match and recovered possession on three occasions through his relentless pursuit of Southampton's defenders. His sensational hat-trick against Bayern Munich last week looks like a turning point in City's season. Prior to that match, they had won just twice in seven matches in all competitions. Suddenly, they look a more unified and effective force. City may have given Chelsea a head-start in the Premier League title race but they're not about to give up the chase. City find themselves six points behind Chelsea at the top of the Premier League table . Aguero is thwarted by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster as he tries to cap his performance with a goal . Aguero also delivered the ball for Gael Clichy to score Manchester City's third goal late on . Aguero will have the same influence on City's title challenge as Luis Suarez did for Liverpool last season . Aguero will have the singular impact on City's challenge for silverware this season as Suarez had for Liverpool last. Suarez scored 31 Premier League goals as Liverpool finished a fraction short of the title. But his all-round contribution in setting up goals for others and his general commitment and work ethic were also exceptional. Aguero is exactly the same - a talismanic figure who will also top 30 goals - it's just he does all this without bringing any embarrassment on his club. Suarez will always be tainted by his biting and racism controversies however many goals he scores. He's Suarez minus the madness and his all-round contribution needs to be appreciated.","Man City produced an impressive performance to beat Southampton 3-0 .

"Michael Carrick hopes Manchester United can follow up their 3-0 win against Hull by beating Stoke at Old Trafford on Tuesday. The midfielder, who has started Manchester United's last three games following his return from injury, was happy with his side's performance against the Tigers. However he has urged his team-mates to follow up their impressive victory against Steve Bruce's side by claiming all three points in midweek. Michael Carrick was delighted with Manchester United's 3-0 Premier League win against Hull on Saturday .

'We controlled the game from the start and played some really good football. Hopefully they'll be more of the same on Tuesday. 'Our downfall this season is that we've had to change the team too much and we haven't had a consistent run with this squad. Hopefully that will change now and it's nice to have a game so quick so we can keep that momentum going. 'It's been strange in some ways [having no midweek games] compared to what we've been used to over the years but it's something that we've got to grips with. It was a good performance and win against Hull but it's behind us now and our focus is on Tuesday.' The 33-year-old also lavished praise on team-mate Robin van Persie following the Dutchman's first goal for his club in just over a month. Carrick added: 'It was some strike! It was only really half a chance, but he's controlled it and smashed it into the top corner. 'It's great when the boys up front are creating chances and scoring goals.

"Gus Poyet says the ‘exceptional’ Lee Cattermole set an example of how to combat Chelsea’s star-studded midfield during their goalless draw at the Stadium of Light. The Sunderland anchorman was man-of-the-match as the Black Cats became only the third team to take points from Jose Mourinho’s side this season. Cattermole – who on Sunday collects the North East Football Writers’ Player of the Year award – was imperious as he out-fought the likes of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic and unsettled the creative flair of Eden Hazard and Oscar. Lee Cattermole robs Eden Hazard of possession during the 0-0 draw against Chelsea on Saturday . Sunderland's Cattermole vies for the ball with Chelsea central midfielder Cesc Fabregas . And Poyet said: ‘What he did, Lee Cattermole, was an example of how you need to play in the middle of the park against a top team. ‘When you need to go for a tackle, when you need to cover, when you need to follow someone, when you need to go deep, when you need to go higher, when you make a foul, even that. Sometimes it’s needed, and he was exceptional. ‘I’m sure he is going to go home feeling that his role in the team is very important, and he is recognised today by defending and being a leader in terms of defending.’ Poyet, meanwhile, was thrilled with his side’s resilience. Cattermole challenges Chelsea's Brazilian star Willian for the ball during the match at the Stadium of Light . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was full of praise for his 'exceptional' midfielder after the game . ‘To have the chance to get something from a team like Chelsea, first you need to defend,’ he said. ‘You need to defend properly and you need to make it very difficult and you need to be a team, organised, shape, throwing bodies in front of the ball, and have everything you need to do to play a football game against one of the best teams, and we did that. ‘That’s the beginning, that’s the minimum. The other side, the chances – at the end, they were coming because there was space and we were enjoying it, the fans were loving it.’","Lee Cattermole set an example against Chelsea, says Gus Poyet .

"Jean-Eric Vergne has announced he will not be driving for Toro Rosso next season, ending months of speculation over his future in Formula One. The Frenchman missed out on a high-profile promotion to parent team Red Bull, with his rookie team-mate Daniil Kvyat selected to take over from departing four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel. Vergne, 24, was still amongst the contenders to drive for Toro Rosso in 2015 - although one seat was taken when the marque announced 17-year-old Max Verstappen would be welcomed into the fold.

That left Vergne, with three years' previous racing experience with the team, vying for the one remaining spot against the likes of Carlos Sainz Jr, Pierre Gasly and Alex Lynn - with the former running in the post-season Abu Dhabi test. But he tweeted on Wednesday afternoon that his future lies elsewhere: 'Despite a good season & 22 pts, I'll not drive anymore for Toro Rosso in 2015. Thanks for those years. Let's go for another big challenge,' he wrote. On the surface there appears to be very little room left on the grid for Vergne, with McLaren and Caterham the only teams yet to finalise their driver line-ups and the latter still unsure as to their own future in F1.

"Anthony Hamilton's 'Info Wing' is to undergo a few design tweaks after a successful maiden track test in Abu Dhabi. Force India ran the LED display system on top of one of their cars on the second day of the final two-day test of the season at the Yas Marina circuit. Using information provided from race control, the aim of the concept is to provide to the viewing public positional data, along with other information such as tyre strategy and on-track flag condition. The Info Wing was tested by Force India in Abu Dhabi, it was placed above the driver's head . The test at least highlighted to Hamilton, whose son Lewis was crowned Formula One world champion for a second time last Sunday, where areas of modification are required. Hamilton said: 'As I suspected the bright sunlight made it a bit difficult to see the LEDs when the cars were out on track. 'In the garage it looked like it was going to be bright enough, and at particular points on the circuit it looked bright enough. 'But we're probably going to need to change the LEDs, make them slightly larger and slightly brighter. Problems appeared when it proved difficult to see the LED lights in the bright sunshine . 'Overall (Force India) thought it looked quite good and think it's going to work well if we can just brighten it up slightly. 'You can do as much testing here in the UK you think is viable, but obviously we don't have the bright sunshine like in Abu Dhabi. 'Nevertheless it was a good test, and it bodes well for the new version.' The next version of the system will incorporate a new-shaped camera mount and a double-LED display showing not only race position data, but also the first three letters of a driver's surname. The technology will be able to display a variety of information once it is fully operational . 'Based on the feedback we're going to be designing the new unit right now, and I hope to have the new circuit board ready in the next three weeks,' added Hamilton . 'I'm going to persevere with it because based on the story that emerged last week there has been a huge amount of interest. 'People love the idea, although of course there are the die-hard fans who say 'we understand racing, we don't need that'. 'But it's not just for the die-hard fans, it's for fans generally.' Hamilton is currently awaiting feedback from the sport's world governing body the FIA.","The 'Info Wing' was tested in Abu Dhabi by Force India .

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has shrugged off criticism aimed at him and insists he does not dwell on individual performances whether they are good or bad. The Belgium international came under even more scrutiny after an error in the midweek Champions League tie but responded with only his third clean sheet in 25 appearances in the scrappy 1-0 win over Stoke. Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar this week blamed him for the club's poor start to the campaign, criticising his inability to deal with crosses or command his area, but it has not even registered with Mignolet. Simon Mignolet has come under heavy criticism this season for some high-profile mistakes . Glen Johnson's late goal against Stoke ensured Liverpool took three points at the weekend . 'I deal with a good performance the same as a poor performance - you have to accept it and move on,' he said after Liverpool ended a three-match losing run in the league. 'What I did after the (Ludogorets) game was look forward to the next game and that is what I will do again today. 'It is always pleasing as a goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet but the most important thing is to get back to winning ways and hopefully we can build a bit of momentum now. 'If you play at home you want to win games and we did the job and that is all that counts. 'There is another game on Tuesday (against bottom side Leicester) and we will look forward to that one.' Johnson looked groggy as he was attended to by the Liverpool medical staff after his goal . Steven Gerrard was dropped on the 16th anniversary of his debut, but he came on as substitute . Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar blamed the Reds' poor start on Mignolet . After an instantly forgettable first half which saw Liverpool lack any semblance of cutting edge or even an idea of how they were to break down Stoke they improved after the break. However, Jordan Henderson, standing in for the rested Steven Gerrard as captain, Raheem Sterling, Lucas Leiva and Rickie Lambert all had decent chances to score, but it was only after the visitors had hit the post through Bojan Krkic and Mignolet had produced a brilliant close-range block to deny Biram Mame Diouf that the winner came - from the most unlikely of sources. Henderson swung in a cross for Lambert to head over goalkeeper Asmir Begovic and back off the crossbar and right-back Glen Johnson was quickest to react with a low diving header to bundle the ball over the line with five minutes remaining. Liverpool survived a nervous seven minutes of stoppage time to record only their third clean sheet of the season in a defence which saw one change from the midweek Champions League draw with Jose Enrique in at left-back, allowing Johnson to switch to his preferred right with Javier Manquillo the one to miss out. That meant a first league start since February 12 for Kolo Toure, who had impressed at centre-back in the last two European matches. 'He has got the experience. He has played throughout the years and he knows what he is capable of doing,' Mignolet said of the 33-year-old Ivorian. 'He can help the team and organise them so we know what to expect from him and he works his socks off every day in training and is always ready when the gaffer needs him.' Despite playing behind another changed back four Mignolet said it made no difference to him. 'We are professional football players so we have to deal with that,' he added. 'You train with all the lads in training every single day so you know what they can do and you know what their capabilities are.' Mignolet (centre) was all smiles as Liverpool left the Anfield pitch on Sunday . Stoke manager Mark Hughes felt his side deserved a point with summer signing Krkic impressing. 'I thought the outstanding player was Bojan. He was unfortunate to hit the post and had an outstanding volley at the end,' said the Potters boss. 'Everyone saw the quality he has. He is getting stronger in every game. 'He is enjoying the Premier League, enjoying playing for us. We need to give him the ball more often because he has the ability to produce.'","Simon Mignolet came under scrutiny in the week after an error gifted Ludogorets a goal in the Champions League .

"Paul Mitchell was this week appointed as Tottenham's head of recruitment and analysis, but head coach Mauricio Pochettino has indicated he had nothing to do with his departure from former club Southampton. A week after high-flying Saints opened their £33million training ground, reports emanated that the 33-year-old would be following the former Argentina international to White Hart Lane. Pochettino penned a five-year deal as head coach in the summer and on Wednesday it was confirmed that Mitchell had also made the move to north London. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has insisted he had nothing to with the hiring of Paul Mitchell . Southampton's head of recruitment and analysis was recruited by Spurs earlier this week . Tottenham are believed to have paid Southampton compensation for the former Wigan and MK Dons player, who links up again with the coaching staff he worked with at St Mary's. Pochettino, though, suggests it was others at the club and not him that took the decision to hire Mitchell. 'I never spoke about the new appointment,' the Spurs boss said. 'I know Paul from Southampton but only I say all the best and good luck in his job.' Asked if he had any role in the appointment, Pochettino said: 'No. The club find him and proposed the job.' Mitchell's arrival at Tottenham will further complicate an already politically charged structure, with director of football Franco Baldini and chairman Daniel Levy both prominent in transfer negotiations. Tottenham technical director Franco Baldini could be heading for the White Hart Lane exit door . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is unfazed by the exit of the Mitchell from St Mary's . It also leaves a void at Southampton, yet manager Ronald Koeman is unfazed by the exit of the man that has headed up the club's scouting and recruitment department since January 2012. 'I think it more of a reflection of what he did and what the club is doing over the last few years,' Koeman said. 'Okay, we would like to keep everybody in, but it is football, it is life. There are changes, not only with the players but managers, with technical directors, with chairmen - as well in the position of Paul Mitchell. 'Good luck to him, and we have to look for another one to bring in.'","Mauricio Pochettino says he had no involvement with hiring Paul Mitchell .

"A decision on changes to the funding of Olympic sports will not be taken until after the general election in May - but could include team sports being funded in a different way. UK Sport is holding a consultation exercise on changes to its 'no compromise' funding system which funnels public money to those sports winning Olympic and Paralympic medals. There has been criticism from team sports such as basketball, which now receives no UK Sport money despite being popular in terms of participation, that the system is unfair and favours sports which have many medal chances such as cycling, rowing and swimming. UK Sport will decide which Olympic sports will receive funding from the public . Great Britain won 65 medals - 29 of which were gold - during the 2012 Olympic Games in London . UK Sport's consultation ends on December 10 and its board will then make recommendations to ministers - however it will be the Government that is in power after the general election in May which will make the final decision and changes will be brought in after the Rio 2016 Games. UK Sport chairman Rod Carr said the organisation firmly believed that its no compromise approach had delivered, with record medal hauls at London 2012 and this year's Sochi winter Olympics but confirmed that a decision to treat team sports differently could emerge as a 'strong' option. He said: 'It's possible that that will come out as a strong option. 'There is an acceptance on the UK Sport board that there may be an opportunity here to do things better. 'We will collate all the information from the governing bodies - those that are funded and those that are not funded - as well as the athletes and the general public and make recommendations on that basis.' Carr said it was also possible that the decision would be not to change the current approach and instead recommend that team sports such as basketball should only receive funding from bodies such as Sport England, which targets the grassroots and participation, and should not be funded at elite level unless it can prove it can challenge for medals.","Final decision to be made after the general election in May .

"The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and every week, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside. NEWS-MAKER . LeBron's James return to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat was the big story of the summer but all has not gone to plan so far. Only three players have more turnovers (46) than LeBron this campaign and the Cavs, who were expected to steamroll the weaker Eastern Conference, only ended a four-game losing streak when they overmatched the Orlando Magic 106-74 on Monday night. Still, James was phenomenal in that game, finishing with 29 points, four rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in what was perhaps Cleveland's best performance of the season to date. So far the Cavs' have struggled due to lack of overall depth. The team's 'Big Three' (LeBron, fellow new signing Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving) were expected to make the Cavs immediate contenders, but, Love and Irving have yet to match the defensive consistency of LeBron's old Miami colleagues Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. This team's potential might be greater than that of the Heat, who won two titles and reached two more NBA finals during James' four-year spell in Florida, but they are still a long way away from looking like potential champions. LeBron James (right) celebrates with Dion Waiters during Cleveland Cavalier's game on Wednesday . GOOD WEEK . The Golden State Warriors made it six wins on the spin on Tuesday night as they enjoyed a 114-97 win over the Miami Heat. The star of the show was undoubtedly Stephen Curry who continues to illustrate why he is one of the best pure shooters to ever play the game. The league's foremost marksmen poured in a season-high 40 points on 12-of-19 shooting (including a silly 8-of-11 from three-point distance) in the victory as the Warriors moved to 11-2 under new coach Steve Kerr. Stephen Curry (centre) has impressed this season, and continues to illustrate why he's one of the best . BAD WEEK . Last week we told you about how the Philadelphia 76ers had lost their first 11 games of the season. Fast forward a week and they STILL haven't won a match. They did lead at half-time of Monday night's game against the Portland Trazil Blazers but fell to a 114-104 loss in the end. The Sixers are now 0-15 and in massive danger of setting a record for the worst start in NBA history. The 2009-10 Nets currently hold that questionable honour after beginning the season 0-18. 'Nobody is rolling over or pointing fingers,' 76ers coach Brett Brown said after the Portland loss. 'This locker room is great. You go home and sleep OK. It wasn't that bad. There were a lot of positives tonight.' God only knows how positive he will be if they actually win a game. Philadelphia 76ers have lost their first 15 matches of the season, approaching the worst ever start . NOBODY GETS KOBE BRYANT ON THE CHEAP . Another struggling team are the LA Lakers and Kobe Bryant is taking a lot of the heat for signing a two-year, $48.5 million contract extension last season. The NBA has a strict salary cap and some have painted Bryant as selfish and greedy for not taking less so the Lakers could enjoy more financial flexibility moving forward. Kobe is not in the mood for apologising to anybody though. When asked what he thought about Dirk Nowitzki giving the Dallas Mavericks a 'hometown discount' when it came to renewing his deal, Kobe said: 'It's the popular thing to do The player takes less, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think it's a big coup for the owners to put players in situations where public perception puts pressure on them to take less money. Because if you don't, then you get criticised for it.' For the record the Mavs are 10-5 and the Lakers are 3-11 . Kobe Bryant (left) has been branded selfish and greedy for not taking a smaller salary at LA Lakers . AND FINALLY... His dad, Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent), may have made it big in the music industry, but Marquise Jackson has been making some noise on the basketball court. The high school senior produced a 'mixtape' to try and attract the attention of college teams. On the video he shows a versatile skill set. He can handle the ball, knock it down from long range and set his teammates up for open looks. He has also been playing against, and matching, some of the best prospects in the country. Alas his small stature, he is just 5' 9', has stopped big colleges recruiting him, but he could be one growth spurt away from becoming relevant in the sport.

"LeBron James claimed that violence is not the answer after rioters took over cities across America when it was determined that police officer Darren Wilson will not face charges related to the death of 18-year-old Micheal Brown. The basketball superstar condemned the violent protests across the nation, saying that the rioting was hurting more people. Members of a grand jury decided earlier this week that police officer Wilson would not face criminal charges related to the death of teenager Brown in August in Ferguson, Missouri.

"Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu played down talk of a rift between himself and coach Luis Enrique ahead of Sunday's Primera Division trip to his former club Valencia. The 31-year-old France international will make a 'special' return to the Mestalla for the first time this weekend, having ended his five-year association with Los Che when he joined Barca in the summer. And he will do so having sought to clear the air with Enrique after comments made by the player in the wake of last month's El Clasico defeat by Real Madrid. VIDEO Scroll down to watch . Jeremy Mathieu has rubbished claims suggesting he has fallen out with Barcelona boss Luis Enrique . Mathieu was said to have been unhappy at having to play at full back against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . Barcelona boss Enrique said 'we should all pack up and go home' after Mathieu's comments . Mathieu admitted he was surprised at being deployed at left back at the Bernabeu, having impressed at the heart of the Barcelona defence early in the season. Enrique responded by saying if Mathieu was surprised, 'we should all pack up and go home'. Mathieu addressed the matter at a press conference on Friday lunchtime, and was quoted by the Spanish press as saying: 'It was a comment I did not say with any controversy. 'When I signed, we talked about who could play both central and at full back. I just said that I was surprised to be playing in that position. '(But) it is the coach who decides, and if he says I have to play there again, I'll play.' Valencia had a tough season in 2013/14, finishing eighth, and, although they have picked up only one point from their last two games, they have collected 16 points from a possible 18 on home turf this term. And Mathieu knows exactly what to expect from Nuno's side. 'Playing against Valencia will be a special game for me, I will not deny it,' he said. 'Valencia have changed a lot with regards to last season. They have a squad that can do great things.' The Frenchman, pictured with Adriano and Neymar, is looking forward to facing former side Valencia . Mathieu played at Valencia for five years before sealing a move to Barcelona in the summer . Defender Thomas Vermaelen could miss his entire first season with Barca as he requires thigh surgery, but that news was offset by a number of positives over the past week with Lionel Messi having become the all-time leading scorer in both La Liga and the Champions League. The Argentina forward scored a hat-trick in a 5-1 triumph over Sevilla last weekend to make it 253 goals in 289 league appearances, and bagged another treble in a 4-0 midweek win at APOEL Nicosia to make it 74 goals in Europe's top club competition. Mathieu was full of praise for his team-mate, saying: 'I can see Messi ending his career at Barca. He is a legend as a player. 'It's only normal for Messi to play all the time. We need him in every game because he is a very important player.' Valencia midfielder Andre Gomes felt Sunday's game would provide a good opportunity for his team to make a statement. 'They are a great team and we want to get back to being a top team,' the on-loan Benfica man said on www.valenciacf.com. 'It's in these games that we want to show that we are doing well. 'We are playing at home and will do everything possible to win the game, because we are Valencia.' 'We always try to start the game well. At home, with the help of the fans, we always try everything in odder to get the win. We want to show that Valencia  are a great side.'","Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu said he was surprised at being deployed at left back against Real Madrid .

"Sam Burgess admits his short-term future in rugby union lies in the centre - even if Bath coach Mike Ford sees him as a 'barnstorming back rower'. League convert Burgess made a 17-minute cameo from the bench as Bath went top of the Aviva Premiership with a 25-6 victory over Harlequins at the Recreation Ground on Friday night. Burgess' arrival in the centre would have delighted England coach Stuart Lancaster who believes the 25-year-old can make a real impact in that position at next year's World Cup, and the Dewsbury-born powerhouse admits that is where his formative education in union will take place. Sam Burgess charges into the Harlequins defence with his first touch of the ball in rugby union . 'I've been mixing it up in training but I think I'll stay at centre for now, certainly over the next few games,' Burgess said after tasting his first action since his final game for the South Sydney Rabbitohs on October 5 when he played almost the entire NRL Grand Final with a fractured cheekbone. 'But we've got a lot of time. It's certainly not an overnight transition and the worst thing we could do is rush it. 'It was always going to be hard but I've really enjoyed it and everyone's been open to teaching me things. 'The game's tough to learn and I was sat on the bench a little bit nervous. There was plenty of excitement at the Rec as rugby league superstar Sam Burgess was named on the bench . 'I haven't felt that for a while but I enjoyed the feeling and the adrenalin and once you get on the field you just enjoy the game.' Burgess admits he has thought about next year's Rugby World Cup in England but insists he has much to grasp about union before breaking into the national team set-up. 'I think everyone's got an eye on the World Cup,' Burgess said. 'I'm not going to be naive and dismiss it, but it would be stupid to waste energy looking at that. 'I'm using all my energy to focusing on training here with the guys, knuckling down and working hard with my team-mates at Bath. A tearful Burgess celebrates winning the NRL Grand Final with the South Sydney Rabbitohs last month . 'It's great to be part of that. We train intensely and it's been great to slot into that environment, but I will learn most through time on the field with the guys.' Ford said he was delighted with Burgess' introduction to union a month ahead of schedule, something which Lancaster described as 'a bonus' with the World Cup in mind. But he suggested that playing Burgess at inside-centre could be short-lived with a place in the Bath back row very much an option. 'The two carries he had were very, very good,' Ford said. 'He needs to get out there and play and when the pressure's on that will accelerate his learning. Burgess chats to Bath head coach Mike Ford at the Recreation Ground last month . 'There's a plan there and Sam's first few games are going to come at 12, but when it's dry we're going to have a look at him in the back row as well. 'Personally, I think that will suit Sam personally more. It's a gut feeling of mine as he's a guy who carries and tackles a lot and I don't want to stick him out in the centre to do nothing. 'That's not his skill set. Can we get him over the gain line with six, seven or eight on his back? 'Of course we can and the next month or so we'll know where he is. 'My vision is for Sam to be a barnstorming back row and we'll see how it unfolds, it'll be a good journey.'","Sam Burgess made first appearance for Bath in the 63rd minute in the 25-6 victory over Harlequins at The Rec on Friday night .

Sam Burgess chats to Bath head coach Mike Ford at the Recreation Ground last month . Anticipation is high as the powerful 25-year-old begins his transition from league in earnest, not least among England's coaching team who will be hoping he can make an impact in time for next year's Word Cup. However, Stuart Lancaster insists competition for places in his squad is fierce regardless of whether Burgess is natural at home in the centres or back row. 'Sam is very realistic and knows he has to learn the game. Without doubt he's a quality individual and quality rugby player,' England head coach Lancaster said. A tearful Burgess celebrates winning the NRL Grand Final with the South Sydney Rabbitohs last month . England head coach Stuart Lancaster oversees training this week ahead f facing Australia on Saturday . 'Some make the transition from league to union quickly, others don't.

'Then he will have to prove he has something over and above or at least as much as the equivalent England players in his position. 'We will subjectively and objectively assess all the players and Sam will come into that equation because clearly he's a good player. This is just one game of many he will play in union.

"The RFU has banned two men from Twickenham for two months for the alleged homophobic abuse aimed towards Welsh referee Nigel Owens during England's defeat to New Zealand earlier this month. Both men will also pay £1,000 each to a charity of Owens' choosing following an initial RFU investigation. However, there is a second ongoing investigation into the alleged incident - which took place during the November international at Twickenham on November 8 and came to light in a letter from a spectator published in The Guardian. Referee Nigel Owens (left) is one of only a handful of openly homosexual people in rugby . 'As a lifelong rugby fan, a straight man in his 60s, I could not believe that a bunch of men half my age watching a rugby match in the 21st century could be capable of hurling such nasty, foul-mouthed, racist, homophobic abuse at an openly gay match official,' Keith Wilson, from South Yorkshire, wrote in a letter to The Guardian on Wednesday. 'My equally disgusted son is in his 30s but next to him, hearing this vitriol, was a little boy. 'I felt ashamed.' And Owens, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, says it's others the abusers are hurting, not himself. 'They go to the stadiums, get drunk and think its fine to shout abuse,' Owens said. 'It's up to rugby people in the stadium saying 'that's not acceptable in this sport' so we can get rid of them from the game.' 'I'd tell them to think twice about saying things, because it's not me they're hurting, it's the young kid sitting in the row in front who's maybe dealing with their own sexuality. 'The most difficult thing I ever had to do in my life was accepting I was gay. It's someone sitting two seats away, going through what I went through, dealing with who they are, who are the people they're putting in danger. The Welsh official is widely considered to be one of the world's best referees . 'I've been there myself and I know they can tip you over the edge, I had a second chance, let's make sure that we don't put other people in that situation - because there's no need for it in society and no need for it in life. 'People say that I've broken down barriers by being a gay man in sport, but the true heroes here are the ones who don't stand by, who stand up and bring it to the attention of the governing bodies.' Owens is one of only a handful of homosexual people in rugby and admitted he contemplated suicide before he came out. He is also an extremely highly-respected referee and is regarded as one of world's finest officials. Two men have been banned from Twickenham for two years for the alleged homophobic abuse . In a statement on Friday, RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie said: 'While instances of this nature are exceptionally rare, the RFU takes rugby's values of teamwork, respect, enjoyment, discipline and sportsmanship very seriously, and is determined to uphold them. 'We are all guardians of these aspects of the game, on and off the pitch, and it is these values which make the sport special.' In addition, the RFU has insisted it will endeavour to underline exactly what is expected from supporters at Twickenham - with messaging being inserted into every ticket pack, programme, on LED boards and big screens throughout the ground highlighting the behaviour expected. A fan sparked the RFU probe by claiming he was 'ashamed' at the abuse aimed at Owens .

"England made their final preparations before facing Australia as they took to the field during the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday. Team captain Chris Robshaw led the final training session before the clash against the Wallabies on Saturday, as manager Stuart Lancaster paid close attention from the sidelines. Backs coach Andy Farrell has called for a positive end to the QBE series following defeats by New Zealand and South Africa in recent weeks, and the pressure is on for England at Twickenham following comments about the seeming decline in performances since the RBS 6 Nations.

England fly-half George Ford cranks back his leg as he practices his kicking in preparation for the arrival of the Australia team . It is a game England dare not lose as the countdown to next year's home World Cup continues, but England backs coach Andy Farrell welcomes the pressure. 'This is a big game. We're disappointed with having lost two games and we obviously want to finish the autumn on a high with a performance and scoreline to match,' Farrell said. 'We want a great performance heading into the Six Nations. I'm excited about this match and the fact we've lost out marginally in a couple of games, albeit we've not been at our best. 'Australia are in a very similar position to us. This match is the end of their season and they want to finish on a high. It's a big game for both teams. 'If you can take the positives out of the defeats then it's that Australia have become the pressure game we want. The bigger the game, the better at this stage.' England and Australia collide in a pivotal World Cup group showdown at Twickenham on October 3 - Wales also share a heavyweight pool - but Farrell subscribes to the view that events on Saturday will have little influence on what happens 10 months hence.

'Australia are just getting together as a newish side as well. We're all in trouble if we don't improve between now and then,' Farrell said. 'Our performances have not been what they could be, so it's important that we go away with a good feeling within the camp. 'We want to wake up on Sunday morning and say our goodbyes to one another and say that is the standard we want to come back to. 'It will make it a lot easier if we come into the Six Nations on the front foot.' The stakes are equally high for the Wallabies, who arrive at Twickenham on the back of successive defeats to France and Ireland. 'Australia are renowned for attacking football. They have shown this autumn that they like to run the ball from everywhere. They will be our biggest test defensively,' Farrell said.

"Dylan Hartley has lifted the lid on the social-media ‘bullying’ he has endured which came to a head after his yellow card in the recent defeat against South Africa. The England hooker has become familiar with the demoralising routine: on-field crime and punishment, followed by a mixture of legitimate criticism and excessive abuse. This time, he had cause to believe he had been harshly penalised for his actions, but that didn’t stop the Twitter trolls tearing into him. In the aftermath of that QBE series match on November 15, Hartley exposed some of the hostile comments he was receiving. Now, having been recalled to the starting XV after being demoted to the bench for the win against Samoa, the 28-year-old has spoken out about the online bile he has had to face. Hartley leaves the field at Twickenham after he was sin-binned late on in England's loss to South Africa . Hartley was yellow carded for walking on South Africa number eight Duane Vermeulen (above) Asked about retweeting several messages, he said: ‘Those were the nice ones as well. I got sick of it because I get quite a bit of that on a regular basis. That week all we had got is stick. So I thought I’d do it to highlight that it’s going on. People shouldn’t accept it. I wasn’t upset or drunk, I just thought it was the best way for people to see what they (trolls) write. Hopefully I made some people realise.’ Hartley’s experience of such a social-media backlash follows recent events which led to one of Britain’s leading Olympians becoming a target, and he added: ‘Just because Jess Ennis-Hill is a pretty young lady who you shouldn’t bully, you shouldn’t do it to anyone. Just because I’m a big, burly rugby player, I have feelings too. You can’t cyber-bully anyone.’ The unsavoury abuse was prompted by Hartley’s latest disciplinary episode, but this one was different to some of his more notorious offences. The Springboks were repeatedly pulling down England’s lethal driving maul and when the referee took no action while Duane Vermeulen lay on the floor trying to illegally disrupt the pack, Hartley simply walked over him. Hartley (centre) has been recalled to the line-up and will pack down with David Wilson (left) and Joe Marler . Sin-binned for stamping, Hartley insists what he did is standard practice at club level. ‘It was stupid, yeah, but it wasn’t crazy,’ he said. ‘I made a point of tapping him before I did it and told the ref he was in the way and wasn’t moving. I didn’t go for a knee, I went for a fleshy part! I knew stamping was illegal so I walked over him. ‘In most club games, you would get away with that, but on the big stage it’s been made pretty clear you can’t. Bloody slow-motion cameras! It was stupid but it wasn’t red mist. In a club game you can probably police that yourselves but on the big stage, no.’","Dylan Hartley received a torrent of abuse on Twitter after his sin-binning against South Africa at Twickenham .

"When Jack Wilshere signed his first long-term contract at Arsenal in the summer of 2009, there was a real sense of excitement around the club. Wilshere was already the Gunners' youngest ever player in the league, and although he had played just six minutes of top-flight football, there was a belief around the Emirates that he was the future. What they did not see coming was the amount of time he would spend out injured. Jack Wilshere's many injuries which have seen him miss more than 100 weeks through injury in five years . Wilshere could be out for up to four months after this tackle by Manchester United's Paddy McNair . Wilshere broke into Arsenal's first team as a 17-year-old and has always been tipped for the top . The Arsenal star became the club's youngest ever Premier League player when he broke through in 2009 . But Wilshere has been hampered by injuries since his Gunners debut, with his ankles suffering most damage . October 24 2009 - Ankle - until Dec 2 (5 1/2 weeks) Jan 8 2010 - Hamstring - until Feb 9 (4 1/2 weeks) November 14 2010 - Back - until Nov 23 (1 1/2 weeks) August 1 2011 - Ankle - until Oct 27 2012 (65 weeks) February 9 2013 - Hip - until Feb 16 (1 week - missed 0 games) March 3 2013 - Ankle - until April 13 (4 1/2 weeks) May 20 2013 - Ankle surgery - until July 4 (6 1/2 weeks) October 31 2013 - Ankle - until November 10 (1 1/2 weeks) Jan 24 2014 - Ankle - until Feb 8 (2 weeks) March 5 2014 - Ankle - until May 11 (9 weeks) October 26 2014 - Ankle/ilness - until Nov 9 (2 weeks) November 22 2014 - Ankle - Up to four months (16 weeks) Total: 119 weeks injured . Back in 2009, Arsene Wenger spoke glowingly of his young star: 'At still 17 years of age, the potential is huge for Jack and we’re all delighted that he has committed his long-term future to Arsenal Football Club.' Wilshere came off the bench in two Champions League games that autumn, completed 90 minutes in the League Cup, and made a Premier League appearance in a win over Birmingham. The world, it seemed, was at his feet. But, just as the teenager was building some momentum, he picked up his first injury, an ankle knock that kept him out of first team action for six weeks. The midfielder bounced back, making his full Premier League debut in early February, and playing a part in 15 league games that season. But since that first injury five years ago, Wilshere has been plagued by ankle complaints, missing more than 100 weeks of football with various injuries. Arsene Wenger looks on anxiously as his midfielder is treated for yet another injury, this time at Sunderland . Wilshere is an England regular, but has seen his playing time limited by persistent problems with his ankles . The young midfielder sits on the floor with an anguished look on his face after his latest injury set-back . With his latest set-back possibly requiring yet more surgery, Wilshere could be out until March, at which point he will have missed 119 weeks with injury in five years - meaning the young star has been injured an incredible 43 per cent of his Arsenal career. During that time the 22-year-old has racked up 95 Premier League appearances, which may seem a lot at his age but it is just a fraction of what Wenger would have hoped for. Wilshere has had hip, hamstring and back injuries over the last five years, but the vast majority of his issues have been with his ankles, which will, by the time he returns, have ruled him out of almost 112 weeks of football. Wilshere missed the entirety of Euro 2012 during his longest spell on the sidelines, which lasted 65 weeks . The star has been out for 119 of the last 279 weeks, an astonishing 43 per cent of the time . Perhaps the only positive from Wilshere’s latest injury is that it did not occur on his right ankle, which has previously required surgery. ‘It does not look good,’ admitted Arsenal manager Wenger. ‘There is no bone damage but there is ligament damage. It is just how [long] it is, which we should know next week.' Even in a best case scenario, it is another sad chapter in the sorry tale of missed opportunity that is Jack Wilshere's injury-stifled career to date.","Jack Wilshere picked up injury against Manchester United last week .

"Chief executive James Sutherland has announced Cricket Australia will 'immediately' conduct an investigation into player safety in the wake of Phillip Hughes' death on Thursday. The cricketing world has been in mourning for the last 24 hours following confirmation that Hughes died from injuries suffered during a Sheffield Shield game on Tuesday, when the South Australia batsman was struck on the head by a bouncer bowled by New South Wales paceman Sean Abbott. After being too early on a pull stroke, the 25-year-old was hit by a ball on the back, lower left side of his head, just below his helmet. He never regained consciousness.

'Statistics say it's clearly a freak incident, but one freak incident is one freak incident too many,' he said at a media conference in Sydney.

"The cricket world was in a state of shock on Thursday night as it struggled to come to terms with the death of Phillip Hughes, who never regained consciousness after being hit by a ball and collapsing while batting in a Sheffield Shield match. The news that cricket had been dreading ever since the horrific incident at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday came early on Thursday morning when it was confirmed the Australian batsman had lost the biggest fight of his young life. Australia team doctor Peter Brukner broke the news at the city’s St Vincent’s Hospital, where Hughes had been placed in an induced coma after emergency surgery on his brain following extensive treatment on the SCG outfield. Phillip Hughes has died at the age of 25 at St Vincent's Hospital after being struck in the back of the head by a short-pitched ball .

Michael Clarke, Australia’s captain and a close friend of Hughes, had kept vigil at the hospital alongside Hughes’ family for much of the 48 hours following the incident. He read out a statement on behalf of the stricken batsman’s parents Greg and Virginia and his brother and sister Jason and Megan. ‘We are devastated by the loss of our much-loved son and brother Phillip,’ read Clarke. ‘It has been a very difficult few days. We appreciated all the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the public.’ Clarke, struggling to contain his emotion, added: ‘Cricket was Phillip’s life and we as a family shared that love of the game with him. We would like to thank all the medical and nursing staff at St Vincent’s Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip. We love you.’ Devastated Australia captain Clarke pictured at a press conference following Hughes' death on Thursday .

It emerged that Hughes, who would have been 26 on Sunday, was the victim of a freak injury when he was hit in the neck attempting to pull a delivery from young New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott while batting for South Australia. When Hughes, who had been expected to return to the Australia Test side against India next week after an 18-month absence, was struck below his helmet at the back of his head, one of the main arteries to his brain was compressed. ‘The impact caused the vertebral artery to split and for bleeding to go up into the brain,’ said Dr Brukner. ‘Phillip had a massive bleed into his brain. This was a freakish accident and this type of injury is incredibly rare. The Australia batsman's parents, Greg and Virginia Hughes, and sister Megan in Sydney following the devastating news .

Brett Lee (left) in Sydney after the tragic passing of Hughes and Mitchell Johnson (right) who said he was 'extremely saddened' Test matches have been played for almost 140 years but deaths are very rare in cricket, although Phillip Hughes is the second player in two years to sustain a fatal blow. Darryn Randall, who was 32 and a former first-class player in South Africa, was killed after being struck on the side of the head during a domestic match in the Eastern Cape last year. In 1998, former India Test player Raman Lamba died after being struck on the head while fielding during a match in Bangladesh. Nottinghamshire’s George Summers died after being hit on the head while batting at Lord’s in 1870, and Abdul Aziz died after he was hit over the heart in a 1959 Pakistan first-class match. ‘If you look at the literature there have only been around 100 cases ever reported and only one of those was caused by being hit by a cricket ball. Yes, we have to review our procedures and equipment but it is a very unusual injury.’ Hughes had briefly put his hands on his knees after being struck by the unfortunate Abbott, who has been offered counselling by Cricket Australia, and then collapsed face first to the ground before medics rushed on to the outfield. ‘The head injury that he suffered was catastrophic,’ said Dr Tony Grabs, the trauma director at St Vincent’s, who said that Hughes had 80 minutes of surgery but showed little improvement before he died. Fears had grown for the left-handed batsman, who played in 26 Tests, as a procession of team-mates, friends and Australian greats like Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh visited Hughes in hospital and left in tears or grim faced. The visitors also included Abbott, who had made his international Twenty20 debut for Australia alongside Hughes against Pakistan in Dubai just six weeks ago and who now has to contend with his unwitting part in this tragedy. Hughes wallops Anderson (right) through the covers during the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge last summer . Former England bowler David Lawrence was in a similar situation to Abbott when he struck West Indies batsman Phil Simmons — who also had to undergo emergency brain surgery — in a tour match at Bristol 26 years ago. ‘What gave me comfort was that I was able to see Phil Simmons 48 hours later and he told me it wasn’t my fault,’ said Lawrence. ‘The bowler in this instance wasn’t able to do that so my thoughts go out to him, too. Personally, I don’t think he’ll play cricket again.’ Play in the third Test between New Zealand and Pakistan in Sharjah was abandoned for the day while India’s tour match in Adelaide ahead of next week’s scheduled first Test was cancelled. England’s one-day international against Sri Lanka on Saturday will go ahead after a two-minute silence in honour of Hughes. Australia’s rugby players will wear black armbands when they face England at Twickenham. Hughes of Australia enjoys victory with his father Greg after his Test debut against South Africa in 2009 . The Australian cricketers will hold a meeting before deciding whether next Thursday’s Test will go ahead, with Cricket Australia likely to leave the decision up to individuals like Brad Haddin, David Warner and Nathan Lyon, who were playing for New South Wales when the accident happened and comforted Hughes during his 40 minutes treatment. Cricket now faces an anxious spell of introspection while it considers what, if anything, can be done to make the game safer. Hughes was wearing a 2013 Masuri helmet which has marginally less protection than their newer model, but no helmet on the market would have been likely to save him. This means that a redesign will be looked at. ‘This will re-focus the way we look to develop our range,’ said Nick Wilton, who helps to design helmets for Gray-Nicolls. ‘This sad, sad case will ensure that everything is looked at again.’","Australia Test batsman Phillip Hughes passed away at Sydney's St Vincent Hospital aged 25 .

"England and Saracens centre Brad Barritt faces four weeks on the sidelines after damaging his calf during the final QBE international against Australia. Barritt, who finished the match resembling a prize fighter following a clash of heads with Wallaby winger Rob Horne, suffered a calf injury which is expected to keep him out until the New Year. Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘Brad pulled his calf in the last game for England. Saracens centre Brad Barritt (above) leaves the field at Twickenham following England's win over Australia . ‘It’s obviously hugely disappointing for us to lose him for four weeks when he comes back with a pretty significant injury like that.

Owen Farrell started at inside centre and scored a first-half try and an important 65th- minute drop goal before Chris Ashton averted a late Sale surge with a crucial turnover.

"Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has said no decision has been taken on whether the first Test against India will go ahead next week as Australia mourns the loss of batsman Phillip Hughes. Australia were due to begin the first of four Tests in Brisbane next Thursday but that has now been cast into doubt following the death of Hughes on Thursday.

"Tributes poured to Phillip Hughes after the Australian batsman lost his life two days after being struck by a bouncer while batting for South Australia at the SCG. Hughes, who passed away three days before his 26th birthday, dominated the front pages in his homeland. Team-mates past and present, opposition players - including Kevin Pietersen - and politicians remembered a cricketer who won respect on and off the field. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . The Age reflects on the tragedy, asking its readers to take nothing for granted . The Melbourne paper carries a personal piece from former England batsman Kevin Pietersen, entitled: 'Quiet, humble, fearless... the Phillip Hughes That I Knew'. Pietersen says that Hughes was a player whose scores he would look out for, saying he batted with a 'wonderful spirit and freedom', before paying tribute to his game-changing batting ability. 'I know a lot of people were talking very positively about how he was developing his cricket. He was moulding his game to Test cricket. He batted beautifully, and responsibly, against us [England] at Trent Bridge last year, making an unbeaten 81 in the first innings,' Pietersen says. 'He was a dangerous player who you wanted to get out early because you knew if he stayed in for a whole session he would score quickly.' Pietersen added that Sean Abbott, the bowler of the fateful delivery, needs support. 'He needs a lot of strong people around him to encourage him to continue playing our great game and understand this was a freak accident,'. Sydney's Daily Telegraph shows a poignant picture of Phillip Hughes on a sombre day for cricket . The Telegraph's Ben Horne dissects Hughes' fateful last innings, referring to 'a one in a million shot' which struck the 25-year-old. 'Those who know Hughes’s game well, noticed there was a steely resolve about the diminutive left-hander from the moment he walked out to start the day,' Horne writes. 'If there’s a signature Hughes shot, it’s his cut — and he pulled out one of the most exquisite examples of the stroke midway through his innings,' he continues. His piece ends in reflective fashion. 'The Cricket Australia live feed makes for eerie reading. '“No run, problem here, misses a pull shot and hit, urgent treatment needed.” 'That’s how Phillip Hughes’ career ended. 'But it’s not how his talents as a batsman or his courage as a person will be remembered.' The Herald Sun dedicates much of its edition to remember the life of the young opening batsman . There is no sense to the loss of such a sublime talent, says Richard Hinds of the Melbourne tabloid. Calling Hughes 'a wonderful work in progress', the article remembers ' a polite and ever-smiling cricketer'. 'The harrowing scenes that unfolded in public view, the plight of the unfortunate bowler Sean Abbott and the helplessness of those at the SCG scene compound our sense of shock and despair,' Hinds says. 'The game that brought the sublime talent and wonderful character of Phillip Hughes into our lives has taken him away. You can try to make sense of that. There is none,' he concludes. The Courier Mail pays tribute to Hughes, calling him 'a little legend' The front page of the Courier Mail calls Australia 'numb' after the shocking news of Hughes' death. Andrew Carswell tells the story of his devoted father, Greg, who was always by his son's side. A banana farmer by trade, Hughes Snr was an ever-present figure throughout Hughes' journey from successful schoolboy cricketer to his final innings in Sydney. 'For all the cricketing legends that surrounded him and the brother he shared a home and a deep kinship with, Greg Hughes was always Phillip’s best mate,' the moving article reads. The Australian leads with a picture of Hughes in front of the national flag, referring to 'an innings cut short' The Australian paints a picture of Hughes as a tremendously popular figure in the cricketing fraternity and beyond. With comment from Australian captain and friend Michael Clarke, Will Swanton and Brent Read pull together quotes from figures including Ian Botham, Darren Lehmann and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. They also quote Jim Maxwell, broadcaster for ABC Radio, whose voice will be familiar to listeners of Test Match Special. 'This is one of the worst days in Australian sport. It’s bad enough in sport when someone is killed in an accident but you’re actually playing the game, and it’s the least of anything you would expect. For this to actually happen in a match on a big stage, and at a point where he was playing so well ... it just leaves you absolutely numb.'

"Each year the awards season becomes more like a Three Stooges episode. Metaphorically at least, the combatants poke each other in the eye, bash each other over the head with frying-pans or planks of wood, each tumbling over the other to look more vindictive, more pompous, more ludicrous, more stupid. It starts, where else, with all the venal, pointless bile on social media: ‘My favourite is better than your favourite,’ which resembles nothing more closely than the playground ‘my dad could batter your dad’. You know the stuff. But year-on-year the participants and football powers-that-be are abandoning dignity quicker than an I’m A Celebrity contestant. Real Madrid's Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo holds up the Ballon d'Or after winning the award in 2013 . Last year, we had the risible, hopefully soon-to-be-deposed, Sepp Blatter prancing about the stage at the Oxford Union impersonating Cristiano Ronaldo as some sort of stentorian automaton who ‘spends more expenses on his hair than “the other one’’ and lauding his personal ‘preference’ for Lionel Messi because ‘he’s a nice boy’. It was all against the delightful background of FIFA forgetting that they were running a World Cup the following summer, easy mistake, and thus that there were World Cup qualifying play-offs in November 2013. The polls closed before the infamous Zlatan v Ronaldo play-off ‘super-matches’ which were bound to influence the voters (FIFA’s international coaches, captains and a select band of journalists) and so a vast amount of them just didn’t bother responding. Ronaldo is many people's favourite to win the award again this year after winning the Champions League . FIFA ‘re-opened’ the polls, announced that those who’d already marked their ‘X’ couldn’t vote again (to take account of Ronaldo’s fabulous performance in eliminating Sweden in that play-off), then informed them that they actually could... on it went. Like a bad Benny Hill episode. Nobody in Zurich seemed to realise that when you produce a real-life narrative which would put the script-writers of The Thick Of It to shame then something’s gone wrong. Madrid demanded an apology on behalf of Ronaldo, got it, and CR7 duly won. Franck Ribéry, principal star of Bayern Munich’s treble season, spiralled down into a reverse Sally Field acceptance at the 1985 Oscars (‘You LIKE me.... right now you really LIKE me!’). Lionel Messi has won the Ballon d'Or three times and also won the World Player of the Year trophy too . Those around him in Bavaria needed to mop up tears for weeks (‘They hate me, they really HATE me!’) and even now he’s still harping on about it in interviews: ‘I learned a lot during last year’s Ballon d’Or gala. As soon as I got there, I told my wife that I would lose,’ he whined last week. ‘I saw how Blatter was hugging Ronaldo and how his entire family was there. I’m not stupid. It was clear that he had to win it. He wouldn’t have brought his entire family with him otherwise. ‘It will be the same this year. Manuel Neuer or Arjen Robben should win it. You can’t disagree with this. Manu has won it all, he’s a great guy and he isn’t arrogant. Arjen has played an incredible season in the Bundesliga and then a fantastic World Cup. Messi is unlikely to win the award after Barcelona failed to win any major trophies last season . ‘But I fear it will be about politics again. The Ballon d’Or is no longer for the best player. Fabio Cannavaro won it in 2006 because he won the World Cup, that’s all.’ Now Franck isn’t known for his University Challenge capabilities. But, I ask you. Robben or Neuer ‘should get’ the Ballon d’Or this year for their fantastic World Cups, but Cannavaro was a blaggard and a con man of the first order when winning it ... for World Cup 2006. Give us strength. And if Blatter was fawning all over Ronaldo, then lingering embarrassment at his Oxford Union stupidity might explain it. This weekend, it’s all taken a new, nonsensical turn. Asked, well after voting had closed, about the Ballon d’Or, UEFA chief Michel Platini replied that, in a World Cup year, one of the players who’d lifted that trophy in the summer should automatically be Ballon d’Or winner, too. Sepp Blatter got in trouble last year after admitting he would prefer Messi to win the award as he was 'nice' He repeated an opinion he’d given four years earlier when Xavi and Andres Iniesta were both pipped by Messi because of his individual brilliance in a year when Spain became world champions. Both Spaniards admitted that they were pleased Messi won. Platini put into words a sentiment that many (particularly the voting journalists, I believe) hold — but I’d also ask how many of you really think that the FIFA coaches and captains will now be remonstrating themselves and banging fists against their own head after the Frenchman spoke? Imagine it: ‘World Cup!?!? Bloody hell, I never even THOUGHT of making that part of my consideration!!!’ or: ‘Dammit — Platini’s come out for a World Cup winner to lift the Ballon d’Or, if I’d only known how he’d vote then I’d obviously have trotted along behind him like an obedient little sheep.’ But, oh no. Real Madrid exploded in an apoplectic vomit of nonsense — issuing a statement remonstrating with Platini for answering a question posed to him by a Spanish news agency, declaring that anyone who opposes Ronaldo for this award is an ideological criminal and questioning his impartiality despite the presence of World Cup winning Toni Kroos in their own first XI. A number of Germany's World Cup winners have been touted as possible winners of the award . While all of this was happening, a much stranger fact emerged. The players world union FIFPRO hadn’t found a place for either Koke or Gabi in their top 15 midfielders of 2014 despite the Atletico Madrid pair’s excellence in winning the Spanish League, Supercup and coming within seconds of winning the Champions League. Weird, I’d suggest. Wrong in my view. But football democracy in action. FIFPRO’ s voting is not immune to errors or manipulation but the players had their voice and it didn’t shout: ‘Atletico!’ On Sunday we’ll know the final three for the Ballon d’Or. Hopefully they are Ronaldo, Neuer and Messi. I’d expect the podium to reflect that order in January. But, if it doesn’t, don’t expect me to join the pitiful Three Stooges pantomime.","Final three for the Ballon d'Or announced on Sunday .

"It is still seen as a carefree time of innovation, peace, fashion and great music. So it is no surprise that the Sixties has been chosen as the best decade in history. One third of Britons say they would rather be living in the Swinging Sixties than in today’s trouble-torn world, saying it was an ‘age of change for the better’. Carnaby Street, 1968: One third of Britons say they would rather be living in the Swinging Sixties . Ironically, though, the majority of the 2,000 people aged 18 to 60 who were polled are far too young to remember the era. Two thirds said there was ‘greater optimism’ in the Sixties than today, despite the Cold War tensions of the time. Only 17 per cent said they would prefer to be living in the Seventies and 10 per cent chose the Fifties. The Sixties topped the poll in every category, from memorable events to music and films. Asked to pick their top three ‘defining moments’ of the decade, 63 per cent chose Neil Armstrong becoming the first man on the moon in 1969 followed by the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963 and the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King. The events, all of which occurred in the US, beat England winning the World Cup in 1966, chosen by 47 per cent, and The Beatles cutting their first single in 1962. When it came to naming the best Sixties record, The Beatles took four of the top five places with She Loves You, Can’t Buy Me Love, I Want To Hold Your Hand and We Can Work It Out, with Elvis Presley’s It’s Now Or Never at number four. The best movie was Mary Poppins, beating The Sound Of Music, Psycho, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid and Doctor Zhivago. Marilyn Monroe was voted the decade’s greatest female icon, with Elvis Presley greatest male icon. The poll was conducted to mark the start of a ten-part documentary series, The Sixties, on the Yesterday TV channel tonight. Adrian Wills, general manager of Yesterday, said: ‘Regardless of whether we were around in the 1960s or not, Brits tend to have a real sense of nostalgia when it comes to the music and the history surrounding that era. 'Few decades have had the breadth of impact. The events of that period transformed the world.’","Two thirds said there was ‘greater optimism’ in the Sixties than today .

Sevilla started strongly, scoring the game's only goal after eight minutes. Grzegorz Krychowiak's pass from the right found Bacca, who finished into the bottom left-hand corner from close range. Rayo struggled to get going, with both sides more preoccupied with fouling than playing football. In fact, it took until the 41st minute for the next meaningful effort of the game to take place with Joaquin's 20-yard effort sailing over the bar.

"Cesc Fabregas and Angel di Maria are rightfully lauded as two of the most creative players in the Premier League, but the foreign imports don't top the minutes per chance created charts. Perhaps surprisingly, Manchester City's James Milner tops the list for chances created per minutes on the pitch of the Premier League players who have clocked up a minimum of 450 minutes so far this season. The England winger has laid on 27 chances for team-mates in his 640 minutes, giving him an impressive minutes per chance ratio of 23.7.

The star-studded list also included Manchester United summer signing Angel di Maria, who has made a bright start to his career at Old Trafford, scoring three goals while creating 31 opportunities. Fabregas, who sits in fifth place, looks on course to break Thierry Henry's Premier League assist record of 20 in a season as the Spaniard has already set up 10 goals to help Chelsea to the Premier League's summit. As Sportsmail's table shows, the former Arsenal man has created an astonishing 45 chances for his team-mates so far this season, but has barely missed a kick for Chelsea having been on the pitch for 1,237 minutes which means he has created a chance every 27.5 minutes.

"Towards the end of Manchester City’s win at Sunderland in midweek, a pitch invader dressed as Spider-Man was caught and led away by police. When Sergio Aguero is around, there’s only room for one superhero these days. Aguero’s 19 goals from 20 games this season might suggest City are turning into a one-man team. Sat in an executive box at the Etihad on Friday, winger Jesus Navas seemed less convinced. Jesus Navas pictured at the Etihad stadium for a promotional EA event on Friday . The Manchester City winger insists there is more to their side than just in-form Sergio Aguero . So where would the champions be this season without their mercurial striker? ‘I couldn’t tell you,’ says Navas. ‘But what you have to remember is that we’re all working really hard in the same direction to take City up the league. We’re pushing forward all the time to create as many chances for him as possible. ‘It’s fantastic we’ve got Sergio among our ranks, a player like him can make the difference. 'But we are really becoming a solid unit now, we are defending as a block. I think that’s helping the fact we’ve managed to turn the results around.’ Aguero celebrates scoring his 19th goal of the season for City against Sunderland . City players celebrate with Aguero after his last-gasp heroics secured a vital win against Bayern Munich . Things are looking up for City compared to a few weeks ago, after four straight wins in all competitions. The gap between Manuel Pellegrini’s side and Chelsea is down to six points ahead of Saturday’s game at home to Everton, and Aguero’s heroics against Bayern Munich has given them a fighting chance of qualifying for the knockout stage of the Champions League when they face Roma in Italy in a potential Group E decider on Wednesday. There is a possibility captain Vincent Kompany and playmaker David Silva — who has missed the last six games — could return from injury at the Stadio Olimpico, Pellegrini said on Friday. The City boss also confirmed England goalkeeper Joe Hart is expected to sign a four-and-a-half-year contract worth £120,000-a-week in the coming days. City certainly look back to their old selves after a disjointed start to the season. Navas believes they are capable of going on to retain the Barclays Premier League title and mount a serious challenge for the Champions League as well. The 29-year-old has been an ever-present for Manuel Pellegrini's side so far this season . ‘As long as we keep up this level of consistency, then why not? This is a really key period. There are lots of points up for grabs in December and then in Rome it’s a huge game. 'If we can carry on playing in this manner it could be a crucial time for us for the rest of the season.’ For a player renowned for his blistering pace, Navas is taking things slowly however. Step by step. He insists that City dare not take their focus off Everton and look too far ahead to Roma. ‘No, definitely. The whole team will be focussed on Everton. We’re very much aware that we’re still six points behind Chelsea and we have to claw back the points. Tomorrow is the key.’ Jesus Navas stars in EA SPORTS FIFA 15, out now on Xbox One, PS4 and all other platforms. www.easports.com/uk/fifa/buy .","Manchester City are six points behind the leaders Chelsea .

"Olympic champion Laura Trott won Great Britain's fourth gold of the Track World Cup in London with victory in the women's omnium on Sunday. Trott, who won gold in track cycling's equivalent of the heptathlon at London 2012, claimed her second gold of the three-day event at the Lee Valley VeloPark, formerly the Olympic Velodrome. She was a key figure in Friday's win in the women's team pursuit, while Britain also won the corresponding men's event and Owain Doull and Mark Christian on Saturday won the Madison. Great Britain's Laura Trott won the women's omnium event on Sunday at the Track Cycling World Cup . Trott had 186 points after five of the six disciplines, 14 points more than nearest rival Jolien d'Hoore of Belgium, with Kirsten Wild of Holland third on 164. The final, decisive discipline in a revised omnium format is the points race which once proved Trott's Achilles heel. However, her confidence boosted by winning gold at the Commonwealth Games in July, the 22-year-old produced a tactical masterclass in a race which features sprints every 10 laps. Trott was limpet-like on the wheel of D'Hoore, who was wearing the all-white Track World Cup series leader's jersey, for much of the 100-lap (25-kilometres) race. The pair also monitored Wild and Australia's Isabella King, who began the final discipline in fourth. Trott waves to the crowd after winning her second gold of the three-day event . D'Hoore tried to shake Trott off her wheel and won the seventh of 10 sprints as Trott failed to score, reducing the deficit to eight points, but with time running out. Wild and D'Hoore attacked after failing to score in the eighth sprint, but Trott marked the move and then, roared on by a partisan crowd, won the penultimate sprint and five points to ensure the gold would be hers. Trott finished on 193 points, with D'Hoore second on 181 and Wild third on 167. Tougher tests are to come for Trott as she eyes reclaiming the world title in Paris in February. The United States' Sarah Hammer, who has beaten Trott to gold at the two Track World Championships since London 2012, was absent, but the field was nevertheless strong.","Laura Trott wins Great Britain's fourth gold of the Track World CupÂ .

"Despite a glittering career at the top as a player Burton Albion 'novice' Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is under no illusions he has to earn his right as a manager. The former Chelsea, Leeds and Middlesbrough striker took his first management role in England when he was appointed by the League Two side in November. And Hasselbaink, who scored 127 Premier League goals during his distinguished career, says his achievements as a player count for nothing as he starts at the bottom of the managerial ladder. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was appointed manager of League Two side Burton Albion in November . The former Chelsea, Leeds and Middlesbrough striker applauds his Burton players on the touchline . Hasselbaink scored 70 Premier League goals for Chelsea during a four-year spell from 2000-2004 . 'I don't talk about it. Never,' Hasselbaink told the Guardian's Stuart James. 'The other day we were driving to the game at Wycombe and there were goals of mine on Sky on the team coach. I was embarrassed. I know it's me, but... it's gone. We don't have to talk about when I was a player. I have to earn my right as a manager.' 'What does that mean: ""Too big for that""? If I was Jose Mourinho and I would come to Burton, then you can say something. I know my role. I know who I am, I know what I have done as a manager, I consider myself novice.' Hasselbaink played under Steve McLaren at Middlesbrough before coaching under him at Nottingham Forest, and the 42-year-old reserves the highest praise for the former England manager.

He went with the modern game. He is not still there, where he was 10 years ago when he was at Middlesbrough, where he was so successful. He has evolved.' Hasselbaink was capped 23 times for Holland  and played under Louis van Gaal with the national side, and the Burton boss reveals that beneath the prickly exterior the Manchester United manager has a soft centre. 'Very intimidating but very fair and very loving. If you keep on doing things wrong, he will pinpoint you. If you do it good, he will also tell you that you did it good.

"Neil Lennon expects Eidur Gudjohnsen to rejoin Bolton in time for the trip to Reading this weekend, while fellow veteran Emile Heskey could also sign for the Sky Bet Championship club if he impresses in training. Former Chelsea and Barcelona forward Gudjohnsen, 36, enjoyed a stint with Wanderers between 1998 and 2000 before moving to Stamford Bridge and he has been back with Lennon's squad for almost a month now. He played 90 minutes for the club's Under 21s on Monday and Lennon, short of experienced forwards since letting Jermaine Beckford join Preston on loan, revealed the former Iceland international is set to pen terms on a deal until the end of the season. Eidur Gudjohnsen made his eagerly anticipated return for Bolton  against Middlesbrough on Monday night .

TOTAL: 289 games 55 goals . 'I'm assuming everything's agreed,' the Northern Irishman said. 'If there's any hold-ups it'll be a minor thing and I'm hoping to have him in the squad for the weekend.' Gudjohnsen could soon be joined by another 36-year-old after Lennon's former Leicester team-mate Heskey was invited to train with the Trotters this week. The 62-cap England forward is a free agent having left Australia's Newcastle Jets and Lennon has granted Heskey a two-week trial period before deciding whether they will pursue a contract. 'Emile is a free agent, I know him very well from my time at Leicester and he's another player we tried to sign in our time at Celtic,' Lennon added. Former Premier League striker Heskey is a free agent after leaving Australian outfit Newcastle Jets . 'He may be coming to the end of his career but he still has very good attributes. It's no-gamble stuff for us, we're just bringing him in and going to have a look over the next 10 days, two weeks - see if he's got something to offer. 'If he has we'll look at it, if he hasn't we'll say, ""thanks for coming in but we're not going to pursue this"".' Lennon is optimistic that Heskey can follow Gudjohnsen's lead and impress sufficiently in his training audition. It is two years since the Leicester-born forward played in this country but Lennon is confident that despite his advancing years, his talent will not have waned greatly. Heskey decided to move to Australia after leaving former side Aston Villa in 2012 . 'We're pleased he's come in,' the Wanderers boss added. 'There's a hunger there to keep playing. He's 36 and he's had a great career. 'We think there might still be a bit of mileage in him yet and if there is we will try and make the most of that. 'If you look at his career, he's won a lot of things in the game and he's played for his country over 60 times now; that's quality and you don't lose the quality. 'You lose the legs a little bit but he was always a fantastic athlete as well. At 36 I still think there might be plenty left in there if he has the right attitude and hunger to keep going. 'I'm really pleased to see the career he went on to have at Liverpool, Villa, Birmingham and obviously England. He's a great kid, always has been. The way he's looked after himself, he's got longevity as well.' The 36-year-old missed a golden opportunity to score on his return for Bolton during the first half .","Eidur Gudjohnsen could rejoin Bolton Wanderers before weekend .

"Nolberto Solano has claimed he has already been interviewed for the vacant post as manager of Motherwell. Club directors are still to talk to a number of candidates next week, including frontrunner Terry Butcher, Kenny Shiels and caretaker boss Kenny Black who has now indicated he would like to be considered. On Friday, a club source cast doubt on Solano's claims but, as Sportsmail first revealed, the former Peru international, 39, is the choice of an Argentina-based consortium to take the reins at Fir Park should they gain control. The Well Society are the preferred saviours of former chairman John Boyle. Still short of the £800,000 they need to purchase the owner’s 70 per cent stake, however, Solano is waiting by his phone for further news after insisting he held talks last month. Former Newcastle winger Nolberto Solano, claims he has been interviewed for the vacant Motherwell post . And the Newcastle United legend, who quit his post as technical director of FC Toronto in August, says he is desperate for a crack at Scottish football under new South American owners. Last night he told Sportsmail: ‘I went to see Motherwell play against Dundee United five weeks ago, had an interview after that and since then I haven’t heard anything else. ‘As people probably know, the new prospective owner has not been able to complete a deal yet. ‘For me at the minute there is lots of talking, but there are a lot of things to be done before they take over. They don’t have 100 per cent ownership of the club. ‘The people concerned are from Argentina. I don’t know them especially well and I can’t tell you their names, but I know them through some friends of mine. ‘There is no deadline and I don’t know when or if they will complete. Because they are not from here it obviously takes a little longer. Solano spent eight years with Newcastle over two spells and also played for Aston Villa, West Ham and Hull . ‘But from what I know they want to move the club forward, to challenge and finish in the top four consistently. ‘To try to qualify for Europe and build up an academy with good young lads from all over the world, not just South America. ‘They want to be a club which provides a window for the world. Not just from South America – if there are good young Scottish lads with potential they will get a chance as well.’ Currently based in England, Solano previously coached at Hartlepool United and Universitario de Deportes in his native Peru before his brief spell in Canada. A former team-mate of Diego Maradona at Boca Juniors, he joined Newcastle when Kenny Dalglish was manager and says he has no concerns about moving to Scotland. The former Peru international, in action against Argentina, left his post as technical director of FC Toronto . ‘I am told Motherwell are interviewing four or five other coaches for the job as well. I understand that. ‘But I have been following them closely in the last few games and will be watching them again against Celtic tomorrow on television. ‘It’s a job I am very interested in and I have to be fully prepared in case the call comes at any moment. ‘They are struggling to win games now, but there are two or three teams like Ross County in the same situation so I am confident that if I can get the job I can get some players who can make them a winning team. ‘The priority is to keep them in the Scottish Premiership and build up from there.’ Former Hibernian boss Terry Butcher could move back to Motherwell where he managed between 2002-06 . Former Well manager Butcher is the latest frontrunner for the post, but caretaker Black has now thrown his hat into the ring, too, after appearing initially reluctant to do so following Stuart McCall’s resignation. The club’s general manager Alan Burrows told the BBC: ‘We thought initially Kenny was not interested in the position but Kenny and I had a conversation on Thursday and he said that he was keen to be considered. So Kenny will be spoken to.’ Meanwhile, Black, who has won one and lost two of the games in which he has been in temporary charge, said he expected a clear-out if Solano comes in under a South American regime. ‘I think we all know that if it’s the foreign route then the minute that was confirmed you could be packing your bags,’ he said. ‘They bring their own people in.’ A former Hearts coach under Vladimir Romanov, Black is wary of the impact foreign owners have had on some Scottish clubs, adding: ‘We have seen it happen at Livingston, at Dundee, at Hearts. I certainly would not like to see it happen here. ‘We are a little bit unsure of what is going to happen, but what better chance tomorrow than a game against Celtic to get talking about football again?’ Kenny Shiels guided Kilmarnock to Scottish League Cup glory over Celtic in 2012 . Motherwell caretaker boss Kenny Black hopes he has proved enough that he is capable of the job .","39-year-old played for Newcastle for eight years over two spells .

"Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is poised to sign a new contract with the Barclays Premier League champions. Manager Manuel Pellegrini has hinted the England number one is ready to commit himself to the club and fresh terms could even be finalised within the next day. Hart, 27, has reportedly been in discussions with the club over a possible new five-year deal since the summer. His present contract, worth a reported £80,000 per week, is due to expire in the summer of 2016. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is poised to sign a new contract with the  Premier League champions . Hart's current contract which is worth a reported £80,000 per week is due to expire in the summer of 2016 . Manuel Pellegrini has suggested the England number one is ready to commit himself to the Etihad club . The former Shrewsbury trainee has been in fine form this season, underlining his status as first choice for club and country after a spell out of Pellegrini's side last year. Pellegrini, speaking on Friday at a press conference to preview Saturday's home clash with Everton, said: 'I always said it is important for this club to keep Joe with us. 'He is a very good goalkeeper and not only a very good goalkeeper, he is a very important player for the squad also. So - maybe - in the next day you will have good news.' Asked if that meant within 24 hours, Pellegrini said: 'I can't say exactly the amount of hours, but the next day.' Hart has recovered well after a testing spell a year ago. He was axed by Pellegrini in favour of then number two Costel Pantilimon in October 2013 after a series of high-profile mistakes. He did not regain his place until December and even then continued to sit out domestic cup games. Hart's fine form has seen the Manchester City goalkeeper earn a new contract that is set to be finalised . Manchester City want to tie Hart down to a new contract at the Etihad to keep other interested clubs away . He went on to finish the season well, but Pellegrini still decided to increase the competition for his place by signing a new goalkeeper in Willy Caballero from his old club Malaga in the summer. Hart has responded to the challenge from the Argentinian by producing some fine displays and Pellegrini is pleased with the current situation. The Chilean said: 'Joe is having a very good season. The arrival of Willy Caballero was very important for the club, for Joe, for Willy, for everyone - because he is a very good goalkeeper. 'I think the best way for players to have high performance is when they have important competition. I think that was very useful for him and I am very happy about that.' City will be without their influential captain, Vincent Kompany, for the visit of Everton. The Belgian missed the midweek trip to Sunderland with a hamstring injury and is facing a battle to be fit for next week's decisive Champions League trip to Roma. Hart has responded to the challenge from Willy Caballero by producing fine performances for City . Pellegrini is keen to ensure other clubs can't tempt Hart, whose contract runs out in the summer of 2016 . It is merely the latest of a long series of muscular injuries to have affected the 28-year-old in recent seasons. He missed the draw at QPR and an international last month with a calf problem and had spells out last season with a thigh and groin injuries. Pellegrini accepts that problems will occur because of the ferocity with which Kompany plays, but is hopeful issues can be controlled. He said: 'Vincent, maybe in the way he plays, is more exposed to having injuries because he plays always with 100 per cent intensity and he works every day in the same way. 'But we hope for the same that happened last season - he will manage those injuries. They are important injuries but not very long injuries.'

The Scouser - who played for the Teessiders between 1992 and 1998 - was a popular figure at the Riverside and had been credited in helping the team mount the promotion push which currently sees them just two points off top. But the club announced the shock news on Tuesday morning that Hignett had left his position as Aitor Karanka’s No 2 with immediate effect. Craig Hignett has left his job as Middlesbrough assistant manager with immediate effect . Hignett had been working as No 2 to manager Aitor Karanka . A statement read: ‘Following discussions between Craig, head coach Aitor Karanka, and the club, all parties have agreed for Craig to leave his position with immediate effect. ‘The club would like to place on record its thanks for Craig’s efforts since joining us from Hartlepool last season and wish him all the best for the future.’ Hignett had previously worked at Boro’s academy before moving to Hartlepool as assistant to Colin Cooper. Hignett made over 150 appearances for Middlesbrough between 1992 and 1998 . When he left Victoria Park last season, Pools’ subsequent slump was attributed to his absence. It is thought that Hignett’s methods may have been in contrast with those preferred by Karanka and his Spanish-speaking backroom team.","Craig Hignett has left his role with immediate effect .

"If only the second half of Premier League games counted, it would be Manchester City and not Chelsea sitting top of the table. Sergio Aguero and Co are currently second in the division, six points behind Jose Mourinho's league leaders after three consecutive victories.

Kieran Gibbs, in action against West Brom last weekend, could miss Arsenal's trip to Stoke on Saturday . Arsenal head to the Britannia Stadium on Saturday to take on Mark Hughes' Stoke side . Walcott will have an injection on Friday in hope of clearing up a groin problem that has dogged him since the international break. 'We have to assess a few players today because we had some bad surprises with Nacho Monreal being out for tomorrow’s game,' revealed Wenger. 'Hopefully Kieran Gibbs will be available and back in the team and we have to assess some other players like Laurent Koscielny and a few bumps and bruises that we got after the game on Wednesday. I’ll make that decision after training today. 'I would like to play Koscielny because he is a very important player in our squad, and ideally I hope he will be available tomorrow.

"Newcastle United boss Alan Pardew will put any anniversary celebrations on hold as he seeks to secure what would rank as one of the most famous wins of his turbulent reign at St James' Park. Next week will mark four years since Pardew succeeded Chris Hughton as Magpies boss despite many - perhaps sometimes even Pardew himself - predicting he would never survive to see such a milestone. But a run of just one Barclays Premier League defeat in nine has lifted much of the immediate pressure off Pardew's shoulders and convinced him his side can rise to the occasion and become the first this season to sink Jose Mourinho's Chelsea. Newcastle United boss Alan Pardew will celebrate four years in charge at the club next week . Papiss Cisse (right) celebrates scoring Newcastle's equaliser against Burnley at Turf Moor on Tuesday . Newcastle train at their training centre on Thursday ahead of their clash with Chelsea on Saturday . Pardew said: 'I haven't really thought about it (the anniversary) at this stage because this game takes precedence over anything like that and I will probably review it some other time. 'As a coach it's the same as the players - you've got to rise to the occasion and I can't wait for the game and I hope the players are feeling the same way. 'Getting on the same pitch as the likes of (Eden) Hazard and (Diego) Costa and (Cesc) Fabregas is fantastic and you've got to raise your game. If you are not going to get inspired by that then don't play.' Newcastle's dramatic recent revival has stalled slightly with defeat at West Ham United and a frustrating midweek draw at Burnley but Pardew is boosted by the return of Moussa Sissoko - who scored the winner against Chelsea two seasons ago - and Jack Colback for the Saturday lunchtime clash. Pardew believes his player will be 'inspired' by playing against Cesc Fabregas (left) and Eden Hazard (centre) Freddie Woodman, Newcastle's young goalkeeper, waits to save a shot during training on Thursday . But he has injury worries elsewhere with goalkeeper Tim Krul ruled out until the new year with an ankle injury and captain Fabricio Coloccini unlikely to be risked as he struggles for match fitness following his return from a hamstring strain. Pardew's survival against the odds this season is exemplified in the way his players have battled back from a dismal start to the campaign and fostered the kind of team spirit that he believes will ensure they continue to improve. And it means he has no fears about taking the game to a Chelsea side he believes is probably the best he has seen since he grew up watching the club in his youth. Pardew added: 'I think mentally we're in a strong position and our confidence is high - we've had one defeat in nine and we have a good kind of spirit and we're still learning lessons along the way. Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini (centre) could return against Chelsea after a calf problem . 'We learned at Burnley that you have got to put the ball at risk and take chances in the game and that even against the so-called lesser opposition you still have to take risks. 'Especially against Champions League teams, if you're not going to take risks you're not going to make forward runs and you're not going to threaten the opposition and you'll get beaten, so we need to threaten against Chelsea.' While Sissoko's return is especially timely, Pardew is also counting on the continued improvement of striker Papiss Cisse, who struck his fifth goal of the season to rescue a point at Turf Moor on Tuesday. Pardew added: 'Papiss is a goalscorer and scoring goals breeds confidence, of course. He is a player who has five goals in the Premier League and he's probably only had eight chances. 'That's Papiss - he has a good consistent strike rate when he gets the chances.'

"Paul Lambert has tipped Jores Okore and Ciaran Clark to push for regular first-team football, even when Aston Villa solve their defensive injury crisis. Okore and Clark forged a resilient central defensive pairing in Villa's 1-0 Premier League victory at Crystal Palace on Tuesday night. The makeshift duo battled manfully amid the continued absence of long-term injury trio Ron Vlaar, Philippe Senderos and Nathan Baker. Paul Lambert believes Jores Okore (left) is making a claim for a first team place at Aston Villa . Lambert hailed Okore for adapting quickly after his return from 14 months battling knee ligament trouble, admitting hopes the 22-year-old can continue to thrive alongside Clark. 'Our defensive effort was terrific at Selhurst Park,' said Lambert. 'Okore and Clark worked very well together, Alan Hutton was outstanding too, and with (Brad) Guzan and (Aly) Cissokho formed a strong unit there. 'For Okore it's his third game in quick succession, and he's been out for more than a year. 'And I think Ciaran Clark certainly: the two of them have certainly stepped up their game. 'That's the aim of football, to have selection conundrums, and those two are going to give me that when others return. Okore chases down Fraizer Campbell during Villa's 1-0 win against Crystal Palace on Tuesday night . 'You've got to push a mate to get into a side, and at the minute these two lads are holding their own.' Holland defender and Villa captain Vlaar remains sidelined with calf trouble, while former Arsenal man Senderos is fighting a shin problem. Baker is out with a knee injury, and Villa boss Lambert is still awaiting return dates for all three. Former England midfielder Joe Cole joined Villa's walking wounded on Tuesday, limping out after just 20 minutes with hamstring trouble. Lambert's men host Leicester at Villa Park on Saturday, with the Scottish boss admitting Cole is a doubt. Former Borussia Dortmund and Scotland midfielder Lambert admitted he will continue to stave off the stress of top-flight management, aiming to hide his relief after Villa ended their nine-match winless streak. Lambert believes Ciaran Clark (right) and Okore have forged a solid partnership . 'It's a blow (Cole's injury) because I thought he was outstanding in our 1-1 draw at Burnley,' said Lambert. 'I'll handle this the same as I always do, I don't change. 'You try to keep your level, try not to have any stress, which is a hard thing to do. 'So I'll just keep focused and try to do my best for this football club, and that's why I'm here. 'I know you'll say nine games without winning, but in the last four games we've not been beaten. Christian Benteke celebrates scoring Villa's winning goal against Palace . 'So it's whatever way you want to perceive it, and I tend to look at the positive. 'I'm delighted for the lads, because they've come through a period where people were giving them criticism, and as I've said before this is Aston Villa Football Club; it's big news.

"Arsenal have deployed chief scout Steve Rowley to watch Tyrone Mings as they plot a move for the Ipswich left back. Mings has flourished this season after the departure of Aaron Cresswell to West Ham and is attracting strong interest from the Gunners, who also had scout Pat Holland run the rule over him at their match against Watford at the weekend. But they face stiff competition from Manchester United, Everton and Newcastle, who are all understood to have had him monitored. Arsenal have deployed chief scout Steve Rowley to watch Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings . Mings likes getting forward and lines up a cross against Cardiff last month . The Gunners have struggled defensively in recent weeks, with Nacho Monreal filling in at centre back . The 21-year-old came through the youth ranks at Southampton with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but was released by the club in 2009 and has worked his way back up from non-League. He first moved to Yate Town before joining Chippenham Town, where Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy plucked him from for just £10,000 in 2012. But Ipswich could be set to cash in with the club thought to now want up to £10million for the player who won Championship player of the month in September. Mings, who can also play right back and could develop into a centre half, has only just signed a three-year contract with Ipswich, tying him to the club until the summer of 2017. Mings replaced Aaron Cresswell (pictured, now at West Ham) at Ipswich and has impressed this season . The youngster played at youth level with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at Southampton but was released . Mick McCarthy will be keen to keep hold of Mings, who may command a fee of up to £10million .

"Southend strengthened their position in the League Two top six with a 2-0 win at home to 10-man Northampton on Saturday.

Promotion hopefuls Luton kept the pressure on leaders Wycombe with a 3-0 win over Mansfield. Matt Duke was unable to keep out Barry Corr's penalty as Southend won 2-0 at home to Northampton . Two goals from Shaun Whalley and one from veteran striker Paul Benson at Kenilworth Road ensured the Hatters continued their blistering run of form, climbing to second place. Leaders Wycombe were equally keen to issue their own statement of intent as they breezed past strugglers Hartlepool 3-1 at Victoria Park. Neil Austin missed a penalty for the hosts while Marlon Harewood’s late strike was a mere consolation in reply to efforts from Paris Cowan-Hall, Matt Bloomfield and Alfie Mawson. Tranmere, who complete the bottom two along with Hartlepool, showed plenty of fighting spirit though as they recorded a surprise 3-1 win over Portsmouth.

"Michael Dawson was delighted Hull once again took a point from a trip to one of the Barclays Premier League's major sides but feels games like Saturday's against West Brom hold the key to the Tigers' season. Ending a run of four straight defeats, Steve Bruce's men drew 1-1 with Everton at Goodison Park after a strike around the hour mark from substitute Sone Aluko cancelled out Romelu Lukaku's first-half opener for the hosts. Hull - above the relegation zone on goal difference alone - have also secured creditable draws at Arsenal and Liverpool this term. Michael Dawson believes Hull's result against West Brom on Saturday is vital if they are to stay up this season . But Dawson sees the truly vital fixtures for the team being those where they are taking on outfits lower down the table. Hull boss Steve Bruce stressed after Wednesday's match that the points his side claimed from such matches last term, their top-flight comeback season, were ultimately the reason they beat the drop. And when asked if games like Saturday's visit to the KC Stadium of West Brom are what will define Hull's 2014-15 campaign, Tigers centre-back Dawson said: 'Yes, of course they are. 'You look at our recent performances away from home, when we have been to the Emirates Stadium, Anfield and now Goodison Park, and we have taken a point each time. 'We can take a lot out of this - even in the first half (against Everton), with as much possession as they had, how many shots did they have on goal? Not too many. 'But yes, the games against the likes of West Brom and other teams that are going to be around us are where we really need to pick up the points.' Dawson (right) played a commanding role at the heart of Hull's defence at Goodison Park on Wednesday night . While it proved a constructive evening for Hull, Wednesday was frustrating for Everton, who had looked well in control in the first half but faded badly as the contest wore on and were booed off at the end by some fans. Toffees boss Roberto Martinez - whose side have been playing in the Europa League group stages on top of their domestic fixtures, qualifying for the knockout rounds - admitted tiredness had been a factor. The Merseysiders have also had injuries to contend with, but Everton defender Sylvain Distin says the squad must keep pushing on, with a tough-looking trip to Manchester City on Saturday up next. Reflecting on the Hull game, Distin told evertontv: 'It was very frustrating. 'We didn't lose the game but we feel like we have lost. We felt the frustration from the fans as well. Everton defender Sylvain Distin (right) admitted Wednesday's night draw felt like a defeat after the match . 'Hull made it tough for us and it was difficult to play forward at times. 'We have had a lot of games and that's going to continue. 'We have to move on because it is a big game this weekend, then next week, then the following weekend.'

"Julian Speroni believes Crystal Palace have to approach their game at Tottenham as a match they can win - or they risk falling into the relegation battle. The Eagles currently sit 15th in the Barclays Premier League table but are just one point clear of the bottom three ahead of their trip to White Hart Lane on Saturday. Neil Warnock's side had taken four points from clashes with Liverpool and Swansea before a home defeat to fellow strugglers Aston Villa on Tuesday evening and could find themselves in the relegation zone if Spurs can see them off. Julian Speroni (left) believes Neil Warnock's side cannot approach games with a negative attitude . Palace lost to Aston Villa on Tuesday night and fell to 15th in the Premier League table . But Speroni feels a safety-first approach could have a detrimental effect on Palace, especially if they make the short trip to north London intent on sitting back and looking to leave with a point. 'It's a week where we need to prepare well and make sure the recovery is spot-on. It'll be a tough challenge for us but we're looking forward to it,' the Argentina goalkeeper told the club's official website. 'We've been creating a lot, especially against Villa, and we hope to do that against Tottenham too. Any point away from home is always a good point but if you go into games with that mentality then you tend to lose. You have to go out there thinking you can win, try to win and then see what happens. 'We try not to think too much about what has happened before, we try to prepare for every game in the same manner. We know it's going to be a tough challenge but we have the confidence to go there and try and win the game because of the performances we've had lately.' Palace finished 11th last season under the stewardship of former manager Tony Pulis and were 12 points clear of Norwich in the final relegation position. Speroni is beaten by a Christian Benteke shot to give Paul Lambert's side the three points at Selhurst Park . Palace face Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham on Saturday, who lost 3-0 against Chelsea on Wednesday . But Speroni thinks the table could be much closer this campaign, with eight points currently separating the bottom half. 'It'll probably go down to the last few games of the season,' he said. 'We're going to have to perform as well as we've been doing but the margins are so small so we need to pick up some points. 'You always look for other results after a game to see how other teams are doing but I don't think you have to think too much about it because it's going to be a tough season. 'We showed last year the difference between the bottom of the table and halfway up is so close, and you can quickly climb if you get a win as there's little difference between the teams. 'After the Villa game I couldn't understand how we didn't get a point out of the game. We had so many chances but for some reason the ball didn't seem to want to go in so we ended up losing, but I was pleased with the performance because we played really well.' .","Julian Speroni wants Palace to approach the Tottenham game as winnable .

The 31-year-old goalkeeper tweeted: 'Just dropped off a tonne of top designer women's clothes, shoes and children's toys @womensaid on Stratford rd in Shirley, go check it out.' Included in the four boxes and two bags of donated clothes were sunglasses by Chanel, Prada and Dior all which can be snapped up for £45. Bargain hunters: People queued up outside the shop waiting for it to open this morning . Going, going, gone: The cut price items were snapped by shoppers . There were also two pairs of sought-after Victoria Beckham jeans available for £45. Rachel Taylor, the retail manager for Women's Aid in Birmingham, said: 'I can't believe it - it's crazy around here. 'Normally we'd be lucky to see a couple of people on a Monday but to have some queuing before we opened is madness. Stampede: Shoppers rushed to the store after the goalkeeper tweeted that he had dropped off designer goods . Not their average Monday: The charity shop said they have never had a queue outside the door before . On sale for less: These designer sunglasses by Dior and Chanel were available for £45 . Second hand: A Stella McCartney top for £70 that's worth £855 . Fraction of the original costs: Victoria Beckham jeans and a French Connection coat in the charity shop . Budget buys: Christian Louboutin heels worth £700 and Diane Von Furstenberg worth £500, both going for £50 . 'I'd been on holiday when Ben dropped all the clothes off but I knew about it quickly as he tweeted about it. 'We're so grateful - not only is it a wonderful donation but he's helped raise the profile of Women's Aid by tweeting us.' It took manager Ashleigh Healy six hours to price up the haul. She said: 'I had to look online to find out how much the clothes were worth as we had no idea where to start. Unusual price tag: The Victoria Beckham jeans sell for £250 new but these were just £45 . Grateful: Manager Ashleigh said they were delighted for the donation of designer goods . Generous: The Fosters have two children who also donated some of their old toys . Little bargains: Children's designer shoes were also up for grabs . Ashleigh, holding the Stella McCartney cardigan, had to price up all the goods for re-sale . 'We have set prices for tops and trousers and try to make sure that all things are around the same price.'

"The extraordinary claim that 99 per cent of Russian Olympic athletes are taking performance-enhancing drugs was just enough to wake anti-doping officials from their slumber yesterday. Allegations of systematic abuse on a scale comparable to the old Eastern Bloc were made in a German TV documentary. Former discus thrower Yevgeniya Pecherina claimed that ‘most... the majority... 99 per cent’ of Russian athletes take banned substances. Mariya Savinova won silver in the 800m at the World Championships in 2013 (left) and she won the gold medal in the same event at the London 2012 Olympics . ‘You can get absolutely everything,’ said the 25-year-old, who is serving a 10-year doping ban. The programme also broadcast footage seemingly showing the 800metres gold medallist from the London Olympics, Mariya Savinova, admitting to have taken the illegal steroid oxandrolone. Liliya Shobukhova, the 2010 London Marathon winner and now banned for irregularities in her biological passport, claimed she paid the Russian Athletics Federation £350,000 to cover up a failed test. Liliya Shobukhova crosses the finish line to win the Chicago marathon in 2011 . Even more alarming are claims that Russian athletics officials supplied drugs in exchange for a slice of an athlete’s earnings. Britain’s Dai Greene, who competed in the 400m hurdles at the World Championships in Moscow last year, posted on Twitter: ‘This is no surprise to any athletes. We know when we see suspect performances. Is enough being done to stop it?’ The World Anti-Doping Agency — once dubbed the Weak and Defenceless Agency — last night issued a statement that amounted to little more than a sigh, saying: ‘WADA will ensure that all matters raised are fully investigated.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Yevgeniya Pecherina made the claim in a German TV documentary .

"From a camera perched atop a sideline tower on the Miami practice field, it seemed like Hurricanes quarterback Brad Kaaya misread a particular play. The camera hovering five feet over his head showed otherwise. With the help of an affordable $500 toy, Miami coaches and players are studying film like never before. The Hurricanes are using a drone with a camera attached to capture their practices, now studying footage gleaned from its unusual vantage points along with what's collected from more traditional places like sidelines and end zones. Caught on camera: In this October 28, 2014, aerial photo provided by Miami Athletics, Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya, front center, gestures before a play begins during an NCAA college practice in Coral Gables, Florida . 'It's all about getting the players information they need so they can play fast and execute,' Miami coach Al Golden said. 'This drone, in terms of quarterback play, I don't know if there's any other way to do it anymore.' Miami isn't the first to bring a drone into practices. UCLA made headlines last spring when it revealed it has embraced the drone point of view, and Tennessee and Louisville are among the few other schools who are known to have tinkered with the technology. Miami isn't just tinkering. The drone is necessary equipment now for the Hurricanes, who are planning to acquire more and better ones soon, and it will soon be part of Miami's recruiting pitches. 'We've always been behind in sports when it comes to technology,' Miami offensive coordinator James Coley said. 'Coaches don't like change. Nobody does this, not the way we do this.' Coley said he started seriously thinking about bringing a drone into practice this summer. He was on vacation in the British Virgin Islands and noticed one of the small devices hovering about. He eventually ordered a drone and five battery packs, since the flying time on each battery was only about eight minutes per charge. The Hurricanes put the drone into regular use starting around late September, and it's perhaps not a coincidence that Kaaya - the team's true freshman quarterback - has been making better decisions ever since. 'When you see from the drone's point of view, you get a complete panoramic view of the field,' Kaaya told The Associated Press. 'You see what I'm seeing. You see the whole field better and then it's easier to show coaches what I was thinking at any given moment.' Coley calls it a game-changing advantage, and as he held a remote control Monday inside the Miami offensive meeting room he eagerly displayed what he meant by showing the same play from various angles. Aeriel view: The Hurricanes are using a $500 drone to capture scenes from their workouts, seeing things from players' perspectives . Kaaya was throwing the ball to a receiver on the right sideline, the far side of the field from where a camera atop a sideline tower was rolling. That angle, from perhaps as much as 60 yards away, suggested Kaaya's throw - which tailed back slightly toward the middle of the field before getting caught - should have been sent more down the sideline. Without the drone, Coley would have chided Kaaya for the mistake. But the drone gave a much better angle of what the defender was doing, and why Kaaya moved his receiver slightly off the sideline to make the play. 'You see that? He did exactly what he was supposed to do,' Coley said. 'And I wouldn't have known that. That drone, we got to see exactly what he was seeing. We got to see his guy getting pushed toward the sideline, so he throws it away from the defensive back. There's so much coaching that doesn't happen because you don't get all the angles. We get them now.' The drone, which gets moved to show numerous angles in each practice, has also led to some interesting moments. Players have been known to gesture wildly at the drone after making a big play. Kaaya had to learn to get used to having a machine buzzing - 'it's like rabid Africanized bees,' he said - not far from his helmet. And during the week where Miami prepped for Duke, a higher-powered drone than what Miami uses was spotted at practice; ultimately, it was deemed to be a fraternity prank. 'I was thinking it was Duke,' Kaaya said. 'They're pretty smart over there.' It wasn't Duke, and spying isn't permitted under NCAA rules. Teams can use it at their own practices only, not games. One other small drawback: The angle is such that some players who suffer from motion sickness struggle to watch. 'It's close enough to the action, but you can see what's going on in the whole field,' Kaaya said. 'Every year, every college is looking to reinvent the wheel. You always have to come up with new ways, new technology. It's good to keep up with the times. And it helps.'","The Miami Hurricanes football team have started using a $500 drone to capture scenes from their workouts .

"Lord Coe revealed his manifesto for the presidency of athletics’ world governing body — the IAAF — and promised he would clamp down on ‘plastic Brits’ who switch nationality for financial reasons. Coe, who appears certain to face pole vault great Sergey Bubka in next August’s election, has included in his manifesto a commitment to making it more attractive for an athlete to stick with the country of their birth, after Team GB came under fire before the London 2012 Olympics for selecting several recently naturalised citizens. Lord Coe is aiming to succeed current IAAF president Lamine Diack (right) when he steps down next year . - Reforming the world athletics calendar and bringing in city centre 'street athletics' competitions. - Maximising commercial growth and focusing on youth engagement. - Increasing resources for anti-doping and creating a new IAAF ethics department. - Changes to the IAAF internal structure to give a greater voice for athletes. He said: ‘Clearly, there is an issue about transfer of allegiance, where it is based purely on a financial exchange. And it is very important that the sport has a proper discussion on this and that we act on it. I know there is significant strength of feeling in many continents that this does have to be resolved.’ The former double Olympic champion, 58, is currently chairman of the British Olympic Association, executive chairman of CSM Sports and Entertainment, a global ambassador for Nike and an adviser to PruHealth and Deutsche Bank UK, but insisted that, if appointed by the IAAF, he would avoid a conflict of interests as he did during his chairmanship of London 2012. Coe, currently a vice-president of athletics' world governing body, is standing to succeed Lamine Diack, who is stepping down in August. Coe, seen giving a speech at the closing ceremony, headed the London 2012 organising committee . Coe said: 'To many within and outside our sport, our calendar seems disjointed, lacks a narrative and the essential glue to build excitement and a loyal and passionate following. 'Many fans don't know when the athletics season starts, when it ends, why it seems to bounce around from the USA to Europe to Asia and back again. A harmonised calendar is the key to promotion, marketing, the athletes and member federation development and we must address this. 'We need to be more innovative in how we project and present our sport to the world, both in venue and on screen, give serious consideration to an 'IAAF Street Athletics' circuit to help reach new audiences, and create a new IAAF division that has the sole purpose of focussing on youth engagement, especially via social media.'","Seb Coe has launched his manifesto for the IAAF presidency election .

"Nostalgia will abound as Great Britain's cyclists return to the Olympic Velodrome this week for the first time since London 2012, but now it is time to look ahead. The Track World Cup at the Lee Valley VeloPark - as the Olympic Velodrome is now known - is the first competition in British skinsuits at the venue since Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton - who are both now retired - Laura Trott, Jason Kenny and all the others struck gold in August 2012. Britain, astonishingly, matched their Beijing bounty of seven gold medals from 10 events, but have had mixed fortunes since. Laura Trott will return to the Olympic Velodrome for the Track World Cup this week . The Olympic qualification for Rio 2016 has begun and the London Track World Cup offers an opportunity to see what progress has been made since a disappointing showing, by the men in particular, at the 2014 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. For the first time since 1998 the men returned from a World Championships without a medal, leading to a dressing down from Shane Sutton, while the women won five medals. Sutton is now technical director after a restructuring following the departure of British Cycling performance director Sir Dave Brailsford, who left in April to concentrate on his role as Team Sky principal. One of the few to avoid a scolding assessment was Joanna Rowsell, who won team and individual pursuit titles in Colombia before adding the Commonwealth Games individual gold medal in July and the European team title in October. Rowsell won team pursuit gold at London 2012 and is relishing a return to an arena which holds such happy memories, even though her 26th birthday on Friday's opening day will coincide with a busy schedule of racing. She said on britishcycling.org.uk: 'There's an extra round of the team pursuit - qualifying, semi-final and final all on the same day - which is on my birthday too.' Sir Chris Hoy has retired but was part of Britain's cycling team who won seven gold at London 2012 . Rowsell missed the November Track World Cup to focus on her conditioning for London, with the 2015 World Championships in Paris in mind. 'I have had two weeks in Majorca, which were brilliant, my form has come on massively,' Rowsell added. 'I had a break after the Commonwealths, tried some different training out which didn't really work for me. 'It worked well for some of the other girls but I just dipped so stopped and did what worked for me. 'It's not that I'm not willing to try new training, but at my age I've done it for enough years to know what works. 'It's good to try out new things and say 'let's go back to what we know works'. So I went to Majorca and had a good two weeks, all of my power outputs are coming back to what I'd expect and I feel a lot better on the track, so I'm in the right direction now.' London will provide an indication of whether that is the case for the British squad as a whole, although there are caveats. Illness has disrupted preparations in recent weeks, while the considerable presence of Sir Bradley Wiggins is still to return to the track full time, with the aim of racing in the team pursuit in Rio. Wiggins is likely to return to the boards after April's Paris-Roubaix one-day classic, his early season target for 2015, and then it will be full steam ahead for Rio.","Britain won seven cycling gold medals at London 2012 Olympics .

"Liverpool stars past and present gathered on Thursday to honour the club's Anfield expansion announcement. The Merseyside club revealed that construction on the club's Main Stand will begin early next year ready for completion during the 2016-17 season. Club legends such as Phil Thompson, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish and Ian Rush have posed in front of Liverpool shirts with each one commemorating the number of appearances each player has made for the club. Liverpool players past and present (from left to right) Ron Yeats, Rodger Hunt, Ian Callaghan, Phil Thompson, Phil Neal, Alan Kennedy, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Rossiter of Liverpool pose for a photograph with managing director Ian Ayre and first team manager Brendan Rodgers . Ron Yeats: 454 appearances . Rodger Hunt: 492 . Ian Callaghan: 857 . Phil Thompson: 477 . Phil Neal: 650 . Alan Kennedy: 359 . Alan Hansen: 620 . Kenny Dalglish: 515 . Ian Rush: 660 . Robbie Fowler: 369 . Jamie Carragher: 737 . Steven Gerrard: 688 . Raheem Sterling: 97 . Jordan Rossiter: 1 . The picture, which also includes manager Brendan Rodgers and chief executive Ian Ayre, shows the huge number of appearances past players made during the club's glory years and ranges from the 857 showings of Ian Callaghan between 1960 and 1978 to Reds youngster Jordan Rossiter, who has made just one appearance during his fledgling Liverpool career. Red captain Steven Gerrard also features, sitting proudly in front of his '688' appearance shirt between Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher and English winger Raheem Sterling. Gerrard, who will be out of contract in the summer, has been linked with a move away from Anfield after a slow start to the 2014-15 Premier League season, but Ayre insists the club want Gerrard to stay. 'We have a fantastic dialogue with Steven and his representatives,' said the Reds managing director, speaking at an event to announce the £100million redevelopment of Anfield's Main Stand will begin on Monday. 'We have made an offer to Steven and we have to be respectful to him and where he is in his career. There is no pressure from our side. 'The one thing I can say is he will always be a part of this football club whatever his decision. 'He is an iconic part of this football club and we want to see him here for many years - and that is not just about his playing career. 'He has been a fantastic servant to this football club and we don't expect that to change. 'If you ask Steven Gerrard he will say he wants to be here as long as he can.' Liverpool Football Club is soon to add more seats to its famous and iconic home Anfield - to look like this . Anfield could look like this should its potential 13,000 seats be added to bring its capacity to about 58,800 . The cost of the redevelopment has been funded internally by owners Fenway Sports Group in the form of a loan which will be paid back over five years. Ayre also expects new sponsorship opportunities to be generated by the stand with the possibility of naming rights for all or parts of the stand likely. And while crippling debt under the previous regime of Tom Hicks and George Gillett took the club to the brink of administration, there will be no impact on squad strengthening. 'The funding has been put in place by the owners, we haven't gone outside, and it will come in as a loan and that is great news because it minimises the cost and allows us to move very quickly,' he added. 'It is an effective way rather than going to a bank and paying escalating interest prices. 'It shouldn't affect squad development as we built this economic model on the basis it was important to find a solution where we could maintain our level of investment throughout the build. Anfield is soon to be altered after Liverpool won permission from the city council in September . Rodgers looks on as Mamadou Sakho passes the ball during a Liverpool training session on Thursday . 45,522 - Anfield's current capacity . 58,800 - Anfield's potential new capacity . 8,500 - Phase one to extend the Main Stand . 4,500 - Phase two to extend Anfield Road end . £75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season . £260m - cost of overall regeneration in Anfield . 'It can only improve once the construction is finished and the money is paid (off) then it is additional revenue so it is additional revenues to invest in the team. 'It shouldn't have any negative effect on investment in the football team. 'That is why we do this. We obviously want more of our fans to come through the door each week but we want to compete at the highest level with our biggest competitors. 'They have a bigger capacity and therefore bigger revenue so can invest bigger amounts so this is one of the final pieces in the jigsaw for us.' There have been protests at Anfield over ticket prices in recent weeks but Ayre insisted the new development would allow for a greater spread of prices. 'We have said all along we recognise there needs to be some affordable pricing and tickets in the stadium - that is the case today and maybe there can be more of that,' he added. 'It is about finding the right balance as transfer fees and wages are going up.' Ayre also confirmed the Hillsborough Memorial would be placed into storage and a temporary feature installed at the stadium until construction is completed.

"Optical Express failed to properly inform a young woman of the risks of laser eye surgery then spied on her in a bid to prove she was lying about how damaged her eyesight was. Stephanie Holloway's eyes were so sensitive to light following the operation to correct her short-sightedness she was forced to wear sunglasses everywhere and light her home with candles. But the 28-year-old from Lee-on-Solent, Gosport, was followed by private investigators hired by the company in a bid to dismiss her complaints that the surgery had ruined her life. Stephanie Holloway (pictured left with her mother) needs to wear sunglasses constantly after being left sensitive to light following the botched operation by Optical Express. Dr Joanna McGraw (right( was 'extremely busy' at the time of the operation, the court heard, and barely had time to properly inform her of the risks . The High Street chain was ordered to pay more than £500,000 in damages for the mistake at Central London County Court. Miss Holloway had been 'enticed' into a branch an Optical Express branch in Southampton in 2008 after seeing an advert on television for eye surgery which claimed it cost £395. But when she contacted the company, they quoted her a price seven times as high. In the end she paid £2,790 for the procedure. Despite her reservations, Miss Holloway was coaxed into getting the surgery by an optometrist who, the court heard, said he had had the procedure himself and his eyesight was 'brilliant'. Confidential guidance the chain had given to its staff encouraged them to tell customers they were 'in excellent hands' and to 'reduce price objections' with encouragement. After paying a £200 deposit, she waited for five hours for her first appointment with a surgeon who was 'extremely busy'. Dr Joanna McGraw said though she had little memory of their meeting, she would have warned Miss Holloway that hers was a difficult case and that surgery might not necessarily correct her problems. But the judge insisted there was 'no way' the woman could have given Miss Holloway all the relevant information in that small of a time. An hour before her surgery, she was told to sign a consent form which was inappropriate, according to the judge who said: 'That is not how things should be done'. 'It was like a conveyor belt. I was under a lot of pressure. The lady did not leave my side, I was literally told to sign the form and I did what I was told,' Miss Holloway told the court. After the operation the woman said that 'everything was hazy' and she felt 'sick and shocked'. She went back to the branch and was told by an optometrist not to be concerned and to keep taking the drops. When Miss Holloway sought a second opinion, one expert said it was the worst case of photophobia he had encountered, and wrote: 'I'm sorry I'm not able to offer her any further treatment.' She was forced to use candle light in her home, because electric lights were too bright for her to bear, and can only sometimes manage to read large print. The company was ordered to pay £500,000 in damages to Miss Holloway who said her life had been ruined by the ordeal . After having to rely on friends to take her to buy food and run errands for fear of falling, the former book dealer said she thought life was 'hardly worth living'. The court heard Optical Express used private detectives to covertly film her over three days in August to try and dispel her claims. They followed the woman driving her car, shopping at a supermarket and even through the windows of her own home. Ruling both Optical Express and Dr McGraw liable to pay full compensation, the judge said Miss Holloway had at no point been given sufficient information about the risks of the surgery and possible complications in order to give ‘informed consent’. The company was told to pay a total of £569,287, including £30,000 for Miss Holloway’s ‘pain and suffering’ and over £400,000 for her lost earnings. Speaking after the court ruling, Stephanie Holloway said: 'I would urge people considering laser eye surgery to really think it through carefully, that you have a decent surgeon and to make sure you are aware of all the risks beforehand.'","Stephanie Holloway underwent laser eye surgery for short-sightedness .

"The contest for the 2024 Olympics could feature two cities from the Middle East including Qatar capital Doha - with their chances boosted by proposed changes to bidding rules. International Olympic Committee member Prince Feisal Al Hussein, from Jordan, said he expects one or two bids from the Middle East for 2024. Olympic watchers expect Doha to bid for a third successive time, after its success in winning the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships, while Dubai has also been mentioned as a possible candidate city. The Khalifa International Stadium in Doha could be a host venue at the 2024 Olympics if Qatar win the bid . Changes to IOC bidding rules to be decided in December could make it easier for countries in very hot climates to win the right to host the summer Games, by allowing it to be staged at different times of year to the traditional July/August slot, and with more flexibility in putting on some events in a different city or even different country. Doha secured the 2019 athletics showpiece on the basis of it being staged in early October rather than the usual month of August. Prince Feisal, speaking on a conference call as founder and chairman of Generations For Peace, said he would welcome the Olympics coming to the Middle East. He said: 'We have already seen in the 2020 Olympic Games we have an Arab country that looked to be a candidate city to host the Games and for 2024 we expect other Middle East countries that might consider putting themselves forward. Boston is in the running to host the 2024 Olympics - but it could face competition from the Middle East . 'As an Arab and a Muslim I would love to see the Olympics in our part of the world, as it has been in other parts of the world. 'I would expect that we will find one or two countries will be putting themselves into the bidding process and it is a question of what they have and what it takes to meet the IOC requirements and whether they deserve the opportunity to host the Games.' There are 40 proposals that make up Olympic Agenda 2020, the recommendations that will be put to the full IOC membership next month. Asked whether the changes suggested would aid a bid from the Middle East, Prince Feisal added: 'You cannot pre-empt what the IOC at the session will select to do. 'We would love to see a country in the Middle East in a position to host but obviously temperature and other considerations do need to be part of the bidding process. 'We would need to stand on the merits of what we are offering and it is about the legacy and the long-term impact.' Prince Feisal was speaking after the end of the latest Generations For Peace training programme - the organisation is using sport as a tool for peace to support Syrian refugees in Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp.

"Try to find a public toilet in central London these days, and you may be out of luck... but you'll find plenty of underground spots for an artisan coffee or hipster cocktail in a mason jar. Disused public restrooms have become popular spaces to open cafes, restaurants and bars, with new ones popping up all over the capital. From eating a sandwich in an 1890s urinal, to throwing back a drink in an old Victorian underground station toilet, it is now perfectly acceptable to invite a Friday night date to 'meet you in the toilet'. Scroll down for video . Sanitary sandwich spot: Attendant, in central London, made headlines when it opened last year in a former public toilet .

'I just love Nicki Minaj and I wanted to look like her.' That wasn't Jayci's only disappointment. 'And you know what else? Ellen DeGeneres,' she said, nonsensically referring to the talk show host.

"A woman smuggling cocaine into the United States was captured by authorities at New York City's Kennedy Airport. Janisha Atkins, 33, a Jamaican national who now lives in New Haven, Connecticut, was arrested after officers found her carrying almost four pounds of cocaine with a street value of $64,000. The narcotics were found inside her Chanel purse and two pairs of platform shoes. Busted: Janisha Atkins was arrested while trying to smuggle almost four pounds of cocaine in her Chanel bag and wedge heels (above) Pricey: The Chanel Classic Flap Bag (above) retails for $5,500 . Atkins was selected for examination by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers on Sept. 19 after arriving in NYC aboard a JetBlue flight from Montego Bay, Jamaica. Officers immediately noticed a strong smell when they opened her suitcase that seemed to be coming from her Chanel purse and two pairs of platform shoes. The lining of the pocketbook and the heels of the shoes were probed further after officers noticed they felt 'unusually heavy.' It was then they discovered a white powder inside that turned out to be cocaine. Atkins admitted that she was aware the drugs were in her purse and shoes and was charged with importation of a controlled substance. Apprehended: Officers questioned Atkins after she got off a JetBlue flight arriving at New York City's Kennedy airport (above) from Montego Bay, Jamaice . Big bust: The cocaine seized had an approximate street value of more than $64,000 . According to CBP, the total weight of cocaine seized was approximately 3.7 lbs. with an approximate street value of more than $64,000. 'This latest seizure demonstrates the vigilance of our CBP officers, and their excellence in detecting those who would try to smuggle these illegal substances,' said Robert E. Perez, Director, Field Operations New York. Atkins, who now faces federal narcotics smuggling charges, is being held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. She also won't be getting her Chanel bag back, a loss of roughly $5,500 assuming it is a real Classic Flap Bag and not a fake.","Janisha Atkins, 33, was arrested at New York City's Kennedy airport with almost four pounds of cocaine .

"Canada's national airline was today ordered to apologise to a couple of French language 'extremists' who complained that cabin crew only spoke to them in English. Michel and Lynda Thibodeau launched legal action against Air Canada for not respecting their right to be served food and drink in their mother tongue. Mr Thibodeau - also a fluent English speaker - branded the airline's employees as 'malicious, oppressive and reprehensible' for not answering his questions in French. Michel Thibodeau has failed with a compensation claim against Air Canada after being spoken to English . The couple claimed they didn't get served in French when they checked in for their flight or at the boarding gate at the airport in the Canadian capital Ottawa. They also complained that they ordered a 7UP drink aboard the plane, but the English speaking air hostess brought them a Sprite instead aboard the flight in July 2009. They were initially awarded £8,000 in damages in 2010, but Air Canada appealed and the ruling was overturned. The Thibodeaus then took their case to the Canadian Supreme Court, where judges ruled on Tuesday that Canada's Official Languages Act does not allow citizens to sue for cash damages for being spoken to in the wrong language. Instead, the airline was only ordered to apologise to the couple and ensure the Languages Act was respected in future. Mr Thibodeau had also filed a similar language complaint against Ottawa's bus company in 2002 after a driver greeted him with 'hello' instead of 'bonjour'. Air Canada appealed an £8,000 compensation ruling successfully and now only have to apologise to the couple . The Thibodeaus made their complaint after not being served in their mother tongue, French . Canada's National Post newspaper had earlier described Mr Thibodeau as the linguistic equivalent of a 'supermarket coupon clipper'. Columnist Barbara Kay wrote: 'Instead of haunting supermarkets, he haunts bus companies and airlines, forever on the lookout for a breach of his right to hear the station stop, the weather, the time and the altitude in French. 'Next time Mr Thibodeau tries his little trick, the airlines should offer him a free case 7UP, and if that isn't good enough then they should inform him - in both official languages - that he is wasting their time.'","Michel and Lynda Thibodeau angry they weren't spoken to in mother tongue .

"A drunk rugby coach crashed his car while dressed as pop star Rhianna - and then sped off because he was embarrassed about his outfit. Glenn Stroud had been at a Stars in Their Eyes fancy dress party at a nearby rugby club and was still in costume when he hit an oncoming car in Newport, Wales in the early hours of 9 November. The former rugby player, who coaches the sport at local schools, failed to stop at the scene - claiming that he didn't want to be seen dressed up as the singer. 'Embarrassed': Glenn Stroud (right) had been at a Stars in Their Eyes fancy dress party at a nearby rugby club and was still wearing a wig, dress and make-up (left) when he hit an oncoming car in Newport, Wales . But the other driver followed him and phoned the police, who found the 43-year-old in his curly red wig, purple dress and make-up at the wheel of his Ford Ka. Stroud was banned today from the roads for twenty months after admitting drink driving. He was more than twice the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed. Judge Richard Williams said: 'This was a calculated attempt to avoid detection. 'You failed to stop after a road traffic accident, the offence of failing to stop is a serious aggravating factor.' Crash: The 43-year-old was twice the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed his Ford Ka while dressed as pop star Rihanna (right). He was seen 'swerving all over the road' before crashing into a Vauxhall Corsa . Stroud had been at the party at St Julians Rugby Club on 9 November, Newport Magistrates' Court heard. After the party, he got behind the wheel of his car with 86 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35 milligrams. He was seen 'swerving all over the road' before he crashed into a Vauxhall Corsa in the early hours of the morning on November 9. No one was injured but damage was caused to both cars and Stroud tried to drive off from the scene. Scene: Stroud was more than twice the legal drink-drive limit when he decided to drive home after the themed party at nearby St Julian's Rugby Club. He crashed into another car on Caerleon Road, Newport, pictured . Ian George, defending, said: 'One of the reasons Stroud didn't stop immediately was because of what he was wearing.' Stroud, of Caerleon near Newport, admitted driving under the influence of alcohol and failing to stop after a road accident. The coach, who works for Newport City Council coaching rugby at local schools and formerly played for leading Welsh club side Cross Keys, was also fined £668.","Glenn Stroud attended Stars in Their Eyes fancy dress party at rugby club .

"The former Melbourne private school student accused of murdering a homeless man told his victim that his father was a werewolf before attacking him, a court has heard. Easton George Woodhead, 19, stabbed Morgan Wayne 'Mousey' Perry as he lay on his mattress with a group of homeless people living on the banks of Melbourne's Yarra River, the Melbourne Magistrates Court heard. Prosecutor Michele Williams SC said Woodhead approached the group who were set up under a bridge in the city's centre claiming one of them had stolen his motorbike. Easton George Woodhead's lawyer Michael Tovey said there was no dispute that Woodhead (pictured) stabbed and killed Morgan Wayne 'Mousey' Perry, but his state of mind at the time would be at issue . Mr Perry responded by telling Woodhead to 'p*** off', Ms Williams said. The court heard Woodhead then pulled a combat knife from his pocket and started waving it around, before standing on a milk crate and addressing the group, telling them he had recently discovered his father was a werewolf. Ms Williams said Woodhead then jumped on Mr Perry as he lay on his mattress and started stabbing him in the early hours of January 4 this year. Woodhead had recently completed his year 12 studies at Melbourne Grammar and his former classmates had noticed his heavy use of marijuana and erratic behaviour, the court heard on Monday. One friend, Matthew Caldwell, said Woodhead began ranting about bizarre topics, including vampires and werewolves, and carrying around a bulletproof vest. The 19 year-old stabbed Morgan Wayne 'Mousey' Perry as he lay on his mattress with a group of homeless people living on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne in January . Mr Caldwell said Woodhead spoke of being recruited by the Australian Special Air Service (SAS) for the 'special abilities' he possessed. 'Special abilities he had that others didn't,' Mr Caldwell told the court. He also believed he was in an ongoing battle with werewolves and vampires and feared they were following him, Mr Caldwell said. 'It was a battle between him and the werewolves and vampires,' he said. Woodhead could become manic, talking for hours at a time and also discussed the possibility of injecting ink from printer cartridges into his veins to make himself immortal, according to Mr Caldwell. Woodhead's barrister Michael Tovey QC said there was no dispute that Woodhead stabbed and killed Mr Perry, but his state of mind at the time of the incident would be at issue. 'There will be focus on the bizarre and delusional behaviour of Easton Woodhead in the days and months leading up to the stabbing,' he said. Woodhead's committal hearing continues.

"There were many who doubted Alastair Cook could repeat his achievement in India in turning a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 Test series lead, including at least six former England captains, but Peter Moores was not among them. The extraordinary fourth Test victory, England’s first within three days against India since 1967, was a triumph for a captain on the end of fierce criticism after the low of Lord’s and a coach in Moores who had much to prove. The bitter aftermath of the worst winter in England’s history increased the pressure on Cook and Moores but, finally, after the most searching examination, a new era brimming with promising talent looks close to glorious fruition. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook salutes victorious England effort . Crowd scene: Alastair Cook smiles as he celebrates with supporters following England's Old Trafford win . Meet and greet: Cook is congratulated by happy England fans after comprehensively beating India . VIDEO Cook salutes victorious England effort . ‘The significant point was when Alastair came out and said he was in it for the long haul,’ said Moores when asked how England had recovered under Cook from the rock bottom of their second Test capitulation to twice thrash India. ‘He still wanted to do the job. If other people didn’t want him then fine, he’d move on, but he made public his desire to captain England. The more criticism he got the steelier he got, more determined. He’s that sort of character. ‘I think he honestly said, when people were questioning him, that he would give it everything he had and he’s still got the same approach. He’s developing quickly tactically as a captain and he has great values. 'There is nothing Alastair wouldn’t do for England or for the team. And that’s a good place to start.’ Privately, the England hierarchy have always been adamant that Cook was going nowhere, not even, they insist, if that defeat at Lord’s had been followed by another in Southampton. Yet Paul Downton, the new managing director whose belief in Cook and Moores has never wavered, did not have to worry about that. This Investec series is not won yet but such was the spineless surrender of India at Old Trafford, when salvation in the form of Hurricane Bertha was just around the corner, that it is difficult to see them possibly recovering at The Oval. Stumping up: Cook leads the applause following the final wicket . Another victory in the final Test would cement Cook as captain for next year’s Ashes, with England’s next Test cricket not coming until April in the Caribbean, of an exciting team who just needed to turn that potential into tangible success. Did Moores, in his second coming as coach, ever doubt his captain? ‘No, because when you are close to somebody you get an idea of their will to do the job,’ said Moores. ‘He would openly admit that he’s had a really rough ride but that can sometimes forge somebody into something special. ‘Leadership is about getting people to follow you and creating opportunities for them. Cooky is very much into that. Deep down, he is a real carer as a bloke. He wants the team to grow. 'That’s why it’s exciting, there are chances for all these young players coming in. There will be some changes as we go along but hopefully the leader is not someone you want to change too often.’ Joy: Chris Jordan (right) celebrates after taking the final wicket by bowling Pankaj Singh . Over and out: Pankaj is comprehensively bowled by Jordan and England win . While England are on the up India have descended from a position where they could have claimed an historic series win on these shores to an absolute rabble under a captain in MS Dhoni who just did not look interested on Saturday. Dhoni’s hopeless slog to gift Moeen Ali one of his four wickets, as nine in all fell after tea on the third day in just 132 balls, summed up an India side who have appeared to lose focus ever since Dhoni became obsessed with trying to get Jimmy Anderson banned for the rest of the series. The India captain must have known bad weather was on the way to Manchester yesterday and tomorrow yet he showed a complete lack of discipline. Jumping for joy: Moeen Ali (second left) is congratulated after taking the wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara . England’s startling recovery should be placed in the context of India’s fecklessness at the Ageas Bowl and in Manchester but it is also worth pointing out that the home side finally got the pitch at Old Trafford, with pace and carry, they have craved all season. It is no exaggeration to say that England would probably have won all their Tests this season if the pitches had replicated the one produced by Matt Merchant. Can it really be so hard for groundsmen? ‘That was one of the best cricket pitches I’ve seen for a very long time,’ said Moores of his old stamping ground. ‘It had something for everyone.’ For now it has helped restore the smile on the face of English cricket.","Lots of former England captains said Cook should go .

"Facebook may have more than one billion users, but despite so many ‘connected’ people, the social network is full of lonely hearts, a new study suggests. Researchers analysed a collection of studies to conclude that a connection between Facebook and loneliness exists. They said the link is because the feeling of loneliness brings users in search of friendship to Facebook, rather than the social network making people feel isolated. Researchers analysed a collection of studies to conclude that a connection between Facebook and loneliness exists. They said the link is because the feeling of loneliness brings users in search of friendship to Facebook, (illustrated with a stock image) rather than the social network making people feel isolated . Hayeon Song, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) focused on Facebook because of its broad appeal. The social network accounts for 54 per cent of global users’ time. Many pieces of research have sought to investigate the link between Facebook and loneliness as well as whether interacting with people online harms face-to-face relationships, or enables shy people to connect with others virtually in a meaningful way that they might not manage offline. This is known as the 'internet paradox'. Her team reviewed studies published so far on the topic and found that people have concluded that Facebook both causes and eases loneliness. Experts found the lonelier someone is, the longer they spend on Facebook. A stock image of a lonely man is pictured . Professor Song found that the lonelier someone is, the longer they spend on Facebook. She suggests that this shows Facebook does not reduce people’s sense of isolation. However, the researchers did not find that Facebook causes loneliness – only that people use the social network in a bid to feel more connected. ‘Compared to non-lonely people, lonely people spend more time on Facebook. Lonely individuals who are shy or have low social support may turn to Facebook to compensate for their lack of social skills and/or social networks in face-to-face settings,’ she wrote in the study, published in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour. ‘The interesting point of this study is that it both supports and corrects the original internet paradox study, which is one of the most influential studies in internet research,' and was produced by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. She continued: ‘To the question of whether or not the internet increases psychological dysfunction such as loneliness, the internet paradox study suggested that Internet use has detrimental effects. Our study supports this in that Internet use is associated with loneliness. ‘However, we found the previously suggested causal direction to be erroneous: lonely people spend more time on the internet rather than internet use making people lonely,’ Professor Song said. She said that more research is needed to investigate the findings further, including whether young people compensate for loneliness in the same way that older people do. Australian researchers from Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia studied the profiles of 608 female Facebook users. According to the researchers, ‘half (308) were categorised as “connected” and the remaining 308 users were categorised as ""lonely”; based on clearly stating this feeling in their latest wall posting.’ The study then monitored the publicly available aspects of the profile to see if there was a relationship between loneliness and self-disclosure. Half of those who were categorised as lonely were more likely to include more personal information on their accounts. This ranged from their relationship status to their address and phone number. One in eight lonely users also listed their favourite book and film.","Feelings of loneliness bring users in search of friendship to Facebook .

"Signing off: Lena Dunham has cancelled two stops on her book tour this week amid allegations she sexually abused her little sister. Pictured above at a book event in London on October 29 . Lena Dunham is reportedly threatening to sue the right-wing website which last week accused her of sexually abusing her little sister Grace when they were children. In the wake of the allegations,  the creator and star of HBO's Girls, has cancelled two stops on her book tour scheduled this week in Belgium and Germany for health issues. On Monday,  she tweeted that she was 'deeply sorry' to miss the Antwerp Book Fair and a signing in Berlin, adding that she's 'so grateful for your energy and support'. Last week, right-wing website Truth Revolt excerpted a portion from Lena's new book about her childhood curiosity with the female reproductive system and labelled it 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'. Today, that website claims that Lena is threatening to sue them if they don't remove the article she claims is 'false and defamatory' and publish an apology note. The website adamantly declined, and editor Ben Shapiro wrote another article explaining why they would not heed to the demands of Lena's lawyers. 'We refuse. We refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it, because quoting a woman’s book does not constitute a “false” story, even if she is a prominent actress and left-wing activist. 'Lena Dunham may not like our interpretation of her book, but unfortunately for her and her attorneys, she wrote that book – and the First Amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like, the article reads. The passage that Truth Revolt excerpted details a conversation that then-year-old Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs. In the course of the conversation, young Lena asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers. 'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds . 'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes . Scroll down for video . Allegations: A right-wing website published a story last week, citing an incident detailed in Lena's (right) new book as evidence of molestation. The essay descirbes a curious 7-year-old Lena looking at her then 1-year-old sister Grace's (left) vagina after having a conversation with her mother about female reproductive organs. The Dunham sisters pictured above at the filming of Lena's film Tiny Furniture in November 2010 . 'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked. 'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!” 'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 'She just on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.' Truth Revolt  responded described the essay as 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' in an article titled  'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister' The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. Obviously upset with being named as a child molester, Dunham took to Twitter on Saturday to lash out at Truth Revolt for their damaging article three days after it was published. The website has refused to apologize for the article. 'If Ms. Dunham says that our quotations from her book were “false,” or that our interpretation of those events was libelous under the law, then we look forward to asking her, in her deposition, about why they appeared in her book,' editor Ben Shapiro wrote on Tuesday. 'We also look forward to asking her why she believes it is now appropriate for a 28-year-old woman to make light of opening her baby sister’s vagina, paying her with candies for prolonged kisses on the lips in the manner of a “sexual predator,” or masturbating in bed next to her prepubescent sister,' he added. Grace Dunham also appears to have responded to the allegations in her own Twitter rant on Monday, writing vaguely about heternormativity and what is and is not considered 'normal' behavior. Grace writes that she supports writers 'narrating their own experiences, determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful'. She also posted: '2day, like every other day, is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women, queer, and trans people.' While the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister's essay, they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world. The sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the Truth Revolt article, according to one tweet Lena wrote on Saturday. 'Sometimes I get so mad I burn write up. Also, I wish my sister wasn't laughing so hard,' Dunham tweeted on November 1.

"A former New York City Ballet soloist, who had to quit her promising career as a dancer after a thyroid illness caused her to gain 40lbs, has broken her silence. Kathryn Morgan, now 25 and based in New York, was only 17 when she joined the prestigious NYCB and was 21 when she was diagnosed with an under-active thyroid. At 23 when she quit in order to recover. 'You have to be thin, you have to look good, you have to fit in the costume, and that’s pretty much it,' she told The Huffington Post. 'It's just part of the job.' Scroll down for video . Dancer: Kathryn Morgan, now 25 (pictured) was only 17 when she joined the prestigious New York City Ballet, 21 when she was diagnosed with an under-active thyroid, and 23 when she quit in order to recover . Miss Morgan, who has danced lead roles including Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, and Aurora in Sleeping Beauty, battled with her illness for two years before accepting it was time to leave the NYCB. Dancing ten hours a day and juggling the industry standard of 50 ballet shows per season became impossible amid the crippling migraines, exhaustion, hair loss and weight gain. 'I remember [my ballet masters] just constantly telling me, ""You're gaining weight; you're gaining weight; you're gaining weight."" And I just thought, ""Yes, I know"",' she recalls, referring to the time just before her diagnoses, when the weight gain was unexplained. On the mend: Miss Morgan, pictured in 2010 when she was playing the lead role of Aurora in Sleeping Beauty (left) and now, two years after she had to quit following her under-active thyroid diagnoses (right) Miss Morgan is keen to maintain that it were her choice to break her contract and head to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama, to recover; and that the NYCB's concerns over her weight were purely logistical. She describes ballet as an 'aesthetic art' with a certain standard that audience members pay to enjoy. That, and the simple fact that the male dancers 'need to be able to lift you,' renders your weight important. 'When I was heavier, I found that things just hurt more,' she admits. 'Pointe shoes hurt a lot more, and it was really hard to do some of the things that I did when I was thinner at a heavier weight.' Her difficult decision to leave her fledgling career was probably wise. Miss Morgan spent the next two years recovering in Alabama, where she started a blog, If The Pointe Shoe Fits, and a YouTube channel for other aspiring dancers. Giving guidance and advice to others was, and still is, a therapeutic practice for Miss Morgan, who describes it as 'catering to my 13-year-old self.' Grueling: Miss Morgan (pictured in 2010) trained for ten hours daily at the NYCB, and describes it as an 'aesthetic art' with a certain standard that audience members pay to enjoy . Turned teacher: Miss Morgan left the NYCB in 2012 at the age of 23 to recover from her illness at home. There she started a blog and YouTube channel (pictured) to give guidance to other aspiring dancers . Questions she receives from young, ambitious girls regarding the importance of weight and general appearance are tough, but Miss Morgan claims she never lies. It wouldn't be helpful, she points out, to paint an unattainable fantasy, because it is an industry, much like modelling, where weight will always be a concern. 'You're looking at yourself in the mirror every single day in a leotard,' she remarks. 'I tell people who are not dancers that it's like being in a bathing suit all day long.' Miss Morgan notes that during her time at the highly competitive NYCB, she wasn't exposed directly to eating disorders. In all likelihood however, many girls were 'probably very good at hiding it.' She does argue that the intense physical demands of the job are enough to keep dancers slender in of itself, and that it would be impossible to 'not eat' and still manage to perform at such a level. Miss Morgan (pictured in May) is now recovered, has dropped 25lbs, and plans to return to ballet . Miss Morgan, who stills runs her popular blog and YouTube channel, was given a clean bill of health in May of this year, and is keen to pick up where she left off. The first step, she says, it to 'get in shape' again - she's dropped 25lbs so far - and then she will start auditioning for ballet companies. She was unable to rejoin the NYCB, so will have to explore other options. In a statement made to The New York Times last month, Peter Martins, the company’s ballet master in chief, said: . '[Miss Morgan's] decision to leave New York City Ballet was an enormous loss, but was, of course, necessary so that she could focus on her health. 'When Katie reached out to me in the spring of 2013 about possibly returning to the stage, I was thrilled to hear that she was feeling better. 'However, at the time NYCB was working very hard to eliminate several years of budget deficits, and I was simply unable to add another dancer to the roster, and could not offer Katie a position with the company.' Despite this set-back, taking a break from the occupation that had dominated her life - 'If you're more concerned with having friends, this may not be the career for you,' she advises in one video - has actually been a positive learning experience for Miss Morgan. With her health back, a legion of over 9,000 subscribers to her YouTube channel, and dreams of ending up at a ballet company in Europe, Miss Morgan's future looks to be bright again.","Kathryn Morgan, now 25, was diagnosed with an under-active thyroid in 2010, causing weight gain, exhaustion and hair loss .

"The founder of outlawed file-sharing website Megaupload launched his new online hub with a lavish ceremony at his £15.8m mansion, including a re-enactment of the police raid on his home, yesterday. Kim Dotcom spoke from a giant stage at Dotcom Mansion in Coatsville Auckland, as he unveiled new site Mega, which the millionaire said comply with the law, rendering it safe from being taken down. Dotcom then compared last year's raid to the iceberg which caused the Titanic disaster, saying without it 'we wouldn't have a . great Titanic movie which makes me cry every time I see it.' Scroll down for video . Mega man: Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom launches his new file-sharing site 'Mega' surrounded by dancers . 'Mega is going to be huge, and . nothing will stop Mega!,' Dotcom shouted seconds before a helicopter roared . overhead and faux police agents rappelled down the side of his mansion . and female military guards in mini-skirts surrounded him on stage. The controversial millionaire then . ordered to 'stop this madness' before breaking out into a dance . alongside the 'guards'. The interest for Mega.co.nz is already high, and Dotcom said half a million users registered in its first 14 hours. Kim Dotcom said his new ‘cyberlocker’ was not revenge on U.S. authorities, who are trying to extradite him and . three colleagues from New Zealand, and last year closed Megaupload and . charged him with online piracy for which he faces jail if found guilty. ‘This . is not some kind of finger to the U.S. government or to Hollywood,’ Dotcom said at his sprawling New Zealand estate. ‘Legally, there’s just . nothing there that could be used to shut us down,’ he said. Happy raiding: Kim Dotcom poked fun at the police raid on his home last year with a cheeky re-enactment saying that he was glad it happened because 'without it we wouldn't have Mega' Jolly Roger: Mega was launched exactly one year after Megaupload was shut down and Dotcom was arrested in the world's biggest online piracy case . Commander-in-chief: Dotcom, who claims then new site is not a 'revenge' on U.S. authorities who shut down his last venture, joined the fancy dress dancers in a jubilant boogie to celebrate the launch of Mega . Dotcom said Mega was a different beast . to Megaupload, as the new site enables users to control exactly which . users can access uploaded files, in contrast to its predecessor, which . allowed users to search files, some of which contained copyrighted . content allegedly without permission. It offers 50 gigabytes of free storage, much more than similar sites . such as Dropbox and Google Drive, and features a drag-and-drop upload . tool. A sophisticated encryption system will . allow users to encode their files before they upload them on to the . site’s servers, which Dotcom said were located in New Zealand and . overseas. Each file will then be issued a . unique, sophisticated decryption key which only the file holder will . control, allowing them to share the file as they choose. The decryption keys for uploaded . files are held by the users, not the site itself, which means the company can't see . what's in the files being shared. Dotcom argues that Mega therefore . can't be held liable for content it cannot see. Pleased: Kim Dotcom's new site has already had a huge response, with 500,000 users registering in the first 14 hours . Unbreakable: Dotcom insists the new site complies with the law and is therefore impossible to shut down . Turnout: Guests, staff and media attended the launch at Dotcom mansion yesterday to hear Kim Dotcom unveil the new site . ‘What he's trying to do is give . himself a second-string argument: `Even if I was wrong before, this . one's all right because how can I control something if I don't know that . it's there?’' said Sydney attorney Charles Alexander, who specializes . in intellectual property law. ‘I can understand the argument; whether it would be successful or not is another matter.’ He added that the launch is unlikely to have any impact on the Megaupload case. ‘All . it might do is annoy them enough to say, “We're going to redouble our . efforts in prosecuting them”. But I don't think it makes any practical . difference to the outcome.’ The . Motion Picture Association of America, which filed complaints about . alleged copyright infringement by Megaupload, was not impressed. ‘We . are still reviewing how this new project will operate, but we do know . that Kim Dotcom has built his career and his fortune on stealing . creative works,’ the MPAA said in a statement. ‘We'll . reserve final judgment until we have a chance to take a closer look, . but given Kim Dotcom's history of damaging the consumer experience by . pushing stolen, illegitimate content into the marketplace, count us as . sceptical.’ Defiant: Kim Dotcom is launching a new file sharing website called Mega exactly a year after the FBI shut down his old site Megaupload and charged him with online piracy . New venture: Dotcom insists his new offering, Mega.co.nz, which will launch on Sunday, complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile . The faux raid at the Mega launch re-enacted the police raid on Dotcom last year. Last January, New Zealand’s elite . special tactics forces landed by helicopter at dawn in the grounds of .

"Donor cartilage can be used to help delay or even prevent knee arthritis and the need for a joint replacement. Rebekah Mills-Bennett, 34, a physiotherapist from Cardiff, underwent the surgery, as she tells JUDY HOBSON. THE PATIENT . As a teenager, I lived for sport. But my dreams of playing volleyball for England were wrecked after I twisted my left knee during team trials when I was 14. An MRI scan revealed I had ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament, which joins two bones in the knee together. Rebekah could barely walk a couple of hundred yards and was starting to limp . I'd also torn my medial meniscus, a disc of rubbery cartilage on the inner side of my knee, which cushions your knee bones when you bend and straighten your leg. I had surgery to reconstruct my torn ligament and the torn meniscal cartilage was sewn back together. However, it didn't knit together properly and my knee kept swelling up afterwards. So three months later, I had an arthroscopy, where the surgeon uses a telescope with a camera at the end to examine inside the joint, then repairs or removes damaged tissue. He took out some of my torn meniscus during the procedure. Then because bits of it still kept breaking off, I had a second arthroscopy in 2001 to remove the rest. This seemed to work well, and in my 20s I was running regularly and playing beach volleyball. But five years ago, my left leg started to become very swollen and painful after exercise. Eventually, I had to give up sport altogether. I could barely walk a couple of hundred yards and was starting to limp. I was miserable because it was such a huge part of my life. I even thought about having my leg amputated and being fitted with an artificial limb - I knew people with artificial limbs who were taking part in marathons. At 30, she felt like an old, disabled woman . I was only 30, but I felt like an old, disabled woman. I was planning to marry my fiance, Gareth, a semi-professional rugby player, and was frightened I wouldn't be able to keep up with him. In September 2010, my GP referred me to an orthopaedic surgeon, who suggested a meniscal transplant as my knee had started to become arthritic. I'd not heard of this procedure before, but he said I'd be given a new meniscus donated by someone who had died. I had to wait six months for a donor as it had to be the correct size and come from someone a similar age. It would come from the U.S. because this is a relatively new procedure and the tissue available in Britain is limited. It arrived two weeks before I got married in June 2011. I had the operation on June 28 at the Vale Hospital in Hensol, near Cardiff, ten days after my wedding. The procedure took four hours. Afterwards, the pain was horrendous. I was given the pain-killing drug co-dydramol plus anti-inflammatories, which helped. The next day, though still in pain, I was out of bed on crutches. I also had to wear a leg brace for eight weeks to stop me from bending my knee too much. On the fourth day, I went home and after six weeks I no longer needed painkillers. After nine months, I could walk more than a mile pain-free - now it's five or six miles and I've also started to play a little volleyball again. I'm so grateful to the person who donated the meniscus. THE SURGEON . Christopher Wilson is an orthopaedic surgeon at the Nuffield Health Cardiff Bay and Vale Hospitals in Hensol. Orthopaedic surgeons now recognise that if you replace a damaged meniscus you can delay knee arthritis - and in some cases prevent it altogether. This is because when your meniscus is damaged, it puts pressure on the rest of the knee and you end up needing a joint replacement. The meniscus is a crescent-shaped cushion of rubbery, fibrous tissue that sits on either side of your knee joint. It acts as a shock absorber and allows knee bones to glide smoothly over each other. If it gets damaged, bone starts to rub on bone and you can go on to develop arthritis. Tears to the meniscus are common after a fall or any twisting injury. It also loses elasticity through wear and tear as we age. A meniscal transplant is best done before the surfaces of the joint have become too damaged. For this reason, it is most suitable for people with the signs of early arthritis - usually the under 50s. In the U.S., surgeons carry out the procedure well before the onset of arthritis and this is proving very successful. We also have 20 years of data from Belgium showing that it has a 90 per cent-plus success rate. Only 100 to 200 operations are done in the UK each year, but we're now in a position where we can start conducting our own studies. I'm hopeful that by the end of this decade a meniscal transplant will have become a standard procedure. Rebekah had the meniscus on the inside of her left knee removed some time ago. She was hobbling around in a lot of pain and showing early signs of osteoarthritis. Without a new meniscus, her symptoms would have worsened rapidly. The first thing we to do is ensure we get a good size-match from a donor. This is critical because a meniscus can't be stretched or squashed to fit and cutting damages it so it won't work as well. To gauge the size needed, we use an X-ray machine that incorporates a measuring device to look inside the knee. After nine months, Rebekah could walk more than a mile pain-free - now it's five or six miles . The donated meniscus looks rather like a horseshoe, and at either end it has tiny natural anchors of stronger tissue. It is these that keep it firmly fixed to the patient's bone and stop it sliding around. Using a camera to guide me, I implanted Rebekah's new meniscus in a keyhole procedure under general anaesthetic. I made four tiny (0.5cm) keyhole incisions and two longer 6cm incisions over the front of her knee. With a motorised device that looks rather like a pen but acts like a mini-vacuum, I removed the last remaining bits of Rebekah's own meniscus. Then I drilled two tiny tunnels into the top of her shin bone, (the tibia) and pulled the meniscal anchors through these and stitched them in place at the front of her knee. After stitching up all the incisions, I injected lots of local anaesthetic around the area to help with the pain. Rebekah's transplant has made a huge difference - her chances of ever needing a full knee replacement will have been delayed by at least 15 years. ANY DRAWBACKS? The greatest risk associated with this kind of surgery is that it will fail and need to be redone. It is estimated this occurs in 5 to 10 per cent of cases. There is a very tiny risk of disease, however because donated meniscus discs are all screened for diseases such as hepatitis and HIV, the risk is less than with a blood transfusion, says Adrian Wilson, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke and the Hampshire Clinic in Old Basingstoke. Rejection of a donor meniscus is rare as there are too few cells in the tissue to excite a response. 'The reason so few are carried out in the UK is that it is a challenging procedure, so surgeons need to put in the time in order to acquire the expertise,' adds Mr Wilson. 'But it can no longer be regarded as experimental and when undertaken makes a massive difference to people's lives.' Meniscal transplant surgery is available on the NHS and privately. It costs around £9,000.","Rebekah Mills-Bennett, 34, from Cardiff, underwent the surgery .

"Anywhere else, a property developer who buys a bundle of foreclosed houses, abandoned factories and disused churches for a mere $500 a piece would be hailed as a genius. But this is Detroit. And Herb Strather's $3.2million purchase of 6,350 homes is being called foolhardy. To be sure, there are plenty of gems in the city's 'blight bundle.' A 170,00-square-foot factory that's still in good shape, a three-story brick home built in 1915 that most recently sold for $185,000, a lovely Tudor-style house that's ready to move into and a five-bedroom that simply needs a new roof. But city officials tell the Detroit News that 2,000 of the properties are vacant lots. More than 3,000 will need to be torn down immediately. Scroll down for video . The 'blight bundle' of 6,350 homes was never meant to be sold to a private developer, city officials say. Instead it was going to be transferred to the Detroit Land Bank and the home would have been individually dealt with . This property contains nothing more than a charred ruin of what was once a house in once a nice neighborhood . It is estimated that only 1,000 of the properties have salvageable homes. And many of those will require significant work to make move-in ready . All of the properties in the 'blight bundle' have been foreclosed, though some are in better shape than others . It costs an average of $10,000 to demolish and clean up the wreckage of a house in Detroit - leaving Herb Strather on the hook for more than $30million . The Motor City Mapping Project show the 'blight bundle' properties in red, spread across the city of Detroit. Other foreclosed homes that are in better shape are in blue . Hundreds more need so much rehab work that it's not worth the effort. And only 1,000 are salvageable houses. The Motor City Mapping Project has attempted to document all of the foreclosed and blighted houses in the city - tens of thousands of properties. What's more, the city never intended anyone to buy its 'blight bundle.' It offered the properties up for auction so that they could then be given to the Detroit Land Bank, which would take care of selling the worthwhile properties a few at a time and cleaning up the rest. The city put strenuous rules on the buys of the 'blight bundle' requiring the buyer to either demolish and clean up all 6,350 properties within the next six months or offer a development plan. 'Now what we have to do is find out if indeed this group is serious about taking on such a task. And if they're willing to do so, we're willing to listen,' Wayne County Chief Deputy Treasurer David Szymanski told the Huffington Post. Herb Strather, a Detroit real estate developer, is leading the group of investors who paid $3.2million for the foreclosed homes . More than 2,000 of the properties are simply vacant lots. Some 3,000 more must be demolished . Included in the bundle in the former Detroit Hope Hospital, which closed in 2010 . Also in the package is this 170,000 square foot factory that's still in good shape . Some of the blighted homes are really blighted at all . All of the houses in the packaged have been seized by the city for nonpayment of property taxes . The costs involved with the purchase of the 'blight bundle' are already slated to be many times the $3.2million price tag. It costs $10,000 to demolish a house in Detroit. Mr Strather and his investors are likely to be required to demolish all 3,000 - at a cost of more than $30million. Many of the homes have fire damage, have been vandalized or have squatters living in them. Countless hundreds have been stripped of pipes and anything valuable. Many are in various states of disrepair. Mr Strather is undaunted. 'I think I was born to do it. The idea of redevelopment in my community would be a work of love,' he told the Huffington Post. The developer, however, has far from a perfect track record. He led a group of developers who tried to return the St. Regis Hotel to glory. In 2009, the group defaulted on an $8.7million loan. This brick house looks in mostly good conidtion . Fixer-upper? Ivy has entirely consumed this property and it remains to be seen whether it can be salvaged . Room with a view: This house will almost certainly have to be torn down . Some of the homes can be quickly resold to owners .

"A representative study on internet attack traffic has revealed that China is the country where the largest number of attacks originate. By monitoring connections on the web it was shown that 43 per cent of online attacks originated in China, more than three times Indonesia in second place with 15 per cent. And the researchers add that general internet users can keep themselves safe by frequently updating their software. The attacks in the study refer to attempts by a computer to connect to specific ports on the internet, which would indicate a hacked or infected computer that was trying to connect to other computers. Scroll down for video . Massachusetts-based Akamai says 43 per cent of internet attacks originate in China according to a representative study. They about 200 computer systems around the world to monitor connections. The results of where most attacks originated from is shown in this infographic . The research was carried out by Akamai Technologies, based in Massachusetts, using 100 to 200 computers as ‘agents’ to create a representative view of internet traffic. Part of their ‘State of the internet’ quarterly report, the findings showed that nearly half of all web attacks originated in China. And most of them were directed towards ‘Port 80’, which is the port that web servers generally listen in on. Akamai’s David Belson, Editor of the report, explains to MailOnline that the results should not be taken as a view of the Internet as a whole, but rather only as representative findings. Last month warnings were issued about a 'catastrophic' security flaw affecting one of the most important interfaces powering the web. Known as the 'Bash' bug, the flaw could be 'bigger than Heartbleed' which put every computer user at risk earlier this year. Experts claim the bug may pose a serious threat to computers using Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Apple's Mac OS X - and in turn, could spread to all internet-connected devices. The bug, which also goes by the name 'Shellshock', could potentially allow hackers to gain access to every internet-enabled device in a person's home using something as innocuous as a smart lightbulb. The danger with this, in particular, is that once it has access to an internet-connected device it can jump onto others. This includes smart locks that open front doors. ‘We’re basically saying from the systems we’ve got out there, 43 per cent of the attacks we observe are coming from China,’ he says. When asked if he’d expect similar results if every connection on the internet was monitored, he says: ‘It’s hard to say if they’d be similar. Other attack traffic studies have placed China in top spot [like Akamai], others have placed other countries top.’ Explaining the method behind getting the data, Mr Belson says internet ports can be thought of as telephone extensions. ‘So, for example, human resources is extension 123, finance is 456 and legal is 789,’ he explains. ‘Think of somebody that’s randomly calling in to your company’s telephone number and punching in various extensions.’ He continues: ‘Port 80 is the port that web servers generally listen on, so it may be indicative of somebody trying to look for vulnerabilities in common web based software.’ The quarterly report, which has run since 2008, comes at quite a busy time for internet security, with the Shellshock bug making headlines in previous weeks. Shellshock is a newly emerged major Internet threat that affects a common software tool found in many operating systems known as Bash, or Bourne-again Shell. The findings were published in their quarterly 'State of the internet' report. However Editor David Belson tells MailOnline that the results do not necessarily represent the internet as a whole. He adds that people can keep themselves safe by keeping their software and systems up to date (stock image shown) The biggest change from the previous report according to Mr Belson is that Indonesia jumped back up to second place. In 2013 Indonesia jumped into the top slot and significantly increased the amount of attack traffic from the country, but it seemed to be a quarter anomaly. Mr Belson says the results should not be too much of a cause for concern for general internet users, but he advises people to keep their systems up to date. ‘Generally the statement I would make would be to make sure you’re keeping your systems patched and up to date,’ he says. ‘There’s a reason Microsoft, Linux, Apple and so on publish updates on a regular basis. ‘Constantly update and patch your systems, make sure you’re running malware and virus scanners, and make sure you’re not doing anything stupid online.’","Massachusetts-based Akamai says 43 per cent of internet attacks originate in China according to a representative study .

"They may be a sanctuary for some of the world’s most endangered animals, but noisy zoos could may be putting creatures off sex, scuppering hopes of populations bouncing back. Noises of modern life - from traffic to mobile phones – may explain why animals such as the rhino are so reluctant to breed in captivity, zoologists claim. Among the unfamiliar sounds which may put the animals off mating are the chattering humans who go to zoos to see animals that are dying out in the wild. Scroll down for video . Noises of modern life - from traffic to mobile phones – may explain why animals such as the rhino are so reluctant to breed in captivity, zoologists claim. Rhinos have  sensitive hearing to detect potential predators and rival rhinos approaching their territory on the grassy savannahs of Africa. White rhinos are shown . Rhinos have exceptionally sensitive hearing to detect potential predators and rival rhinos on the grassy savannahs of Africa. They can even pick up on the change in vibrations to the ground on which they roam because they can hear infrasound - low noises that cannot be detected by humans. But alien sounds heard in urban zoos affect this ability and may distress the animals enough to affect their natural mating behaviour, according to zooloogists at the University of Texas. Do not disturb: Alien sounds in urban zoos may distress animals enough to affect their natural mating behaviour, according to zoologists. It is hoped that the study finding will lead to the development of sound-proof enclosures where animals will not be disturbed (illustrated) and may feel like mating . Rhinos can pick up ‘infrasound' such as low rumbles that can't be detected by humans. They can hear down to a frequency of four hertz, whereas a human with perfect hearing can only detect frequencies above 20 hertz. It is thought that rhinos can also hear high pitched noises, because they sometimes make high whistles and giggles. The new study suggests that human noises such as mobile phone calls and traffic, put rhinos off breeding. It could lead to quieter, sound-proofed enclosures that may lead to more fruitful captive breeding programmes. They say that sound is preventing the animals breeding more than poor habitats, diet or diseases in zoos and safari parks. Rhinos are among the most difficult animals to breed in captivity. For example, only one rare Northern white rhino has ever been born in a zoo. But captive breeding programmes are desperately needed, because an increase in poaching means wild populations could be wiped out within a decade. Three species of rhinoceros are already endangered. Rhinos have one of the most sensitive hearing ranges in the animal kingdom, along with pandas, who also do not breed well in captivity, the experts told a US acoustic conference. It is thought that giant pandas have especially sensitive when they are pregnant. Lead researcher Suzi Wiseman and her team used sound detectors at a Fossil Rim Wildlife Centre in Texas to pick up noises like traffic and chatter that wouldn’t bother humans but may upset a rhino. Easily distracted: Rhinos have one of the most sensitive hearing ranges in the animal kingdom, along with pandas (pictured), who also do not breed well in captivity, the experts told a US acoustic conference . She said that the sound levels she monitored would be louder in urban zoos. ‘We can go into some zoos and think, this is delightfully quiet - but it might be that some animals don’t think it’s quiet at all, because urban areas have a lot of chronic infrasound,’ she said. The findings could be used by zoos to adapt enclosures with soundproofing and other methods of drowning out any man made noise that can be heard in enclosures to boost the chances of animals mating. ‘The soundscape is something that zoos need to consider and it’s something that can be improved,’ she added.","Traffic, mobile phones and humans talking could put rhinos off having sex .

"Coming to terms with a loved one’s death can be difficult and this has prompted one British council to offer bereaved families digital autopsies for free. A £1.2 million facility offering digital post-mortem examinations at no cost is the first of its kind and will open at the end of November. It will allow pathologists to conduct fully analyse dead bodies using a computer mouse instead of a scalpel and the results will be made available almost immediately. A new £1.2million facility, offering free digital post mortems is the first of its kind and will open at the end of November. It will allow pathologists to conduct full post mortems using a computer mouse instead of a scalpel and the results will be made available quickly. A scan of a body taken by an autopsy scanner is shown . In order to carry out the high-tech autopsy, the body must be scanned. Afterwards, using date form the CT scan, visualisation software creates a 3D image that can be manipulated on a computer screen. The process means that grieving families can understand a loved one’s cause of death without the need for a traditional post-mortem examination. The technology was created by iGene in Malaysia. The first UK centre was opened in Sheffield last year, but now Sandwell Council has said it will offer the service to families for free from November, at Sandwell Valley Crematorium, in West Bromwich in the West Midlands. In order to do the high tech autopsy, the body must be scanned. The CT scanner is pictured. Afterwards, visualisation software creates a 3D image that can be manipulated on a computer screen . The process of the digital autopsy means that grieving families can understand a loved one’s cause of death without the need for a traditional post mortem. A scan of a clothed body is shown. It is possible to pick out clothing details such as buttons as well as bones such as the ribs and internal organs such as lungs . A digital autopsy involves a scan of the body using a CT scanner. This creates thousands of image ‘slices’ across the body. iGene’s software creates a 3D reconstruction of the body that can be viewed on a computer screen. This enables a pathologist to conduct a full, non-invasive digital post mortem using a computer mouse instead of a scalpel. The results are available almost immediately. iGene says digital autopsies minimise delays in releasing bodies for burial or cremation and improve the accuracy of results. The authority is offering to pick up the £500 tab for all residents who want a digital autopsy - as long as the deceased lived in the borough. ‘It’s distressing enough to lose a loved one, but to then find out that a post-mortem [examination] is necessary can be extremely upsetting,’ said Mahboob Hussain, Sandwell Council’s deputy leader councillor. ‘The digital autopsy is non-invasive and the results are available quickly, which is going to be of real comfort to grieving families. ‘We’re proud to be the first council in the country to work with the private sector to offer this service free of charge to residents. ‘I feel it’s only right that bereaved families in Sandwell have the option to choose this incredible new technology without worrying about the extra cost.’ The computer software allows a pathologist to conduct a full, non-invasive digital post mortem using a computer mouse instead of a scalpel. They can manipulate the scanned image to get different views of a person's body. This view shows the bones and internal organs of a person, without any skin . ‘The digital autopsy is non-invasive and the results are available quickly, which is going to be of real comfort to grieving families,' said Mahboob Hussain, Sandwell Council’s deputy leader councillor. Two images showing the sort of images available using the service are pictured . Professor Peter Gaines, consultant radiologist for iGene, said that families using its existing sites in Yorkshire are already successfully avoiding a traditional post mortem. ‘We have scanned a number of cases at our Sheffield and Bradford sites, some referred by the coroners and others by families coming to us directly for peace of mind,’ he said. ‘We have been able to quickly establish the cause of death and allow the body to be released to the family for burial untouched. ‘Digital Autopsy stands to revolutionise centuries old post mortem practices, treating the dead with the same respect as the living and taking away one additional source of much anguish for their bereaved family.’ iGene is in discussions with a further 14 local authorities to open further centres across the UK. Their £3million facility which opened in Sheffield last year was the first of a £50million network of centres that will be operational across Britain by the end of 2015.","Sandwell Council in the West Midlands will become the first in Britain to offer cutting-edge digital autopsies to bereaved families for free .

"'A Marcel Proust for our time': French writer Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature today for work focusing on Nazi occupation of France . French writer Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature today for his work focusing on the Nazi occupation and its effect on his country. The Swedish Academy gave the 8 million kronor ($1.1 million) prize to Modiano 'for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation.' Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said of Modiano: 'You could say he's a Marcel Proust of our time.' 'He has written some 30 different books,' Mr Englund said. 'Many novels but also a number of children's books, movie scripts, and so on. But he's mainly knwon for his novels which are very specific. 'They are small books - 130 to 150 pages - which use variations of the same theme about memory, about loss, about identity, about seeking.' Mr Englund added: 'His best known work is called Missing Person. It’s the story about a detective who has lost his memory and his final case is finding out who he really is; he is tracing his own steps through history to find out who he is.' The 69-year-old - whose novel Missing Person won the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1978 - was born in a west Paris suburb in July 1945, two months after the Second World War ended in Europe. His father was of Jewish Italian origins and met his Belgian actress mother during the occupation of Paris, and his beginnings have strongly influenced his writing. Jewishness, the Nazi occupation and loss of identity are recurrent themes in his novels, which include 1968's La Place De L'Etoile, which was later hailed in Germany as a key Post-Holocaust work. Modiano owes his first big break to a friend of his mother's, French writer Raymond Queneau, who first introduced him to the Gallimard publishing house when he was in his early twenties. Modiano, who lives in Paris, rarely accords interviews. He has published more than 40 works in French, some of which have been translated into English, including 'Ring of Roads: A Novel,' 'Villa Triste,' 'A Trace of Malice,' and 'Honeymoon.' He has also written children's books and film scripts, including co-writing the 1974 movie 'Lacombe, Lucien' with director Louis Malle and the 2003 movie 'Bon Voyage' with director Jean-Paul Rappeneau. He was a member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000 and in 2012 won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature. Permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, Peter Englund faces the media in Stockholm, Sweden, as he prepares to announce French writer Patrick Modiano as the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature . Dervila Cooke of Dublin City University, author of a book on Modiano, said his works dealt with the traumas of France's past but have a 'darkly humorous touch.' 'His prose is crystal clear and resonant,' she said. 'A common description of his work is of its petite musique — it's haunting little music.' Mr Englund said Modiano's works often explore the themes of time, memory and identity. 'He is returning to the same topics again and again simply because these topics, you can't exhaust them,' Mr Englund told journalists in Stockholm. 'You can't give a definite answer to: Why did I turn into the person I am today? What happened to me? How will I break out of the weight of time? How can I reach back into past times?' Betting on Modiano to win the Nobel Prize surged in the week before the announcement, raising questions about a possible leak. David Williams of bookmaker Ladbrokes said Modiano's odds had shortened from 100-1 a few months ago to 10-1 before the announcement. Something similar occurred the last time there was a French winner, when Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio won the Nobel literature prize in 2008. The academy at the time suspected a leak. But Mr Williams said the betting pattern on Modiano was not suspicious. 'We are experts in analyzing betting patterns and we kind of know what a leak looks like. This doesn't look like a leak. It just looks like his fans got behind him and gave him a bit of momentum,' he told The Associated Press. Modiano in his study: Jewishness, the Nazi occupation and loss of identity are recurrent themes in his novels, which include 1968's La Place De L'Etoile, which was later hailed in Germany as a key Post-Holocaust work . Literature was the fourth of this year's Nobel prizes. Two Japanese researchers and a Japanese-born American won the physics prize for the invention of blue light-emitting diodes, a breakthrough that spurred the development of LED as a new light source. The chemistry prize on Wednesday went to two Americans and a German researcher who found new ways to give microscopes sharper vision, letting scientists peer into living cells with unprecedented detail. The announcements continue tomorrow with the Nobel Peace Prize and the economics award on Monday. The prize is named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and has been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace in accordance with his will. As always, the awards will be presented on December 10, the anniversary Nobel's death in 1896.

"If you are going to carry out an armed robbery, it is probably best not to put on your disguise in an alleyway covered by a CCTV system. Two inept robbers, who threatened a man with a gun in central London, are being hunted by Scotland Yard after being caught on camera as they lay in wait for him. The pair are clearly seen putting on their disguises before the robbery attempt in Shepherd's Market, in the capital’s upmarket Mayfair district in the early hours of the morning. Scroll  down for video . The two wanted robbers are seen here putting on surgical gloves, while one is holding a gun, in a Mayfair alley . One of the men, who covers his face with a green bandana and the hood of his jacket, is seen holding a gun behind his back. The robber is seen seconds earlier taking it from his waistband as he and his accomplice leave the alleyway and approach a nearby car. He was also seen putting on surgical-style gloves. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a 37-year-old man who was parking his vehicle was approached by two men, one of whom pointed a handgun at him and said: ""What have you got for me?"" The spokesman added: ""The man ran off and alerted police. No shots were fired and he was not injured."" At the end of the CCTV footage, which recorded the robbery at about 2am on October 19, the two men are seen fleeing the scene. The suspect with the gun is described as white and aged 18 to 21.

"Andy Murray advanced to the quarter-finals of the Western & Southern Open with a hard-fought victory over big-hitting John Isner. The 2011 champion was almost faultless for most of the first set but the wheels came off in the tie-break as Isner took the initiative. Murray produced the only break of the match to take the second, but the third went to another tie-break and the eighth seed made his class count as he closed out the match 6-7 (3/7) 6-4 7-6 (7/2). Close call: Andy Murray saved two match points to beat John Isner 6-7, 6-4, 7-6 in Cincinnati . On the mend: Andy Murray is still searching for his first title of the year following back surgery . The duo largely cancelled each other out in the first set, with Isner's big forehand return causing plenty of problems for Murray, but the Scot was easily out-classing his opponent at the net. Isner was making the early errors, finding the net every time Murray brought him short, but he produced a stunning backhand volley to win the fourth game. The rest of the set went with serve and Murray secured a mini-break on just the second point before moving 3-1 ahead. But Isner came roaring back, his big returns proving unplayable off Murray's second serve, and took the tie-break 7-3. The world number nine could have been forgiven for being shellshocked, but he delivered the perfect response by breaking Isner in the first game of the second set. Murray had two break points but Isner fought back before eventually succumbing to the first break of the match. The rest of the set went with serve, with Murray keeping his opponent at bay with little trouble as he closed it out. That pattern continued until the Briton double-faulted in the 11th game of the third to hand Isner match point, but once again his volleying let him down as he found the net. Small margins: Last year's runner-up John Isner only lost his serve once during the close defeat . Murray saw off another match point at 40-40, but then produced a sublime winner and an ace to take the game to a deciding tie-break. And the former US Open and Wimbledon champion proved too strong as two good returns forced Isner to find the net. The American 11th seed finished things off with a double fault. 'It was a big win for me,' Murray told Sky Sports 3. 'He plays extremely well here. 'Returning his serve, especially his second serve, in these conditions is very challenging so I did well to fight back. 'I felt like I played a very good match. I served well, I moved well, I was hitting the ball clean from the back of the court and when I was challenged at the end of the third set I responded well, that's important. 'It's all about winning right now, I don't really care how I play, I just try and keep getting wins.' Next up? Andy Murray could face former world No 1 Roger Federer in the quarter-finals . Murray was also full of praise for his opponent, whose big serve had caused the 27-year-old problems all match. 'He has the best serve,' he added. 'He serves huge first serves and the difference between him and the other guys is the second serve. 'Her serves quite a lot of second-serve aces, he gets good work on the second serve.

"Life after Luis Suarez got off to a stuttering start for Liverpool as they were made to work hard by Southampton at Anfield, before emerging victorious. Saints, who had sold three of their stars to Brendan Rodgers' side this summer, put up a strong fight, coming from behind with Nathaniel Clyne cancelling out Raheem Sterling's opener. But Daniel Sturridge struck from close range late on to give the hosts a winning start to the season. Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his opinion on the performances from both sets of players. VIDEO Scroll down for Rodgers: Sturridge has best 50 game record in Liverpool history . Opener: Raheem Sterling celebrates putting Liverpoool 1-0 up after a sumptuous ball from Jordan Henderson . Back on terms: Clyne smashes Southampton level giving Ronald Koeman hope of a point in his first game . Winner: England striker Daniel Sturridge pokes home Liverpool's second goal from close range . Liverpool  (4-2-3-1) Simon Mignolet – A couple of smart stops in the first half and, like last season, came to Liverpool’s rescue late on with a fabulous finger-tip stop to thwart Schneiderlin – 7.5 . Javier Manquillo – Made a few thumping challenges and showed a willingness to defend. Encouraging Premier League debut from the Spaniard, who will improve with games – 7 . Martin Skrtel – Played with experience and composure. Looking to form a solid partnership with Lovren, couldn’t get to Clyne with a last ditch tackle when Southampton equalised – 7 . Dejan Lovren – Given an acerbic reception by his old supporters but never paid any attention; a couple of robust challenges and some excellent long passing made this an impressive debut – 7 . Saving the day: Mignolet had to be at his best to deny Southampton, tipping one strike brilliantly onto the bar . Well-know opponent: Lovren was making his Liverpool debut against his former club . Glen Johnson – Facing a fight to maintain his position as a regular starter; made one crucial block to deny Ward-Prowse a certain goal but looked uncomfortable on the left flank – 5.5 . Steven Gerrard – Steady without being spectacular from the captain, never wasted a pass and had more of an influence when Lucas was replaced by Allen – 7 . Lucas – Chosen ahead of Emre Can for his experience but saw his afternoon end prematurely when replaced by Joe Allen after failing to exert a significant influence – 5 . Jordan Henderson – Played the pass of the match to set Sterling scampering away for Liverpool’s opening goal; his usual honest, energetic performance – 7 . Philippe Coutinho – A Brazilian with a number of gifts but this was an afternoon when he spent too long on the periphery, failing to provide any kind of service for Sturridge – 5 . Encouraging: Coutinho (left) showed few flashes of his quality, never really unlocking the Southampton defence . Raheem Sterling – Took his goal with great style and threatened to give Southampton nightmares with his speed on the counter; came up with the crucial head on to provide the winner for Sturridge – 8.5 . Daniel Sturridge – Got involved early, with a shot that fizzed wide and a shout for a penalty, but then disappeared from view for long spells, until popping up when it mattered – 6.5 . Southampton (4-2-3-1) Fraser Forster – Powerless to prevent either of Liverpool’s goals but wasn’t overly-worked on his Premier League debut. Didn’t have to make a save of note – 6.5 . Solid: Forster, who could do little about either Liverpool goal, beats away a shot from Sterling . Nathaniel Clyne – Full of invention and energy, took his goal with the confidence and swagger of someone with much more experience. Will be pushing for an England call on this evidence – 7 . Jose Fonte – Didn’t have his normal partner to back him up but made no difference; he carried on tackling and controlling Southampton’s defence, impressed with some hefty late challenges – 7.5 . Maya Yoshida – Perhaps lucky to get away with a silly tackle on Sturridge in the first half but, otherwise, wasn’t given a difficult afternoon by Sturridge – 6.5 . New Saint: Ryan Bertrand was one of eight new signings to make their debut at Anfield . On target: Clyne smashed home after bursting into the Liverpool box to draw Saints level . Ryan Bertrand – Honest and hard-working, he covered miles down the left flank. Couldn’t cut out the cross that ultimately led to Liverpool’s late winner – 7 . Victor Wanyama – Protected Southampton’s defence with great diligence, caused problems for Liverpool with his muscular aggression when he powered forward. Didn’t deserve to be on the losing side – 7.5 . Morgan Schneiderlin – No doubting his commitment to Southampton here; tackled relentlessly, covered miles and was desperately unlucky late on not to secure Southampton a point – 8 . Steven Davis – Will spend the next week running over the chance he fluffed in front of The Kop to give Southampton what would have been a crucial lead. His face told the story – 6 . Prolific: Vincent Wanyama made more successful tackles in the first half than the whole Liverpool team . James Ward-Prowse – Superb afternoon from the England Under-21 international, full of energy and invention. A number of fine set piece deliveries and kept running into dangerous areas – 8 . Dusan Tadic – Southampton look to have bought well, as he caused Liverpoolo trouble all afternoon and provided a magnificent back heel pass to Clyne. Standing ovation from away fans when he was substituted – 8 . Graziano Pelle – Struggled to make any kind of impression and was kept under a tight-rein by Lovren and Skrtel.

"Nigeria aims to secure the release by Tuesday of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamist Boko Haram militants, two senior government sources said today, although they declined to say where this handover would take place. Yesterday, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, the head of Nigeria’s armed forces, announced that a ceasefire had been agreed with Boko Haram that would allow the girls to be freed. The girls were taken during exams from the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April causing worldwide shock and revulsion and leading to the twitter #bringbackourgirls campaign. Scroll down for videos . The kidnapped schoolgirls are seen at an unknown location after being abducted by Nigerian Islamist rebel group Boko Haram . However, Boko Haram has not yet commented on the reported truce and last night and early this morning launched attacks on the villages of Abadam and Dzur killing at least one person at the former and eight at the latter. There have been a number of times since April when the Nigerian government has announced a ceasefire or even that it had rescued some of the girls, all reports subsequently proved false so the latest claim has been met with some scepticism in the country. The ceasefire announcement comes just before a rally in Abuja where President Goodluck Jonathan, or his vice president Namadi Sambo, is expected to announce his candidacy for the February 2015 elections. Fearful: More than 200 girls were seized from the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote town of Chibok in Borno state, northeastern Nigeria, in April, but dozens more managed to escaped . Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan (left)  is expected to announce his candidacy in next February's elections and Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau (right) whom the military last year said it had killed . One source told Reuters, the news agency, ‘I can confirm that [the federal government] is working hard to meet its own part of the agreement so that the release of the abductees can be effected either on Monday or latest Tuesday next week.’ However, a second source was more cautious, stressing that there might have to be more discussions in Nigeria and the Chadian capital N'djamena – the nearest non-Nigerian major city to the heart of the Boko Haram insurgency – before all the details are ironed out. ""We have confidence in those we are negotiating with but we are still doing it with considerable caution. Boko Haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could come up disowning the deal,"" he said. ""[But] we believe we are talking to the right people."" Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh (centre), the head of Nigeria’s armed forces, announced that a ceasefire had been agreed with Boko Haram that would allow the girls to be freed . The reason for his confusion is twofold.

"As the title winners Manchester City go toe-to-toe with FA Cup holders Arsenal at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, a glittering array of stars will be on show at the home of English football. From David Silva and Yaya Toure to Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sanchez, this will be a meeting of some of the finest footballers in the Barclays Premier League. But who comes out on top in the head-to-head battles? Sportsmail runs the rule over these two teams... Goalkeeper . Joe Hart . A shaky start to last season culminated in the England No 1 find himself on the bench for an extended spell in the winter. Turned out to be smart management by Manuel Pellegrini and Hart demonstrated his class in the second half of the season with several match-winning saves. Will face competition from new signing Willy Caballero, mind. England's No 1: Joe Hart got better as last season went on after a shaky start . Wojciech Szczesny . Last season, the Polish stopper eliminated much of the rash decision-making that had previously blotted his copybook to enjoy his finest campaign so far. All smiles: Wojciech Szczesny will hope Arsenal can build on their FA Cup triumph . Verdict: Joe Hart. A proven winner, having won two titles in three years, and a powerful voice in the Manchester City dressing room. Expect him to step up once more with Caballero in town. Right Back . Pablo Zabaleta . Relentless up and down the right flank, he is an immensely likeable character, firm in the tackle and a menace going forward. Offers a regular threat making those overlapping runs. Mathieu Debuchy . The summer signing from Newcastle always tend to appear to be a better player in the blue of France than the black and white stripes in the North East. Enjoyed an impressive World Cup but has work to do to convince in the Premier League. Strong at the back: Pablo Zabaleta pips Arsenal new boy Mathieu Debuchy to the best right back . Verdict: Pablo Zabaleta. Along with Philip Lahm, Zabaleta is seen as the finest full-back in world football and he’d walk into any team in the Barclays Premier League. Centre-Back . Vincent Kompany . The Belgian centre-half is City’s most important player. The captain – who is currently discussing a new contract – is an inspirational leader and an outstanding defender. Leader of men: Vincent Kompany guided Manchester City to the Premier League title last season . Calum Chambers . The new £12m signing will get his first experience of what it is like playing for Arsenal in a cup final. The test will be for him to keep the composure he showed at Southampton now that he is in the big time. Step up: Calum Chambers will be out to prove he can take his form from Southampton to Arsenal . Verdict: Vincent Kompany. Chambers is a talented young defender with plenty of potential but Kompany has proved for several years that he is the most complete centre-back in English football. Centre-back . Martin Demichelis . The Argentine struggled in his early days at Manchester City but has emerged through that tricky spell and demonstrated his credentials as an accomplished centre-half. Part of the Argentina side that reached the World Cup final. New look: Martin Demichelis is back at City with a new short back and sides after the World Cup . Laurent Koscielny . Koscielny’s more impulsive tendencies harnessed well with Mertesacker’s more serene approach last season. The Frenchman is quick, powerful and is also a threat at set-pieces. Getting stuck in: Laurent Koscielny and Olivier Giroud fight for the ball in training . Verdict: Laurent Koscielny. The 28-year-old has matured into an excellent defender under Wenger’s guidance and he only seems to be getting better. Demichelis’ lack of pace remains a concern, underlined by Manuel Pellegrini’s pursuit of Eliaquim Mangala. Left-back . Gael Clichy . Prone to the odd mistake and his concentration can lapse from time to time. Good energy and offers pace in the attacking third. Kieran Gibbs . The Englishman was one of Arsenal’s most consistent performers last season and if this country were not so blessed in the left-back position – Gibbs had to compete with Ashley Cole, Luke Shaw and Leighton Baines – he would have been a shoe-in for the World Cup in Brazil. Defending the left: Gael Clichy will come up against his former club and Kieran Gibbs . Verdict: Kieran Gibbs. With Ashley Cole now out of the picture, Gibbs can press for an England place and continue to star for Arsenal. Central Midfield . Fernandinho . The Brazilian was magnificent in his debut season, complementing Yaya Toure in the central acres and dominating the midfield. Incredible energy levels and sets the tempo. Interesting to see if he can recover his confidence after Brazil’s traumatic World Cup campaign. Commanding: Fernandinho (left) impressed during his first season with Manchester City . Welsh wizard: Aaron Ramsey had a good season before his injury last season . Aaron Ramsey . The Welshman emerged as the division’s best player in the first half of last season, scoring 13 goals before the end of November. An injury set him back in the second half of the season but reclaimed the spotlight with the winning goal in the FA Cup final against Hull. Verdict: Aaron Ramey. A difficult one but if Ramsey replicates the form he showed this time last year, Arsenal have one of the world’s most talented midfield players on their hands. Central midfield . Yaya Toure . Birthday cakes and summer shenanigans aside, Toure is the best midfielder in the country. He is a match-winner, scoring 24 goals as City won the title last season. Keep lighting those candles, City fans, because Yaya is irreplaceable. Pass master: Yaya Toure helped City win the Premier League title last season . Middle man: Jack Wilshere will hope to have an injury free season . Jack Wilshere . Career has stagnated after such a blistering start and the images that emerged of Wilshere smoking on holiday did little to correct the feeling that this player could be taking his opportunity more seriously. Has to score more goals and repay the faith that Wenger continues to show in him this season. Verdict: Yaya Toure. Wilshere’s most valuable asset is potential while Toure is proven at the highest level. Attacking midfield . Samir Nasri . His national team harshly overlooked the Frenchman for the World Cup, particularly after such an impressive campaign last season. City, however, have a very gifted footballer who has had a nice long break this summer. Former Arsenal man may feel he has something to prove to his old employers. Exile: Samir Nasri was left out of the France World Cup squad despite a good season for City . Big money move: A lot will be expected from Alexis Sanchez after his arrival this summer . Alexis Sanchez . The Chilean was one of the stars at the World Cup and represents a major coup for Arsenal. An explosive forward blessed with pace, skill and goals. Verdict: Alexis Sanchez. The former Barcelona man is the most exciting player to be signed by a Premier League club this summer. Expect Nasri to have another good season, though. Attacking Midfield . David Silva . The Spaniard is City’s conductor, pulling strings most players can’t even see. His touch is immaculate and his passing is deeply intelligent. Such a wonderful player to watch. On the attack: David Silva was key for City last season  and Mesut Ozil impressed in his debut season . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Oxlade-Chamberlain had a stop-start season last time around picking up a cruciate knee ligament injury on the opening day before returning in good form in January, only to be troubled by a groin problem at the end of the campaign. Verdict: As impressive as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain when injury free, you have to go for David Silva for his sheer consistency in a Manchester City shirt. Attacking midfield . Stevan Jovetic . Only made two Premier League starts amid a plague of injuries last season but he has been City’s star performer in pre-season and he believes he is now ready to become a key man. May get the nod over Sergio Aguero due to the Argentine's late return for pre-season. Back from injury: Stevan Jovetic made only just two Premier League starts last season due to injury . Bright future: Santi Cazorla has proved to be one of the more exciting players in the Premier League . Santi Cazorla . Arsenal have resisted interest from Atletico Madrid for the talented midfielder and he will light up the Premier League once more this season. On his day, Cazorla is a real joy to behold. Verdict: Santi Cazorla. Cazorla has proven himself in the Premier League over several seasons. The same cannot be said of Jovetic. Yet. Striker . Edin Dzeko . The Bosnian stepped up when Alvaro Negredo lost his goalscoring touch last season, hitting over 25 goals for Manuel Pellegrini to prove his importance to the City cause. Clinical finisher: Edin Dzeko has proved to be lethal in front of goal for City . Gunner be a star: Yaya Sanogo has looked good in pre-season for Arsenal . Yaya Sanogo . Arsene Wenger has suggested that this game may come too soon for Olivier Giroud. Sanogo scored four goals against Benfica last season after a tricky first season in the first-team last time out. Verdict: Edin Dzeko. The Bosnian is a clinical finisher and powerful in the air. Provides City with something different in the final third. Overall verdict . Manchester City 6-5 Arsenal .

"Chelsea had mixed success in their latest pre season outing - a Istanbul pre season tournament in memory of the Soma mining disaster - beating Fenerbahce but losing late on to Besiktas in two 45-minute matches. Diego Costa started both games and the £32million hitman scored a brilliant goal against Fenerbahce, beating four defenders to open the scoring before Branislav Ivanovic added a second. A defeat to Besiktas through Ersan Gulum's late goal denied them the title though as Besiktas came out on top. World Cup returners Andre Schurrle, Oscar, Willian and Ramires all made their first appearances of pre season as Jose Mourinho's side went back to winning ways after a 3-0 defeat at Werder Bremen. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fabregas, Luis and Costa singing in Chelsea initiations . Brilliant: Diego Costa scored a superb goal to open the scoring against Fenerbahce in Chelsea's opener . MATCH REPORT - BESIKTAS 1-0 CHELSEA . Ersan Gulum scored a late win to deny Chelsea the title in their pre season mini-tournament at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium. Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba was denied by Petr Cech before Gulum netted from the subsequent corner to condemn Chelsea to defeat. Didier Drogba came closest for the Blues, seeing a decent free kick effort knocked away by Cenk Gonen in the Besiktas goal. Downer: Ersan Gulum tucked home the winner late on for Besiktas to condemn Chelsea to defeat . Familiar sight: Didier Drogba goes down under a challenge from Gulum earlier in the game in Istanbul . Catch me if you can: Eden Hazard gets away from a pair of Turkish defenders on Friday night . Competitive: John Terry . Besiktas: Gonen, Franco, Sivok, Nukan, Kurtulus, Koybasi, Boral, Hutchinson, Ozyakup, Holosko, Tosun. Goal: Gulum 43. Chelsea: Cech, Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Luis, Matic (Mikel 44), Fabregas (Salah 36), Ramires (Torres 44), Hazard (Oscar 23), Willian, Costa (Drogba 23). Cech will have been disappointed for his part in the decisive goal - getting caught in no-mans land and being blocked off at the corner - allowing Gulum to stick the ball into the empty net. Before that former Blue Ba got away from Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill before Cech tipped his shot wide. In a game of few chances Diego Costa saw an early shot saved but Chelsea didn't create enough to merit the win leaving captain Terry to make the trophy presentation to their victorious Turkish opponents. Reasons to be cheerful: Jose Mourinho seemed in a better mood than after Chelsea's 3-0 defeat in Bremen . Boys from Brazil: Willian made his return from the World Cup and took on Oguzhan Ozyakup here . Disappointment: Oscar looks gutted as the Besiktas players celebrate winning the pre season tournament . MATCH REPORT - FENERBAHCE 0-2 CHELSEA . Diego Costa scored a brilliant goal to set Chelsea on their way to a win over Fenerbahce in a 45-minute Istanbul friendly as the Blues' £32million hitman continued his fine pre season form. Branislav Ivanovic doubled the lead with a follow-up to Andre Schurrle's free kick as Jose Mourinho's side took an early lead in the pre season tournament arranged to help the families of victims in the Soma mining disaster. And Petr Cech took a step ahead of Thibaut Courtois in the battle to be Chelsea's No 1, making a smart save and keeping a clean sheet - albeit for just a half - as his young Belgian rival missed out through injury. Impressive:  Costa opened the scoring with a brilliant goal against Fenerbahce . See you later: The Spanish striker evaded the challenges of four defenders to score in Istanbul . Blue boys: Cesc Fabregas jumps on top of Costa as his team mates congratulate him on the opener . Fenerbahce: Demirel, Topal, Sow, Meireles, Sahin, Alves, Kadlec, Potuk, Emenike, Gonul, Erkin. Chelsea: Cech, Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Fabregas (Mikel 39), Matic, Schurrle (Ramires 33), Oscar, Hazard (Salah 41), Costa (Drogba 35). Goals: Costa 24, Ivanovic 31. Schurrle, Oscar and Ramires all made their first appearances of pre season but Costa played the starring role as he warmed up to spearhead the Blues' Premier League title bid. Moving from a position on the left wing the Spanish centre forward turned one defender before escaped the attentions of three more before smartly finishing past Volkan Demirel after 24 minutes. And Ivanovic made it 2-0 later in the half, latching on to Demirel's parry from Schurrle's dead ball attempt. Oscar earlier had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside after latching onto Eden Hazard's through ball while Costa was lucky to avoid injury when Bruno Alves jumped in for a two-footed challenge but was only booked. Courtois was missing from the Blues squad after picking up a minor injury problem. Easy does it: John Terry congratulates Branislav Ivanovic on his goal which doubled Chelsea's lead . Finish touch: Ivanovic knocks home the rebound past Volkan Demirel to secure the win against Fenerbahce . Back in action: Brazilian midfielder Oscar made his return to the side after playing at the World Cup .

"George Perez, a former computer . programmer for Bernard Madoff who was convicted in March of . aiding his boss' massive Ponzi scheme, got support from a . noteworthy source this week: Madoff himself. In an email filed in Manhattan federal court by Perez's . defense lawyers, Madoff described a meeting in which he said he . told Perez and another programmer, Jerome O'Hara, that the . trading at his firm was legitimate. 'They (asked) if I was buying the securities that they . showed on the reports,' Madoff wrote from his North Carolina . prison, where he is serving a 150-year sentence. 'I answered, . 'of course' and explained that I had trading and custodial . arrangements with all the major investment banks in Europe and . the U.S. who traded with us every day.' George Perez is one of five ex-Madoff workers convicted in March of conspiracy to defraud clients, securities fraud and falsifying records. He’ll be sentenced next month, and his lawyers said the Madoff emails might sway the judge toward leniency . Madoff's email also attempted to excuse Jerome O'Hara. The email Madoff sent to one of the defense lawyers  claimed that the pair really didn't know what was happening . In the filing, the lawyers argued that Madoff's description . of the meeting undermined the government's thesis that Perez and . O'Hara were aware the reports they were creating for outside . auditors were based on fake trades. The two programmers were found guilty on all counts in March . along with three other former Madoff employees - back office . director Daniel Bonventre and portfolio managers Annette . Bongiorno and Joann Crupi - following a nearly six-month trial. Prosecutors have asked for more than 20 years in prison for . Bonventre and Bongiorno, more than 14 years for Crupi and more . than eight years for Perez and O'Hara. According to the email correspondence, Madoff reached out to . the defense lawyers and offered to provide information that . might help their cases. 'I assure you that my info in each of you clients (sic) cases is of great value and discredits the testimony provided by . frank D,' he wrote on Sept. 29 in an email with several . typographical errors, referring to the government's star witness . and his former deputy, Frank DiPascali. At trial, DiPascali testified about the meeting involving . Madoff, Perez and O'Hara that took place in September 2006. Since Madoff's fall, when he finally pled guilty to pocketing nearly $20 billion from his investors, many have been caught in the wake. Not only are his employees facing serious jail time, but his family has been shattered . According to DiPascali, the two programmers confronted . Madoff after expressing concerns they had given fake data to . government regulators. DiPascali claimed the men refused to continue creating data . reports and demanded additional pay, including a suggestion that . they be paid in diamonds. Lawyers for the two men have disputed that account, saying . their clients had legitimate concerns and that they accepted . Madoff's explanation during the meeting. 'In our view, the government's arguments in this regard have . no support in the record and are based on sheer speculation,' wrote Larry Krantz, a lawyer for Perez, in the court filing. Federal prosecutors have not yet filed a response. A . spokeswoman for the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet . Bharara declined to comment.

"Gwyneth Paltrow has had a tough time recently. Not only has she 'consciously uncoupled' from husband Chris Martin, but she's had to approve of his new girlfriend, Jennifer Lawrence. It is perhaps then unsurprising that the A-lister has been looking for alternative remedies to help her through her woes. The star, who recently claimed that water has feelings and called in a psychic to help her to ‘heal and expand’, has this week been seeking the advice of an acupuncturist. Alternative remedies: Gwyneth Paltrow has this week shared her views on acupuncture, which she says has helped her through 'many an ailment' Writing on her weekly Goop, the 42-year-old explains: 'One day, when being treated by an acupuncturist, a Spanish friend who was visiting me in London walked into the room and remarked that I looked like a bull who’d had a run in with the picadores (the dudes on horseback who stick the bull with many little knives to rile him up before the actual fight). 'I assured her that although I was stuck with needles, I was faring far better than the bull would in the analogous scenario. In fact, those many little needles have helped me through many an ailment.' The mother-of-two, who swears by a vegan diet and plenty of yoga, explains to her readers that Eastern medicine has a different approach to Western medicine because, she says, it’s more holistic. She said: 'The root of the problem is addressed, as opposed to a symptom being attended to with prescription medication, only to return. Don’t get me wrong, I am thankful as hell for a round of antibiotics or surgery when necessary, but I have been helped tremendously by all of the practices that help the body heal itself. When implemented by a professional with experience, the benefits can work wonders.' Clean living: The mother-of-two, who swears by a vegan diet and plenty of yoga, explains to her readers that Eastern medicine has a different approach to Western medicine because, she says, it's more holistic . The health aficionado also cites  goji berries with chrysanthemum flowers, which she brews into a tea and drinks to her calm her red, dry eyes, as one of her favourite alternative remedies. Explaining the bizarre treatment, the actress writes: 'Goji berries are all the rage now, Whole Foods sells them and I have even seen them covered in chocolate! (I do not recommend the chocolate-covered ones.) 'In fact, Goji berries’ health properties are greatly enhanced by cooking them five to ten minutes. Throw them into your hot cereal, soups or even tea. A very nice tea full of B vitamins (the natural way) is chrysanthemum and goji berry tea. Both of these foods happen to be good for the eyes as well.' The star tackles the dreaded time of the month cramps with a mug of ginger tea with raw brown sugar and swears by dry body brushing. Healing: Acupuncture is an ancient treatment first practised in China around 1,000 years ago. It arrived in Europe in the 17th century, but it's really only since the 1970s that there has been strong public interest in it . Despite their marital troubles, Gwyneth and Chris Martin have proved that they are still very friendly with each other, and are perhaps the most civilised ex-partners in showbiz. The two stars stepped out for dinner together with their family at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening, and shared an affectionate farewell as Gwyneth stroked Chris's face. Gwyneth and Chris - who have two children together, daughter Apple and son Moses - have been spotted together on several occasions since their split in March this year, although both have moved on to other relationships. Musician Chris, who organised Gwyneth's recent birthday bash, has been seeing Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence for a few months, and Gwyneth is reportedly seeing Glee's co-creator Brad Falchuck in August. Still pals: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have proved that they are still very friendly with each other, and are perhaps the most civilised ex-partners in showbiz, by eating out regularly together . An ancient treatment first practised in China around 1,000 years ago. It arrived in Europe in the 17th century, but it's really only since the 1970s that there has been strong public interest in it. How does it work? The traditional Chinese view is that energy - or 'Qi' - flows directly through 12 main channels, called meridians, in the body and if the flow is interrupted it can cause ill-health. Inserting tiny needles and manipulating them at 'trigger points' restores the flow of energy. It is believed the needles stimulate skin and muscle nerves, releasing the body's natural painkillers - endorphins and serotonin - into the pain pathways of the spinal cord and the brain to modify the way pain signals are received. It may also have beneficial effects on the nervous system, muscle tone, hormone production and circulation, as well as breathing, digestion and fertility. What is it used to treat? Some people have acupuncture to 'strengthen' their constitution. But it is commonly used for anxiety, asthma, arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, infertility, menstrual problems, migraines, rheumatism, skin conditions and ulcers.","Mother, 42, wrote about it on this week's Goop .

"Kimi Raikkonen is in trouble with Bernie Ecclestone for defying an order to respect the national anthem before the race. Raikkonen refused to join every other driver at the front of the grid for the playing of the Star Spangled Banner at last week’s US Grand Prix in Austin. His non-show has annoyed Ecclestone, who issued an edict last month calling for ‘total silence on the starting grid’ because ‘it has been alleged that F1 is one of the most ill-mannered sports in relation to the national anthem and complaints from fans, public and political institutions are now too heavy to ignore.’ Ferrari Kimi Raikkonen (left) walks around the paddock in Sao Paulo having been warned by Bernie Ecclestone over missing the US national anthem at last week's United States Grand Prix in Texas .

'He just didn't get one right, but you have to say he's going to have a World Cup hangover.'

"Manchester United are prepared to stump up £15million to beat Barcelona to the signature of Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen. Manager Louis van Gaal is anxious for more signings following the club’s return from their pre-season tour in America and wants to close deals for Vermaelen and Ajax wing back Daley Blind before his Premier League bow against Swansea City on August 16. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward accepts he will have to pay a premium price for Vermaelen however because Arsenal would prefer to see him go to La Liga than play for one of their Premier League rivals. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: Thomas Vermaelen could leave Arsenal . Swapping sides: Could Thomas Vermaelen be lining up alongside Manchester United this season? Familiar face: Vermaelen tries to block a shot from United star Robin van Persie . Barcelona have already made a £10million offer for the 28-year-old Belgian World Cup star but United have informed the London club they will top it. Vermaelen was officially Arsenal's club captain last season but played only seven Premier League games due to the form of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. He and the versatile Blind can also provide cover for left back Luke Shaw. Van Gaal wants transfer business both in and out the club to gather pace in the next fortnight. Targets: World Cup star Daley Blind and Vermaelen are both on United's list this summer . The Dutchman pointed out at his unveiling that he had approved rather than initiated United’s first two summer signings Ander Herrera and Shaw. United made their third capture, teenage Serbian goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic, but Van Gaal wants to improve the balance of the squad, needing more defenders to play his preferred 3-4-3 formation following the departures of Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra. A move for Borussia Dortmund’s highly-rated midfielder Marco Reus is likely to have to wait until next year when his £20million buy-out clause kicks in. On the lookout: Louis van Gaal wants to add more signings to his squad before the season starts on August 16 . VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . United’s tour players can expect to find about their futures from Van Gaal when they return to training on Friday. Van Gaal has given the squad two days off after travelling nearly 15,000 miles across America but plans to work them hard physically on their return. He has also promised the players to let them know who he wants to keep, and who are surplus to requirements and will either be sold or loaned out. After a final rest day on Thursday, the players have been told to report to the Aon training complex at the end of the week with Van Gaal preparing to make his decision on the likes of Shinji Kagawa, Javier Hernandez, Wilfried Zaha and Michael Keane. Marouane Fellaini and Anderson are also expected to be allowed to leave. They have been training all week with Fellaini given time off after the World Cup and Anderson suffering an injury that caused him to miss the tour to America. Uncertain future: Marouane Fellaini could leave Old Trafford before the transfer window closes . Several of United’s former greats including Champions League winners Pau Scholes, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole will pull on the red shirt again in Munich on Saturday in a match between Bayern All-Stars and a United legends team.

"James Noble, 25, was the captain of the Ocean Way which disappeared in the North Sea yesterday . A sailor who died after his trawler got into difficulty in the North Sea was the boat's captain according to rescuers. The 45-year-old skipper, who has been  named as James Noble from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, was airlifted to hospital by RAF helicopters yesterday but later died. Two other men - aged 32 and 38 - are still missing after the Ocean Way vessel ran into problems off the Northumberland Coast, but the search operation has now been called off. The two survivors, men aged 38 and 28-years-old, were taken to Wansbeck Hospital in Northumberland suffering from hypothermia and have been released following treatment. Apart from Mr Noble, the four crew members are said to be Filipino, according to reports. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said nothing had been found in the search for the remaining men. A statement said two helicopters and merchant vessels had been searching throughout Sunday afternoon and evening but were unable to find any sign of the two missing crewmen. 'The search will not resume,' said the statement. A search and rescue operation was launched for the missing skipper and crew of the fishing trawler Ocean Way after it began transmitting a mayday signal early on Sunday afternoon. In total three people were rescued from the water, including the captain, Mr Noble. An RAF rescue helicopter was dispatched to the scene while a Norwegian chopper was also sent to help with the search. The Humber Coastguard said the vessel, based at Fraserburgh, was last heard from about 100 miles east of the Farne Islands. The boat, which had sailed from Tynemouth, began transmitting an emergency beacon and attempts were made to contact the skipper. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said: 'We are greatly saddened by this tragic news and our heartfelt thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of the crew at this very difficult time. 'This terrible accident highlights the very real dangers our fishermen face on a constant basis and is a sober reminder of the important role fishing plays in putting food on our plates.' Scotland's Fisheries Minister Richard Lochhead said: 'I am very sorry to hear about the loss of the Fraserburgh registered fishing vessel the Ocean Way that has tragically resulted in fatalities. 'This is a terrible tragedy and my thoughts are with the loved ones and friends of the crew. The trawler, based at Fraserburgh, was last heard from about 100 miles east of the Farne Islands . Three people were winched from the sea - two have survived and another two are still missing. The search has now been called off . 'This tragedy will be felt by all fishing communities and is a horrible reminder of the dangers our fishermen face day in day out to bring fish to our tables with many paying the ultimate sacrifice. 'I would like to pay tribute to all the personnel involved in the rescue operation.' A spokesman for the MCA said yesterday that none of the rescued sailors were wearing lifejackets. She said the whereabouts of the boat was unknown and refused to be drawn on speculation it had sunk until the outcome of further investigations. The Coastguard have been broadcasting mayday relay messages requesting all passing shipping to look out for the missing crew. It is believed the boat set sail from North Shields on Saturday and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating the incident. The Ocean Way had reportedly sailed out of Tynemouth with four Filipino crew and a British skipper. File photo .

"Manchester City have confirmed that they have finally landed Eliaquim Mangala from Porto, with the player adamant he's ready to win trophies immediately.

'For me, it was an important step to leave Porto and join Manchester City in order to continue my progress. I want to win titles and I believe I can do this. I am ambitious and this is why I am here.

Pellegrini said: 'I'm delighted to have added a player of Eliaquim's quality in the squad ahead of the new season. 'He is already a fine player but in my opinion, he has all of the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe's very best defenders.

"Researchers have found that teenage boys tend to make riskier decisions than girls or adults. When confronted by a threat they found it more difficult to ignore than others due to increased emotional activity in their brains. The study suggests that boys are unable to stop themselves responding to a threat, even if they are told not to. Scroll down for video . A Florida researcher has found that teenage boys are most likely to take risks. When faced with a threat their brains have more emotional activity. This makes them more likely to respond to a threat - even if told not to. The findings were vastly different from those in other children and adults . The research was led by Pradeep Bhide, a Florida State University College of Medicine neuroscientist and director of the Center for Brain Repair. Together with Cornell University, he examined 20 leading research projects from brain experts on teenage brains. And he says a large amount of their behaviour could be explained by their brain development - or lack thereof. ‘I think teenage behavior is probably the most misunderstood of any age group - not only by parents but by teenagers themselves,’ said Bhide. Scientists have found out why some teenagers are prone to taking huge risks as well as seeming antisocial. Research from the Center for Brain Health at The University of Texas at Dallas found that connections between certain brain regions are amplified in teens more prone to risk. 'Our brains have an emotional-regulation network that exists to govern emotions and influence decision-making,' explained the study's lead author, Sam Dewitt. 'Antisocial or risk-seeking behavior may be associated with an imbalance in this network.' ‘It's a critical time in life, and a very stressful one, when they are going through so many changes at the same time that their brains are changing. ‘The teen years are actually a very busy time for brain development.’ When confronted by a threat teenage boys showed enhanced activity in the part of their brain responsible for emotions, unlike children and adults. This made supposed threats difficult to ignore, and often led to an irrational response. Some have suggested that such risk-taking may have once been a necessity from an evolutionary standpoint for hunting. Teenage brains were also found to be less adept at recognising faces, and were also more susceptible to lasting damage from drugs and alcohol.

"A water-main break on Friday sent churning, muddy water flowing down West Hollywood's Sunset Strip, forcing authorities to close a section of the busy street to traffic as hotels and other businesses sought to keep their properties dry. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was determining what valves needed to be closed to shut off the flow of water, which was spreading into surrounding streets. No injuries were reported.

Residents were instructed to avoid the area for feat that the water could unexpectedly 'knock people off their feet,' according to officials. The break occurred in a 36-inch steel, riveted pipe that was constructed in 1916. The pipe was coated with cement in 1957 to prolong its life, department spokesman Joe Ramallo said. There were no reports of customers losing water service, Ramallo said. It was the second time in recent months that Sunset Boulevard — a traffic artery in and around Los Angeles — has been closed by a flood created by a broken water main. In July, the rupture of a nearly century-old water main ripped a 15-foot hole through the boulevard and turned a swath of the University of California, Los Angeles into a swamp. Hundreds of cars and campus buildings were damaged by that break. On average, the Department of Water and Power's aging water system has three breaks a day in 7,200 miles of piping. Friday's break, which created a steady spout of water along a sidewalk, occurred shortly after 2:30 p.m. Los Angeles County firefighters were going door to door to make sure no one was trapped by the water. Water also spilled onto nearby Santa Monica Boulevard, although that street was not immediately closed. Metro buses scheduled to drive on Sunset Boulevard between North San Vicente Boulevard and North Fairfax Avenue planned to detour onto Santa Monica Boulevard, reported KTLA.

"Operagoers walked a gauntlet of protesters calling for the cancellation of an opera that dramatizes the killing of a Jewish American on opening night Monday. Former mayor Rudolph Giuliani was among the public figures appearing at a rally  against The Death of Klinghoffer, a 1991 opera by John Adams, at the Metropolitan Opera. On stage, actors depicted the 1985 hijacking of cruise ship Achille Lauro by four militants from the Palestinians Liberation Front, leading to the killing of wheelchair-bound New Yorker Leon Klinghoffer. Scroll down for video . Gauntlet: Protesters on both sides of barricades outside the Met held signs denouncing the production of the Death of Klinghoffer as operagoers entered . Some in the crowd booed after the opening piece, 'Chorus of Exiled Palestinians,' in which the destruction of a Palestinian's home is mourned, followed by the 'Chorus of Exiled Jews.' During the first half, a man in the audience repeatedly yelled, 'The murder of Klinghoffer will never be forgiven,' and after the intermission a woman shouted an expletive and walked out. The New York Times reports that the man was arrested for disorderly conduct. But the evening ended with a standing ovation that drowned out any heckling. 'There are obviously some people who came here to be heard, and unfortunately they’re disrupting the performance, but we were prepared for worse,' said Peter Gelb at intermission. Gelb, the Met's general manager, was a target of the protesters outside, who waved signs suggesting he took money from terrorists. For some critics of the work, the juxtaposition of Israeli abuses with the cruise ship hijacking is meant to absolve the terrorists depicted in the opera. Sit in: 100 protesters sat in wheelchairs facing the Metropolitan Opera in protest of the production of the Death of Klinghoffer . Indignant: Hundreds of protests filled police barricades, conflating the production with the Met dignifying terrorists . Attacked: Met general manager Peter Gelb was a subject of the protests, which also conflated the PLO with ISIS and other terror organizations . Klinghoffer's daughters, Lisa and Ilsa, have publicly decried the opera, which has debuted in several cities and is often hailed as a masterpiece of American opera, as making 'false moral equivalencies.' 'It rationalizes, romanticizes, and legitimizes the terrorist murder of our father,' reads a statement by the daughters printed in the Playbill of the new production. Ari Mandel, a New York University student attending his first opera told Haaretz the play was 'not doing any of that.' Murder: The opera dramatizes the murder of Klinghoffer, when a terrorist executed him and threw his body into the water off a cruise ship . Voices: The main terrorist, Omar, has an aria in the opera, but it is sung by a character called the Palestinian Woman, played in the Met's production by Israeli opera singer Maya Lahyani . Dramatization: The opera depicts the Palestinian Liberation Front holding the ship hostage, but gives voices to the individual characters . 'They don’t soften the blow,' Mandel said. 'They’re not trying to make the terrorists look like anything other than what they are.' The production was originally planned to be accompanied by a live high-definition broadcast in November, but drew protests from Jewish groups. After talking with the Anti-Defamation League, the Met decided to cancel the broadcast, saying it might be used to fan global antisemitism, according to the Guardian. The characters do not allow the killers to go without rebuke. As the play ends, the audience watches Klinghoffer's wife Marilyn being told her husband has been killed by the captain of the ship. 'You embraced them,' she sings in the final aria, condemning both her husband's killers and the captain for accommodating them.","The Death of Klinghoffer has been controversial since it was first performed .

"Sitting alongside Louis van Gaal in an air-conditioned annexe of Miami’s stiflingly humid Sun Life Stadium in the early hours of Monday morning, Ashley Young spoke positively about Manchester United’s pre-season tour of America and life under his new manager. During what has amounted to a five-game trial, Young is one of those players who has persuaded Van Gaal that he has a future at Old Trafford, operating as a wing-back in the Dutchman’s 3-4-1-2 formation. Others have not been quite so successful, however. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Javier Hernandez miss an absolute sitter for Mexico . Judgement day: Louis van Gaal insists he will let his players know after tour whether he wants them or not . Back in the fold? Luke Shaw points to Ashley Young after the winger's star performance against Real Madrid . Hanging in the balance: Wilfried Zaha in action against Inter Milan in Maryland last week . VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . Guided by the intelligence he received from his Dutch coaches Albert Stuivenberg and Marcel Bout at Carrington while he was away at the World Cup, and convinced by what he has seen here in the US, Van Gaal has wasted no time drawing up a list of the players he wants to keep and those he does not. It will be presented to United chief executive Ed Woodward later this week, when plans will be put in place to get those who have failed to make the grade out of the door as soon as possible. Van Gaal is not someone who likes to hang about. Marouane Fellaini . Signed: August 2013, £27m from Everton. League apps: 16 . Goals: 0 . How much: United expect to take a hit and want £20m but will do well to get £15m. Who’s interested: Napoli but not at the asking price. A subsidised loan suits them. Shinji Kagawa . Signed: June 2012, £12m from Borussia Dortmund. League apps: 38 . Goals: 6 . How much: United will look to get around £8m-£10m. Who’s interested: Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp loves Kagawa. Atletico Madrid are keen too. Cash in: Atletico Madrid and former club Dortmund are keen on Kagawa, with £8m-£10m the price . Wilfried Zaha . Signed: January 2013, £15m from Crystal Palace. League apps: 2 . Goals: 0 . How much: United would do well to raise £10m and may prefer to send him on loan. Who’s interested: QPR, Crystal Palace, West Ham and Newcastle would risk it. Nani . Signed: July 2007, £19m from Sporting Lisbon. League apps: 146 . Goals: 25 . How much: A new five-year deal raised his value last season but price will be around £12m. Who’s interested: Juventus, Inter Milan, Valencia and Arsenal still rate the Portuguese. Anderson . Signed: July 2007, £20m from Porto. League apps: 104 . Goals: 5 . How much: United are struggling to find takers even at a knockdown £5million. Who’s interested: Clubs in Portugal and Brazil have shown interest but little else. Down south: Hernandez could leave the club for around £8million, with Spurs and Southampton interested . Javier Hernandez . Signed: July 2010, £6m from Guadalajara. League apps: 101 . Goals: 37 . How much: £12m would be the Mexican’s ideal price but United expect closer to £8m. Who’s interested: Juventus and Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Tottenham and Southampton. Big ask: Marouane Fellaini has a lot to prove in a United shirt after a poor campaign under David Moyes . Out the door: Javier Hernandez (left) and Shinji Kagawa (right) could be sold by new boss Louis van Gaal . Nani, Anderson, Marouane Fellaini, Shinji Kagawa and Javier Hernandez are those most under threat. Wilfried Zaha, whose future at United appeared bleak, is battling to win another chance at the club. ‘I shall make judgments after this tour,’ said Van Gaal when quizzed about his plans as United prepared to face Liverpool in the International Champions Cup final overnight before flying straight home. ‘I have let all the players play and I now know more than before the tour. ‘Now, also, it is a little bit soon to judge, but in football you have to judge. You have to give the player a chance to make a transfer when I see that his prospects to play are not so high. You have to say it in advance, because it’s too late after August 31. I will tell players after the tour but to them, not to you.’ Atletico Madrid are actively pursuing Hernandez and Kagawa, who also continues to be linked with his former club Borussia Dortmund. Van Gaal admits he has too many midfielders capable of operating in the No 10 role that he has given to Juan Mata, and the Japan star appears to be the odd man out. Exit: Anderson, who was on loan at Fiorentina last season, is likely to leave Old Trafford . Meanwhile, any suggestion that Hernandez had impressed his manager by scoring in Saturday night’s 3-1 victory over Real Madrid in front of a record 109,318 fans at Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor, was quickly snuffed out by the Dutchman. ‘I think the striker has the biggest chance to score, so that it is not the reason why a player plays,’ said Van Gaal in response to a question about the Mexico striker. ‘We are playing as a team and the team scores. I don’t make individual evaluations because we are playing with a team, not individual players.’ The form of Young and Antonio Valencia in the wing-back roles has convinced Van Gaal that Nani is also surplus to requirements, although offloading a player who only signed a new five-year deal last September may prove a problem with interest from Inter Milan and Juventus waning this summer. Any hope Anderson had of persuading the new manager that the stories about his perpetual lack of fitness were untrue quickly disappeared when he went down with a calf strain two days into the initial strength and conditioning tests at Carrington last month. All smiles: Young (second right), who seems to have impressed Louis van Gaal, laughs with Tom Cleverley (left) The Brazilian, who spent last season on loan at Fiorentina, has hardly been seen since. Zaha did not get off to the most auspicious of starts either. When the players were offered an ‘optional’ training session on the third day of pre-season, everyone turned up in the hope of impressing the new regime — except him. However, it is understood that Van Gaal sees potential in converting the winger into a fourth striker if Hernandez is sold and he may give Zaha another chance. Of all the players whose futures at the club are in jeopardy, Fellaini can perhaps count himself as the most unfortunate. A much-derided symbol of the David Moyes era, the Belgium midfielder has not even been here on tour to fight for his future. He only reported back from World Cup duty last week but the decision has already been made and he will move to Napoli if the two clubs can strike a deal. On a roll: United have had a successful tour of the US, and will look to carry momentum into the season . United want to recoup as much as they can of the inflated £27.5million fee paid to Everton for Fellaini a year ago but at this stage, Napoli are only interested in taking him on loan. Offloading so many players will not concern Van Gaal, who is known to prefer working with a smaller first-team squad, and he still hopes to make more signings before the end of the month. Centre back remains a priority following the departures of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, with Dortmund’s Mats Hummels and Arsenal’s Thomas Vermaelen the main targets. A new left back is required to replace Patrice Evra, despite the costly recruitment of Luke Shaw, and Van Gaal would also like another midfielder. It has been suggested that Moyes’ indecision over players cost the club dear last summer, but the same certainly cannot be said of his successor as United arrive home on Tuesday. The tour is over, the decisions have been made. The Van Gaal revolution has begun.","Ashley Young seems to have impressed new boss Louis van Gaal .
