"By . Stephanie Linning . A British family cheated death on Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 after they were bumped off the doomed plane when they arrived at check-in. Barry and Izzy Sim were planning to travel to Kuala Lumpur with their young baby but were told by staff at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport that there were not enough seats on the plane. Mrs Sim said that there 'must have been someone watching over' them as they were switched to a later KLM flight - just hours before MH17 was shot down in an 'act of terrorism'. Scroll down for video . Escape: Barry and Izzy Sim were due to fly on doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 with their young baby but were bumped off after being told that there were not enough seats . Doomed: Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 taking off from Schiphol airport today. Barry and Izzy Sim were due to be on the flight with their young baby . They were due to board the Boeing 777 aircraft which left Schiphol airport at lunchtime today. Just hours later it exploded into flames as it was hit over territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian rebels. All 283 passengers and 15 crew on board were killed. Nine British passengers have been confirmed as among the dead. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph about his reaction to the crash, Mr Sim, from Scotland, said: 'You get this sick feeling in the pit of your stomach... We started getting butterflies. Your heartbeat starts going.' Mrs Sim added: 'There must have been someone watching over us and saying ""you must not get on that flight"".' The couple, who described themselves as loyal customers of Malaysian Airlines, said that they were 'so glad' not to have been put on the plane. Mr Sim told the Daily Telegraph he now felt 'philosophical' about what had happened and believed that the couple should take the KLM flight. Tribute: A woman lights a candle in front of the Embassy of the Netherlands in Kiev on Thursday night to commemorate passengers of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 . In memory: A young girl places her head on a teddy bear as people light candles and place flowers in front of the Dutch Embassy in Kiev . Anguish: A man sobs as he leaves Schiphol airport on a bus provided for the families of passengers travelling on MH17. Relatives gathered at airports in Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur . He added that his wife does not feel the same way as she is wary of the danger of another crash. On Thursday airlines were advised to cease flights over the region – and faced questions as to why commercial jets had been flying over what is effectively a war zone. Last night there was speculation that flight MH17 had taken a short-cut across the disputed region of eastern Ukraine to save fuel. Dutch authorities have said that at least nine Britons, 154 Dutch, 27 Australians were among the dead. The nationalities of 41 people on board have not been confirmed. Earlier it was feared that 23 Americans had perished based on a Reuters report, but there has been no confirmation of any U.S. deaths since then from the State Department.

Crash site: Rescue workers inspect the wreckage of a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane which was shot down today above Ukraine, killed all 298 people on board . Laying the blame: The Ukrainian authorities laid the blame for the attack on the rebels by denying any responsibility for the missile launch, with President Petro Poroshenko called the downing an act of terrorism . In April, the International Civil Aviation Organisation advised carriers to consider alternative routes after outlining ‘the possible existence of serious risks to the safety of international civil flights’. On Monday, Eurocontrol – the body that coordinates all traffic across European airspace – sent out an official note to airmen, known as a Notam, repeating the warning and saying it ‘strongly advises’ avoiding the airspace. But many carriers continued to use the route because it was shorter and therefore cheaper.","Barry and Izzy Sim planned to fly to Kuala Lumpur with their young baby .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Syria may be in the grip of an unrelenting civil war with its murderous regime facing the threat of impending American intervention, yet on the Syrian Presidency’s Instagram account the county’s first lady is attempting to paint a very different picture of her county. The social media platform is being used by the regime as a sickening propaganda tool as they attempt to sell a lie to the outside world that all is well. The main stooge in this shameless PR exercise is the president’s wife Asma al Assad who it seems is all too willing to try and mask the horrific atrocities being carried out by her husband’s forces. Shameless propaganda: The Syrian government posted this photo op, left, featuring the country’s first lady on Wednesday, while in reality men inspect a site hit by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad . Different worlds: This photo of the President and his wife was posted on the Syrian Presidency’s Instagram account on July 30, the same day that Bashar al-Assad’s forces carried out this attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus . Even as photographic evidence emerges from the country showing what Assad’s regime are doing to his people, the Instragram account attempts to sell an alternative version of events where the president’s wife is photographed smiling as she hugs old women and ladles out soup to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers. In reality the photographs show that British-born Asma al-Assad has become a Marie Antoinette figure, completely out of touch with what is really going on in the country. In some photographs recently posted on Instagram, she is shown wearing a new blue Jawbone UP on her right wrist – a device designed to help wearers keep track of how many steps they take and calories they burn. The Instagram account was opened in July in what an apparent attempt to win back favor across the globe, but it didn't take long before it backfired. In a tasteless photo op: Asma al-Assad ladles out soup to starving refugees wearing her expensive exercise bracelet in this August 4 photo, while the same day a boy stands next to a barricade set up by the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo . No one smiles: British-born Asma al-Assad reaches out to a clearly uncomfortable girl on August 11, while elsewhere in Syria a woman carrying a bag of bread exits a bakery run by the Islamic rebel group ‘Ahrar Al-Sham’ The staged publicity shots are fooling very few and although some users have comment on Mrs al-Assad's 'beautiful soul,' the majority are less forgiving. 'I love ur designer clothes and shoes... paid for by the blood of your people! Seriously, u make Marie Antoinette look like an angel compared to you!,' wrote one Instagram user. Others comment on the 'hypocrisy' of Mrs al-Assad being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two-year Syrian war. To date, more than 100,000 men, women and children have been killed and nearly two million Syrians have fled the country since the conflict started in March 2011 . But as millions have fled the fighting to neighboring states, the Syrian regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life-as-normal image for the President and his family. President Bashar al-Assad attempts to maintain an air of respectability on July 28, while at the same time his forces patrol in the battle-scarred Khalidiyah neighborhood of the central city of Homs . Asma al-Assad has become a Marie Antoinette figure out of touch with what is really going on. She is pictured on Instagram embracing an old woman on July 31, while a member of the Free Syrian Army carries an injured civilian after shelling by forces loyal to her husband on the same day . Nadim Houry, deputy director for Human Rights Watch in the Middle East and East Africa, said Al-Assad's Instagram account was something different to previous leaders like the deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. He said: 'I think it is a generational thing, I am not aware older leaders like Mubarak and Gaddafi used social networking, but the Syrian regime has always been keen to show a business-like image to the world. 'I am not surprised by this account, but it is a parallel between the regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality for the people subjected to the bombs, arbitrary arrests, human rights abuses and violence. 'Bashar Al-Assad is not going to show the millions of people displaced, it's not going to show attacks on civilians.' Photo opportunity: Asma al Assad hands out supplies in this July 24 Instagram image, while boys look at a pool of blood belonging to one of ten victims of shelling at Bustan Al Qasr carried out by forces loyal to her husband on the very same day . The Syrian Presidency’s Instagram account attempts to portray an alternative reality where Bashar al Assad appears presidential such as in this August 8 photo, but meanwhile a Free Syrian Army fighter uses a mirror to monitor the movements of the president's forces elsewhere as the civil war rages on . Amnesty International UK Syria campaign manager, Kristyan Benedict, said: 'On one level you'd have to say that it's not surprising to find any government, even the rigid and oppressive one in Damascus, using social media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view. 'Image obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative stability is important in President Assad's ""love me or I'll kill you"" strategy. 'Naturally, we'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in Syria - of the torture chambers or places of execution. Seeing the Assads in hospitals only reminds you of the fact that Syrian government hospitals have been used as places of torture. 'No amount of photos or tweets or Facebook posts will ever wash away the stain on the Syrian government's record.'

Variety: A range of different ingredients limits Sensory Specific Satiety, or SSS. This is why, no matter how much we like what we're eating, it quickly stops tasting fabulous if we eat too much of the same thing. Turkey: a nutritional wonder-food. Being high in protein means turkey regulates digestion and stabilises insulin levels. Turkey is also an excellent source of Omega 3 Fatty Acid, which protects against heart disease and may also safeguard against depression. A 150g serving of roast turkey also contains 158 per cent of the recommended daily intake of an essential amino acid called L-Tryptophan. As well as reducing your appetite, and so preventing over-eating, this breaks down serotonin and melatonin, making it easier to remain cool, calm and collected in the face of Christmas Day's excitement. Potatoes: L-Tryptophan's benefits only come into effect if the turkey is digested with carbohydrates - which is where the potatoes come in. The body also converts carbohydrates into glucose, releasing insulin and pushing nutrients to the heart, liver and other organs. Vegetables: As well as containing vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, the vegetables in the perfect Christmas dinner are high in fibre, helping to ensure that guests feel fuller for longer. Sweet: The sweet cranberry sauce releases a cascade of powerful 'reward' substances in the brain, such as dopamine, serotonin and opioids - the latter providing an exhilarating natural high. Umami: The Japanese word for 'simply delicious' is one of our five basic tastes, and is found in vegetables such as red cabbage, as well as in the turkey itself. Texture: The fat in the gravy, together with the range of textures from crunchy roast potatoes to soft stuffing, helps enhance the 'mouth feel' of the meal, which is key to our enjoyment of it. Pudding: The contrast between the slightly salty umami of the main course and the sweet and savoury flavours of the pudding tells the brain that we are 'full', stopping us from overeating. Both Christmas pudding and mince pies also have a hint of cinnamon, which can stop blood sugar levels from fluctuating and may help lower cholesterol levels. Fruit: Ending a meal with fresh fruit can round the meal off on a healthily enjoyable note, leaving guests feeling happier and with more energy for the rest of the day - and even Boxing Day as well.","Created by food psychologist, Dr David Lewis Dr Margaret Yufera-Leitc .

Mr Burrows said his family was struggling to understand how they could be struck by such horrible luck on two separate occasions with the same airline. 'She just lost a brother and now a stepdaughter, so...' he said of his sister as his voice trailed off. Marie and her husband Albert, from Melbourne, were returning home from a four-week holiday in Europe, said Phil Lithgow, president of the Sunbury Football Club, with which the family was heavily involved. Mr Rizk, a real estate agent, was a member of the club's committee, and his wife was a volunteer in the canteen and their son, James, plays on the club's team.

"By . Emma Thomas . A dog allergic to dog food enjoys a meal of specially-cooked food every day - costing his doting owner thousands. French Bulldog Blake is fed chicken, sweet potatoes, salmon and brown rice every day because of his intolerance to ordinary dog food. Owner Preeti Young, who is a professional model, eats her meals at the same time as Blake and often prepares the same meal for them both - at a cost of £1,800 per year on food for the allergic hound. Pampered: Preeti Young, 24, with her French Bulldog Blake, 14-months-old, and twin sister Priya. The dog joins them at the table for his special meals . Cute: Blake comes up in a rash if he eats normal dog food so owner Preeti cooks him special meals every day . Blake comes out in a rash if he eats tinned or dry food so Preeti, 24, makes him cooked meals. She said: 'He loves it. 'I coordinate our meals and make his dinner at the same time as mine. 'Ever since I put him on human food he has been fine and had no problems. My vet said it’s fine.' Blake even joins Preeti and her twin sister Priya at the dinner table for meals. She spends £5 a day on Blake’s special diet and even makes him a packed lunch if he has to go out. 'It is way more expensive that buying dog food. A big bag would last ages, but I buy fresh chicken, sweet potatoes and all his other favourites.' She added. 'I probably spend about £10,000 a year on him. I am quite an extravagant person. Most people who know me would expect this kind of thing from me. It’s only the people that don’t know me that think it’s weird. My friends just laugh. It’s just the sort of person I am. 'I don’t mind spending that on him - he is worth it. I have to do it,' Preeti, from Brentford, west London, added. 'Everyone thinks I am a bit extreme with my dog. I adore him. If I have to go out I will cook his food and make him a little packed lunch.' Preeti discovered Blake’s dog food allergy when he was five-months old after a trip to the vets when he couldn’t stop scratching himself. The 14 month old pup comes out in an itchy rash every time he goes near normal dog food. He scratched himself so much once his skin became infected, leaving him with painful sores all over his body. Tests by a dermatologist showed the canine was allergic to beef, lamb, cow's milk and even barley, so owner Preeti Young decided to test him on a diet of human food. She explained: 'It was getting too much. It was pretty horrible when he was scratching all the time - it was quite distressing to see. Pedigree Chum 1/2 can 36pDry biscuits (25g) 25pTotal: 61p . Chicken breast £1.50Sweet potato 50pTotal: £2 per meal . Special diet: Blake enjoys meals of chicken breast and sweet potato instead of ordinary dog food . 'I took him to the vets who ran blood tests which showed he had some allergies to beef, lamb, cow’s milk and barley so I cut all those things out of his diet and bought different dog foods but he was still scratching so I took him to a specialist dermatologist. 'They said his initial blood test was probably done a bit early and he hadn’t developed anti-bodies, so I just tried cooking for him one day. 'I researched it and read on the internet to try not feeding him dog food and it has worked wonders.' Blake also enjoys Quorn sausages as part of his daily diet but is still happy to chew on a bone. Preeti Young, 24, with her French Bulldog Blake, 14 months old, and twin sister Priya. Preeti says her vet told her Blake was allergic to normal dog food . 'I still buy him bones for his teeth and other dog treatments,' Pretti added. 'He is healthy and his coat is nice and shiny. 'He is much happier now and is very outgoing.' Deputy veterinary director from the Dogs Trust Runa Hanaghan said the number of dogs with allergies is increasing. She said: 'Dogs can get allergies from quite commons things that humans can get as well. 'Blake has quite a serious problem there. We are seeing more and more allergies in dogs but may be we are understanding them more as well. We are able to help more now with allergies in dogs and we will test for them. 'There are lots of different types of allergies. 'They aren’t simple cases they never are. Every individual dog is different and it’s important to make sure people take their dogs to the vet.'

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Kansas City sports writer who took his own life yesterday morning sparked a treasure hunt for gold coins after leaving what appeared to be GPS coordinates on a website. Before Martin Manley killed himself outside Overland Park police station, he set up a website that many believed suggested his $200,000 collection of gold and silver coins had been hidden. Details of the alleged hoard were revealed on a local radio station, leading several people to go in search of the money, according to Gawker. Hoax: Sportswriter Martin Manley caused a treasure hunt for gold after his website listed coordinates on the day he died . Trail: The coordinates led treasure seekers to Oakland Park Arboretum . However, family of the former sports statistician of the Kansas City Star said he gave the money away before his death, and police also confirmed the treasure hunt was a hoax. As treasure hunters started to dig around Overland Park Arboretum, the park was forced to close. In a statement it said: 'This morning sparked quite the treasure hunt. Overland Park Police have spoken with the family of the victim and they indicated that the victim had purchased gold but had given it away.' It added: 'The alleged ""buried treasure"" is a hoax. Please be mindful of this and that the Overland Park Arboretum does not allow digging.' Radio station 96.5 The Buzz fueled . the search, reading excerpts of Mr Manley's website live on air and . encouraging listeners and one of their team, 'Mark the Overseer' to go on . a treasure hunt. Sealed off: As rumors about a stash of gold circulated police were forced to bar entry to the park . Updates: Members of a radio station joined the search and tweeted details of their journey . Watch: The park had to be closed as people armed with shovels started to turn up . Through Twitter Mark and other treasure hunters, some armed with shovels, sent updates and pictures as they followed the coordinates to the arboretum. The . morning show presenters excitedly egged listeners on as they called in . updating the station on their hunt while the hosts speculated on Mr Manley's life. Coordinates were listed on Mr Manley's . website, which was seen by Mail Online, but he made no reference to his . assets being hidden. They were listed under a paragraph, with no explanation, as Mr Manley wrote: 'I sold my house which was completely paid for in 1998. The same year I bought $30,000 in 1/10 ounce gold coins and pre-1965 silver coins. Gold was $300/ounce when I bought it and silver was $4/ounce. Gold went up to $1,700 and Silver to $44 making my stash worth over $200,000.' He then listed the coordinates, which led to Overland Park arboretum. Clue: A member of the radio show tweeted a picture of a flag in the undergrowth, asking 'what does it mean' Mr Manley, who died on his 60th birthday, had worked as a sports reporter on the Kansas City Star until February last year. He had been married and divorced twice, and had two step-daughters. Editor at the Kansas City Star Mike Fannin said: 'Martin was a terrific guy and a good employee.

A prankster had monster-ous fun ahead of the opening of blockbuster Godzilla, by programming a road sign to warn drivers that the creature was attacking San Francisco. The electronic sign was set up last week to flag potential delays caused by a fun run, but instead the ominous messages ‘Godzilla Attack’ and ‘Turn Back’ were displayed. The joke messages appeared just before Godzilla stomped all over the competition by taking top spot at the box office at the weekend, raking in $93.2million.

The U.S. Air Force’s largest combat wing based at Kadena Air Force Base in Japan is ready to see off Godzilla, according to a set of interviews conducted by the Smithsonian Air & Space Magazine.

'We . can deploy a team quickly and use the guns on board to provide some . much needed fire power. We would probably need to use all the F-15 . fighter jets we have here along with the rapidly deployable Cobra . helicopter gunship aircraft,' SnR Herman confidently says. 'Using our 50mm guns, four kilos of ammo with eight guns and 600 rounds a piece, it's got to do something, right?' Master Sergeant Jason Edwards says Kadena base is the keystone of the Pacific because of their strategic location. 'Should . Godzilla come to Japan, we are prepared,' he insists. However, Msgt .

Rachel Shoaf, along with her friend Sheila Eddy, lured Neese out of her house in July 2012, before stabbing her multiple times and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania wood. Did she know too much? It has been suggested that Skylar Neese, 16 (left), was killed in 2012 by her friends Sheila Eddy and Rachel Shoef (right) because they feared she would tell about their lesbian tryst . 'Dark secret': Skylar allegedly wrote in her diary (pictured) that during a sleepover in her house she walked in on Sheila and Rachel having sex together . Taunt: In June 2012, Skylar sent out this tweet, possibly reminding her friends that she knew about their sexual relationship . Skylar may have sealed her fate with a couple of tweets alluding to a secret she had been keeping . It was not until six months later that the accomplices finally confessed to the savage murder and led officers to the remote location where Skylar's body had been concealed. When interviewed by police, Rachel, a high school drama star, told investigators that she and Sheila stabbed Skylar to death because they no longer liked her as a friend. But according to a new book 'Pretty Little Killers,' which details the horrific murder, the girls may have been scared that Skylar was planning to out them as a lesbian couple. The lesbian affair theory has been detailed by the authors of the new book 'Pretty Little Killers' This theory was repeated on Friday's episode of 20/20 on ABC dedicated to the shocking case. In her diary obtained by authors Daleen Berry and Geoffrey Fuller, Skylar Neese reportedly wrote in graphic detail about walking in on Sheila and Rachel having sex during a sleepover in her home. And in the weeks after the incident, the 16-year-old University High student apparently made sure her friends were aware that she knew their secret. 'Just know I know,' Skylar tweeted on one occasion, while on another she wrote about her desire to tell 'everything' to everyone - if she thought she could get away with it. However, neither Skylar’s parents nor police investigators have embraced the idea that Shoef and Eddy murdered Skylar in cold blood just to stop her from speaking out about their alleged sexual tryst. Mary Neese, Skylar’s mother, told ABC’s 20/20 that her daughter had many gay and lesbian friends, and she would not have taunted  someone because of their sexual preference. On their part, investigators involved in the case got the impression from their interactions with Shoef and Eddy that the teens stabbed Neese ‘for the thrill of it’ and to see if they could get away with murder. When they finally confessed to the crime long after Skylar's disappearance, the two accomplices said they had planned the friend's murder in science class, discussing in detail which weapon to use and where to hide the body. Before that fateful night on July 6, Shoef and Eddy bought cleaning supplies and tools for digging. The girls then stashed several knives in their hooded sweatshirts and drove to Skylar's home, according to police. Eddy and Shoaf . lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and took her . to a secluded spot across state lines to Pennsylvania. Dismayed: Skylar's parents, Mary and Dave Neese, said in the days after their daughter's disappearance, Sheila came to their house looking distraught and asked to sit in her friend's room . All smiles: This photo was allegedly taken just a day after the murder showing Rachel (right) looking carefree at the beach with a friend . The . trio spent some time smoking marijuana in the woods. When Skylar got up to grab a lighter, Shoef and Eddy trailed her with knives at the ready, and . on count three they began stabbing her. The 16-year-old tried to run away, by Rachel tackled her to the ground, and one of the teens then slashed her jugular vein. All along, the . plan was to bury Skylar's body, but the ground proved too hard. So, according to authorities, the girls covered their murdered former friend . with branches and left her in a wooded area for months. As Skylar's distraught parents, police and the entire community were frantically searching for the missing girl, Sheila kept up a disturbingly normal social media presence. On July 7, 2012, just a day after she and Shoaf killed Miss Neese, Eddy tweeted a 'happy birthday' message to a friend. Eddy kept up a steady stream of . tweets about watching Law And Order on TV, doing homework and going to . parties, according to the new episode of ABC's 20/20 that aired Friday. She . also tweeted about how close her friendship was with Shoaf, writing: . 'no one on this earth can handle me and rachel is you think you can . you're wrong.' But away . from social media, Sheila played the role of a heartbroken friend, . going to the Neeses' home to spend time with her parents. In retrospect, what stood out – and . horrified - Skylar’s parents the most is the time when Eddy came over and asked . to sit on the missing girl’s bed. Tribute: Sheila Eddy posted this tribute to Skylar Neese (on the left in each photo) on Twitter in March 2013 before being arrested for her murder . Eddy posted this message months after she and friend Rachel Shoaf murdered 16-year-old Skylar Neese . In the 20/20 interview, Mrs Neese . described how her daughter’s killer wept in Skylar’s room. The mother even sat down next to her and comforted her, gently rubbing her back. ‘Oh my Lord, and we believed that garbage,’ Mrs Neese said. Dave Neese added: ‘Skylar trusted those two little witches and it cost her life.’ When . investigators questioned the Neeses about their daughter’s circle of . friends, Dave Neese asked police to leave Sheila alone. From one . police interview to the next, Shoef and Eddy repeated the same version . of events, insisting that they did not take Skylar on a ride away from . Star City on the night the went missing. The first clue came when police obtained surveillance . video from the night of July 6 showing Sheila's car driving away from the town towards the Pennsylvania border, which directly contracted Shoef and . Eddy’s perfectly rehearsed story. Sheila Eddy volunteered to take a . lie detector test, which police said she failed. When it was Rachel’s . turn to face the polygraph, the high school drama star jumped out of her . father’s moving car on the way to the test. Cold-hearted: The girls told police they just didn't like Skylar anymore . Duplicity: Mary and Dave Neese welcomed Sheila Eddy into their home after Skylar's disappearance and even comforted her as she sobbed in her 'friend's room . Meanwhile, the Neese . family and the girls’ friends started putting pressure on the duo to . come clean about the night of Skyler’s disappearance. In January 2013, six months . after Skyler vanished without a trace, 16-year-old Rachel had a nervous . breakdown and had to be sent to a psychiatric hospital. Upon her . release, she headed straight to police. ‘The first words out of her mouth were, ‘”We stabbed her,”’ an investigator working the missing person case recalled. A few days later, Sheila Eddy was back on Twitter, posting messages about watching her favorite TV shows. In March, authorities announced that the remains found belonged to Skylar Neese. Even then, Eddy was still keeping up the act. She posted a picture montage of the girls together with the message: 'Rest easy Skylar, you’ll ALWAYS be my best friend.' She then tweeted that it was the 'worst day of my whole life'. For a time, Eddy refused to cooperate with the investigation. Police decided to . put a wire on Rachel hoping to incriminate her accomplice, but Sheila . said nothing during their encounter. Eddy tweeted this message shortly before her arrest for the murder of Skylar Neese. Fellow murderer Rachel Shoaf had already admitted to police that the girl's decided to count to three and then stab the 16-year-old . Eddy posted a stream of inane messages to her Twitter account in the months after she fatally stabbed her 'best friend' Skylar Neese . Eddy posted happy birthday greetings to a friend the day after she and Shoaf murdered Skylar Neese and left her body in the woods . Days after Rachel Shoaf admitted to killing her friend Skylar Neese along with Eddy, the latter was back on Twitter posting messages about TV . A break in the case came when police officers found traces of blood in Sheila . Eddy’s car. A DNA test confirmed the blood was Skylar’s. That same day, Eddy was arrested in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant in front of her mother. On March 30, 2013, just before she was taken into custody, Eddy tweeted: 'We really did go on three.' Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced in January to life as part of a plea agreement that makes her eligible for parole after 15 years. Shoaf, 17, pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder in the July 2012 slaying. She'll be eligible for parole after 10 years. During . her sentencing, a tearful Rachel read a statement from the stand . apologizing to Skylar’s parents, but Mary and Dave Neese did not believe . a word she said. Rachel Shoaf pleaded guilty to murdering her friend Skylar Neese in July 2012 for no apparent reason other than she didn't want to be friends with her anymore. She was sentenced to 30 years in March (pictured) Sheila Eddy, pictured in court in October, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her friend in March this year . ‘You don’t apologize for murdering somebody in cold blood,‘ the father told 20/20. Eddy refused to address the court . other than to say 'guilty' - something that Mr Neese found 'unacceptable' at the time. Dave Neese now only has one thing to say to his daughter’s killers: ‘Rot in hell.’ Sheila and Rachel could be released from prison on good behavior by the time they are in their 30s.","Rachel Shoaf, 17, of Morgantown, West Virginia and her friend, Sheila Eddy, lured 16-year-old Skylar Neese from home, stabbed her to death and dumped her body in the Pennsylvania woods .

"By . Rosie Taylor . While many families are worrying about how to afford Christmas this year, one jobless single mother has revealed she receives so much in benefits she has £2,000 to spend on designer gifts, clothes and partying. Mother-of-two Leanna Broderick plans to buy 20 presents for each of her children, including Burberry and Ralph Lauren outfits, iPads and gold jewellery. The 20-year-old, who has never worked, claims nearly £15,500 a year in state handouts. Want for nothing: Leanna Broderick (pictured centre with Zelekah, left, and Zakirah) has revealed she receives so much in benefits she has £2,000 to spend on Christmas . Expensive: Miss Broderick is planning on buying iPads and gold earrings among other gifts for her daughters . She claims she is better off on benefits and would not get a job unless she could continue her luxury lifestyle, which includes designer outfits, holidays abroad, clubbing, lunches out and expensive gifts for her daughters Zelekah, two, and Zakirah, one. ‘Last year, I saved £2,500 and my kids had 50 presents each, including Burberry and Ralph Lauren clothes and dolls, DVDs and CDs. ‘This year, I’ve saved £2,000 and they’ll get 20 presents each, including iPads and a new Disney-themed bedroom to share, with designer wall art and bed linen,’ she said. She is also buying gold earrings for Zelekah, who has pierced ears, and keeping £300 for the sales and £150 for a New Year’s Eve outing. Miss Broderick, who left school at 16 with no GCSEs, said: ‘I don’t care if people get annoyed. I don’t take advantage, I just choose to save – it’s smart.’ She said there was ‘no point’ earning less in a minimum wage job and having to pay for childcare on top. After becoming pregnant at 17 with her on-off 23-year-old boyfriend, Miss Broderick was allocated a temporary three-bed council house. Leanna Broderick's interview appears in the Christmas issue of Closer . When Zelekah was eight months old she considered working in care, but then became pregnant again by the same man. Now split from the girls’ father, she has a new two-bedroom council flat in Croydon, South London, with a garden, which is paid for by her £111 weekly housing benefit – part of £1,290 a month total claim. She said: ‘I didn’t want to miss out on my kids’ childhoods or have someone else raise them. I’m not one of those girls who gets pregnant for the benefits.’ The money for Christmas comes from the £250 she saves each month, which she said shows she is ‘really responsible’. She adds: ‘Anyone who thinks people on benefits don’t deserve nice things is talking rubbish. I work 24/7 as a mother. ‘This way, taxpayers know I’m raising two well-brought-up kids.’ But she admits Christmas might not be so lavish next year because of the Government’s benefit cuts. ‘I’m not against the cuts, but only if the Government helps me find a job,’ she said. ‘In the meantime, I’ll stay on benefits and get as much as I can out of it.’ The full feature appears in Closer Christmas issue, on sale now or go to www.closeronline.co.uk .","Leanna Broderick plans to give children designer outfits, iPads and jewellery .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Two incredibly well-preserved Neolithic tridents discovered in northern England have gone on show to the public for the first time. The pristinely preserved wooden tridents, which measure around six feet in length, were each crafted from a single plank of oak almost 6,000 years ago. They could be among the earliest farming tools used in Cumbria but no-one is entirely sure what the tridents were used for. The perfectly preserved wooden tridents, which measure around six feet in length, were each crafted from a single plank of oak almost 6,000 years ago . The perfectly preserved wooden tridents, which measure around six feet in length, were each crafted from a single plank of oak. Carbon dating has shown that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old, when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in the area . The tridents could be used for farming, hunting or fishing. Fraser Brown, of Oxford Archeology North believes they are not curved enough to be a kind of pitchfork and are too heavy and unbalanced to be a fishing spear. He thinks they could have been used to pin fish to a river bed, while another man collected the catch in a basket. The tridents are made from mature oak and required a great amount of skill and time to make them. They survived intact for so long as they were buried in waterlogged deposits, which kept the air out and stopped them rotting. Four almost identical tridents are known of and another two might have turned up in Ireland. The tools were . discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations . prior to the construction of the Carlisle Northern Development Route . (CNDR) near the village of Stainton. Carbon dating has revealed that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old, when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in the area. However, while they may well be agricultural tools and bear some resemblance to pitchforks used for turning hay, experts believe the tridents could have been used for hunting or fishing. Fraser Brown, of Oxford Archeology North, who oversees the project, told MailOnine the tool appears to be too over-engineered to be a simple fishing spear - which were usually made of light, narrow strips of wood with a bone or flint tip so they could be thrown easily - while wood with a natural curve was usually chosen for pitchforks. The tridents discovered are heavy and made of mature oak. 'It would have taken a massive effort to fell a big oak tree and split it into planks with hand axes and then carve the trident using stone tools - that's hours of work,' he said. 'Nothing fits very well so we think the trident had a very specific purpose.' Some experts believe the tools could have been used for fishing, but instead of an individual throwing a simple spear, a trident was used to 'wedge' salmon or eels to the floor, while another man collected the large fish in a basket. They also think it could have been used to stretch and hold a net across a stream, but the fishing connection would seem to be logical as the river Eden, where the tridents were found, is still known for its excellent salmon fishing. The tridents survived intact for such a long period of time as they were buried in waterlogged deposits which, according to an archaeologist from Tullie House Museum, kept the air out. Just four similar tridents have been found in the UK and all of them were unearthed the in 19th century, Archaeology.org reported. Carbon dating has shown that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old, when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in Cumbria. However, experts believe the tridents could have been used for fishing or hunting as well as for farming . The latest discovery adds to the mystery surrounding the finds in Cumbria and Northern Ireland 200 years ago. All the tridents have near identical designs and show a proficiency in woodworking suggesting they were made for an accepted purpose, experts said. The newly-discovered tools have gone on show at the Tullie House Museum, which is encouraging visitors and social media followers to give their theories for what the tridents might have been used for. Two of the other tridents, which are displayed at the British Museum, were found in Ehenside Tarn, Cumbria, while the other two were plucked from a bog in Armagh, Northern Ireland. However, Mr Brown said  another couple of tridents discovered many years ago in Southern Ireland might have come to light recently as a result of the publicity surrounding the 'new' Neolithic tools. The tools were discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations prior to the construction of the Carlisle Northern Development Route (CNDR) near the village of Stainton . So far, the tridents have only been found in areas that suggest an Irish Sea distribution, he said, hinting that their design might have evolved to suit a relatively local purpose. Mr Brown said that archaeologists have also found insect and pollen traces as well as preserved wood and seeds, which could give them a better picture of the valley environment in which our ancestors lived. He said that groups of people were still fairly mobile at the time but were starting to cultivate the land by planting seeds and probably keeping cattle. They lived in valleys and woodland composed of Oak, Hazel and Elm trees and at the time the trident was made, the number of oaks declined, perhaps indicating that people started clearing trees and used them make tools and shelters. The tridents were discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations prior to the construction of the Carlisle Northern Development Route . No houses were found near the site where the tridents were discovered, but there is a henge monument around 150 metres away, said Mr Brown. The archaeologists hope to learn more about the site and whether there are other similar tridents in private collections that could help them with their research. Mr Brown said that the tridents discovered could even be 1,000 years older than currently thought.","The wooden tridents, which were discovered in Cumbria, measure around six feet in length and were each crafted from a single plank of oak .

"In the future, computer hackers could steal sensitive data from people’s computers using nothing but soundwaves, experts have warned. German computer scientists have proved the idea is possible by developing a new type of malware  that can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to unsuspecting humans. Using built-in microphones and speakers in laptops, the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts of data between machines 65ft away from each other. Computer hackers could steal sensitive data from people's computers using nothing but soundwaves (illustrated), experts have warned. Computer scientists used built-in microphones and speakers in machines to pass passwords between machines 65ft away from each other . The terrifying feat was achieved by . computer scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, . Information Processing and Ergonomics in Germany, The Huffington Post reported. The researchers warned: ‘Acoustical networking as a covert communication technology is a considerable threat to computer security.’ The finding is of huge concern to computer security firms that currently isolate important machines which have no internet connection, using ‘air gaps’ to protect them. Until now it has been thought that these computers would be safe from hackers but the new research, published in the Journal of Communications, casts doubt on this idea. The researchers wrote: 'In our article, we describe how the complete concept of air gaps can be considered obsolete as commonly available laptops can communicate over their internal speakers and microphones and even form a covert acoustical mesh network.’ The computer scientists started investigating the idea of hacking computers using sound by imagining how tech savvy criminals might gain access to the most secure of machines. The researchers chose to used high pitched sounds, inaudible to humans, and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a Lenovo T400 computer to transmit keystrokes from one machine to another. The technique could be used to pass small data files, and passwords between machines, they said . They noted that in the past hackers have . used ‘parts of the operating system that were not considered for . communication’ to gain access to sensitive data'. Consequently they came up with a hack using sound to steal data from ‘air gap’ protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data between target computers and the ‘hacker’ machine. The researchers chose to use sounds that are too high pitched for humans to hear and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a Lenovo T400 computer to transmit keystrokes from one computer to another. The technique could also be used to pass small data files passwords and encryption keys between machines, they said. While in the experiment, they only managed a data rate of 20 bits per second, the slow rate is still enough to transmit passwords and could no doubt be improved upon in time. The experiment passed data between computers positioned 65ft apart but the scientists believe the range could be expanded using ‘mesh networks’ to transmit sound over long distances, enabling hackers to attack from afar.","German computer scientists transmitted passwords between two machines using soundwaves that are inaudible to humans .

Sadie Bell, 58, a woman from Southfield, Michigan, was convicted in April of shooting her partner Edward Lee, 60, in the stomach with a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic handgun. She was convicted of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, plus a felony firearms charge. Bell told police that she was angry at Lee for failing to produce enough ejaculate after coitus, leading her to believe that he was sleeping with another woman. The catch, according to authorities, is that Bell and Lee had themselves been carrying on a 15-year affair. Lee was married to another woman. Mugshot of Sadie Bell, the 58-year old woman who shot her lover after he failed perform adequately during sex. Bell was freed on $10,000 bond last week, pending the results of an appeal filed on her four year prison sentence . According to the police, the July 28, 2013 incident unfolded when the two had sex, then argued and began to shove each other. Bell then went into the bathroom, came out with the handgun and shot him. 'She stated that she knew he was having an affair because he wasn’t producing enough ejaculate,' Chief Assistant Prosecutor Paul Walton told CBS Detroit. 'She also said to the police some very graphic things about how she expected him to perform, she was a cheap date, she liked sex, she expected him to be able to do what he’s promised; and she said, in essence, to quote her, she was pissed off, so she shot him.' Lee survived being shot, but spent five weeks in the hospital recovering. He underwent major surgeries to repair damage to his liver, pancreas, colon and kidney. This was not the first time Bell was arrested for violence against a lover. In 1991, she was arrested for allegedly shooting another man, her husband. She was not convicted of any crime in this instance, and her husband refused to testify against her. The same man also refused to testify in the more recent case.

'She’s a danger to the public and she should . be held accountable for her actions.' According to court documents, Bell's counsel believes that her case will be overturned, due an alleged violation of Bell’s right to effective assistance of counsel related to her decision not to testify on her behalf during the trial.

She then emptied out Mr Bawler’s trolley of trays of bargain value baked beans, spaghetti, rice pudding and tinned potatoes and then put most of it back on the shelves. Reiss Bawler was purchasing tinned baked beans, spaghetti, rice pudding and potatoes to send to starving children in Syria when Aldi staff stopped him and told him they had 'other customers to think about' The keep fit instructor was buying the bulk canned goods to send to children in war-torn Syria, after he was horrified to hear stories about hungry locals eating cats. Despite Mr Bawler’s protests he was told he could only buy £15 worth of good before being asked to leave the supermarket in Blackburn, Lancashire. It is thought the Aldi manageress feared Mr Bawler would snap up so many cheap items and other customers would not be able to get their weekly shop as the shelves would be empty. 'The woman said she had to look out for her other customers - but am I . not a customer too? It sounds to me that Aldi were too lazy to re-stack . their shelves even if it lost them money and meant that much needed food . didn’t get sent to starving children. Mr Bawler said he was 'absolutely godsmacked' and was something he would expect  'during war time rationing'. 'Regardless of whether the food is for charity or not, surely the point of a supermarket is to sell their goods and I was buying. I’m sure buying a few trays of tinned food is not going to clean a firm of the size Aldi.' The bizarre incident occurred after Mr Bawler had already spent around £100 of his own money in the same Aldi 24 hours earlier and then £120 in a rival Lidl store. Horrified to hear stories of starving children in war-torn Syria forced to eat cats, Mr Bawler decided he would help out by sending tinned goods to the country - he rattled up a £150 bill filling up his trolley twice . He said: 'I was buying stuff to send over to Syria. I am not from there and never really knew anything about the situation but two weeks ago I started seeing all this stuff about these poor children going without food and had to resort to eating cats. 'For me that was utterly shocking and I thought I would get as much cheap tinned food as I could to send it over there. It was nothing to do with religion. 'On the second occasion I was loading up my trolley with trays of tinned food when this woman comes running up the aisle in a store manager's uniform. 'She said: ‘I am not having this.' I said, ""Excuse me?"" She turned and said: ""you have been spoken to before."" I had come into this Aldi twice and never been spoken to. She said: ""I have spoke to you lot before"".' 'I had no idea what she meant but she started emptying my trolley and said I could leave with what she left in which was two trays of beans and two lots of new potatoes which wouldn’t even be worth £15.' He said he left the store 'utterly embarrassed and confused'. 'I phoned the Aldi complaints line straight away and they said they were going to deal with it in-house but I’m still waiting for an apology. Aldi declined to comment.","Reiss Bawler was buying tinned goods to send to starving children in Syria .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Taxi driver Richard O'Brien has been jailed after admitting sexually assaulting a 94-year-old client in her care home in Cumbria . A taxi driver who abused a 94-year-old woman every time he collected her from her retirement home has been jailed after admitting sexual assault. Richard O'Brien, 58, specialised in driving elderly people to hospital appointments and helping them do their shopping and advertised his services on a business card which bore the slogan 'Peace of mind - piece of cake.' But he was arrested after a 94-year old woman who used his taxi services told police he had been sexually assaulting her at the care home she lived in in Cumbria. Officers installed a secret spy camera in the frail woman's flat, and within days O'Brien was caught on film abusing her. Today O'Brien, of Carlisle, pleaded guilty pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual assault and an unrelated offence of fraud and was jailed for two years. Cumbria Police had told Carlisle Crown Court that for years, O’Brien had marketed his taxi services towards pensioners. He built up a client base from the most vulnerable members of the community and transported frail elderly people on behalf of a local charity. O'Brien's business card read: 'Are you a senior citizen or physically or medically disabled - I can help you to be more independent. I will see you safely on the train or bus and meet you on your return. 'Richard’s private hire will get you there.' The victim was introduced to him in 2001 when she was living alone, and he ran errands for her including trips to the supermarket to do her shopping and take her to medical appointments. When she could no longer live independently she moved into a retirement property, and O’Brien used her move as a chance to ingratiate himself on other residents, handing out his business cards and offering his services. He would ring the intercom of a resident to gain access to the home, and would get in to assault the 94-year old without staff on duty realising he was there. 'Peace of Mind? Piece of Cake!' O'Brien's business card was specifically designed to attract vulnerable clients . O'Brien's card offered help with doctor and hospital visits, trips to the supermarket and odd jobs at home . Police were alerted after she complained, and in August 2012 a camera was placed in her sitting room. Within days of its installation O’Brien was caught on camera sexually abusing the elderly woman. Police also discovered that he had fraudulently withdrawn more than £4,000 of his late uncle’s pension payments. Today Detective Constable Carolyn . Willacy, from Cumbria Police, said: 'This kind and gentle lady has . suffered regular degrading assaults over a long period of time. 'This kind and gentle lady has suffered regular degrading assaults over a long period of time.  Due to frailty of body and mind she was unable to defend herself against his abuse.' - Detective Constable Carolyn Willacy, Cumbria Police . 'Due to frailty of body and mind she was unable to defend herself against his abuse. 'O’Brien pleaded not guilty until the morning of trial, which caused further distress to those taking part in the trial. 'There is no excuse for his horrific crimes and the lasting impact they will have on the victim and her family.' A Cumbria County Council spokesman said: 'This dangerous man has deliberately targeted the most vulnerable people in society causing untold harm and distress while showing no remorse for his actions.' A child of the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described how they felt after they discovered what had happened. They said they felt: 'Angry, sickened, saddened, vulnerable, ashamed, and broken. 'My mum has looked after me well all my life and when it was my turn to look after her, I feel I should of done better. I will have to live with that for the rest of my life. 'To me Richard O’Brien has committed one of the worst crimes possible and I hope he too has to live with the consequences of what he has done for a long time to come.'","Richard O'Brien, 58, was caught on camera assaulting woman in care home .

"Police have warned a 'dangerous' game of hoax calls which result in armed units descending on homes, known as 'swatting', is becoming a national epidemic. Officers investigating one such hoax call which lead to a SWAT team storming a home under the belief a teen had shot dead his mother say it is just one of the latest examples of the 'game'. An army of police and a SWAT team descended upon the Long Island home on Tuesday, but within minutes they discovered the hostage call was an act of revenge by a disgruntled 'Call of Duty' gamer who'd just been defeated. Long Beach police commissioner Michael Tangney described the phenomenon, which sees people gain points for the size of police response to a hoax call, as 'very dangerous'. Scroll down for video .

According to an April 17 search warrant, an e-mail from an anonymous source was sent to the University of Arizona, claiming to be from a teenager, referencing going to the campus with an M4 rifle and body armour. The teenager told KVOA.com he believed he was the victim of somebody online 'that doesn't like me... for either me coding, or me playing video games.'

"By . James Rush . The body of a fugitive billionaire businessman sought over the South Korean Sewol ferry disaster that left more than 300 people dead or missing has been found. Police have said the body was found in an agricultural field in the southern South Korean city of Suncheon on June 12. Officer Wu Hyung-ho told a televised news conference that the results of DNA and fingerprint tests showed they matched those of Yoo Byung-eun. Scroll down for video . The body of a fugitive billionaire businessman sought over the South Korean ferry disaster that left more than 300 people dead or missing has been found . Police and prosecutors have been seeking Yoo for weeks and had offered a $500,000 (£293,000) reward for tips about him . The officer said the body was already decayed too much beyond recognition when it was found and more thorough investigation was needed to find how and when he died. The body was found wearing a pair of expensive shoes and a costly Italian-made jacket. Also found near him were three empty Korean local liquor bottles, a bag and a magnifying glass, according to police. Authorities believe Yoo was the owner of the ferry and that his alleged corruption may have contributed to its sinking. The sinking, one of South Korea's deadliest disasters in decades, has prompted an outpouring of grief and anger after some crew were caught on video abandoning ship while children, following instructions, stayed put in their cabins. The Sewol ferry, travelling too fast on a turn, sank on April 16 on a routine trip from the mainland to the holiday island of Jeju. Of the 476 passengers and crew on board, 339 were children and teachers from the same school on the outskirts of Seoul. Reporters and police gather at the spot where a body confirmed as that of Yoo Byung-Eun was found a month earlier, in Suncheon . The body of Yoo Byung-eun, 73, is moved into an ambulance in Suncheon City . About 100 days after the disaster, 294 dead bodies have been retrieved but 10 people are still missing. Police and prosecutors have been seeking Yoo for weeks and had offered a $500,000 (£293,000) reward for tips about him. Yoo, who was head of the now-defunct predecessor of the ferry's current operator, Chonghaejin, allegedly still controlled the company through a complex web of holding companies in which his children and close associates are large shareholders. The government offered a $100,000 (£59,000) bounty for Yoo's eldest son, and one of his daughters was arrested in France in May. The sinking, one of South Korea's deadliest disasters in decades, has caused an outpouring of national grief, and the country is undergoing national soul searching about public safety . The predecessor company went bankrupt in the late 1990s but Yoo's family continued to operate ferry businesses under the names of other companies, including one that eventually became Chonghaejin. Yoo was also a member of a church that critics and defectors say is a cult. The church made headlines in 1987 when 32 people, who critics suspect were church members, were found dead in the attic of a factory near Seoul in what authorities said was a collective murder-suicide pact. Church members have denied involvement. Yoo was investigated over the deaths after a probe into the dead people's financial transactions showed some of their money was funnelled to him. He was cleared of suspicions that he was behind the suicides because of a lack of evidence, but was convicted on a separate fraud charge.","Body found in agricultural field in South Korean city of Suncheon on June 12 .

"By . Amanda Williams . Al-Shabaab - the extremist group behind the Kenyan mall massacre - is believed to have funded its terrorist attack by poaching endangered species in the country's national parks. Authorities have confirmed a probe has been launched into claims that the group, linked with al Qaeda, are behind the poaching of rhinos and elephants, as an animal 'head count' is launched in Kenya and Tanzania at the Amboseli National Park in Kajiado County. Hillary Clinton recently unveiled an $80 . million plan to tackle elephant poaching in Africa. She warned that money from the wildlife crime could be helping to fund terrorist groups  - including the al-Shabaab group . that launched the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last month, a theory which is backed by elephant conservation groups. Elephants graze in a marsh at Amboseli National Park, Nairobi. Kenyan and Tanzanian governments have started a joint aerial count of elephants and other large mammals in the shared ecosystem of the Amboseli-West Kilimanjaro and Natron- Magadi landscape . The census comes as authorities launch a probe into claims that Al Shabaab, linked with al-Qaeda, are behind the poaching of rhinos and elephants . The one-week census exercise, will cost 104,000 US dollars, is a collaboration between the two countries and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI) and the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) among others . It has been reported that local communities are being enlisted to poach the elephants and other large animals on behalf of terrorist organisations . The Elephant Action League (EAL),  launched a two year undercover investigation of elephant poaching in Kenya in 2011. Andrea Crosta, who lead the investigation, said many poachers he spoke to said they were increasingly selling to al-Shabaab, the New Scientist reports. The ivory is then sold on to markets in Asia, at hugely inflated prices. He said: 'Part . of al-Shabaab's funding has been, and is still, from ivory.' He added that according to sources in the militant group, 3 tonnes of ivory were passing through Somalian ports each month. It is believed this could be earning the group up to $600,000 (£375,000) a month. In the past month, armed poachers are said to have slaughtered five rhinos in the Oserian sanctuary and escaped with the horns. The rise in poaching is concerning authorities as the killers are targeting endangered species. William Kiprono, director of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), said it was now investigating the claims, and warned local communities not to be 'used by foreigners' for poaching. Standard Digital News reports: 'The problem of poaching does not only involve foreigners but is done in four stages – from local level, financiers, exporters up to consumers – and our people are used to kill the wild animals. An elephant and its calf are captured as they graze at Amboseli National Park. It is the practice of Kenyan and Tanzania wildlife authorities to conduct both a wet and a dry aerial census every three years . The census will also count other large animals, including wilderbeest and rhino . Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), said the week-long drive will establish the status of wildlife within the cross-border landscape which includes the elephant, wildebeest, zebra and other large mammals . William Kiprono, director of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), speaking at the launch of the census, said it was now investigating the claims, and warned local communities not to be 'used' for poaching . 'I urge them to stop this habit as it is primitive and aimed at destroying nature, which cannot then be enjoyed by the next generation.' It comes as an animal 'head count' is launched in Kenya and Tanzania at the Amboseli National Park in Kajiado County. The census will be carried out this week, and will cost 104,000 US dollars. It is a collaboration between the two countries and the Kenya  Wildlife Service (KWS), Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI) and the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF). Kenyan and Tanzanian governments started on October 7 a joint aerial count of elephants and other large mammals in the shared ecosystem of the Amboseli-West Kilimanjaro and Natron- Magadi landscape. Rhino horn is just one part of a trade worth an estimated 19 billion US dollars (£12 billion), making it the fourth biggest global illegal trade after narcotics, counterfeiting and human trafficking. Elephants are captured on film by census teams. The Centre for Pastoralists Development (Cepad) said it was concerned over a rise in poaching in ranches in the last few months . Al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, has said it carried out the attack on the Westgate shopping mall, in which at least 67 people were killed . Among the reasons for the trade is demand for medicines, consumer goods and the desire to possess exotic pets, hunting trophies and rare plants and animals. Illegal wildlife trade thrives in places with widespread corruption, weak law enforcement and where rangers, police officers and customs officials are not sufficiently trained or resourced with new tools such as DNA tracing technology.

Al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, has said it carried out the attack on the Westgate shopping mall, in which at least 67 people were killed. The count comes after a similar wet count done earlier in April this year.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A young date palm named Methuselah has blossomed for the third time after a 2,000-year old seed was planted eight years ago. The ancient seeds, one of which has produced Methuselah, were discovered in a clay jar at the site of Herod the Great's fortified palace in Masada, Israel in 1973. While the seeds languished in a drawer of Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University for years, one was eventually planted in 2005 and have proved sceptics wrong after producing a seedling - effectively resurrecting a plant last seen in Bibical times. The only example of a Judean Date Palm located at Kibbutz Ketura, Israel. It was germinated in 2005 from a 2000 year-old seed found in the Masada excavations, and is nicknamed Methuselah. Botanical researcher Elaine Solowey said it looks similar to its modern relatives apart from the length of its third leaf . Botanical researcher Elaine Solowey with help from the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Centre at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, sowed the seed that has now produced the rare and ancient plant. She told Popular Archaeology: 'When we asked if we could try and grow some of them, they said, ""you're mad,"" but they gave us three seeds.' 'Lotus seeds over 1,000 years old have . been sprouted, and I realised that no one had done any similar work with . dates, so why not give it our best shot and we were rewarded.' The researcher planed the seed as soon as she received it and it blossomed for the first time in 2011. The ruins of the Mezada are pictured - a geological mesa at the edge of the Judean Desert that rises in 1300 foot cliffs above the level of the Dead Sea. Herod the Great began developing palaces, fortifications, and storehouses on Mezada in 37 BCE and the ancient seeds were found at the site . Masada is an ancient fortification in the Southern District of Israel situated on top of an isolated rock plateau (akin to a mesa) on the eastern edge of the Judaean Desert, overlooking the Dead Sea. Herod the Great built palaces for himself on the mountain and fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE. The Siege of Masada by troops of the Roman Empire towards the end of the First Jewish–Roman War ended in the mass suicide of the 960 Jewish rebels and their families hiding there. Masada is located 12 miles east of Arad and is  Israel's most popular paid tourist attraction. The site of Masada was identified in 1842 and extensively excavated between 1963 and 1965 by an expedition led by Israeli archeologist Yigael Yadin. Due to the remoteness from human habitation and its arid environment, the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia. While it looks very similar to modern date palms, the tree has some unusual leaves. Dr Solowey said: 'The only difference between this date . seedling and any other date seedlings I've seen come up is the length of . the third leaf. This is very unusual. She plans on cross-breeding the plant with modern close relatives. The young date palm has been called Methuselah after a biblical story about the oldest person who ever lived. The Romans reported seeing groves of the trees in the Jordan River valley, which stretched to the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, which made the area wealthy. In ancient literature, the Judean date, which is produced by the palm variety is said to have medicinal properties. It was used as an aphrodisiac and contraceptive, as well as treatment for toothaches and malaria, as well as cancer. The ancient Hebrews referred to the palm variety as the 'tree of life' because of the food and shade it produced.","The seed that produced the young date palm was planted in 2005 by Elaine Solowey and the Louis L.

"By . Bianca London . He has designed wild headgear for the likes of Rihanna, Mick Jagger and Princess Beatrice. But this December Stephen Jones has got a rather more surprising client. The famed milliner has given Barbie five festive makeovers for Christmas, decking the doll out in cocktail dresses, floor-length gowns and velvet minis. But for those who thought the £25 they usually have to shell out for their favourite plastic doll was steep, look away now, because Happy Holly Barbie, Toffee Ice Barbie, Snow Globe Barbie, Santa Baby Barbie, and Christmas Tree Barbie all come with a price tag of £250. It's a doll's life! Famed milliner, Stephen Jones, has given Barbie five festive make-overs for Christmas, including cocktail dresses, floor-length gowns and velvet minis . Speaking about the design project which saw him create total couture looks for each doll, Stephen said: 'Barbie is the most fabulous private client. 'She came into the salon for her Christmas morning hat and left with five glamorous outfits. Barbie and I have the same design vision; we love tradition, but have an eye for the future.' Erin Moscow, a spokesperson for Selfridges, who is selling the dolls, said: 'We're enamoured with the idea of truly one-of-a-kind gift this Christmas. 'More than ever before we're aware of the demand for pieces which offer something really special. Toffee Ice Barbie: Stephen says: 'Rudolph, Prancer and Vixen are some of Santa's reindeers, so I wanted to make Barbie an outfit in which she can dance and prance on the ice rink' Santa Baby Barbie: Stephen says 'Every Barbie needs a fabulous Christmas outfit, so I used the idea of a Santa hat to make a fantasy cocktail dress, dedicated to Mrs Santa' 'These pieces don't necessarily come with a million pound price tag - they're not about ostentation - their beauty lies in their rarity. 'All of the storytelling and fantasy of Stephen's work, realised with fun and witticism that's synonymous with Barbie, has gone into these beautiful dolls.' Born in Cheshire, and schooled in Liverpool, Stephen burst onto the London fashion scene during its explosion of street style in the late seventies. Snow Globe Barbie:  Stephen says 'There is nothing more magical and glamorous than floating snowflakes encased in a snow globe' Happy Holly Barbie: Stephen says 'This is my personal favourite, using the contrast of soft velvet and spiky holly leaves. Barbie also has her very own pet Robin to give her a Christmas peck' Christmas Tree Barbie: Stephen says 'I ensured the drama and volume of a full pine tree by illuminating . the multicolour baubles within her Christmas tree headpiece' By day, he was a student at Central . Saint Martins, while after dark he was one of the era's uncompromising style trailblazers at the legendary Blitz nightclub, always donning a . striking hat of his own idiosyncratic design. By 1980 he had opened his first millinery salon in the heart of Covent Garden, soon to become a regular haunt to the likes of Boy George and Diana, Princess of Wales. Stephen isn't the first designer to give Barbie a make-over. Over the past fifty years Alaïa, Burberry, Comme des Garçons, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Roksanda Ilincic have dressed her. Famous fans: Princess Eugenie (L) and Kylie Minogue are fans of his designs . Hats off! Princess Beatrice (L) and Nicole Kidman also love Stephen's headwear .","Milliner Stephen Jones has dressed Barbie in festive couture gowns .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Raunchy music videos by the likes of Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke should have a ratings system, campaigners have said. Rewind&Reframe are launching a petition calling for the government to give pop videos cinema-style ratings to stop the sexualisation of young girls. The campaign group will also launch a website tomorrow which will allow girls to blog and comment on the images of women they see music videos. Campaigners are launching a petition to have cinema-style age ratings put on raunchy music videos form the likes of Miley Cyrus . Speaking to The Observer Justine Roberts, founder of the website Mumsnet, said: 'I can't see any reason why these videos wouldn't be classified in the way that other forms of media are but the truth is that it won't be a silver bullet. 'Technology these days makes it pretty nigh on impossible to stop under-18s viewing and sharing this kind of material so as parents it's important to talk to them about what's wrong with it. 'As a society we need to consider how we've got to a situation where misogyny and racism is so commonplace.' Columnist Caitlin Moran has also waded into the debate, saying that teenage girls are being force-fed the idea that all they should aspire to is 'being hot', while Jo Heywood, the headteacher of £30,000-a-year Heathfield School, an all-girls college, called on parents and teachers to provide more positive role models for teenagers. Robin Thicke's video for chart-topping single Burred Lines has also come in for criticism with activists saying the lyrics amounted to an incitement of rape . Tomorrow evening MP Claire Perry, David Cameron's adviser on childhood, will use a debate in the House of Commons to call for a ratings system, as well as for all airbrushed photos to be clearly labelled. However, at Mumsnet's annual Blogfest debate yesterday disability campaigner Victoria Wright, star of Chanel 4's Cast Offs, argued against banning such viedos, saying it would make them more attractive to teenagers. She added: 'These highly sexualised images are a distraction from some great songs and it's really worrying. It's always women in skimpy clothes shaking their arses around men standing about in suits.' Labour MP Stella Creasy said: 'One third of girls say they have experienced some sort of sexual harassment at school. 'Above all, we need to teach our young . people to be critical of what is age appropriate and we want them to be . critical of these images and these videos of young sexualised women. 'They need to challenge the view that it is OK.' The campaign has been launched in the same week that a survey revealed a third of parents have found their children copying 'porn style dance moves' The comments come in the same weeks that a survey revealed that four fifths of parents have caught children repeating offensive words in pop songs and a third have caught youngsters acting out 'porn style dance moves'. The online poll also showed that two-thirds of parents feel their children were exposed to unhealthy images on pre-watershed shows such as the X Factor. In 2012 Reg Bailey, a government adviser, called for a rating system to be applied for music videos in a report to David Cameron.","Campaign to have age ratings put on music videos launched .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Kate McCann attended the opening day of the trial but has since stayed away, leaving it to friends and family to represent her, until Mr Armal began his defense . The tormented mother of Madeleine McCann has said she wants to defend herself in open court for the first time against Portuguese police 'smears' over her daughter's disappearance. Kate McCann has asked a judge for permission to address a libel trial brought after a controversial book suggested the McCanns may have hidden their daughter's body and staged an abduction. The author of The Truth Of The Lie is ex-police chief Goncalo Amaral, 56, who was tasked with investigating Madeleine's May 2007 disappearance. Kate's husband Gerry and Mr Amaral have already applied to speak in the Portuguese court. Her . application, revealed at the libel trial today as former police . colleagues of Mr Amaral spoke in his defence, paves the way for an . emotional finale to the case. It . comes just days ahead of a new appeal by the McCanns for information on . their missing daughter on BBC's Crimewatch which will feature a . reconstruction of events in Praia da Luz on May 3 2007. It is thought Gerry and Kate, 45, will appeal directly to a kidnapper during the programme. Madeleine's . mother flew to Portugal for the start of the libel trial last month - . but had left it to friends and relatives to testify before Mr Amaral's . side launched its defence. Judge . Maria Emilia Melo e Castro, referring to Kate by her maiden name as she . revealed her change of heart, said: 'On October 2 Kate Healy made an . application to make a statement to this court. Hearing: Gerry McCann has also expressed a wish to testify against police chief Goncaro Amaral . 'The . court will decide on this application once evidence has been heard by . both sides as only then will it be able to judge on the need for and . the pertinence of this application.' If . given the go-ahead, the McCanns and Mr Amaral are expected to speak on . the same day on or after November 27 when the last hearing in the trial . at Lisbon's Palace of Justice is scheduled. Former . colleagues of Mr Amaral's turned up the heat on the McCanns today by . insisting nothing he wrote in his July 2008 book was new. The . book was published just three days after the McCanns had their status . as suspects over Madeleine's disappearance officially lifted. Around 120,000 copies were sold before it was withdrawn when the McCanns won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Proceedings: Mr McCann in the court building, where the case against Mr Amaral is being heard . Anger: Mr McCann claims the allegations made it harder to search for his daughter, who vanished in 2007 . Portuguese . TV station TVI, also being sued by the McCanns along with Mr Amaral's . book publishers, broadcast a controversial documentary based on the book . in April 2009. Former . family liaison officer Ricardo Paiva told the court: 'What is in the . book is based on our investigation and contains the professional and . personal opinions of Goncalo Amaral as a police officer. 'Everything that is there can be found in the case files.' Contradicting . earlier claims by the McCanns' family and friends that Mr Amaral's book . had hindered their search for their daughter by turning the Portuguese . public against them, he added: 'The flow of information continued to . come in regularly. 'Neither this book or any other book affected the flow of information.' Luis . Neves, head of a national police unit tasked with investigating . organised crime, including kidnappings, said Mr Amaral's conclusion . Madeleine was dead was an idea accepted early on by her parents. He . insisted Kate was the driving force behind a failed July 2007 search . for Madeleine by controversial ex-south African detective Danie Krugel, . who claimed to have invented a machine which could locate a body if . provided with a DNA sample. Neves . said the reservations he felt over Mr Krugel were shared by colleagues . about sniffer dogs supplied by British police which went on to smell the . 'scent of death' in the McCanns' holiday apartment and place a huge . question mark over the hypothesis Madeleine was kidnapped. The . performance of the dogs was later called into question after they also . reacted to remains at Haut de la Garenne orphanage in Jersey, which were . later found to be animal bones. Battle: Mr McCann and his family are still looking for Madeleine, who was aged three when she disappeared . Mr Neves told the court: 'The McCanns convinced us we should bring in the south African man with his equipment. 'We didn't want to place any obstacles in the way and so the investigating officers eventually allowed it. 'It . was during this part of the investigation our British colleagues said . there was a team made up of dogs and their handlers that could help us . to find out where the child could be buried. 'It . was from then on that the Algarve police division decided to allow the . dogs to come and the idea of Madeleine's death began to form and things . took another direction. 'I know the suggestion of the dogs was not accepted lightly. 'We had no experience of it in Portugal and the cost was another factor.' Retired . police officer Francisco Moita Flores, now a TV commentator, described . the Madeleine McCann investigation as one of the 'most complex and . well-investigated cases' he had had ever seen and called Mr Amaral . 'competent.' He insisted . the Tapas Nine - the McCanns and the friends dining with them at a . tapas bar near their apartment the night Madeleine disappeared - should . have had their phones tapped because of 'inconsistencies' in their . statements. Attacking . the ongoing Home Office-funded Met Police investigation into Madeleine's . disappearance, called Operation Grange, he told the court: 'There's a . prophetic and dogmatic vision behind it. 'These detectives are only putting forward the hypothesis of abduction.' Judge . Maria Emilio Melo e Castro stopped lawyers on both sides asking Mr . Amaral's former police colleagues what they thought about his . conclusions on Madeleine and her parents in his book because they were . 'opinions' and not 'facts.' Victim: Madeleine's disappearance sparked a worldwide police search, but she has not yet been found . Couple: Gerry and Kate McCann say they were extremely distressed by Mr Amaral's book, published in 2008 . She . waved the book in her hand as she demanded to know from Ricardo Paiva: . 'The back cover says it contains exclusive revelations. 'What's new in the book that's not in the police files?' Told by Mr Paiva, 'Nothing', she replied: 'Ok, so then I have to conclude this is misleading advertising.' Another . defence witness, Mr Amaral's ex-number two Vitor Tavares de Almeida, . was bizarrely dismissed after being asked just one question. The . police chief, still a serving officer despite being convicted in . January of torturing a crime suspect and receiving a two and a half . suspended jail sentence, has previously claimed he believes the McCanns . concealed Madeleine's body. He . was overheard on a video link muttering: 'What am I doing here?' before . being sent away after admitting he had only read the final two pages of . Mr Amaral's book. Mr Amaral denies defamation.

"By . Sam Webb . Barrie Goldthorpe, 56, has been jailed for three-and-a-half years after a court heard how he abused his position at a bank over five years . A former HBOS manager who swindled the bank out of £1.5m was caught when colleagues raised suspicions about how he could afford his extravagant lifestyle. Barrie Goldthorpe, 56, has been jailed for three-and-a-half years after a court heard how he abused his position over five years and spent the cash on luxury holidays - including one on a private jet - and a corporate box at Leeds United. During a long career with the business Goldthorpe, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, worked his way up to the post of Group Technology Service Manager with a salary of almost £45,000. Michael Greenhalgh, prosecuting, said Goldthorpe and co-defendant Michael Sharkey, who was employed by a company which obtained computer hardware and maintenance engineers for HBOS, were in regular contact over contracts and planned to defraud the bank using inflated or bogus invoices. Goldthorpe was so trusted by the bank that whatever payments he authorised would not be checked, the court heard. The scam came to light in late 2008 and a complex police inquiry lasting five years ended with the jailing of Goldthorpe, Steven Shaw, 60, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, and Sharkey, 58, from Scotland, who all admitted a charge of conspiracy to defraud. The court heard some of the sums obtained from the bank between 2003 and 2008 were diverted through a ‘slush fund’ which was used to pay for holidays for Goldthorpe and his wife Jane. Mr Greenhalgh said: 'One was to Jersey and a far more extravagant affair was a private jet used to take them and their family together with Steven Shaw and his family to a villa in the south of France where they had a holiday.' The court heard that money was also spent on lavish meals, electronic goods such as cameras and personal computers and Goldthorpe and Shaw also obtained the use of a corporate box at Leeds United’s Elland Road ground. The fraud came to light because Goldthorpe’s colleagues reported his extravagant lifestyle, prompting a bank investigation and there was a change of management at Sharkey’s firm which uncovered the ‘slush fund account.’ Extravagant: Goldthorpe splashed out on a private jet to take his family to a villa in the south of France. File picture . The investigation revealed 27 suspicious transactions with invoices totalling £1,591,383.56. Goldthorpe was jailed after the court heard he had received payments totalling almost £540,000. Shaw, who benefited to the tune of just over £70,000, was jailed for 15 months while Sharkey, who received about £30,000 and was described as a ‘key facilitator’, was locked up for two years. Sharkey’s 52-year-old brother Peter, also from Scotland - who admitted laundering some of the proceeds - was jailed for 19 months while Paul Ashton, 49, of Leeds, was sentenced to a year in prison also for money laundering. Jane Goldthorpe was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for her limited role in laundering some of the stolen money. She will also have to do 150 hours of unpaid work for the community. Plush: Goldthorpe also paid for a box at Leeds United's Elland Road ground . Judge John Potter told Bradford Crown Court on Friday it had been a professionally planned conspiracy which had realised large sums of money over a number of years. During the hearing he described Barrie Goldthorpe as being driven by, and riddled with, dishonesty and greed on a ‘breathtaking’ scale. 'As soon as you were aware of the existence of the slush fund you wished to milk it for as much as you could with a view to living an extravagant and lavish lifestyle and so you did over a number of years living way beyond your means,' the judge told him. The judge said Goldthorpe had also exerted control over his wife and concealed from her how their extravagant lifestyle was being funded. Rodney Ferm, for Goldthorpe, said the couple now had nothing left despite the amounts of money that had passed through their hands and although they had enjoyed the fruits it had left a bitter taste. 'He made his own decisions. He blames no-one else,' said Mr Ferm.","Barrie Goldthorpe, 56, abused a position of trust for five years .

"By . Becky Evans . The Moldovan tour guide who had an affair with the captain of the doomed Costa Concordia has revealed the pair met for 2am sex sessions in his cabin. Domnica Cemortan, 26, said she was also on the bridge with Francesco Schettino when it crashed into a reef, killing 32 people. The mother-of-one, who worked as a guide and translator for Russian tourists, said she loved Schettino and was 'fascinated' by him. Scroll Down for Video . Domnica Cemortan has revealed she and her former lover Francessco Schettino, the captain of Costa Concordia, enjoyed secret 2am sex sessions in his cabin . The Moldovan tour guide laughed off suggestions she distracted the captain but was on the bridge at the time of the crash . The cruise liner was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it sank off the island of Giglio in January last year. Miss Cemortan said she and Schettino, who is currently on trial for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship, had a meal together the night the cruise ship sank. He later invited her to the bridge and she was with him and other officers when crash alarms went off. Prosecutor said she was a distraction to Schettino but she says she was more than 150ft away from him at the time of the crash. She admits they passionately kissed on the night the ship sank but says they did not have sex. Miss Cemortan also denied that their late night trysts made Schettino tired when on shift. She told The Sun: 'He is not stupid. He is a very good captain. I still respect him so much.' Miss Cenmortan said Scehttino was not a coward but saved 'many lives' in the way he handled the sinking . Miss Cenmortan, who began her relationship with the married captain in December 2011, only admitted they had been lovers when she gave evidence at his trial this month. Miss Cemortan told how she had first been introduced to Schettino by a colleague when she arrived on the cruise liner December 2011 to work as an international hostess, translating for Russians for three weeks. She said he began timing his trips to parts of the ship so he could see her. They kissed for the first time after he called her into his office. She says people were gossiping about their affair but she does not believe anyone saw them together. Miss Cenmortan said Schettino was the 'god of the ship' and was a responsible captain . Thirty-two people died when the cruise liner sank off Giglio island, Italy, in January last year . The classically trained ballet dancer told Italian programme Domenica: 'When I see him I see a fashionable man, a smart man… For me he was fascinating because he was the captain. For the crew he was the strongest man on the ship. He is a god on the ship. 'In the first week he could not remember my name because it is not an easy name. But later he started to pay more attention to me… He started to speak with me, make jokes.' Schettino was dubbed Captain Coward after the tragedy but Miss Cemortan said he saved 'many lives' in the way he handled the situation. She said: 'If he was a coward, why was he not one of the first out?' The captain, Francesco Schettino, is on trial in Grosseto, Tuscany, on charges of manslaughter, causing the 2012 shipwreck and abandoning the vessel before all others aboard were evacuated. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. The trial continues.","Domnica Cemortan would sneak into Francessco Schettino's cabin at 2am .

Healthy: Ruth Dales (right), who beat a cancer scare to become a model, poses with colleague, Claire Jones . The colposcopy, a treatment which involves having abnormal cells burned away, that followed left her with a month at home to fill while she recovered. And, incredibly, instead of sitting at home feeling sorry for herself, she used it to train for her first ever fitness modelling competition. 'I had been given this massive health scare and I didn't want to wallow in my own misery,' she explains. 'I decided I was going to go after something I had wanted to do all my life. I . have always had sly comments from girls about the way I look, they . would say nice things to my face and then make horrible comments behind . my back to try and knock my confidence.

And . so with just five weeks to train, Ruth entered a competition run by the UK Body Fitness Federation, which she hoped would kickstart her fitness modelling career. To her complete surprise she was crowned the Midlands champion. 'I couldn't believe that I won, I hadn't trained for very long . and didn't think I would even come runner-up let alone winner,' she reveals. 'There are all sorts of models at these contests - tall, short, plus size - but it's all fine as long as you're fit and healthy. 'Beauty comes from living a healthy life. Clothes and make-up are just the icing on the cake.' With her homegrown triumph complete, Ruth will now travel to Los Angeles to compete against women from all over the world. 'I had always been healthy and fit but then when I got the cancer scare it made me think you only live once and you have to follow your dreams,' explains Ruth. 'I had thought about doing modelling for some time but I was always scared that people would think I was vain when all I want to do is promote good health. 'When I began to win at different modelling events I realised this was a really great way of being a spokeswoman for fitness and good health.' Despite her travel plans and modelling success, Ruth says she has no intention of giving up her day job. 'Even if I won the lottery, there's no way I would give up this job,' she explains. 'I trained for six years and it's something I will always have an interest in. 'I have an exciting job, making sure that the right people get the right drugs and GPs are great people to work with.'","Ruth Dales, 32, from the Midlands, always wanted a modelling career .

"By . Beverley Morrison . Former Nazi SS officer Erich Priebke during his first trial for the massacre of 335 Italians. His death and plans for burial sparked violent protests in Italy . Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, . whose death sparked violent protests and a legal dispute over what to do . with his body, has been secretly buried in an Italian prison cemetery. The . 100-year-old died last month while living under house arrest for his role in one . of the worst massacres of the Second World War in Italy. A report in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica said Priebke was buried in a grave in a fenced-off area of the cemetery, ‘marked by a wooden cross in the underbrush.’ Scroll down for video . But the paper did not give details on . where the cemetery is located, adding, that it was, ‘the only bit of . Italian land where Priebke's death can go back to being just a death, . not Nazi symbolism.’ Rome city authorities banned any burial out of fear it could become a Nazi pilgrimage site. The Vatican issued an unprecedented . order barring any Catholic church in the city from holding a funeral . mass for the war criminal. Argentina, where he had lived in exile and wanted to be buried, would not take the body either. An attempt by the Italian authorities . to hold a funeral for Priebke sparked rioting. Protestors surrounded . the car which was carrying the body at the church of Lefebvriani. So Priebke’s body was taken in the middle of the night in a grey station wagon to a military airport near Rome for safekeeping. In a secret operation it was driven . up the motorway for a couple of hours, before, ‘as dawn approached, the . coffin was unloaded and loaded onto another car,"" before being driven . into ""a mountainous area,’ La Repubblica rerported. 'Even if we cannot reveal the location of his grave, the public should know that the affair has been brought to a close.’ Erich Priebke in his Nazi SS officer's uniform during the Second World War.  Born in Henningsdorf in Germany, even his hometown did not want him back for burial . Nicknamed the ‘Butcher of the Ardeatine Caves,’ Priebke always insisted that he had only ever obeyed orders. The 335 victims of the massacre - mainly men and boys - were executed in March 1944 with a bullet to the neck. The slaughter was in retaliation for an attack by the resistance movement on SS soldiers. Priebke managed like many Nazis to escape to Argentina at the end of World War II, evading the 1948 trial in Rome of other perpetrators. Because of his age and ill-health he was allowed to serve out his life sentence at the home of his lawyer after being extradited from Argentina, where he lived a free man for nearly 50 years. The Nazi war criminal, whose body has lain in limbo since he died two weeks ago, was finally interred after his lawyer claimed a deal was struck to bury him in a secret location. His family and friends had refused requests by authorities to have him cremated and buried at sea like Osama bin Laden. Former SS captain Priebke was serving a life sentence for the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves. The slaughter outside Rome of 335 men and boys was a reprisal for an attack on Nazi police by resistance fighters. His birth town of Henningsdorf in Germany said they could not accommodate him, and even Argentina, his adopted homeland refused to take back his body, saying it ‘would be an affront to humanity.' Former Nazi SS officer, Erich Priebke,  left, surrounded carabinieri (Italian military police) during his first trial in 1996 and then, right, during his trial in 2002 in Naples.  Talking of his part in the the massacre, he claimed he was only obeying orders .","Former SS officer interred in hidden corner of prison cemetery .

"Could have proven useful for situations like the London . riots in 2011 . By . Nicola Guttridge . Rumours spread fast, and with social media sites like Twitter it's quicker than ever to share your thoughts – and boasts – with the online world. But be careful what you tweet; scientists from the University of Sheffield are developing an online lie detector that can tell fact from fiction in just 140 characters or less. The lie detector, named 'Pheme' after a Greek goddess famed for spreading scandalous rumour, will sift through tweets from news outlets, individuals, members of the public, and automated 'bots' to see if their posts are as truthful as they claim. A new lie detector is being developed that will sift through user tweets on social networking site Twitter, to tell truth from lies and identify accounts set up to spread malicious rumours . Such a system could have been valuable for situations like the 2011 London riots, where rioters used networks like Twitter to organise themselves and spread untrue information. 'There was a suggestion after the 2011 riots that social networks should have been shut down, to prevent the rioters using them to organise,' says scientist Kalina Boncheva of the University of Sheffield, who is leading the development of the system. 'But social networks also provide useful information – the problem is that it all happens so fast and we can’t quickly sort truth from lies. 'This makes it difficult to respond to rumours, for example, for the emergency services to quash a lie in order to keep a situation calm. 'Our system aims to help with that, by tracking and verifying information in real time.' Pheme . will use a range of different indicators to tell the difference between . truthful tweets, malicious rumours, and harmless boasts. The . system will assess the authority of the Twitter user, assigning more . trust to well-known, reliable outlets like experts or news accounts. It . will trawl through the history and background of users to pinpoint . accounts that were created purely to spread lies and rumours. Pheme . will hunt for other accounts that confirm or deny the information, and . keep a close eye on how the conversation is developing - plotting all . the results in a visual dashboard to easily spot popular rumours that . are taking hold. A system like Pheme would have been very valuable during the London riots in 2011. A scene from the riots in Croydon from August 2011 is pictured, as British riot police walk past a burning building in Croydon . Pheme will classify online rumours into four different types: speculation – for example, over rising interest rates; controversy – such as the furore over the MMR vaccine; misinformation – where a lie is spread unknowingly; and disinformation – where the information is spread with malicious intent. Although the lie detector is not currently up and running, Boncheva hopes to have a final version within 18 months, with working prototypes completed sooner.","System will sift through tweets in real time to verify or debunk lies .

"By . Mario Ledwith . 'Be sensible': Justin Welby, the Archbishop of . Canterbury, has issued a warning over the 'ridiculous' materialistic . excesses of Christmas . Increased financial pressure in the build-up to Christmas ‘spoils life’ for families across the UK, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Criticising the festive period as ‘over the top’, Justin Welby said that high-spending in an attempt to create the perfect Christmas risked making life miserable. But in a frank admission, the former oil executive said nobody would ‘pay attention’ to his message about the obsession with material goods. In a warning to hard-pressed families across the UK, Archbishop Welby said: ‘Save up for the Christmas budget, be sensible, don’t put pressure on your finances – don’t make your life miserable with Christmas.’ His description of the festive period as ‘absurd and ridiculous’ follows research that suggests the average family spends £1,000 on Christmas. The stark assessment of Christmas celebrations are his first comments on the Christian festival since taking over as Archbishop. He said: ‘The Christian bit of Christmas isn’t the bit that’s getting people into debt. ‘It’s the whole mercantile trading, shopping, over-the-topness, so I don’t feel guilty about it.’ Admitting that our obsession with shopping is unlikely to wane, he said that people should show ‘love and affection rather than trying to buy love and affection’. He added: ‘You can’t buy it, you can show it, and when you show it, it comes back to you with interest. ‘Share love and affection with reasonable gifts that demonstrate you really care for someone’. During the interview for ITV’s The Martin Lewis Money Show, the Archbishop admitted his comments were unlikely to make a difference. He said: ‘It’s a cliché of modern life that someone gets up and says Christmas is becoming very materialistic, as though it wasn’t 300 years ago. 'Yes, obviously the secular over-the-topness, everything you have to have, new clothes you have to have, new this, new that, new the other, is ridiculous, it’s absurd, it shouldn’t happen. ‘It’s obviously not what Christmas is about but to be absolutely honest there’s not much point in saying it because nobody’s going to pay attention.’ 'It's obviously not what Christmas is about': Thousands of shoppers trudge along Oxford Street in the gathering gloom last December.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A rabbit was decapitated and left disemboweled for its owner to find as a spate of mysterious attacks plague two ice skating clubs in Sweden. The animal's brutal death is the latest in a string of incidents to hit two local figure skating clubs in Landskrona in southern Sweden. The rabbit was left in the garden of a new skating club owner last Thursday. Feud: A rabbit was decapitated and left disemboweled for its owner to find as mysterious attacks plague two ice skating clubs in Sweden . The woman, who does not want to be identified, said she had gone into the garden to feed the rabbit when she saw the  rabbit's decapitated head next to it's feet and limbs which had been cut off while its entrails strewn across the ground. 'I . see the remains of my rabbit’s body…it’s in my mind all the time,' the mother-of-two told an English-language Swedish news site, The Local. 'It’s cruel and it’s cowardly. But it’s too late.' Police who examined the scene concluded that the rabbit was killed by a human, most likely someone with knowledge about hunting, as the dismemberment was clean-cut and precise. The woman said the same evening the garage at the family home was broken into. She said her husband ran outside and saw a man biking away in dark clothing, wearing a hat and a jacket with the letter T emblazoned on the back. Brutal: The animal's brutal death is the latest incident aimed at two local figure skating clubs in Landskrona in southern Sweden (file photo) The rival figure skating organisations hit by the mysterious attacks are, GF Sport Figure-Skating, and the Landskrona Figure Skating and Sport Club (LKSK). For many years, GF was the only place in town for aspiring figure-skaters to learn the finer points of the sport. But in late August, the woman began LKSK, saying she wanted a more fun environment for children to learn to skate and bought skating boots for children to try out. But she says the boots were stolen from her car, while her Apple laptop was left untouched – leading her to conclude the theft was designed to hurt her new business. Meanwhile the treasurer at GF, Pauline Kronvall received a menacing message. 'I found the first letter in my mailbox in September, right after we had opened the skating school for the year,' Kronvall told the local Helsingborgs Dagblad newspaper. It said I should leave the club's board, or my kids would be murdered.' Although police attempted to investigate the investigation was dropped when they could not find any clues. Since then, Kronvall has received two additional letters threatening her family. 'I started looking over my shoulder when walking alone in the ice hall,' Kronvall said. 'I don't know if these are empty threats, or serious.'","Mysterious incidents aimed at two local figure skating clubs in Landskrona .

"By . Arthur Martin . BT was last night facing a growing backlash for paying almost £900 million to secure exclusive rights for Champions League football matches. The telecoms giant had already said its ten million customers would see monthly package costs rise by up to 6.5 per cent from January 4. But it is feared they may now suffer further price hikes to pay for the football deal. Under fire: Telecoms giant BT has bid £897 million for three years' rights to Champions' League matches . One expert warned any rise in the cost of calls and line rental would hit pensioners hardest, as many rely on BT landlines. The company is understood to have bid nearly twice as much as Sky for the rights to all Champions League and Europa League games for three years from 2015. The firm is keen to expand its BT Vision service and overtake long-standing competitors like Sky . The £897 million bid comes after BT paid £738million for the broadcasting rights to 38 English Premier League games each season for the next three years. The firm will hope to attract enough new subscribers and advertising revenue to recoup these huge outlays. But many fear hidden charges to pay for the football coverage, and customers expressed concern online yesterday. One said: ‘When this all backfires for BT, and it will, those of us with BT phone lines will pay for it. ‘It’s time BT remembered their public service clause and treated customers with respect.’ Another forum user, John Dudman, said: ‘BT are using their total customer base to subsidise money being spent on sports licences. Pity my neighbours in Wales who are BT broadband customers and would love to watch sport but cannot because of insufficient bandwidth.’ Paul Green, of Saga, said: ‘Keeping in touch is absolutely vital for older people and for some the telephone is the only social interaction they get. ‘Anything that might increase the costs of this vital link needs to be scrutinised very carefully.’ In September it emerged that penalty fees for leaving a BT contract early will rise by as much as 30 per cent. Even the charge for dialling the Speaking Clock will go up by 6.3 per cent. Standard line rental, paid on top of any phone or broadband package, will rise by 3.5 per cent to £15.99 a month. This is above the inflation rate of 2.7 per cent. BT boasts its new sports service will be free for anyone already getting internet connection through the company. The telecoms giant has already forked out for TV presenter Clare Balding, left, and footballer Gareth Bale, right . It claims a million people have already signed up. But all BT customers will end up financing the project through the price rises – even though the channels are free to some users of the firm’s arch rival, Virgin. BT has splashed large sums on its ambitious scheme to rival Sky in offering top-flight sport. As well eye-watering sums to host matches, the firm is thought to have spent tens of millions on a studio and pundits. It has hired presenter Clare Balding, who will host her own show, and forked out for the opinions of the world’s most expensive footballer, Gareth Bale. Last night a BT spokesman said: ‘Customers can be confident that they won’t find the cost of these rights added to their normal phone bill.’","Phone firm reportedly bid double what Sky did for three years of matches .

Samuel Etherington, from Gosport, Hampshire, appeared at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court today after detectives charged him last night. He was remanded in custody ahead of another hearing at Winchester Crown Court tomorrow. Police were called to Ann's Hill Road in Gosport at 4.15am on Sunday following reports that a green Honda Civic collided with two girls.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A master double agent famous for escaping the British Establishment to Soviet Russia may have been encouraged to defect by a fellow spy, it has emerged. In a letter from the USSR to a lifelong friend who he betrayed, Kim Philby - one of the infamous Cambridge Five - suggested MI6 figures wanted to wash their hands of him. Published for the first time today in The Times, the letter was written by Philby to his colleague Nicholas Elliott soon after he was able to flee to a new life in Moscow despite being accused of treachery in Parliament. Traitor: Cambridge Five member Kim Philby, pictured in Moscow, sent a letter to a friend he had betrayed suggesting he had been encouraged to leave Britain for the USSR . Defector: Philby, who died in 1988, pictured in Russia with his fourth wife Rufina Ivanovna Pukhova . It used the spy slang for defection - 'do me a fade' - to suggest Elliott had encouraged him to defect to Soviet Russia. 'Dear Nick,' he wrote. 'I wonder if this letter . will surprise you. 'Our last transactions were so strange . that I cannot help thinking that perhaps you wanted me to do a fade. It . is invariably with pleasure that I remember our meetings and talks. Spying for Russia: Kim Philby escaped detection for 12 years after two co-conspirators fled Britain . 'They . did much to help one get one's bearings in this complicated world! I . deeply appreciate, now as ever, our old friendship, and I hope that . rumours which have reached me about your having had some trouble on my . account, are exaggerated.' The letter was uncovered by the journalist and historian Ben Macintyre as he researched a new book, A Spy Among Friends. Serialised in the Times, the account describes how Philby abused his friendship with Elliott, with whom he had risen through the MI6, passing information to the Russians which led to the deaths of some of Elliott's contacts. According to the Times, the extraordinary letter asked Elliott to meet him in Finland - and he wanted to go so he could exact revenge on his treacherous friend, who had destroyed his career. Instead he eventually replied with the words: 'Put some flowers for me on poor Volkov's grave', a reference to would-be defector Konstantin Volkov who was outed through Philby's betrayal. In a secret service steeped in the paranoia of the Cold War, the 'Cambridge Five' escaped detection for many years, rising to the highest levels of the MI6. The scandal rocked the Establishment by revealing Soviet double agents at the heart of many of Britain's most storied institutions. Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt all met at the University of Cambridge, where Blunt was an academic and the other three were undergraduates. The older man recruited the students to the Soviet cause before the Second World War - and they remained devoted to the USSR even after the start of the Cold War. Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6, Maclean was a Foreign Office official and Burgess worked for the BBC. Blunt was the most eminent of all, as director of the Courtauld Institute and keeper of the royal family's art collection. Cambridge Five: Antony Blunt (left, 1907-1983) was the director of the Courtauld Institute and kept the royal family's art collection while Donald Maclean (right, 1913 - 1983) was a foreign office official who fled in 1951 . Guy Burgess (1911 - 1963), left, worked for the BBC while the fifth member was said to be John Cairncross . In 1951, Burgess and Maclean were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by Philby, they were able to escape to Moscow. Despite the suspicion surrounding Philby, he avoided detection for another 12 years until 1963, when he too defected to the USSR. It was claimed last week that MI6 chiefs were so convinced Philby could not be a traitor because of his Establishment background and trustworthiness that they shielded him from official probes. Blunt escaped exposure for even longer. It was not until 1979, when Margaret Thatcher named him as a suspect in the House of Commons, that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles. The 'fifth man' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified, but was named as John Cairncross by KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky. The story of the unlikely traitors has been dramatised several times, including in John le Carré's classic book Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and the film of the same name. Blockbuster: Gary Oldman starred in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a fictionalisation of the Cambridge Five scandal based on the book by John Le Carré .","Traitor was one of the Cambridge Five, but avoided detection and escaped .

Even . when you finally relax in front of the TV, you’re . still spinning at a dizzying speed of over 600mph if you’re in the UK. Using . this map, you can search for where your line of latitude crosses the . black curve to determine the speed you’re spinning in the cosmos. Using this map, you can search for where your line of latitude crosses the black curve to determine the speed you¿re spinning in the cosmos . The graphic was created by Oregon-based Seth Kadish who wanted to find a way for people think about their existence in a broader sense. According to the graphic, the speed at which your area of the planet is moving can vary between 0 and 1040mph. ‘Basically, I'm a geologist who loves math,’ Mr Kadish told MailOnline. ‘Every once in a while, I tackle a fun thought experiment or back-of-the-envelope calculation related to the natural world.’ The result was the graphic that reveals the speed of a point on Earth's surface for any given latitude as a result of the rotation of the Earth about its axis. The values on the graph are accurate to within about 1 mph (1.6 km/hr) of your actual speed. It does not take into account our rotation around the sun into account, which is roughly 67,000 mph orbital speed. Even when you finally relax in front of the TV after a long day, you're still spinning at a dizzying speed of over 600mph if you're in the UK . An object on the Earth's equator . travels once around the Earth's circumference. This is about 24,901 . miles (40,075 kilometres) per day. To calculate speed, Mr Kadish divided that distance by 23hr, 56m, 4s to reach the figure of 1,040 mph. After that, speed due to rotation was calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude at the point. ‘The largest error introduced is probably the fact that you have to estimate your location on the curve based on where you live, then read your speed off the x-axis,’ said Mr Kadish. An object on the Earth's equator travels once around the Earth's circumference. This is about 24,901 miles (40,075 kilometres) per day. To calculate speed, Mr Kadish divided that distance by 23hr, 56m, 4s to reach the figure of 1,040 mph. After that, speed due to rotation was calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude at the point. The calculation assumes that the Earth is a perfect sphere, which isn’t the case. . There is also some variability in speed introduced by the altitude of a given location, but the effect is very minor. ‘If, hypothetically, Mt. Everest’s peak and the deepest part of the Mariana Trench were both located along the equator, the difference in tangential speed caused by the 12.3 mile elevation difference would only be about 3 mph,’ said Mr Kadish. ‘I am partial to maps because my education focused heavily on geographic information systems,’ said Mr Kadish. ‘But sometimes all you need is a good graph to make the data beautiful.’","An object on Earth's equator .

Tony Degrafreed allegedly beat and stabbed to death 47-year-old Rebecca Degrafreed in the bedroom of their Indianapolis home about 8am Sunday. He then allegedly stabbed his wife's son, 19-year-old Jordan Yarbro, in the chest. Family members said Rebecca married Tony in 2006 after he'd been released from prison for killing his first wife. But the mother-of-three accepted his past and devoted herself to his rehabilitation. Scroll down for video .

Victim: Rebecca Degrafreed, 47 (right) worked at IU Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis . 'He was my sister’s first love,' Christopher Birdsong, Rebecca Degrafreed's brother, told The Indianapolis Star. 'She put her name on his parole papers . in order for him to get out. She married him and took . him home and had a home already well fixed for him.' Birdsong said Tony connected with Rebecca, who'd met as teenagers, as soon as he left prison. The IU Methodist Hospital worker helped him find a job and 'picked him back up.' It's this generosity of spirit and kindness that Rebecca Degrafreed's loved ones will remember most. 'She was the foundation of her family,' family friend Lynn Howard told WTHR. 'Today she would've been picking her mom up and taking her to church.' Rebecca's son, Jeffery Yarbro, said his mother pushed everyone to be their best and taught her children that family came first. 'She was taken from us. You know it would be a completely different story if it was natural causes or it was a slip and fall, but she was taken from us,' he told WISHTV.com.

"By . Sam Webb . Bipolar: Mr Oddie, who shot to fame in comedy series The Goodies in the 1970s, fears it has become 'fashionable' to speak out about conditions like his . A number of celebrities have spoken of their battles with mental illness, many in an effort to try and remove the stigma associated with their conditions. Now one of their number has decided to step back from his charity work because he feels some stars are using their condition to further their careers - and may actually be skewing the way conditions are understood by the public. Broadcaster Bill Oddie, 72, suffers from bipolar disorder and has spoken of being hospitalised with the condition after he was sacked from the BBC series Springwatch. The Bipolar UK patron, who shot to fame in comedy series The Goodies in the 1970s, fears it has become 'fashionable' to speak out about conditions like his. He said: 'I rather think that too much can be made of these things by celebrities, and I often don’t feel it does an awful lot of good. 'Stephen Fry brought a lot of attention to it, and Ruby Wax, but I don’t think that the life of a celebrity can be compared to, or relatable to, a normal, everyday life, so I don’t know how much good it really does,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'I’m not knocking it. I am just saying that I don’t think celebrities are necessarily the people to bring true understanding of the condition.' Both Fry and Wax are bipolar sufferers and speak openly about the condition. Wax toured mental institutions for two years and created Black Dog Tribe, a  website for people affected by depression and other mental health issues. She has also published a book, Sane . New World, which looks at stress and depression in the modern era and . has a masters from Oxford in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy. Ruby Wax and Stephen Fry have undertaken charity and awareness work for mental health issues. Wax also has a degree in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy . The . comedian has penned a response to Mr Oddie on her blog. She said: . 'Obviously Bill did not read the book and yet claims it’s about . depression. I don’t work in TV and haven’t for many years. 'I . am now touring my show to bring awareness to small audiences.  I wonder . what he’s doing besides criticising someone who is trying to help. Children from wealthy families with pushy parents are more at risk of developing mental health problems, researchers have discovered. Youngsters from affluent homes are seeing a major rise in levels of neuroses that lead to drug abuse, crime and eating disorders. Depression and anxiety – the major factors behind such behaviour – is almost twice the normal rate in children whose parents earn more than £100,000 a year, according to the study. Many were simply unable to cope with the constant demands for ‘high-octane achievement’ from aspirational parents, said US psychologist Suniya Luthar. 'Unfortunately, . we live in a society that listens to celebrities. I don’t feel great . about that but it is the reason Comic Relief makes millions each year. 'I . think we should thank Stephen Fry for being the first to speak out, . it’s a very brave thing to do and he didn’t have to to improve his . career.' Mr Oddie has previously claimed that . the BBC ‘put him in hospital’ with crippling depression when it dropped . him from Springwatch four years ago. The . presenter said his pre-existing illness reached a crisis point when the . broadcaster unexpectedly sacked him from the popular wildlife series. Oddie, 72, says he was forced out following an investigation into his behaviour during filming. At the time, the BBC put his dismissal down to his health problems. He suspects that his mood swings upset colleagues and members of the public during filming on location at Brownsea Island in Dorset. But he says he can’t understand the decision to fire him just before Christmas 2008, and that it plunged him into a despair which culminated in admission to London’s Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in March 2009. Bill Oddie has previously claimed that the BBC ¿put him in hospital¿ with crippling depression when it dropped him from Springwatch four years ago . Bipolar disorder, known in the past as manic depression, is a condition that affects moods, which can swing from one extreme to another - depression and mania. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks or longer, and some people may not experience a 'normal' mood very often. During an episode of depression, sufferers may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide. During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, people with the condition may feel very happy and have lots of ambitious plans and ideas. They may spend large amounts of money on things they cannot afford and would not normally want. Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of the manic phase of bipolar disorder.

Courtney Meppen-Walter, who played for Manchester City and captained the England under-18 team, bragged in a letter that his time in prison was a ‘minor’ matter. The 19-year-old was freed this month after serving just eight months for killing Kulwant Singh, 31, and Ravel Kaur, 37, in the smash.

"By . Sara Malm . The Chinese army is finding itself shopping for new tanks as their soldiers have grown - quite literally - in the 30 years since they were made. The average Chinese soldier is three-quarters of an inch taller, and two inches bigger around the waist, than they were 20 years ago, the army's newspaper said. The survey, which examined more than 20,000 troops over five years, found that the 'fatter' modern soldiers could no longer squeeze into tanks designed in the early 1980s. Growing pains: The average Chinese soldier is three-quarters of an inch taller and two inches bigger around the waist than they were 20 years ago . As the soldiers have also become taller on average, rifle barrels are now too short, leading to accuracy problems, the official People's Liberation Army Daily newspaper reported Tuesday. Adjustments would be made, with 28 body measurements taken into consideration when designing new firearms and other equipment, the report said. According to the Overseas Development Institute overweight and obesity rates have almost doubled in China since 1980. The rise in urban areas is significantly higher as fast food has been incorporated into the previously low-fat plant-based diet in China. Bigger operation: As a result of the increase in size of recruits in China's People's Liberation Army, soldiers do no longer fit into the army's tanks . A 2009 study by the Chinese Health . Ministry found that the average six-year-old boy living in an urban area . was 2.5 inches taller and 6.6lbs heavier than 30 years before. Big .

"By . Becky Evans . and Ap  Reporter . Refugees fleeing persecution in their home country because they are gay should be granted asylum in the European Union, the bloc's top court ruled today. Judges at the European Court of Justice said homosexuals facing imprisonment may have sufficient grounds to be allowed to stay in the EU. The existence of laws imprisoning homosexuals 'may constitute an act of persecution per se' if they are routinely enforced, the court said. The European Court of Justice said existence of laws prohibiting homosexuality could be an act of persecution 'per se' A homosexual cannot be expected to conceal his sexual orientation in his home country to avoid persecution, since it would amount to renouncing a 'characteristic fundamental to a person's identity,' the court added. International treaties say people must prove they have a 'well-founded fear' of persecution for reasons of race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion if they are to obtain asylum. It is not yet clear how asylum authorities are supposed to check a seeker's claim they are gay . The court said it will be up to Europe's national authorities to determine whether the situation in an applicant's home country amounts to persecution, especially whether homosexuals are indeed sentenced to prison terms there. Some nations have laws against homosexuality but rarely enforce them. The European court ruled on three cases of nationals from Sierra Leone, Uganda and Senegal seeking asylum in the Netherlands. The case was brought by the Dutch Supreme Court seeking clarification on the application of relevant EU laws. The Supreme Court said it will now proceed with the asylum cases and others brought on the same grounds since the cases were sent to Luxembourg in April 2012. However, it still remains unclear how national asylum authorities should check a person's claim of being homosexual. The Dutch Supreme Court in March also referred that problem to the judges, asking what the limits are for the 'method of assessing the credibility of a declared sexual orientation' under EU laws. But the European Court of Justice isn't expected to rule on that issue before next year.","Judges ruling on case brought by the Dutch Supreme Court .

"Perpetually rushed New . Yorkers have been telling cabbies to 'step on it' for as long as there . have been taxis, but the city wants to brake that hurry-up habit, in . part by attacking the financial incentive to speed. Cabs . could be outfitted with black-box-style data recorders and devices that . would sound warnings - or even pause the fare meter - for going too . fast, even as speed limits on most city streets would drop from 30 to 25 . mph. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who made the . proposals as part of his broader safe-streets plan, says drivers of New . York's signature yellow cabs rightly should play a particular role in . his push to curb traffic crashes. 'They set the tone on our streets,' de Blasio said. Under ambitious proposals that seek to get New York City cabs to slow down, black boxes inside cabs would shut the toll meter off whenever a cab goes above the posted limit, which is 25 mph in much of Manhattan . While . traffic advocates applaud the ideas, they are getting a bumpy reception . at taxi stands. Cabbies fear friction with passengers and feel they're . being scapegoated, and riders say they're torn between the drive for . safety and the need for speed. 'When I'm in a . rush, anything is appreciated,' New Yorker Emily Baltimore said as she . waited in a cab line outside Penn Station this week. New . York's Taxi and Limousine Commission says it is still exploring the . ideas, which would require a range of approvals. The traffic safety plan . also includes more taxi-rule enforcers, stiffer penalties for cabbies' driving violations and many provisions aimed at all cars, not just . taxis. Deadly auto wrecks have dropped sharply . in the nation's biggest city, from 701 in 1990 to an all-time low of . 249 in 2011, as officials redesigned dangerous intersections and made . other changes. But recent pedestrian deaths have pushed the issue to the . forefront. Nine-year-old Cooper Stock was in a Manhattan crosswalk, holding his father's hand, when a left-turning taxi hit them Jan. 10. Cooper . was killed. Ambitious proposals seek to get New York City cabs to slow down by taking the financial incentive out of speeding . The driver was ticketed but hasn't been criminally charged, . though authorities are still investigating. Under current rules, the . accident wasn't grounds to suspend his otherwise clean license. Cooper's mother says cabbies need to be held accountable for making streets safer. 'They . should be the best drivers in the city. They are professional drivers,' said Dana Lerner, a psychotherapist. While her main goal is tougher . consequences for taxi crashes, she feels black boxes and other . technology could deter bad driving. The . results would ripple through traffic, as cabbies' driving 'dictates . behavioral norms to other drivers,' said Paul Steely White, who runs . Transportation Alternatives, a group backing de Blasio's plan. While . New York's more than 50,000 cabbies may have a hard-driving image, they . note they have eight hours a day worth of reasons to be careful. Just . about 4 percent of the roughly 200,000 vehicles involved in accidents . citywide last year were yellow cabs, according to an Associated Press . analysis of police statistics. A 2004 study . showed taxis had a below-average crash rate, on a per-mile-driven basis, . though a 2010 city report suggests they play a bigger role in . collisions that kill or seriously injure pedestrians. Taxi and . car-service cabs were involved in 13 percent of those crashes, though . they account for only about 2 percent of the cars on the road, the . Transportation Department report showed. Cabbies . feel de Blasio's traffic safety plan unduly singles them out for . scrutiny, a sentiment hardly lessened when a news camera caught the . mayor's official, police-driven vehicle speeding two days after he . unveiled the plan. And taxi drivers and owners fear slowing down could . mean losing business. 'People want to go, . hurry, because they don't have a lot of time. They spend money to save . the time,' says Jawad Habib, a cabbie for 21 years who says he makes . sure to know traffic rules. He fears a lower speed limit could lengthen . taxi trips enough that 'who's going to want to sit in the cab? ... They'll go to the bus.' The drivers' union, . the Taxi Workers Alliance, and the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade . owners' group raised some red flags at a City Council hearing, though . the owners' organization supports the lower speed limit and some other . ideas. Some limousine and car-service fleets . around the country have seen accidents drop by 50 percent or more after . installing data recorders, said Matthew Daus, a former New York taxi . commissioner who's now president of the International Association of . Transportation Regulators. But the devices can be unpopular with drivers . and can bump up against legal questions in an industry in which many . drivers are independent contractors, not employees. Black boxes inside cabs would shut the toll meter off whenever a cab goes above the posted limit - 25 mph in much of Manhattan - and drivers would be alerted they are going too fast . It's unclear whether anyone has developed devices linking speed and fare meters, but experts say it's feasible. Vehicle . security-camera company VerifEye Technologies Inc., for example, . recently started offering a feature that can send a cab company a . message if a car breaks the speed limit, discerned by a combination of . GPS and speed-zone maps, Vice President Terry Walker said. The Markham, . Ontario-based company has mapped Toronto, Chicago and a handful of other . cities so far. The system could be adapted to pause a meter if regulators allowed it, Walker said. Meanwhile, cabbie Yick Li relies on his own anti-speeding system: himself. After . 32 years behind a taxi wheel, he simply says no if a passenger urges . him to speed or break other rules. Some riders gripe, he said, but many . understand. 'They sit back, relax, let us do the driving.'","Ambitious new proposal made by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio this week .

"By . Emma Innes . A new AIDS injection could give people 100 per cent protection against the virus for up to three months . A new HIV injection could protect people from the infection for up to three months, a study suggests. Researchers believe the injection of long-lasting drugs could temporarily provide 100 per cent protection against HIV infection. They say this could be a huge breakthrough which would be particularly important for couples in which one partner is infected while the other is not. In two separate studies scientists found that the injection gives monkeys complete protection when it is administered monthly, The New York Times reports. However, scientists think that having a single injection just once every three months month could be sufficient to provide complete protection. They hope the results can be replicated in humans. Currently, people who are in a relationship with someone who is HIV positive are given low doses of antiretroviral drugs to prevent them contracting the infection. However, this can be problematic if they forget to take the drugs at the right times and, even if they do, it only offers about 90 per cent protection. The researchers hope this injection could eventually offer a safer alternative. Human trials of the vaccine are due to start later this year according to experts at Columbia University. However, if this is successful, a larger human trial will still be required before the injection could be widely offered. This would take a number of years. It is thought the injection could be particularly beneficial for women in Africa. The injection could be particularly beneficial for HIV negative people who are in relationships with people who are HIV positive. Image shows HIV in human tissue . Many such women with an HIV positive partner already take the daily pills but some have reported that taking medication every day leaves them open to stigma by people who assume they are already infected. As a result, they might benefit from being able to go for a regular protective injection. Many of these women already receive long-lasting contraceptive injections for fear that their partner would be angry he found a packet of The Pill. As a result, offering the HIV injection as well could be relatively easy. Currently people who are in relationships with people who are HIV positive take low doses of antiretroviral drugs each day to prevent them becoming infected. However, many forget to take them or are stigmatised for doing so . Dr David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Rockefeller University told The New York Times that these contraceptive injections give ‘a good analogy for how [the AIDS vaccine] might work in developing countries’. One of the injection trials was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and saw six female monkeys given monthly doses of GSK744 – a long-lasting antiretroviral drug. Another six monkeys were given a placebo and then they were all exposed to HIV in a way that simulated having vaginal sex with an infected man. The researchers observed that none of the injected monkeys became infected while all of the unprotected ones did. The second study was designed to establish whether the injection could be as effective in people having anal sex with someone HIV positive. It was carried out at Rockefeller University, in New York, and involved 16 monkeys who were injected with the same drug. During the study none of the monkeys who were given the injection contracted the infection while all of the unprotected ones did. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The New York Times that the results are ‘very impressive for something in the animal model’. ‘This is the most exciting innovation in the field of HIV prevention that I've heard recently,’ added Dr Robert Grant, an AIDS expert at the Gladstone Institutes, a foundation affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco.","The injection of antiretroviral drugs gives monkeys 100% protection .

"By . Louise Eccles . and James Tozer . and Larisa Brown . The treatment of the victims of Flight MH17 has been sickening, the Prime Minister said last night. Amid growing international outrage over delays in returning the bodies, David Cameron told the Commons that Russia must ensure the victims are repatriated as quickly as possible. Pro-Moscow rebels are accused of looting the victims’ corpses and blocking efforts by the Ukrainian and global authorities to investigate the crash. Scroll down for video . Anger: David Cameron blasted images of looting as a 'sickening violation of an already tragic scene' The Prime Minister said: ‘There is anger that this could happen at all, there is anger that the murder of innocent men, women and children has been compounded by sickening reports of looting of victims’ possessions and interference with the evidence. And there is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow has instead been fomented by Moscow. ‘The bodies sitting on a refrigerated train have still not been allowed to leave. And the pictures of victims’ personal belongings being gone through are a further sickening violation of this already tragic scene.’ Ten Britons were among 298 people killed when MH17 was shot out of the sky at 33,000ft as it travelled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur last Thursday. British families accused Ukrainian separatists of treating the dead in a degrading and inhumane manner. The bodies were exposed to 29C (84f) heat for three days before being transported nine miles on trucks and loaded into refrigerated train carriages in the rebel-held town of Torez on Sunday. Volodymyr Groysman, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said the train left last night for government-controlled Kharkiv and would then go to the Netherlands where the bodies would be identified. Evidence of looting? The image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage . Hunt for clues? A rebel fighter is filmed rifling through the bag of one of the 298 MH17 crash victims . Armed separatists, however, were saying the train would be routed to Ilovaysk, another town they control. It has been claimed that bodies have been removed from the scene by militiamen who have stopped international investigators boarding the train. A relative of Stephen Anderson, 44, a Scottish former RAF search and rescue co-ordinator killed on MH17, said: ‘Getting that train moving is all we care about. ‘This is not about politics for us, it’s about human decency. We just want to bring Stephen home and bury him. No one seems to be taking charge or seems able to make a decision when it comes to what to do with the bodies. ‘All the relatives want is to hold funerals and grieve for their loss, but everything is on hold. ‘It’s been days and nobody can tell us when the train will move and when we can have Stephen back. That is what we find distressing. Can you imagine how it feels to know your loved one may be inside that train?’ Barry Sweeney, whose 23-year-old son Liam died in the tragedy, spoke of his distress at seeing television footage of body bags being bundled into trucks. ‘I don’t want him to be lying there somewhere where there’s nobody there to give him a good cuddle,’ he said. The 52-year-old told ITV he just wanted his son – who was travelling to New Zealand to follow his beloved Newcastle United FC on tour – to be brought home. He added: ‘It is horrible thinking he is in a bin bag somewhere. We are just constantly thinking, where is he? ‘The Russian rebels just do not seem to care. All the bodies need to come back, not just Liam’s.’ Jordan Withers, 22, the nephew of another victim, World Health Organisation media officer Glenn Thomas, 49, said the treatment of the bodies was ‘unbelievable’. Grim cargo: Ukrainian rescue workers remove bagged bodies of the 298 MH17 victims from the village of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine where the plane came down. The area is controlled by pro-Russian separatists . Safety: Emergency workers put on protective gear to handle the victims, many of whom were badly burned . Horror: European monitors inspect the morgue train before it pulled out of Torez station heading west . He told BBC Radio 4: ‘They have been loading them on to trains like cargo and it’s just degrading and inhumane. You wouldn’t treat anyone like that. ‘We’re just hoping it’ll get resolved as soon as possible and as peacefully as possible so we can get the bodies back to our families and we can give them the send off they deserve.’ Australia’s foreign minister Julie Bishop said yesterday: ‘I cannot imagine any other air crash in history where, days later, bodies are still laying in the field. ‘This is not a time to use bodies as hostages or pawns in a Ukrainian-Russian conflict.’ Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, whose country lost 193 people in the crash, also criticised the delays, saying: ‘We want our people back.’ Frustrated British relatives admitted they were contemplating flying out to Ukraine to speed up the process. The Foreign Office has assisted in fast tracking  passport applications. It was not immediately known what the Malaysian team would do with the black boxes, but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data . A Malaysian investigator, left, takes a black box as it is handed over by a Donetsk People's Republic official in the city of Donetsk . Mr Thomas’s family said the World Health Organisation had offered to pay for the family to travel to the wartorn country. However, as fighting continued to rage in the region yesterday, it was unclear whether they would be able to go. Intense shelling rained down in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, a city about 40 miles from the train station where the bodies had been held. The front page of the Malaysian Star newspaper said: ‘Hand them over’, as the Muslim-majority country expressed fury that the bodies of their 43 victims had not been recovered and buried in the Islamic way. Prime minister Najib Razak, whose step-grandmother was on the doomed plane, said his government was determined to bring back the victims’ bodies before the end of Ramadan, a fasting month hugely significant to Muslims.","Images emerged apparently showing rebels rifling through luggage .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The GOCE satellite is expected to meet its fiery death in the next few days as it plunges to Earth - but no one knows where it will land. The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) has been in its low Earth orbit for an extra two-and-a-half years on its planned mission. About 40 tonnes of manmade space debris reach the ground per year, but the spread and size mean the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite. Scroll down for video... With a sleek, aerodynamic design responsible for it being dubbed the 'Ferrari of space', GOCE has mapped variations in Earth's gravity with extreme detail . Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer . Launched: 17 March 2009 . Number of instruments: 3 . Nominal life: 20 months . Mission cost: €350 million (£295 million) Orbit: about 260 km altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous . Mass: 1100 kg . Size: 5.3 m long, about 1m body diameter . With a sleek, aerodynamic design . responsible for it being dubbed the ‘Ferrari of space’, GOCE has mapped . variations in Earth’s gravity with extreme detail. After . more than four years on its mission, the one-tonne GOCE satellite will . fall rapidly through the atmosphere, burning up as it descends. In an update earlier this week, the ESA Space Debris Office said GOCE was at at an altitude of 192km, having run out of fuel on 21 October . It added that the spacecraft is still fully functional with good attitude control. 'Interesting days may lie ahead, as several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are expected to reach our planet, which may spark storms in Earth's geomagnetic field and hence lead to a large increase in the atmospheric drag at GOCE's altitude,' said GOCE operations manager Christoph Steiger in a blog post. This is the first uncontrolled re-entry of a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite since 1987. At a height of 224km, GOCE's orbit is so low that it experiences drag from the outer edges of . Earth's atmosphere. The satellite's streamline structure and use of . electric propulsion system counteract atmospheric drag to ensure that . the data are of true gravity. While most of GOCE will disintegrate in the atmosphere, ESA expects that around 25 per cent might reach Earth’s surface. When . and where these parts might land cannot yet be predicted, but the . affected area will be narrowed down closer to the time of re-entry. Taking into account that two thirds of Earth is covered by oceans and vast areas are thinly populated, the danger to life or property is very low. The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) has been orbiting Earth since March 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite. During its mission, it has produced a unique model of the ‘geoid’, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another. During its mission, GOCE has produced a unique model of the geoid, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another. The colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid. The blue shades represent low values and the reds/yellows represent high values . Around mid-October, the mission will come to a natural end when it runs out of fuel and the satellite begins its descent towards Earth from a height of about 224km. Re-entry is expected to happen about three weeks after the fuel is depleted. An international campaign is monitoring the descent, involving the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee. The situation is being continuously watched by the European Space Agency’s Space Debris Office, which will issue re-entry predictions and risk assessments.","GOCE has spent 4 years mapping Earth’s gravity with incredible precision .

"By . Andy Dolan . Ranvir Bassi was overcome by her 'mother's instinct' when an armed robber burst into her shop . The odds were not in her favour. Shopkeeper and mother Ranvir Bassi shouldn’t have stood a chance when a . hooded raider pushed a sawn-off shotgun in her face. But it was the gunman who ended up running. Dramatic CCTV images show Mrs Bassi, . at just 5ft 2in tall, grabbing the gun and grappling with the would-be . robber until he turned tail and fled. Mrs Bassi, 35, said her ‘mother’s . instinct’ kicked in when the thug burst into her shop with the weapon as . her seven-year-old daughter Satpreet cowered beneath the counter. The footage shows the gunman pointing a . 2ft long single-barrel weapon directly at Ranvir. He was also clutching . a yellow carrier bag into which she was supposed to put the cash. ‘It was just horrific,’ said . mother-of-two Mrs Bassi. ‘I  was shutting down the shop and he just . burst in waving the  gun around. ‘He started shouting “Give me the . money” and swearing at me. 'I really don’t know why I did it, but I guess . my mother’s instinct took over. My daughter was hiding and I just . grabbed the gun. ‘I just shouted “Get out of my shop” and started shoving him. I must have startled him because he turned and ran. ‘He just picked the wrong day to mess . with me – but I was determined that I wasn’t going to hand over money I . had been working hard all day for.’ Mrs Bassi, 35, was shutting the shop in Stafford ten minutes early to visit her son Gurdip, eight, who was in hospital. Her husband Parmjit, 32, was at home at the time of the attack, and she says they have all been left shocked by what happened. The family have run the store for 19 years but insist they will not be forced out by the terrifying raid. Mrs Bassi was back at the store to open up as normal the following morning. CCTV captures the moment the masked armed robber points the 2ft-long single-barrel gun at Mrs Bassi . But rather than cowering in fear and handing over her takings the 5ft 2in mother of two grabs the weapon . 'He just picked the wrong day to mess with me,' said Mrs Bassi of the moment she fought off the robber . The robber, evidently startled by the shopkeeper's tenacity, turns tail and runs out of the shop . ‘It’s our livelihood,’ she said. ‘If . we didn’t open up, we’d lose money. We will not be moved – we are a . close-knit community and we won’t be driven out by thugs like him.’ The couple open their convenience store 14 hours a day, seven days a week, closing only at Christmas. It is covered by seven CCTV cameras. Mrs Bassi said that, while she is determined to carry on as normal, Satpreet has been having nightmares and has stopped eating. Satpreet and Gurdip, who was . discharged from hospital after treatment for a severe eye infection on . Tuesday, often sit in the back room of the shop to do their homework. But Satpreet is now on edge whenever a male customer walks through the door, her mother said. Yesterday, customer Richard Fenn, 69, told Mrs Bassi: ‘Well done – remind me not to argue with you!’  He added: ‘I don’t think I would have acted like that.’ Mrs Bassi said other customers in the close-knit community had been in to present her with bunches of flowers. She added: ‘I know all the customers’ names. They have all been so supportive.’ Ranvir Bassi said her daughter still cannot sleep after the 'terrifying' incident . Bassi & Son Newsagents in Stafford was targeted on Monday shortly after 8.20pm. Police are appealing for information about the incident . The attempted robbery was the first . crime other than shoplifting which the Bassis have experienced at the . business since they took charge of it in 2004.

"By . Peter Allen . Two Europeans accused of murdering a young boy in the most popular tourist resort in Madagascar have been burnt to death by a mob of vigilantes, it emerged today. A third European man who was quizzed over the alleged killing of the eight-year-old boy was lynched hours later and his body set ablaze in a separate attack. The horrific killings took place on Nosy Be, an idyllic Indian Ocean island located off the northwest coast of Madagascar, which attracts holidaymakers from all over the world including Britain. Fire: Locals on the Madagascan island of Nosy Be are allegedly pictured watching one of two European men accused of murdering an eight-year-old boy being burnt to death on Wednesday night . Locals went on the rampage on . Wednesday following reports that a Frenchman called Sebastian and an . Italian called Roberto had kidnapped an eight-year-old child. There . were claims that the men, whose surnames have not been revealed, had . not only killed the boy, but cut off his tongue and genitals. Police commander Guy Bobin Randriamaro said: ‘The rioters launched a manhunt and killed the Europeans. ‘Both men were not only suspected of murdering the boys, but were also said to be trafficking human organs.’ The rampaging mob originally stormed a police station in Hell-Ville, capital of Nosy Be, where it thought the pair of murder suspects were being held. Police fired shots in the air, but it was not enough to disperse the increasingly angry crowd. Mr Randriamaro said the men were finally chased and cornered on the palm-fringed Ambatoloaka beach on Nosy Be, where they were attacked. They were kept alive long enough to be tortured, and are said to have ‘confessed’ to killing the boy, and to trafficking organs, before both were set on fire. Both died from their burns. Manhunt: Locals on the island reportedly hunted down the two men after hearing they had kidnapped an eight-year-old boy, cut off his tongue and genitals before killing him . Up to 4000 Madagascans witnessed the lynching of the two men, said a Frenchman living on Nosy Be. He claimed that both were made ‘scapegoats’ for a murder they had nothing to do with. The . mob went on to torch around eight houses, and to start attacking . police, who are thought to have wounded at least two members of the . crowd. A third man was later lynched and his body set ablaze, police in Madagascar reported later. Witnesses saw him being dragged from a car and thrown on to the flames at Ambatoloaka beach. He . is said to have been questioned by detectives on Wednesday along with . the other two men. His name and nationality were not known, but he was . known to be a European. The boy’s horribly mutilated body was found this morning, said the spokesman. France’s consulate in Madagascar has . immediately warned all of its nationals to stay away from Nosy Be island . – the biggest resort in Madagascar - ‘until order is restored.' Crime scene: The horrific killings took place on Nosy Be, pictured, which is  said to be one of Madagascar's most popular tourist destinations . A spokesman added: ‘We are working . with the authorities on the island to try and work out the exact . circumstances of these killings. ‘Nosy Be is a very popular tourist destination but we are asking people to be especially careful.’ Despite . its upmarket tourist resorts, Madagascar is an extremely poor place, . with some 90 per cent of its population of 22 million people living on . less than two dollars a day. Demonstrators involved in the killings claim they found human organs in a fridge in the building where the men were staying. Many Madagascar residents believe human organs are ‘stolen’ for use by cults, or in witchcraft ceremonies. It is common for them to blame outsiders for this practice, and incidents of mob justice are commonplace. However, the triple killing will have a devastating effect on the tourist industry in the economically troubled country.

"By . Rebecca English . Prince Charles is to become the global ‘face’ of the Royal Family as he shoulders more of the Queen’s public duties, sources confirmed yesterday. The Prince of Wales – the longest heir apparent in British history – will take on his mother’s physically-demanding and high-profile engagements such as foreign tours and investitures. It is the first acknowledgement that the Queen, who turns 88 in April, has made a conscious decision to allow her eldest son and other members of her family to take on more of her work. Scroll down for video . Packed diary: The Queen has handed foreign tours and Prime Minister meetings to her son, Prince Charles . But aides were yesterday quick to stress that the monarch is far from retiring and will continue to focus instead on ‘behind the scenes’ duties. According to one senior palace source, her diary for the next 12 months is busier than her Diamond Jubilee year of 2012. They also dismissed claims that a planned trip to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy in June will be the sovereign’s final overseas engagement. The Mail has learnt that there are in fact plans for a second foreign visit later this year, although it is likely to be a short-haul trip. The movement of Charles to a more central role will allow the Queen to concentrate on her equally important ‘backroom’ role as head of state – including hosting foreign ambassadors and state visits, meetings with the Prime Minister and ploughing through the red boxes of official papers that need her attention every day. Prince Harry's move from flying to a desk job has sparked speculation he is part of the family shift in responsibility . It follows the most visible sign of . change yet – the decision to merge the media relations teams for . Buckingham Palace and Clarence House and base a single operation at the . Queen’s London residence. It will be overseen by Charles’s current head of communications, former BBC PR chief Sally Osman – who will still be paid by the prince from his Duchy of Cornwall income. An aide said it was an attempt to simply ‘co-ordinate things better’. Government officials, meanwhile, have been making their own contingency plans for a change of sovereign – with the help of the Queen’s private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt. This month he was awarded a second knighthood by the Government for a ‘new approach’ to the preparation for a new monarch. Sources have indicated that Sir Christopher was ‘put out’ at the wording of the gong because it publicly acknowledges the Queen’s death – seen as rather tactless in royal circles. But they admit that he has been helping the Government ‘put its ducks in a row’. ‘When it comes to the issue of transition, there are certain things that the Government needs to put in place,’ said a source. Charles has already represented his mother at the bi-annual Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka for the first time. And the Queen has also carried out a number of joint engagements with the Duchess of Cornwall, who she once memorably referred to as ‘that wicked woman’. But a senior Palace aide told The Mail: ‘The Queen is not shutting up shop. She is still the Queen and is still incredibly busy. It’s the constant, daily work of being head of state that takes up so much of her time.’ The source acknowledged, however, that there would be a continuing ‘change in pace’ – and added about the forthcoming visit to  Normandy this summer: ‘It is not her swansong. ‘Her private office have openly confirmed she is pulling back on long haul travel, but don’t forget that the Duke of Edinburgh went to Canada last year at the age of 92.’","Longest heir apparent will take on foreign tours and investitures .

"By . Larisa Brown . and Eleanor Harding . Misleading: Yonas Admasu Kebede, pictured, claimed he was 15 - meaning he would receive free care from the state - when he was actually 20 . He claimed the taxpayer should fund his £10,000 flying lessons after his family abandoned him as a child. Now it appears that Yonas Admasu Kebede may have lied about his age to milk the public purse for tens of thousands of pounds. The failed asylum seeker pretended to be 15 years old so that he could be cared for as a destitute child – while in reality he was a grown man of almost 20. He also claimed his mother was missing and his father either dead or in prison, but the Mail’s inquiries reveal that he is still in touch with his family. They own a three-storey house in one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, where Mr Kebede grew up. His lies mean he has wrongly received two years of accommodation, living expenses and schooling paid for by Newcastle City Council. And because he was a so-called ‘looked-after child’, it has meant the authority has been forced to pay for his flying lessons, even though he turns 26 this month. The disclosures sparked outrage among politicians, who said the British system was too easy to exploit. Labour MP John Woodcock said: ‘This new  evidence suggests Britain’s compassion has been badly abused. ‘Proving age can be hard and we must never shut the door on any child who genuinely needs help but it should not lead to well-meaning authorities being taken for a ride like this.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘This whole case appears to have been a calculated scam to rip off taxpayers. The council weren’t even responsible for this man’s care, so any suggestion that we should still pay for his flying lessons is ludicrous. ‘Given the pious tone taken by Yonas Kebede’s lawyers, and the costs of their legal action, there are serious questions about where the bill for this case should fall. It certainly shouldn’t land on taxpayers’ doorsteps.’ Newcastle City Council was forced to pay £10,000 for Mr Kebede to train as a pilot after it lost a case in the Court of Appeal earlier this year. It will also pay for his living expenses, likely to total £10,000, while he lives in London for a year. His lawyers won the case by arguing that the council had a duty to pay for ‘education expenses’ after he left school because he had no parents. In touch: Mr Kebede's parents, Admasu Bedane Kedede and Tayech Getachew, are listed as friends on his Facebook page, though he claims they abandoned him . Mr Kebede claimed in an interview this week that he believed his father, Admasu Kebede Bedane, was in prison or had been killed because he was involved in politics. He insists that the £10,000 is a loan and he fully intends to pay the money back if and when he qualifies as a pilot. He said his father had abandoned him and his younger brother Abiy, 20, after their asylum claim was rejected in 2004. He also said his older brother Benyam, now 28, looked after them for three years before leaving them stranded in 2007. But on Monday, he had the pair listed as ‘friends’ on Facebook, with Benyam stating on his profile that he lives in London. Mr Kebede’s father has worked as an air traffic controller for  Ethiopian Airlines and lives in a three-bedroom house worth £90,000 in a middle-class suburb of Addis Ababa. The house, which he shares with his wife Tayech Getachew, was built by Mr Bedane after his application for asylum failed in the UK. A neighbour said the couple had two vehicles – one an 11 seater  minibus – and they employ a maid. The locals could not explain how Mr Bedane came into the money to build his home, which was much grander than his old one in a run-down part of town. A neighbour said: ‘He built the house himself and it only took about eight months. Now it is worth treble the price.’ Affluent area: This three-storey house was built by Mr Kebede's father - whom he claimed in an interview this week was dead or in prison . Instead of sending his three boys to the local government school where education is free, the Orthodox Christian paid about £500 a year to send them to a private school. Registration documents completed when Yonas Kebede enrolled in nursery at Miskaye Hizunan Medhanealem church school confirm his date of birth as the seventh day of the third month of 1980, which is November 17, 1987 in the UK calendar. His baptism certificate confirmed the details. His uncle, who lived just around the corner, was a pilot for Ethiopian airlines and three of Yonas’s classmates are also now pilots. His fellow classmates were the sons and daughters of middle-class parents - the majority of them working as civil servants and others as doctors or engineers. A school friend, Habte Hundesa, 25, said they had a happy childhood and were privileged to be enrolled in one of the best schools in the country. When the boys and their father left in 2004 and claimed asylum in the UK, Yonas Kebebe claimed he was aged 13, but in reality he was 16 or 17. Yonas and Abiy were granted discretionary leave to stay in the UK until November 2014, and there is no guarantee their permission will be extended. They were placed in council care and lived with a foster mother. Learn to fly: Mr Kebede posted this picture to Facebook of him in a cockpit. He paid for flying lessons with a £10,000 loan from Newcastle City Council . They applied for post-18 courses last autumn but found they were not eligible for student loans because of their immigration status. They then instructed lawyers to make a claim for the money with Newcastle City Council, which paid out £30,000 in legal fees fighting the case. The council lost, meaning it has to pay £10,000 to each brother in tuition fees and an estimated £10,000 in living expenses every year to fund their post-school education. The money has been given to them as a loan, to be repaid once they start work. Abiy Kebede is currently studying for a degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. Paul Heron, of Public Interest Lawyers, said of Yonas: ‘Our client denies that he has lied about his age. ‘If you publish the allegation in the manner you propose you will be alleging that our client has committed fraud and contempt of court, allegations of the utmost severity that our client unequivocally denies.’ A spokesman for Newcastle City Council said it would look at any evidence produced by the Daily Mail in relation to the case.","Yonas Admasu Kebede forced Newcastle City Council to pay for pilot training .

Snacks: Mr Jeffries, a former newsagent's manager, eats a Bounty bar in the morning and smokes 50 a day . Mr Jeffries, whose vegetable-obsessed son runs an allotment, has a particular aversion to cabbage, lettuce, apples and oranges. And aside from an occasional beef curry, he avoids foreign foods. He insists the key to keeping fit is daily exercises to music and tending the garden. 'I’m one of the fittest pensioners going,' he insists. 'I . sit in my armchair, put on some loud obnoxious music and I just punch . and kick the air for around 20 minutes. It's quite something to witness . and people don't understand what I'm doing, but it works all my joints . and muscles and I think its the secret to my great physical form. BREAKFAST OPTIONS .

I have tinitus, so I can hear the pulse in my . ear, and when I stop after a nice jog, I listen to my pulse it's barely . raised.' Mr Jeffries, . who has been married to wife Dawn for 42 years, admits his tastes became . fussier after he suffered two heart attacks 10 years ago. However, despite curbing his taste in sweets and cakes, he said the attacks made him feel even younger. 'I actually died for a few seconds in the back of the ambulance and had to be resucitated,' he said. 'I had a blockage in my artery that was hereditary. It was nothing to do with my diet or the cigarettes. 'Since the heart attacks I feel younger than ever. I feel like I have been reborn.' David, who grew up in Sheldon in Birmingham with his parents and two sisters, recalls that as a child he would often eat fruit and vegetables. 'We would eat whatever was available,' he says. 'Fruit and veg were a lot cheaper back then. I used to like bubble and squeak with the fried potato and vegetables, but not anymore. 'They don’t taste the same as they used to. 'Besides, a little of what you fancy does you good. It hasn’t done me any harm.' David believes that obesity is nothing more than an evolutionary change, and experts should stop interfering in peoples’ diets. Slender: He attributes his 28-inch waist to gardening, running, and dancing to music in his living room . 'We are told we evolved from apes,' he argues. 'But where is it written that we will remain as we are today? 'We could evolve into 30-stone monsters and there is nothing that we can do about it!' Nigel Penny, Lecturer in Applied Human Physiology at Birmingham City University’s Faculty of Health said: 'I would definitely not recommend anyone pursue a diet like David’s. 'I think the facts speak for themselves. The fact he had two heart attacks 10 years ago is largely due to following such a diet, rather than a hereditary predisposition. 'Although, he could have been genetically predisposed to an increased risk of coronary artery disease, had he not followed such a diet he may well have not had heart disease or heart attacks in his mid 50s.'","David Jeffries, 66, calls healthy food tasteless and he feels better than ever .

"By . Sharon Feinstein . and Barbara Jones . Updated: . 07:40 EST, 26 February 2012 . Health scare: Nelson Mandela was being treated for an 'abdominal complaint' today . Nelson Mandela was in a comfortable condition in hospital last night after undergoing surgery for a stomach condition. The 93-year-old former South African president has a ‘long-standing abdominal complaint’ which needed specialist medical attention. However, officials insisted his admission was planned rather than an emergency, although they declined  to say where he was being treated. Last night Mr Mandela was said to be  stable and fully conscious after undergoing  a ‘diagnostic procedure’ and is expected to  be released from hospital today or tomorrow. A statement from the office of the current president, Jacob Zuma, using Mr Mandela’s honorific name, said: ‘Madiba has had a long-standing abdominal complaint, and doctors feel it needs proper specialist medical attention. ‘The doctors are satisfied with his condition, which they say is consistent with his age.’ Meanwhile, Mr Mandela’s eldest daughter Makaziwe, 57, has spoken of her fears for her father, but said that the family hope he will rally. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘He is very old and I know that one day I have to face being  an orphan. I hope he will pull through, but he is very frail  and weak.’ But Mr Mandela’s eldest granddaughter Ndileka said:  ‘I don’t see it as a big thing. When I saw him on Wednesday he was in good spirits, in perfect health, and the epitome of health, really, for a man of his age.’ 'In good spirits': Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg with US First Lady Michelle Obama last year . The ruling African National Congress said in a statement last night: ‘His condition is not life threatening, the admission was long arranged and therefore is  not an emergency admission. ‘The ANC would like to wish Madiba a speedy recovery. We believe he is in good hands and there is no need for panic.’ When Mr Mandela was taken  ill last year there was fevered speculation in the South African media and virtual silence from the government, fuelling public fears that he was close to  death. But after two nights he  was discharged. This time, the authorities appear to have been more open with the public. ‘I can assure you that the former president is in good spirits and well,’ said Mac Maharaj,  a spokesman for Mr Zuma. Former leader: Mr Mandela with the World Cup trophy two years ago when the tournament was held in South Africa. He has rarely been seen in public since . A source close to the family said Mr Mandela had been ill for some weeks and had been too unwell  to attend a family celebration  for the birthday of one of his grandchildren ten days ago. Unusually, visitors had been banned from his home in Johannesburg, where he had been resting before being taken into hospital on Friday night. A source said: ‘The house has essentially been cordoned off, because he has been so poorly. ‘He hasn’t been feeling well at all and there has been a lot of anxiety about his condition. His pulse has been very quick and  the family feared that his body was beginning to shut down.’ Rally: Nelson Mandela speaks to a crowd of 100,000 people in 1990 two days after he was released from prison after 27 years . Mr Mandela returned to Johannesburg about three weeks ago from his home in Qunu, the village where he was born. It is believed he made the move to receive the medical treatment. Makaziwe, a businesswoman also known as Maki, said:  ‘My father always wanted to go back to where he came from. ‘I visit him whenever I can. I spend time with him, precious time.’","Mr Mandela, 93, hospitalised after undergoing surgery .

"By . Richard Marsden . A killer doctor is suing one of his victim’s sons for heckling him as he was about to give a speech, forcing him to abandon the event and miss dinner. Daniel Ubani, who was working as an overseas locum GP, gave victim David Gray, 70, ten times the recommended amount of diamorphine in 2008. Mr Gray’s sons Stuart and Rory disrupted an event where Ubani was speaking in Germany, calling him a ‘charlatan’ and ‘killer’. Now disgraced Ubani – who can still practise in Germany, where mention of his role in Mr Gray’s death is forbidden under strict ‘data protection’ laws – is demanding almost 3,400 euros, equivalent to £2,800 compensation. Confronted: Daniel Ubani is heckled by the two sons of one of his victims, David Gray, in Germany in 2010. Stuart Gray, pictured right, is stopped by security as he disrupts the disgraced doctor's speech . The sum covers the cost of dinner, expenses and the fee for his speech, which was not paid. In 2010, an inquest found that Mr Gray, of Manea, Cambridgeshire,  had been unlawfully killed and an arrest warrant was issued for  Ubani. But the doctor had returned to Germany and a deal was reached under which he was sentenced  there – receiving a nine-month  suspended jail term and fine for a lesser charge of causing death by medical negligence. He was banned from practising in the UK after being struck off by the General Medical Council. However, Ubani has been able to continue working in Germany because, although the country’s equivalent of the GMC would like him to be banned, doctors are licensed by their local council. Anger: Rory Gray (right) and his brother Stuart (left) disrupted a speech he was giving at a conference on plastic surgery in the German town of Lindau in 2010, calling him a 'charlatan and killer.' After Ubani, 71, was banned from practising in the UK following the inquest, Mr Gray’s sons discovered their father’s killer was giving a speech on plastic surgery in Lindau, Bavaria. Brothers Stuart, now 54 and a GP in the West Midlands, and scientist Rory, 49, who lives in Germany, attended the event in June 2010 to confront him. During the incident, Ubani replied: ‘Show me the doctor who has not made a mistake.’ Now . Rory Gray’s lawyers have received a letter from a court in Lindau . saying Ubani is seeking 3,398 euros plus costs. Mr Gray is liable . because he lives in Germany, where he works for its equivalent of the . Meteorological Office. He said: ‘Ubani’s move beggars belief but it is not a surprise because he has told so many lies. Tragedy: David Gray died after being given a massive overdose of painkillers by Dr Ubani . ‘He has no moral compass or integrity – what sort of person would commit an unlawful killing then try to extricate money from his victim’s family?’ Mr Gray said he had obtained paperwork showing Ubani was only qualified to run a cosmetic surgery clinic before he came to the UK – but was able to move to the UK under European law because he had a German medical licence. ‘He pretended to have medical knowledge he didn’t have in order to work in the UK to make money,’ Rory said. ‘There is no evidence he trained or qualified to be  a GP.’ Nigerian-born Ubani, who is still allowed to practise as a plastic surgeon in Witten, an industrial town in Germany’s Rhineland, has given Mr Gray two weeks to answer his  case, which could lead to a full court hearing. Mr Gray said Ubani had already made two unsuccessful attempts in the German courts to sue him and take out an injunction  preventing his family from speaking out. But the third case has now been allowed to proceed. ‘I am defending it, of course,’ he said. His brother Stuart, who lives in Kidderminster,  Worcestershire, said: ‘Rory is only liable because he’s living in Germany. After all Ubani has done to our family, this is the final insult.’ He added: ‘In Germany, data protection rules prevent anyone making public any details about what Ubani did to our father. In my opinion, Ubani has no morals – he’s a weasel.’ The inquest into their father’s death heard that Ubani was on his first shift in the UK as a locum when he killed the pensioner, whom he injected with 100mg of diamorphine – ten times the recommended  maximum dose. Evidence at the hearing in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire,  suggested he had also inappropriately treated at least two other patients. German police documents later showed neither the university where Ubani claimed to have studied nor the state examination office had a record of his ever having sat the state medical exam. Horrified: Rory Gray (pictured with his girlfriend Ingrid Krautwurst) said it is 'disgusting' Dr Ubani is still allowed to practice after his he allegedly fed his father a massive overdose of pankillers .","Daniel Ubani gave David Gray ten times recommended dose of diamorphine .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Prince Harry landed in South Africa this morning for a brief stopover on his way to Antarctica for a gruelling trek to the South Pole. The Prince looked upbeat and smiled as got off the plane with injured service personnel taking part in the Walking With The Wounded challenge. Three teams of four wounded military personnel, representing Britain, the United States and the Commonwealth (drawn from Australia and Canada) will race 335-kilometre (210-mile) across Antarctica. The 29-year-old army attack helicopter pilot will trek alongside the British team in the charity race to the planet's southernmost point, which is expected to take 16 days. Upbeat: Prince Harry looked relaxed as he landed in Cape Town, South Africa, today with the rest of the Walking with the Wounded British team mates . Pit stop: Prince Harry travelled with 12 wounded servicemen and women from the UK to Cape Town ahead of a 200-mile race across Antarctica . After arriving in Cape Town on a flight from London today, the Prince joined his team mates on a bus ride to a local hotel where they could relax for the evening. The teams will tomorrow fly on to an air base near Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station, which is situated at the edge of the Antarctic continent. Once acclimatised to the altitude and freezing temperatures, the teams hope to begin the race on November 29. They aim to reach the South Pole around December 17. Each team has a mentor and a polar guide. Harry is patron of organisers Walking With The Wounded, which raises funds to retrain injured troops and help them find new careers outside the military. Calm before the storm: Prince Harry join other members of the British team in the team bus which headed to a nearby hotel along the coast for some relaxation time before leaving for the South Pole . Keeping calm: The Prince didn't seem at all daunted by the challenge ahead . He launched the charity's South Pole Allied Challenge in London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday. 'All the men and women behind me have achieved so much just to get here, let alone actually walk to the South Pole,' he said, flanked by the competitors. 'It's just a wonderful display of courage from their part. 'These guys aim to achieve something quite remarkable, and in doing so will prove to everybody else that even though you've lost a leg or lost an arm, or whatever your illness may be, that you can achieve pretty much anything if you put your mind to it.' He added: 'This trip is another way of reminding everybody that as Afghanistan draws down and these guys aren't in the news any more... the support must continue.' Trekking around 20 kilometres per day, the teams will be pulling 70-kilogramme (155-pound) sleds.They . will likely endure temperatures as low as minus 35 degrees Celsius . (minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit) and wind speeds of around 50 miles (80 . kilometres) per hour. Patron: The Virgin Money South Pole Allied Challenge 2013, of which Harry is patron, will see them race across the Antarctic to the South Pole . Prince Harry and other members of the British team get off the bus after arriving at a local hotel in Cape Town . Preparation: The teams will all fly on to a Russian base in Antarctica tomorrow where they will be given a few days to acclimatise to the freezing weather conditions . Speaking at London Heathrow Airport on Sunday before departing, British army veteran Ibrar Ali, whose right arm was amputated after a roadside bombing in Afghanistan in 2007, felt both nervous and excited about the challenge ahead. 'A bit like pre-tour when you're just about sat at Brize Norton (airbase) when you're just about to go out to Iraq or Afghanistan,' he said. Speaking of Harry's involvement, he added: 'He's a great team member and just fits in really well so no different to anyone else.' Harry, who is fourth in line to the throne of his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, joined the Walking With The Wounded trek to the North Pole in 2011.

"By . Jamie Redknapp . Cazorla is a class act . I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. He might not get the same hype that Mesut Ozil does, but Cazorla is a maestro in midfield. He could have even more success in that No 10 role but it’s tough to displace Ozil. The Spaniard scored twice on Saturday - one with his left foot, one with his right - and he is the best  two-footed player in the league.  He’s so good that sometimes it’s hard to know which is his stronger foot. He makes the ball talk and he’s got a football brain the size of a planet. Strike it lucky: Santi Cazorla scored both goals as Arsenal beat Fulham . Star man: Cazorla was Arsenal's match winner on Saturday . He sees the whole picture and has a fantastic understanding of the game. What I like about him is he doesn’t look like your standard footballer. He’s got an odd body shape and 10 or 15 years ago not many clubs would have gone near him. But he’s an artist and brings a real joy to the fans. If you like that kind of player, there’s nobody better to watch. Aston Villa's tripple threat . Andreas Weimann, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke were magnificent against Liverpool. They complemented each other so well and caused problems, particularly in the first half. Weimann gave Steven Gerrard a torrid time, working hard and pressing him into errors, Benteke led the line brilliantly and Agbonlahor was so dangerous on the break with his pace. But over the last three seasons, Villa have finished on average just five points above the drop zone, which is not good enough. They have the quality and Villa fans will now be asking why they can’t play this way every week. Three wise men: Andreas Weimann, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke celebrate the first goal . Benteke's back . Christian Benteke scored his second goal . in two games on Saturday, but he showed how valuable his all-round game . is. He hit the joint most passes of any player at Anfield (57), which is . unusual for a striker. He completed 37 passes. And as the map below shows, they came all over the pitch. All over: Benteke made 37 passes during the game . The power of Pulis . FOUR clean sheets kept by Crystal Palace under Tony Pulis. Tony Pulis has rejuvenated Crystal Palace and the way the Stoke fans saluted him tells you the kind of impact he can have. Since taking over, Palace have won four matches and escaped the bottom three. They’ve still scored the fewest goals in the league (14), but only Arsenal (six) have more clean sheets since Pulis took over. Making a difference: Tony Pulis has guided Palace out of the bottom three . Another Cabaye classic . I have talked about Yohan Cabaye many times in this column but I’m not ashamed to mention him again. Against West Ham he produced yet another superb performance. His all-round game was just too much for them. He plays with the No 4 on his back but he’s no sitting midfielder. He roams around the pitch and gets involved everywhere, as his pitch map shows. Special player: Yohan Cabaye celebrates his goal against West Ham . Running the show: The heat map shows how Cabaye got around the pitch . Alan Pardew will want the transfer window to shut because Cabaye gives Newcastle’s midfield an extra dimension and he now has to be worth at least £20million. I don’t think Arsenal, Manchester City or Chelsea would be in the market for him, but he could be a real target for Manchester United, particularly with their problems in midfield. United need players who  are better than what they have got and, though he’s  not world class, Cabaye would fit the bill. Jose crowns his king David . David Luiz took the defensive midfield role to a new level. He offered a shield in front of John Terry and Gary Cahill, denying Danny Welbeck and Adnan Januzaj any room to breathe. But at times he was so deep it was more like watching a back five than a back four. I’ve never seen a midfielder head the ball more - Terry and Cahill barely had to go up for any of David de Gea’s goal kicks. Making it his own: David Luiz impressed in his role as a defensive midfielder . I was at the game and it was clearly something Chelsea had worked on. You could see Jose Mourinho barking orders at him to hold that line. Mourinho clearly thought: ‘Luiz is going to be my base, now it’s up to my front players to go out and win it.’ With a comfortable lead Mourinho, ever the pragmatist, ended up with seven defensive players on the pitch. Job done. Three's company . Six points separate the top three Championship teams and it might be up to three forwards to fire their sides to promotion. David Nugent at Leicester, QPR’s Charlie Austin and Danny Ings at Burnley could well be the difference. Football must stick to the facts . If we needed more proof that a fifth official and video replays won’t work in football, it came this weekend. The Luis Suarez penalty debate has raged on with plenty of disagreement. People say a fifth official would solve the problem. Good luck. How can they be expected to make the correct decision each time when people can’t even agree? I was in the TV studio on Saturday with Stiliyan Petrov, who is Aston Villa through and through. We both thought it was a penalty. If Brad Guzan does not come rushing out, there is no penalty but a lot of people will disagree. Going down: Luis Suarez is fouled by Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan . On his way down: Suarez falls down after a foul by Brad Guzan . If calls like this went upstairs, you would end up waiting around and any decision would still be questioned. Goal-line technology has been fantastic. But debates are part of the reason we love football and with incidents like this, it proves they are a matter of opinion, not fact.","Cazorla outshines Ozil as Arsenal stay top .

"By . Steve Nolan . With swathes of cloud covering almost one side of the planet, you'd be forgiven for mistaking this image for a primitive weather map of a section of Earth. But this is a weather forecast with a difference. NASA scientists have mapped cloud cover on a planet outside of the solar system for the first time. The image offers a first look at clouds on hot Jupiter-like planet Kepler-7b which is some 1,000 light-years away from the Earth. Under the weather: Kepler-7b (left) is the first exoplanet to have its clouds mapped. It is pictured alongside Jupiter (right) The extraordinary map was put together using three years of data from NASA's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes which have been studying the planet - known as an exoplanet. The low resolution map suggests that the planet is covered in high clouds in the west and has relatively clear skies in the east. The data was collected after the Kepler telescope spent just under seven days monitoring the planet and spotted a mystery bright spot on its western hemisphere. Kepler-7b was one of the first exoplanets discovered by the Kepler telescope. It orbits a star which is slightly hotter than the Sun and although the planet is about half the mass of Jupiter, it is nearly one-and-a-half times the size. It has been likened to Jupiter, but it is hotter.Kepler-7b orbits its host star every seven days at a distance of around 5.6million miles away. The planet's discovery was announced in January 2010. Scientists were unable to tell whether the spot was caused by heat or clouds and sent Spitzer in to keep tabs on the planet's temprature. Readings estimated the temperature to be between about 800C and 1,000C, a relatively cool temperature for a planet that orbits so close to its star and, according to astronomers, too cool to be the source of light Kepler observed. Scientists were therefore able to discern that the spot was light from the planet's host star reflecting back off the top of clouds. Brice-Olivier Demory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, said: 'By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution ""map"" of this giant, gaseous planet. 'We wouldn't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world, but we detected a clear, reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds."" 'Kepler-7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we've found, which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere,' said Thomas Barclay, Kepler scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. Similar: Kepler-7b has been likened to Jupiter, pictured, but is said to be hotter . Extra terrestrial: Kepler-7b was one of the first planets outside of our solar system to be discovered by the Kepler telescope . 'Unlike those on Earth, the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time -- it has a remarkably stable climate.' The Kepler telescope has discovered more than 150 confirmed planets outside the solar system. The telescope's problematic reaction wheels prevent it from hunting planets any more, but astronomers continue to pore over almost four years' worth of collected data from the planets already discovered. It is hoped that the same cloud-mapping techniques can be used to observe smaller Earth-like worlds.","NASA mapped cloud on Kepler-7b, 1,000 light years away from Earth .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Lillian Baddeley died after being ravaged by four infections she caught at a brand new 'super-hospital' just months after being admitted . A pensioner died after being ravaged by four infections she caught at a brand new 'super-hospital' just months after being admitted, her family say. Lillian Baddeley, 81, declined from being 'bright as a button' and was dead within eight months of contracting four separate superbugs at University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS). Her son Martin Bailey, 53, said she was 'systematically attacked' by the chest and stomach infections during her final four stays at the £400 million hospital. The grieving family claim the great-grandmother caught E-coli twice, ESBL and Enterobacter on the wards - and are now demanding answers as to why this was allowed to happen. Mr Bailey said: 'For her to contract four infections in a few months was terrible. 'They now have a spanking new multi-million pound hospital so it is unforgivable that people can still catch bugs so easily. 'Dad is inconsolable as he can’t understand why she won’t be coming home when she was so full of life not long ago.' Mrs Baddeley, a retired bakery worker, was first admitted to the hospital two years ago for seizure control after developing epileptic fits. But during her visit in February she developed E.coli and was kept in for 10 days. Her subsequent three spells at UHNS each extended to weeks as staff battled the infections. Mr Bailey said his mother’s last stay ended when she was transferred to Bradwell Community Hospital in the middle of the night where other vulnerable patients were being cared for - despite having an infection. But two weeks earlier, a consultant had allowed Mrs Baddeley home as her condition was deemed satisfactory. Mr Bailey, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., added: 'When they transferred her to the Bradwell she was full of infection which put all the other elderly patients with low resilience at great risk. 'It’s a disgrace that was allowed to happen.” Her son Martin Bailey, 53, said his mother was 'systematically attacked' by the chest and stomach infections during her final four stays at the £400m hospital . Mrs Baddeley, of Talke, Staffs., lost her fight for life at the care home last Thursday. Grandson-in-law Tim Prescott, 35, added: 'She was good fun but also such a proud and dignified lady for this to happen to.' Earlier this year an inquest heard that two premature babies died at the hospital because staff on at the hospital did not wash their hands properly. Jessica Strong was just 11 days old when she died after contracting a bug spread from another child also being treated at the hospital. A ‘breakdown in hand hygiene’ meant six babies became infected, with Jessica and one other killed as a result. Earlier this year an inquest heard that two premature babies died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) because staff did not wash their hands properly . The hospital admitted that negligence contributed to the deaths of the two babies. Fiona Howell, Matron for Older Adult Services, said: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Mrs Baddeley. 'Unfortunately, many frail and elderly people are susceptible to infections in the community, which then require treatment in an acute hospital. “We have met with Mrs Baddeley’s family today and fully reviewed her infection status since December 2012 with them. 'Mrs Baddeley was admitted to the acute Trust to be treated for these infections, which were already present. 'We are continuing to review further concerns that the family have raised today and will be meeting again in the near future.'","Lillian Baddeley fell ill at the University Hospital of North .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A toddler who hit puberty ten years early has been cured by brain surgery. The three-year-old's condition made meant his voice deepened, genitals grew and skin was covered with acne. He also became outlandishly aggressive. It started when he was just 18 months old. Cured: The boy was treated with deep skull brain surgery at Jimper medical centre in Puducherry, India . When his nervous parents took him to the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, medics discovered the child had 'precocious puberty'. At first he was put on a programme of regular injections to control the hormones. But after two years, his parents were struggling to afford the specialist treatment, which was set to continue for ten years but was having little effect. Desperate for another solution, they agreed to try skull base surgery to remove abnormal tissue in the area of the nervous system where hormones are produced. Dr V. R. Roopesh Kumar, head of neurosurgery at Jipmer, told the Times of India: 'Precocious puberty can be completely cured by appropriate medical or surgical intervention if diagnosed early. 'Children with this condition attain puberty before eight years of age. Rare: The parents from Puducherry paid for injections for two years but it was expensive with little to no effect . 'The patient responded well. It is a complex surgery as the abnormal tissue had to be removed without damaging the vital neurovascular structures surrounding it. 'His hormone values became normal for his age and he does not require any further treatment.' The condition, which produces an abnormal amount of sex hormones like oestrogen before the age of 10, is often caused by brain damage. It affects one in every 5,000 to 10,000 children in America but rarely affects somebody so young. Usually girls develop the disorder aged 9; boys aged 10. More commonly found in girls, the youngest parent in history was five-year-old Lina Medina, who gave birth in Peru in 1939.","The boy from Puducherry became surly, got acne and his voice broke .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A Sichuan man has caused public outcry in China after photos of him violently stripping his young daughter and dragging her 100 metres down a street emerged online - but police at the scene did not consider this abuse. The disturbing scenes were captured by a bystander who took the photos on a smart phone from within what could be a shop as the incident took place. Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter with more than 300 million users, has gone into a frenzy over the images. Shameful: The father of a young girl stops on a street to remove her top as scenes of drama unfold . It was reported by Shanghaiist that the man in the images lost his patience after the little girl refused for hours to wear her jacket. After loosing his temper, the man is pictured aggressively taking his daughter's top and jacket off before dragging her violently by the wrisits about 100 metres down the road - and with each step of his rage unknowingly documented. According to the neighbours, contrary to the images, the father has never laid a hand on his daughter and a spoils her by buying her everything she wants. There are unconfirmed reports he bought the her the jacket he later stripped off. In the first photo (above), the man, dressed in jeans and winter jacket, sits his young daughter down on the side of the road and starts taking her top and jacket off in what is clearly chilly weather. Aggressive: As the father continues to lose his patience, he forcefully removes the top from his young daughter, covering her vision . From here it appears he is losing his patience as he lifts his daughter to her feet. With the jacket covering her head and eyes, the young girl loses her footing and is unsteady on her feet as she dangles. Sadly a woman walking by watches on but does not intervene and continues walking off. Once the little girl's jacket is off, her upper body is naked and exposed in the cold weather. But unfortunately her father is far from finished and continues his abusive behavior by using one hand to grab the little girl forcefully by her wrists. With worse scenes yet to come, the man used his force to latch onto his daughter and by doing so, the little girl is pulled backwards unsteadily onto her bottom towards him with one leg in the air. Why?: After removing her top, the man uses one hand to grab his daughter by the wrists and starts dragging her down the road. A passerby pictured in the photo continues walking by as this happens . Once he has a firm grip of her, the man starts dragging the distraught child into the middle of the road and down the street. With her hands pulled back above her head she is unable to free herself and has no choice but to be dragged on her bottom against her will as her feet dangle in front of her. Shockingly, despite the lack of intervention from at least two people walking on the street, it is reported the police did not charge the man with child abuse. Police briefly got involved in the case, but decided that the incident was not severe enough for child abuse charges as, according to them, there was not any ""obvious beating or abuse"".

"By . Rebecca Camber . A former minister who once described the MP expenses scandal as ‘a wonderful moment of  British fiddling’ was facing jail  yesterday after pleading guilty to making bogus claims of £13,000. Denis MacShane is likely to spend Christmas behind bars after admitting swindling taxpayers out of £12,900 in forged receipts for research and translation services. He used the money to fund jaunts to Europe, including a trip to judge a literary competition in Paris. Denis MacShane (pictured with Czech supermodel Eva Herzigova when he was Labour's minister for Europe) is facing a possible prison sentence after admitting he stole nearly £13,000 from the taxpayer . The 65-year-old pleaded guilty at the . Old Bailey yesterday, ending an extraordinary political saga which has . raised questions about the protection offered to MPs by parliamentary . privilege rules. Notably absent from court was twice-married MacShane’s girlfriend, Vicky Pryce, ex-wife of former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne. Miss . Pryce, 60, was released in May after serving two months of an . eight-month sentence for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice . after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been . picked up by Mr Huhne who was also jailed. Absent from the court yesterday: MacShane's girlfriend, Vicky Pryce . MacShane’s shock admission comes four years after Parliament’s sleaze watchdog launched an investigation into his expenses and a year after a police inquiry concluded there was no case to answer, before detectives changed their mind in the light of newly uncovered parliamentary evidence. The former Europe minister first came under scrutiny in 2009 as Westminster was engulfed by the wider expenses scandal. MacShane was initially dismissive of the furore, writing in The Guardian in May 2009 that: ‘There will come a moment when moats and manure, bath plugs and tampons will be seen as a wonderful moment of British fiddling, but more on a Dad’s Army scale than the real  corruption of politics.’ But two months later the Commons standards commissioner, John Lyon, launched a formal investigation into his claims for laptops and translation services. In October 2010 Mr Lyon told Scotland Yard the invoices raised ‘questions of possible criminality’. However, officers were not given access to damning letters from MacShane in which he admitted using a ‘nom de plume’ to forge invoices from a body he controlled, the European Policy Institute. Career: MacShane served as Europe minister under Tony Blair, here he is shown meeting Slovenian foreign minister Dimitrij Rupel in 2004 . The Labour MP said the EPI had been a ‘convenient vehicle’ to fund research trips to the continent and admitted in one letter drawing funds so he could serve on a book-judging panel in Paris. The correspondence was withheld by the Commons authorities on the basis that it had been generated during parliamentary proceedings, and so was covered by the age-old principle of parliamentary privilege, intended to guarantee politicians freedom of speech. Police dropped the inquiry in July 2012 on advice from prosecutors. Then last November the Commons standards and privileges committee reopened its inquiry and recommended a 12-month suspension from the House, castigating MacShane for ‘19 false invoices over a period of four financial years which were plainly intended to deceive the parliamentary expenses authorities’. The report also disclosed, for the first time, the incriminating correspondence between the commissioner and MacShane. He immediately resigned as MP for Rotherham and apologised but insisted he had never gained personally and that he had paid back the cash. Police re-opened their probe in the . light of the fresh evidence and MacShane was charged in July, even . though the letters were still covered by parliamentary privilege and . would not be admissible in court. MacShane . continued to fight the charges, claiming he was given an assurance by . police that he would not be prosecuted. But yesterday he finally pleaded . guilty to a single count of false accounting between 2005 and 2008. Trip: One letter, dated October 2009, described how MacShane drew funds from the European Policy Institute so he could serve on a book judging panel in Paris (file picture) Warning him he may go to jail, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ‘You will understand clearly I’m sure that all sentencing options remain open to the court.’ Following the hearing, MacShane did not make any comment as he was released on bail, but he is understood to have accepted that he made a ‘grotesque mistake’. He is the sixth MP to face prosecution over the expenses scandal. Elliot Morley, David Chaytor, Jim Devine, and Eric Illsley were jailed in 2011 for fiddling their expenses. All four have now been released. Margaret Moran, who falsely claimed £53,000, was given a two-year supervision and treatment order. MacShane will be sentenced on December 19. Former Labour minister Denis MacShane is the latest politician to face punishment as a result of the expenses scandal that erupted in 2009. In May 2011 Elliot Morley was the first ex-minister to be jailed when he was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment. The ex-Labour MP for Scunthorpe pocketed £31,333 in claims for a ‘phantom’ mortgage and by grossly inflating the amount he was paying for another. Punished: Former Labour MPs Elliot Morley, left, Jim Devine were both given 16 month prison sentences . Other ex-Labour MPs Jim Devine, David Chaytor and Eric Illsley were all jailed for false claims. Chaytor, the former MP for Bury North, claimed around £20,000 by submitting false invoices for services he never received, and was jailed for 18 months. Illsley, ex-MP for Barnsley Central, wrongly claimed more than £14,000 and was sentenced to 12 months in jail. Sentence: Eric Illsley wrongly claimed more than £14,000, while David Chaytor claimed £20,000 . Devine, former MP for Livingston, the only one of the four whose case went to trial, claimed £8,385 and was also sentenced to 16 months. In November last year former Labour MP Margaret Moran was found to have fiddled her parliamentary expenses and received more than £53,000 to which she was not entitled. She evaded a jail sentence because and has not received a criminal record because she was deemed unfit to stand trial because of depression and so the jury could not find her guilty of any crime. Her false claims are so far the largest discovered in the expenses scandal. Tory Lord Hanningfield was jailed for nine months in 2011 after he was found guilty of illegally claiming £13,379 in parliamentary expenses, and the party's first black peer, Lord Taylor of Warwick was sentenced to 12 months in prison after he swindled £11,000 in false claims for travel and overnight subsistence. Former energy secretary Chris Huhne was jailed in March for perverting the course of justice after he lied about speeding points which his ex-wife Vicky Pryce took for him on her licence a decade ago. He served 62 days of his eight-month sentence.

"By . James Slack . and Becky Barrow . Mark Harper said that if firms were unable to find willing workers, they were not paying the market rate and should 'reflect' on the salary package they are offering . Businesses complaining about a lack of British applicants to fill job vacancies should pay higher wages, the immigration minister declared last night. Mark Harper said that, if firms were unable to find willing workers, they were not paying the market rate and should ‘reflect’ on the salary package they are offering. He hit back at the boss of Domino’s Pizza for claiming that the chain could instantly create 1,000 jobs - but too many British people do not want the work. Lance Batchelor, the chief executive of Domino’s, said it is ‘harder and harder’ to hire staff in this country, and criticised the government for making it too hard to recruit immigrants instead. He argued that, for a worker from outside the EU to get into the country, they needed to have a ‘PhD’. But Mr Harper said there was no question of the government relaxing immigration rules so Domino’s could ‘keep wages low’. He pointed out that Domino’s can recruit staff from within the entire EU without restrictions – an area that covers 500million people. Mr Harper told a committee of MPs: ‘If out of a market of hundreds of millions of people you cannot find enough people to work in your restaurant, you should look at how much you are paying. ‘Dominos should pay what the market demands to fill their roles’ The minister was last night backed by Sir David Metcalf, who is chairman of the Government’s migration advisory committee. Sir David said the comments by the Domino’s boss ‘beggar belief’. He added: ‘What is he wanting? Ukrainians?’ Mr Batchelor, whose chain employs 22,500 people in the UK, said earlier this week that it is ‘only those with PhDs who can get into the UK.’ He added: ‘You don’t need a PhD for our work, but it is work and we need staff.’ Lance Batchelor, chief executive of Domino's claimed his firm could create 1,000 jobs - but many people do not want to work. It comes as Ocado chairman Sir Stuart Rose criticised the work ethic of many Britons . His comments came after the former M&S boss also criticised the work ethic of many Britons. Sir Stuart Rose, who is now chairman of Ocado, the online delivery business, said it is wrong to criticise immigrants who are prepared to work for lower salaries than Britons turn down. He was quizzed specifically about Romanians and Bulgarians amid fears of a huge influx within weeks when current restrictions on their rights to work in Britain are lifted. At present, they can only work if they are self-employed or are one of a limited number of seasonal workers who are allowed to come for up to six months a year but must then go home. From 1 January 2014, they win the rights to get free access to the labour market in Britain, like other Europeans. Sir Stuart said: ‘These people are entitled to come here and if these people want to come here and work the hours they are prepared to work for the wages they are prepared to work, so be it. ‘There is nothing against that.’ Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show there are currently 542,000 job vacancies in the UK, a number which has risen by 62,000 over the last year. Sir Stuart added: ‘I believe that if I was out of work tomorrow morning that I could find a job by tomorrow afternoon. ‘It is up to people to decide whether they want to do the work for the pay that is being offered. If they don’t, somebody else is there to do it.","Mark Harper said firms unable to find workers are not paying enough .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two women who were sexually abused as children by their stepfather have spoken out in a bid to help other victims after his crimes went unpunished for nearly two decades. Katie Shortman, 24, and Dellisa Shortman, 25, have bravely spoken out after Paul Ward was jailed for four years when he admitted two counts of indecent assault. Ward, 50, of Sale, Greater Manchester, began abusing his two stepdaughters in the early 90s, when they were aged just five and six. Katie Shortman (right), 24, and Dellisa Shortman (left), 25, have waived their anonymity to speak out in a bid to help other victims of abuse . He was left to groom the girls with . sweets at their home and abuse them over a two-year period, despite . having a conviction for abusing a four-year-old boy and being known to . social services, the police and the CPS. The two sisters have now waived their right to anonymity, granted under the Sexual Offences Act 1992, and spoken out in a bid to help other victims of abuse. Katie, 24, said: 'He used to buy me sweets . and take me places which was something me and my sister rarely had when . he wasn’t around. I would plead with him to stop, crying, telling him he . was hurting me. My sister would try to fight him off. We both would be . screaming but nothing would stop him.' The . girls were taken into care aged seven and eight. Both spent the first . three years at a children’s home. But their bond was broken when they were separated. Katie became addicted to cocaine at the age of 12 and fell pregnant at 14, while still in the care system. She had three children by the age of 19 - two have been adopted and one was stillborn. Paul Ward, 50, began abusing his two stepdaughters in the early 90s, when they were aged just five and six . She . said: 'I used to take drugs, I’d run away and go into men’s houses. I . felt like I should be abused - I was conditioned in that way. I was . confused and alone, I had to grow up fast, I used to run away from . foster placements because it felt like I was being punished.' Because of her mental health problems, she lost custody of both her children. She . said: 'It kills me inside that I can’t hold my children, have a family, . and can no longer have the bond with my sister I once had. It feels . like everything has been taken from me because of this man’s disgusting . actions. He has ripped my life apart. While he has lived a free life for . the past 17 years, I have suffered in silence.' She said she feels the authorities failed her as a child - but has praised the police work after the case was reopened in 2011. She said: 'The police this time have been incredible, if it wasn’t for them I would still feel like nobody cared. 'I . hope no little girl or boy ever has to go through what I went through. All those people who should have protected us failed us greatly. Anybody . who is aware of a child being abused and does nothing about it is as . bad as the abuser. More needs to be done so agencies can work together . and get closure. I feel like Paul stole my innocence and social services . stole my potential.' She . went on to say: 'I won’t allow him into my heart. My life’s too . precious to have something so sick and twisted in it. What he did to me . impacted on how I saw life but I’m no longer a victim, I’m a surviving . victim. Even if I can help one child in the same predicament as me, I’ll . die happy.' She now plans to write a book about her experience in order to help others. She . said: 'I want for other children not to have to wait 17 years to get . someone to listen - give them the courage to come forward about their . abuse.' Sisters Katie and Dellisa Shortman have spoken out in a bid to help other victims of sexual abuse. Paul Ward (right), 50, began abusing his two stepdaughters in the early 90s, when they were aged just five and six . Dellisa, 25, . also has depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. She was . Ward’s first target and later, when he began to abuse her little sister, . Dellisa would try to protect her from their stepfather. After they were sent to different children’s homes they met only once a year. Dellisa . had a girl when she was 21 but she was adopted because Dellisa, who has . mental health and learning difficulties, was unable to care for her. She now lives in Oldham in a flat on her own. She said: 'I can’t forgive him, I feel like he should have got a lot longer. He took nearly 20 years of our lives.' She . went on to say: 'My child was taken off me. I’ve never had the right . support and it’s had such a big impact on my life. I don’t have the . close relationship with my sister that I should have.' The judge said there were a number of missed opportunities to stop Ward, who was convicted in 1993 of abusing a four-year-old boy . Jailing . Ward at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Judge Maurice Greene . told him: 'These two girls during the 1990s were let down by social . services, by the police, and by the Crown Prosecution Service. 'Had their case been dealt . with properly, it’s highly likely that you would have been before the . courts many, many years ago and some form of closure may have been . available to these two young women a long time ago.' The . judge said there were a number of missed opportunities to stop Ward, . who was convicted in 1993 of abusing a four-year-old boy, including a . police surgeon examination of Dellisa when she was a young girl which . showed evidence of abuse. Other missed opportunities . included a police interview with Katie in 1998 in which she told . officers her stepfather abused her; a police interview with Dellisa in . 1999 when she again complained of abuse; and reports from school that . the girls were showing symptoms of abuse. In each of these cases no action was taken. He . said: 'It really was not until 2011 when they were interviewed as . adults that prosecution followed. This was an indication of the change . in the prosecution authorities. That can only be for the better.' He added: 'What is clear is . that you abused your position as their stepfather. You abused the . position of trust you had in that family. Your abuse has had a . considerable effect on both these girls. You have ruined a large part of . their lives.' Earlier, the court heard how Ward would send his wife to the shops to have time alone with the girls, grooming them with sweets. Katherine . Pierpoint, defending, said Ward had shown genuine remorse for his . actions. She said he appeared a ‘rather pathetic character’, adding that . he had alcohol and cannabis addictions and that the period of abuse was . during a time of particularly heavy drinking. 'I won’t allow him into my heart. My life’s too . precious to have something so sick and twisted in it' - Katie Shortman . He was put on the sex offenders’ register for life. Greater Manchester Police said in a statement: 'These two girls who are now women reported the abuse to Greater Manchester Police and Trafford Council social services in 1998. 'A decision was made to take no further action against Paul Ward in 1999. 'The recommendation to discontinue the case came from a specialist who advised against the inquiry going further and this was considered at the time to be in the best interests of the victims. 'If such a recommendation was made to officers today, it would be challenged before an investigation was finalised. 'When the abuse was reported again in 2011 the case was immediately re-opened and a full investigation commenced. This investigation has led to the successful conviction of Paul Ward. 'GMP has changed the way it investigates crimes against vulnerable people and officers who investigate child abuse and domestic abuse now have a clear structure with dedicated lines of responsibility and ownership.' Trafford Council said that it would not be appropriate for it to comment on individual cases of this nature . It stated that safeguarding children and vulnerable young people has always been a key priority for the Council. A spokesman said: 'Current policies and procedures, together with the strength of its multi-agency working and information sharing continue to ensure Trafford’s effectiveness in helping protect local young people.'","Paul Ward began abusing his stepdaughters in the early 1990s .

"By . Darren Boyle . The parents of a woman who died on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 travelled from Perth, Australia to honor their daughter at the crash site in eastern Ukraine. Jerzy Dyczynski and Angela Rudhart-Dyczynski, parents of 25-year-old Fatima, crossed territory held by pro-Russian rebels to reach the wreckage-strewn farm fields outside the village of Hrabove. They last spoke to Fatima shortly before she boarded the flight for Kuala Lumpur in Amsterdam on July 17. Jerzy Dyczynski and his wife  Angela Rudhart-Dyczynski flew to Ukraine from Australia to see the site where their daughter Fatima died on board the doomed aircraft . Mr Dyczynski, right, along with his wife Angela, left were able to wander trough the debris field without being stopped by rebels who still control the site . Mr and Mrs Dyczynski became clearly emotional as they walked through the scene, inspecting the aircraft's wreckage searching for any sign of their daughter Fatima . Mrs Rudhart-Dyczynski said, 'We have promised our daughter we will come here.' Her husband added that his daughter 'was for peace. She will be forever for peace.' The Boeing 777-200 twin-engined passenger jet was shot down by pro-Russian separatists more than a week ago. Meanwhile,two cargo planes have flown 38 more coffins carrying victims of the Malaysia Airlines disaster out of eastern Ukraine to a forensic centre in the Netherlands for identification and investigation. Fatima Dyczynski, pictured, telephoned her mother and father in Australia shortly before boarding the doomed Boeing 777-200 from Amsterdam Schipol airport . Mr Dyczynski said he had to travel to Ukraine with his wife after making a promise to their daughter Fatima who was among the 298 casualties onboard MH17 .

Cows graze near the wreckage at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which remains scattered across fields despite being 10 days after the disaster . The Royal Netherlands Air Force returned a further 38 bodies to Holland earlier today where they will undergo a forensic examination in a bid to identify the remains . Soldiers could be seen carrying coffins with the remains of the victims of MH17 from a plane and into a waiting hearse at Eindhoven military airport today. It is the fourth day that Dutch and Australian transporter planes have brought the bodies from Charkov to the Netherlands, where the formal identification process will be carried out . Two cargo planes flew 38 coffins carrying victims of MH17 out of Ukraine and into the Netherlands today where they will be taken to a forensic centre for identification . Friends and relatives of the 298 victims of MH17 have laid thousands of floral tributes outside the main terminal building at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam . The planes took off from Kharkiv, a government-controlled city where the bodies have been brought from the crash site in territory held by pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian government. US and Ukrainian officials believe the plane was shot down by a missile from rebel territory, likely by mistake. Officials said the flights took the last of the victims that have been brought to Kharkiv, while international observers said there are still remains at the crash site. Access has been limited due to rebel interference and security concerns. The aircraft's two black boxes have been transferred from rebel-held territory to experts at the Air Accident Investigation Branch in Farnborough, Hampshire. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has faced severe international criticism for his failure to withdraw ongoing support to rebels in Ukraine. A Hercules C-130 transport plane of the Royal Dutch Air Force, carrying coffins with the remains of some of the victims of the MH17 plane crash, lands at Eindhoven military airport, Netherlands as airport staff line the runway to show their respect to those who lost their lives when the Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down on July 17 . The C130 Hercules transport aircraft has been shuttling between Ukraine and Holland after it was decided that the Dutch should co-ordinate the repatriation efforts . After being flown into Eindhoven military airport in the Netherlands, the coffins were transported in hearses which drove in convoy to a nearby forensic centre . The hearses, led by officials on motorbikes, took the coffins to a forensic centre where formal identification of the victims will be carried out . The floral display features heartbreaking tributes to the passengers and crew who all lost their lives after the aircraft was shot  down over Ukraine last week . Ukrainian forces have advanced to the outskirts of a key town north of Donetsk, officials said today, as they try to retake the stronghold held for months by pro-Russia rebels. The move comes as Ukrainian forces appear to have gained some momentum recently by retaking control of territory from the rebels. But Russia also appears to becoming more involved in the fighting, with the U.S. and Ukraine accusing Moscow of moving heavily artillery across the border to the rebels. Ukrainian national security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces were outside Horlikva, just north of the regional centre of Donetsk. 'The direct route is open for the forces of the anti-terrorist operation to the capital of the Donbass region - the city of Donetsk,' Lysenko said. 'The approaches to Donetsk are being blocked so that the terrorists do not get the chance to receive ammunition, reinforcements or equipment.' Donetsk, a city of about 1 million people, is a major center of the separatist uprising that has battled Ukrainian government forces for five months. Russia reacted angrily on Saturday to additional sanctions imposed by the European Union over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis, saying they would hamper cooperation on security issues and undermine the fight against terrorism and organised crime. Russia's Foreign Ministry also accused the United States, which has already imposed its own sanctions against Moscow, of contributing to the conflict in Ukraine through its support for the pro-Western government in Kiev. The 28-nation EU reached an outline agreement on Friday to impose the first economic sanctions on Russia over its behaviour in Ukraine but scaled back their scope to exclude technology for the crucial gas sector. The EU also imposed travel bans and asset freezes on the chiefs of Russia's FSB security service and foreign intelligence service and a number of other top Russian officials, saying they had helped shape Russian government policy that threatened Ukraine's sovereignty and national integrity. 'The additional sanction list is direct evidence that the EU countries have set a course for fully scaling down cooperation with Russia over the issues of international and regional security,' Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. '(This) includes the fight against the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction, terrorism, organised crime and other new challenges and dangers.' 'We are sure such decisions will be accepted with enthusiasm by global terrorists,' the ministry added.","Fatima Dyczynski was travelling to Australia aboard flight MH17 when it was blasted from the sky by rebels .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Technology’s attempt to thwart the best efforts of thieves can often fall short. But a new smart lock could change that by being able to protect against every possible theft attempt on a bicycle. Berlin-based group LOCK8 claims its device is the world’s first ever alarm protected, trackable, smart bicycle lock. Scroll down for video... Safe: A high-tech bike lock has been invented to combat thieves - by sending a message to the owner every time someone tries to tamper with it . Power: Built-in rechargeable LIfePo batteries . Casing: Industrial strength Polycarbonate shell . Connectivity: Bluetooth, GSM, GPRSE . Sensors: Three-axis gyroscope and accelerometer, vibration trigger switch, light sensor, temperature sensor . System capability: Apple iPhone 4S or later with iOS 6 or greater and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth 4 available soon . Alarm: Audible up to 120dB . The triangular device – which is compatible with 95 per cent of bikes - is attached to a normal bike chain and equipped with Bluetooth technology. It can be locked and unlocked remotely using Android or iOS smartphones and tablets, and has special sensors to detect thieves. For instance, a smart cable will warn if a thief attempts to use a bolt cutter, an accelerometer can detect drills, while a temperature sensor alerts the owner to blowtorches. The black, triangular device is attached to a normal bike chain and equipped with Bluetooth technology . LOCK8 will then send a text message to the owner and sound an ear-splitting alarm to let passers-by know that a theft is taking place. Given that 91 per cent of today people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them, 24 hours a day, the feature means that owners will always know whether their bike is safe. If the thief does manage to get away with the bike, the device also uses GPS and GSM technology allowing bike owners to find where it has ended up. Users can swipe the app to or set up the system to automatically unlock when they get within a few feet of the bicycle. The clever gadget runs on reusable batteries that can be charged through a USB lead. It was created by Franz Salzmann and Daniel Zajarias-Fainsod, who came up with the idea after their bikes were stolen. Users can swipe the app to or set up the system to automatically unlock when they get within a few feet . Lock8 was created by Franz Salzmann (left) and Daniel Zajarias-Fainsod (right), who came up with the idea after their bikes were stolen . Mr Salzmann, 28, from Berlin, said: 'We were talking about bicycle locks and wondered why there wasn't a smart bike lock, so we decided to invent one. 'When triggered a push notification is sent to your smartphone and a painfully loud alarm is sounded on the bike. 'When it is released it will work with iOS and Android and we are planning that a Windows version will be available in the future. The Lock8 could also be used by bike-rental agencies as a way to keep track of their fleets and keep them from being stolen. 'We have had requests from cities from all over the world wanting to use LOCK8 as a cornerstone of their bike sharing scheme,' said Mr Salzmann. The device costs around £110 and is available for pre-order. The Lock8 could also be used by bike-rental agencies as a way to keep track of their fleets and keep them from being stolen . If the thief does manage to get away with the bike, the device also uses GPS and GSM technology allowing bike owners to find where it has ended up .","LOCK8 can be locked using Android or iOS smartphones and tablets .

"By . Misty White Sidell . This month, IMF director Christine Lagarde emerged from brief public hiatus with a new, softer look. It appears that she is attempting using her wardrobe as a tool for reinvention as she continues to experience public unfavorability in France, following charges that she helped embezzle nearly €400 million of government funds in a fraud probe while serving as the country’s finance minister. Likely in an effort to soften her image to help staunch her plummeting approval ratings, Lagarde has grown out her cropped silver hair into a feminine, shoulder-length bob and has begun wearing many shades of pink. New look: This fall, Christine Lagarde reemerged from a lightened public schedule with longer hair and feminine sensibility (R) that is legions different from her previous, politically-shaped style (L) She wore a light pink Chanel suit to address the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in mid-September, and this month, a jewelled, vintage Chanel shift to a discussion at George Washington University. On the first day of the annual World Bank-IMF meetings Lagarde chose a new pink suit, and then re-wore the rosy Chanel suit on the following day. Her efforts at aesthetic reinvention may be seared with motive, but placing scandal aside, it presents an example of sartorial reform for women in both diplomatic circles as well as those belonging to Lagarde’s own peer group. Lagarde, 57, has served as the director of the IMF since 2011. She took over the position from Dominique Strauss-Kahn who resigned after a New York hotel maid publicly charged him with sexual assault. She was tasked with helping save the EU from falling off a fiscal cliff, and her clothes reflected the period with somber tones and restrictive shapes. Her hair, left in its natural silver-white tone, was consistently cut in a mannish crop that was both practical and assertive. While never straying far from chic . accoutrements like scarves, pearls, and Hermès bags, Lagarde still . dressed with diplomatic conformities well known to the few women in her . industry. Prim in pink: Lagarde sits for an interview with CNN during the annual IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington D.C. on October 10 . On duty: In January 2012, Lagarde and German chancellor Angela Merkel both display the conservative fashion and grooming styles typical of women in political fields . In . 2011, Lagarde was charged with participating in a fraud probe that paid . nearly €400 million of tax funds to French businessman Bernard Tapie. She was acquitted of the allegations in May but is still considered an . ‘assisted witness’ in the case, meaning that she could be charged at a . later date. Following the acquittal, Lagarde lightened her public schedule only to reemerge in full force late last month with a longer, feminine haircut and new clothes. While the IMF would not confirm to MailOnline if Lagarde has begun working with a wardrobe stylist, such an appointment would make sense. Seemingly overnight she has shed many of her scarves, which have been the subject of excessive social analysis, grown out her hair into a layered, shoulder-length bob, and set aside her valise of navy suits in favor of pearl-embellished, largely pink attire. 'She has begun to subvert not only her own industry’s standards, but those of her general age group as well' In doing so, she has effectively begun to subvert not only her own industry’s standards, but those of her general age group as well. Lagarde does not only appear . hyper-feminine by diplomatic criterion. Her hair trumps a known cultural . norm for women of their late fifties to cut their hair into a cropped . style as their follicle condition begins to wane with age. Grey hair, . too, is often masked beneath a monthly ritual of corrective hair . coloring. ‘I . think it’s a cultural thing that women feel after a certain point your . hair shouldn’t be long,’ says hairstylist John Barrett, who has a salon . in Bergdorf Goodman and styles Hillary Clinton’s hair. Longer locks: Lagarde shows off her new hairstyle at a speech earlier this month (L), which is much more feminine than her previous, signature coif (R) ‘It just wasn’t feminine, there was nothing feminine about it,’ Barrett says of Lagarde’s old style. He feels that the lack of femininity is often an issue with shorter cuts in general. Simon Doonan, creative director at large for Barneys New York, thinks that particularly in Lagarde’s case the ‘shorter Nineties corporate hairdo gave her an air of competence but it was starting to look a bit passé.’ In layman’s terms, Lagarde’s more . mannish haircut, paired with largely conservative attire, was in no way . going to lend her an air of personability in the public eye. But the cultural stipulation for shorter hair has much deeper implications than what simply meets the eye. ‘There is the sense of long hair on a . woman being out of control and that being inappropriate,’ Hazel Clark, . professor of fashion studies and chair of research at Parsons School of . Design says. ‘Long hair has always symbolized femininity, and when it’s . unkempt it is directly associated with sexuality.’ But . on a more macro level, long hair still ‘is often perceived as not being . appropriate as you age, since you are not looked at in a sexual context . anymore,’ says Clark. In Chanel: Lagarde particularly favors this pink suit by Chanel (L), which was included in the brand's spring 2012 runway show (R) Lagarde’s decision to leave her hair . in its au natural grey state is also unconventional. Typically, many . women feel pressured to dye their hair in order to improve their . perception in the workplace. But according to Doonan, ‘grey equals . gravitas.’ Indeed, short hairstyles are . practically de rigueur in Lagarde’s age group. In diplomatic circles, . the short cut (favored by Lagarde’s contemporaries including Angela . Merkel and Hillary Clinton) is a key part of the industry’s unwritten, . but socially enforced grooming standards that masculinize female . politicians’ appearance. 'Lagarde’s decision to . also broaden her fashion appeal could work out to be her greatest diversionary . tactic yet' Women within the political arena tend to avoid subscribing to fashion at many . costs, as a simple change in grooming or attire can lead to a distraction within the press (take Michelle Obama’s bangs as example). So it makes sense that hair aside, Lagarde’s decision to . also broaden her fashion appeal could work out to be her greatest diversionary . tactic yet. In the last year she has gone from being named 2012’s most . loved French female political figure, to many of the country’s news . outlets calling for her imprisonment. Fashion--often considered one of . the more powerful means of personal articulation--is perhaps the . quickest, most obvious way for Lagarde to try and change the public’s . perception. But her attempt at swaying popular opinion through her appearance must be orchestrated as a carefully balanced act. Buttoned-up: Last May, Lagarde traveled to Istanbul to meet with Turkey's Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan; her hair and clothes appear to blend in amongst the sea of suits, rather than sticking out . Chanel redux: In late September, Lagarde attended a dinner at the UN General Assembly, this time allowing her femininity to shine . ‘If one is seen as being too . interested in fashion and appearance you are considered not as serious . as one might be otherwise,’ Clark says. Clark adds that her sharp attention to fashion could represent a ‘pressure because she is representing the French nation and French women as a whole and is expected to demonstrate that stereotypical chicness.’ And at a time like this, it’s not unlikely that Lagarde would attempt to adapt to her countrymen’s pleasantly perceived archetype, rather than playing along with career social norms. But still, ‘There is only a certain point she can go [with fashion],’ says Clark. ‘It’s something that will only change if there are more women in politics. I still think she has the pressure of conforming to a certain extent.’","Christine Lagarde, who was acquitted of charges stemming from a massive fraud probe, has softened her look .

"By . Abigail Frymann . U2 manager Paul McGuinness has announced he is stepping aside after 35 years at the helm of the world famous band. The unofficial fifth member of the Irish rock group is also close to selling his management company, Principle Management, to Live Nation Entertainment. The New York Times said Madonna's manager, Guy Oseary, is set to take over as U2 manager. Retiring: Paul McGuinness, 62, pictured here with his wife Kathy Gilfillan, as well as Bono and his wife Ali Hewson . McGuinness has managed U2 since 1978, two years after four Dublin teenagers - Paul Hewson (Bono) on vocals, David Evans (The Edge) on guitar, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen on drums - formed a band. Under McGuinness' control U2 has gone on to sell in excess of 140 million records and win 22 Grammy awards. The band's last tour, called 360, grossed more than £438m in ticket sales and was seen by nearly seven million people around the world. Legacy: Retiring manager Paul McGuinness is credited with keeping U2 from breaking up early on in their career . Top of their game: U2, performing here in 2010 in Germany, have sold in excess of 140 million records and won 22 Grammy awards . McGuinness founded Principle Management in 1982 and became one of the most highly-rated executives in the music business. His client list also included PJ Harvey, The Rapture and Paddy Casey. In 1979, the year the band released their first single, Bono proclaimed: 'We're not going to let people rip us off, we want the money.' Bono has often called McGuinness U2's fifth member, and he has reportedly taken 20 per cent of the band's income. While other bands in the 1960s and 1970s were ruthlessly exploited or suffered at the hands of their larger-than-life managers, McGuiness was scrupulously fair with U2 and ensured they were never ripped off. A journalist from Hot Press, Bill Graham, persuaded McGuinness to become the band's manager, after they had performed a gig in Dublin in 1978. Back then, he was a film technician and his only prior experience was of managing a little-known Irish folk band Spud. McGuinness always vowed he did not influence the band's artistic direction. But he did exert some crucial influence in 1981 after Bono, The Edge and drummer Larry Mullen Jr became born-again Christians and told McGuinness the band was finished. Legends: at the 2011 Q awards the band was honoured as the greatest act of the past quarter of a century . Going global: pictured here in Sweden, U2 have won over audiences around the world . Wowed at the wall: As a prelude to Berlin's Fall of The Wall celebrations in 2009, U2 gave a free performance at Brendenburg Gate which formed part of MTV Europe Music Awards . McGuinness appealed to Bono's conscience, reminding him how much other people had spent on their forthcoming tour of the US. It worked, and the band went, and kept going back over the years. But one piece of McGuinness' advice that Bono has ignored is his view that artists should describe problems, not get embroiled in fixing them. Bono has lobbied the likes of President George W Bush and Vladimir Putin to urge them to cancel developing nations' debts. But in 2006 it emerged that U2's business transactions had been shifted to the tax-free Dutch holding company Promogroup - a move McGuinness helped to bring about. That revelation left Bono open to the charge of hypocrisy. Commenting on his forthcoming retirement, McGuinness, 62, said was delighted that Live Nation has joined him in creating a powerful new force in artist management. Distinctive: U2's 2009 Wembley gig was attended by a record-breaking 88,000 people and featured a giant spaceship-style claw over the stage . Making music history: Bono and bandmates took to the stage for the Make Poverty History concert in London's Hyde Park in 2005 that urged G8 leaders to cancel developing nations' debt, improve aid and make global trade rules fairer to poor nations . 'It could be seen as slightly poor etiquette for a manager to consider retiring before his artist has split, quit or died, but U2 have never subscribed to the rock 'n' roll code of conduct,' he told the New York Times. 'As I approach the musically relevant age of 64 I have resolved to take a less hands-on role as the band embark on the next cycle of their extraordinary career.' Good causes: Bono has been associated with a host of charitable causes. But details of U2's tax affairs which emerged in 2006 left him open to charges of hypocrisy . Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, is in talks to buy Madonna's management company Maverick. The move will result in Madonna's manager, Guy Oseary, taking over the management of U2 and day to day running of Principle, while McGuinness will become chairman of Principle Management. Live Nation is due to issue a statement on the deal, which is worth an estimated 30 million US dollars (£18.7m). What a line-up: U2 were the supporting act when The Police performed at the International Stadium, Gateshead, in 1982 . Hair to stay: Bono (left) shows off his mullet at a 1985 performance in Milton Keynes . In the beginning: U2, young and fresh-faced in Dublin in 1978 . Before the big time: Bono said at the outset he didn't want anyone to rip them off, and McGuinness ensured that never happened . In 2008, Live Nation struck a deal with U2 to handle the band's touring and merchandising exclusively for 12 years. According to Pollstar, a concert industry trade magazine, the top 10 highest-grossing tours include four by U2 and one by Madonna. McGuinness has received many international awards including Pollstar Personal Manager of the Year and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Irish music industry in 2002, and the Peter Grant International Manager of the Year Award in 2006. In 1999, together with U2, he received the Freedom of the City of Dublin.","Paul McGuinness is to hand the running of the band to Madonna's manager .

A sick Howard Stern fan has disrupted MSNBC's live coverage of the tragic MH17 crash with a prank call on live TV claiming that the jetliner had been shot down by the shock jock's farts. The caller tricked his way onto live national TV by saying he was Staff Sergeant Michael Boyd from the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine who had witnessed the horrific explosion that left 295 people dead. 'Well I was looking out the window when I saw a projectile flying through the sky and it would appear that the plane was shot down by a blast of wind from Howard Stern's a**,' the caller deadpanned.

"By . Ruth Styles . 10-year-old Izzedine lives with his family in a two-room container in a refugee camp located on the Turkish border with Syria. One of an estimated 1.5 million Syrian child refugees, his brother Omar, just 15, is often away fighting with the Free Syrian Army, while his father, badly injured two years ago, remains in camp. But while the plight of Syrian refugees is well documented, less well-known is the impact the experience has had on the children - in Izzedine's case, a shockingly adult hatred of the Assad regime and ambitions to 'do jihad'. Scroll down for video . Devastating: Baraa, eight, from Homs, saw her mother's body after she was decapitated in a missile attack . Fighter: Izzadine, 10, lives in a refugee camp on the Turkish border and says he is 'ready for jihad' 'When . [the Syrian uprising] started, we went out to protest in the streets,' he says. 'I was still seven . years old and I would keep crying and telling my father I am ready for . jihad. 'Now I am older, I am ready for jihad.' Sadly, as a new BBC documentary makes clear, Izzedine's shocking confession is by no means unique - and neither is his attitude confined to the rebel side. Another child to appear is 14-year-old Jalel Suleiman who lives in Damascus with his father who is currently fighting for one of the Assad regime's 'neigbourhood defence units'. Like Ezzadine, he displays a disturbingly adult appreciation of the situation, speaking endlessly of the need to 'defend the homeland' and of his pride in his 'martyred' uncle. 'Of course we all worry about my father but like anyone who loves his country, he must make a sacrifice and give his life for Syria,' adds the teenager. 'You . won't find a country better than ours. I'd tell [rebel supporters] to return home and . live with us in peace or they'll suffer the same fate as these armed groups.' Clearly, the Syrian conflict, which has so far ground on for more than three years and claimed more than 150,000 lives, will not be ending any time soon. But in a frightening glimpse of what might be around the corner, many of the children interviewed by the BBC's Lyse Doucet spoke of wanting to take revenge on the opposing force or, as in Izzedine's case, become jihadis. 'I . would like to go back to school and become a teacher one day,' says Izzedine's fighter brother Omar. 'But I was . not lucky and now all I have in my head is never to drop my weapon . until Bashar [al-Assad] falls. Devastating: Homs, a former rebel stronghold, was reduced to rubble by indiscriminate government bombing . Grim: Izzedine lives in a container in a refugee camp like this one on the Turkish border . 'I feel that I'll be martyred, God willing. I am not . afraid for myself because I know I'll be a martyr. It's better to start a war and get killed rather than live like animals under the regime's control.' 'We made this film because we realised that by listening more closely to the children, we would see the shape of a country's future - and it's a troubling one.,' revealed Doucet in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'Children are not just cute or compelling sidebars in the worst wars of our time; they are front and centre on the frontline.' One girl who knows all about life on the frontline is eight-year-old Baraa from Homs, the scene of some of the worst fighting the war has seen so far. Baraa, who lives in the old quarter, was trapped behind rebel lines during a government siege and was forced to eat the family pet, a cat, to survive. Patriotic: Jalal, whose father is a member of Assad's National Defence Unit, is proud of his Syrian homeland . Haunted: Daad still dreams about the friends who were killed when her village was shelled by rebels . Worse still, her mother and brother were killed by a missile strike, the little girl catching a glimpse of her parent's decapitated body before her father was able to take it away. 'The . siege was really difficult,' she remembers. 'We ate cats. We had about 40 rats in our . home and a cat. She would eat them all. 'Then a month later, they . slaughtered her too. They sent some of it to us. They didn't tell us . what it was at first. We ate it and the next day, they told us it was . cat meat.' Others, such as 11-year-old Daad Sebbagh who lives in Damascus, say they are haunted by the faces of the friends they've lost - in Daad's case, her playmates from her home village which was flattened by rebels in the early days of the war. 'We were sleeping when the shelling . started,' she says. 'My mother and father lay on top of us to protect us. 'Men came . and woke us up at 4am, grabbed us from behind and took us downstairs. When they did that to us, we were terrified. 'We saw two men taking my . parents out of the house. They did that because all the surrounding . houses were flattened. When we left the house, it collapsed.' The bombardment killed many of the villagers and two years on, Daad is still haunted by their deaths. Fighting: The war in Syria has raged for more than three years and has killed an estimated 150,000 people . 'In my . dreams, I go back to my old town and I see the ghosts of my friends. I . see them and I see people who were shot, who are still alive. I wake up . and can't go back to sleep.' Tragic though Daad's story is, what worries Doucet is what will happen when she and the other children grow up. 'We were shocked by how children as . young as nine years old spoke passionately of seeking revenge,' she says.

"By . Jo Knowsley . and Sharon Churcher . Controversial: Experts have warned thousands of women to stop using the NuvaRing, pictured . A British woman has been stricken with potentially deadly blood clots after being put on a controversial new contraceptive that allegedly killed a 24-year-old US law student last year. Thousands of UK patients are being warned to stop using NuvaRing by experts who have told The Mail on Sunday it puts women at a far higher risk of heart attacks and strokes than traditional forms of birth control. Marketed by pharmaceutical giant Merck, the device is available free on the NHS. In addition, this newspaper has learned that women whose doctors may have qualms about prescribing it can buy it on the internet after a cursory online medical ‘consultation’. The vaginal contraceptive ring  is impregnated with a cocktail of hormones, released for a month after it is inserted, making it seem an appealing alternative to the Pill. Some 9,000 British women have used it since its approval by UK regulators  in 2008. But a 44-year-old English mother-of-one has consulted lawyers about massive blood clots on her lungs which she claims developed after she was prescribed the device. Claire Tellis-Doherty, head of a medical negligence team compiling a database about the drug’s alleged dangers, said the woman – identified only as Lorraine –  was fit and healthy before being put on the ring. ‘In 2012 she began to feel constantly tired,’ Ms Tellis-Doherty said. ‘She visited her GP on three occasions but was told nothing was wrong. But by 2013, she couldn’t walk without being breathless. After she was admitted to hospital, it was discovered she had massive blood clots covering around 40 per cent of both her lungs.’ Lorraine survived the crisis but was allegedly left with low blood pressure that ‘potentially shortened’ life expectancy. Tragic: Erika Langhart, 24, died after suffering two heart attacks allegedly caused by using the Nuvaring contraceptive . The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has disclosed that it has received 23 reports of ‘spontaneous suspected adverse drug reactions’ relating to NuvaRing, some involving blood clots. In the US, where NuvaRing has been available since 2002, over 3,500 lawsuits have been filed claiming the device has caused serious health problems, culminating in the death last year of 24-year-old law student Erika Langhart, after two heart attacks allegedly caused by the ring. Dr Michael Carome, head of Washington-based Public Citizen Health Research Group, told this newspaper he believes statistics show the device should be banned. ‘As long as Nuva-Ring remains on the market, our advice to women is to avoid it,’ he said. NuvaRing is available free from UK GPs and at family planning and sexual health clinics. It is also sold on Internet sites including PharmaDoctor, which ‘approved’ a MoS reporter’s purchase after an online consultation, despite her saying she was obese – which significantly increases blood clot risks. Merck insists ‘the safety and efficacy of NuvaRing were originally established in clinical trials involving more than 3,700 women.’ But the company website adds: ‘The risk of getting blood clots may be greater with the type of progestin in NuvaRing than with some other progestins in certain low-dose birth control pills.’","British woman seeking legal advice after suffering blood clots in her lungs .

Swedish actor Mikael Persbrandt played shape-shifitng monster Beorn who shelters wizard Gandalf, the dwarfs and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins from the orcs in the film The Hobbit. Persbrandt, 51, was charged in a complicated drugs case involving ten other people after his number was discovered on a dealer's phone. Swedish actor Mikael Persbrandt who played one of the key characters in the smash hit hobbit movie has been jailed for five months after he was found guilty of buying 12 grams of cocaine . His lawyer Per Liljekvist argued that the number being in the phone was no proof that he had been buying the drugs, saying: 'If it turns out an order was made, it was another person who used his phone.' He maintained that Persbrandt had been at a party on the evening when it was alleged the drugs had been bought, and that he often left his mobile phone lying about. After the sentencing the actor immediately appealed through his lawyer and it will now be up to the appeals court to decide whether it will allow the appeal to go ahead and then to decide whether or not to uphold the lower court judgement. The prosecutor Lars Agren said he is convinced that whether the Appeals Court looks at it or not the verdict will remain the same, adding: 'I think there is sound evidence and it was a sound investigation.'

"By . Damien Gayle . Extremist Islamists may well have wondered how they could possibly celebrate the happiest day of their lives - their wedding - while at the same time re-affirming their commitment to violent jihad. Or they may not have. In any case, the gap in the market has now been filled by the Islamic State, which is offering honeymoon bus tours across its self-declared caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria. The move into tourism comes after the group, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, opened a marriage bureau for women who want to meet the jihadi of their dreams.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A major international airline has axed flights over Iraq due to concerns about missile strikes following the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. Emirates has decided to re-route planes along different flight paths amid concerns about the dangers posed by Islamic militants on the ground, it has emerged. Sir Tim Clark, president of the Dubai-based airline, said he believed other airlines would soon follow suit as he called for government agencies to offer more advice about flying over conflict zones. Sir Tim Clark, president of Dubai-based airline Emirates, said planes would be re-routed along different flight paths over the next week to 10 days amid concerns about missile strikes and the dangers posed by militants . The move comes after MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile while travelling over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, on July 17. Mr Clark said Emirates flights would be re-routed over the next week to ten days and confirmed routes being considered included over Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea, over Cairo and into European airspace, or over Iran. He said he had taken action because he was no longer ‘comfortable’ with planes flying over ISIS-held territory in Iraq. ‘This is a political animal but the fact of the matter is MH17 changed everything, and that was very nearly in European airspace,’ he told The Times. ‘We cannot continue to say, “Well it’s a political thing”. We have to do something. We have to take the bull by the horns.’ Emirates currently operates the largest number of flights over Iraq, with more than 50 a day travelling in and out of British airports. The country lies on the border of the main flight path between Europe and Asia, with hundreds of aircraft passing over it each day. A popular route is over the Iraqi city of Mosul, a stronghold of ISIS militants. The above map, which shows routes taken by major airline carriers this month, shows how planes are flying over dangerous areas of the world. Dotted lines are probable routes for which exact data is not available . The above graphic shows the flight paths of a snapshot of planes flying over Mosul, an ISIS stronghold in Iraq, last weekend. The prospect has been raised that ISIS has missiles which could shoot down a plane . ISIS, the terrorist group which took over swathes of Iraq in June and declared it an 'Islamic State', are a brutal, anti-West group which has boasted of holding mass executions, crucifixion and imposing hardline Islamic law on its conquered territory. The move by Emirates comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between airline industry groups today, which will see chiefs discuss possible ways to reduce the risks of flying over conflict zones. The meeting, held by the International Civil Aviation Organisation – a United Nations body – comes following two major air disasters this month. As well as MH17 being shot down, an Air Algerie plane crashed in Mali, north Africa, on Thursday, killing all of the 116 passengers on board. It is not yet clear what brought down the plane.","Emirates will stop flying over Iraq and re-route planes to other flight paths .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC has lavished  more than £10million on consultants in the past year. Its total consultancy bill doubled in just 12 months as executives spent thousands of pounds on personal ‘advisers’ from firms such as Deloitte, Accenture and KPMG. But despite awarding hundreds of contracts - at huge expense to licence fee payers - the corporation refused to provide any details of what they were hired to do. 'Not an easy ride': Director-general Tony Hall promised to tighten spending on consultants just last month - but the cost to the BBC has increased . Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show the BBC paid a total of £10.4million to external consultants in the financial year up to March. The bill in 2011/12 was £5million. The five biggest recipients were Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and McKinsey. Only last month director-general Tony Hall promised to reduce spending on consultants. He told the Commons culture, media and sport committee: ‘I want to reduce the amount of money that we pay on consultants, I really do. I am not an easy ride when it comes to consultants.’ But the BBC is already on course to rack up another huge bill this financial year, spending £4.7million in the six months between April, when Lord Hall took up his role, and September. Last night Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, threatened to drag Lord Hall to the House to explain the enormous bill in person. She said: ‘This is public money. You’ve got to account for it properly. They better have a jolly good explanation for why they need so much consultancy in an organisation that is slimming down on management anyway. ‘They have to say what the consultants were hired to do. They can’t carry on with this secrecy.’ In the past two years, 22 divisions of the corporation – including the BBC Trust, the human resources department and the finance team – have employed the help of management consultants. The corporation refused to release details of what projects any of the consultancy firms were hired for, or how much each was paid. Deloitte alone earned £5.7million in BBC fees between January and August this year, it emerged yesterday. It is thought much of the recent increase in consultancy fees has been driven by senior executives hiring external advisers to help them do their jobs rather than rely on the BBC’s own staff. It is believed the BBC’s £300,000-a-year director of operations,  Dominic Coles, employs a Deloitte consultant as his ‘chief adviser’. In September, the BBC’s £295,000-a-year strategy chief James Purnell was criticised for recruiting former Labour spin chief Godric Smith to provide PR advice. The BBC already had 140 staff in its PR department with a salary bill of around £5million. Tory MP Conor Burns, who sits on the culture, media and sport select committee, said the consultancies’ bill was a ‘staggering waste of money’. He added: ‘It is an extraordinary, unnecessary bill. We have a new director-general appointed with a clear mandate to draw a line under the past and get a grip. ‘He has recruited a team of hand-picked managers who he says are the best people to sort out the BBC’s problems, and they are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. ‘Why, if this phalanx of managers are so good, can’t they do their jobs without the help of external consultants?’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC in common with other large organisations does employ consultants when we need specialist advice and guidance on projects that are outside of the normal course of our business and where it would not be cost-efficient to maintain these specialist skills in-house.","Corporation has doubled its spending on advisers in just one year .

"By . Steve Doughty . People who live in the countryside are better educated and more likely to have a job, according to an official analysis. Middle England as it used to be lives on in rural areas, the figures show, with more married families and people who say they are Christians than in the towns and cities. There are fewer people in the countryside who have never passed a school or college exam, and rural dwellers are also more likely to hold a university degree, at almost 30 per cent compared with 26 per cent. Wantage, a quintessential Middle England town in Oxfordshire: People who live in the countryside are better educated and more likely to have a job according to official analysis . That advantage translates into the world of work, with 64 per cent in the country in employment, compared with 61 per cent in urban areas. The gap between cities and the countryside is revealed in figures from the 2011 national census, published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figures, which cover England and Wales, show that more than ten million people live in country districts, or some 18.5 per cent of the population. Their average age is 45 – older than the average of 37 in cities. Daily commute: In cities the proportion of people who say they are Christians is 57.6 per cent compared to 66.9 per cent in the country . Rural people are more likely to be . married, with almost four in ten homes headed by a married couple, . compared with fewer than a third in towns. Christianity . is still the bedrock of rural belief, with more than two-thirds of the . countryside population – 66.9 per cent – considering themselves . Christians. Only 1.5 per cent of rural dwellers profess any other faith. In cities the proportion who are Christian is just 57.6 per cent. However, Christian affiliation has fallen almost as fast over the past decade in the countryside as in towns and cities. The fall, from 78.3 per cent of rural dwellers being Christian in 2001 to 66.9 per cent in 2011, suggests the Church of England is losing ground in its shire heartlands. The data shows that immigration has had a much greater impact in towns than rural areas, despite many migrants working in agriculture. Just under 95 per cent of people  living in country areas of England and Wales were born in the UK, compared with 85 per cent in towns. The same proportion said they were white British, compared with 77 per cent in towns and cities. The ethnic make-up of rural areas was virtually unchanged in a decade, while the proportion of white British people fell in towns. The ONS commented: ‘Migrants from Eastern Europe have at times been associated with agricultural work within England and Wales. ‘It is interesting to note, therefore, that only 6.2 per cent of residents born in EU accession countries and living in England and Wales were actually living in rural areas.’","Fewer people in the countryside have never passed an exam .

"By . Sarah Dean . A shadowy Malaysia based company has applied to trade mark the word 'MH17' in what could be a sick attempt to profit from the tragic Malaysia Airlines disaster. A business called Remit Now International Limited lodged an application with the Australian Trade Mark Office on July 18, just hours after 298 people were killed when their plane was shot out of the sky by a missile above eastern Ukraine. Amongst the passengers on the doomed flight were 37 Australian citizens and residents. The application on the Australian Trade Mark Office website, seen by Daily Mail Australia, shows that it is currently being examined by officials. Sick: A mysterious Malaysia based company applied to trademark the word 'MH17' within 24 hours of the disaster happening . The company has applied for a Class 41 trade mark which includes entertainment, educational and cultural services which would cover film production, exhibition, curatorial and gallery services and live performances. A person who owns a trade mark in Australia may be able to stop other people using the same or a similar trade mark in the country. This means, for example, if someone wants to make a documentary about MH17 they may not be able to use the word 'MH17' or may have to pay the company for the right to use it. The mysterious business is registered to an address in an apartment block in Kuala Lumpur but they also have a post office box at the Australia Fair shopping centre on Queensland's Gold Coast. Offices? The shadowy business is registered to an address in an apartment block in Kuala Lumpur (pictured) The people behind the company are not named, they do not have a website and no contact details are available for them. A spokesperson for the Trade Mark Office, IP Australia, told Daily Mail Australia: 'The trade marks will be examined in due course'. 'Prior to that examination we are unable to say whether it will be accepted or not. However, there is provision within the Trade Marks Act to object to marks which are considered  ""scandalous"", they fall under s42(a) of the Trade Marks Act,' they said. It typically takes approximately 4-8 weeks for a trade mark to be examined. 'If it were to be accepted for registration, any interested third party can oppose its acceptance. If a trade mark is registered it means that the registered owner of the mark has proprietary rights to use as a trade mark for the goods and or/services claimed, this does necessarily preclude others from using or referring to the term outside the parameters of the trade mark,' the spokesperson added. Cashing in? As families of the 298 people killed on flight MH17 grieve around the world, the company is trying to trademark the flight's name . Devastated: Family and friends attend a multi-faith service at St. Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne on Thursday for those who lost their lives on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 . Asked whether they often received applications for trade marks based around disaster events, they explained 'it is not a common occurrence for these types of marks to be filed, but it can occur'. A Malaysia Airlines spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they are trying to block the application by also applying to trade mark the name. 'Malaysia Airlines has started the process of filing the trademark over ""MH17"". The purpose is to ensure no party takes advantage of the tragedy for their personal gains,' they said. Sadly this is not the first trade mark application for the word 'MH17'. A Belize based company named incorporated Seyefull Investments Ltd has applied to the European Trade Mark and Design Network website to trademark 'MH17' in Europe, Digital News Asia reports. A corporate lawyer told the website that the most obvious reason why one would want to register 'MH17' is probably due to the potential of movies or books being made around the event. 'However, one should also question whether they infringe the rights owned by Malaysia Airlines in applying to register such a mark in the first place. 'Usually, the Registrar would not allow registration should it feel that this infringes the existing rights of another party. MAS still retains the common law proprietary rights in the mark,' she said. Devastation: The crash site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, in a field near the village of Grabove, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine . Tragic: This photo shows a Malaysian expert checking the debris at the main crash site of the Boeing 777 Malaysia Airlines flight . A trade mark registration initially lasts 10 years from the date the application is filed. It can also be renewed indefinitely by paying renewal fees. Earlier this week it was revealed the names and photos of Australian MH17 plane crash victims are being exploited by online scammers who have set up fake Facebook tribute pages to drive traffic to a dodgy external website. The Facebook pages, created on the day the plane crashed, baited people to click on another website with a link purporting to show footage of the MH17 disaster. 'Video Camera Caught the moment plane MH17 Crash over Ukraine.Watch here the video of Crash,' the link read. Scroll down for video . Scammers have created fake Facebook accounts for MH17 victims, including the three young Perth children who died with their grandfather . Victims targeted by the scam include young Perth siblings Otis, Evie and Mo Maslin, Canberra woman Liliane Derden and Fatima Dyczynski, who was born in Germany but was on flight MH17 because she was moving to Perth. The scam also exploited the names of victims from other countries, including Quinn Lucas Schansman from the US, British-born Kiwi Rob Ayley, Malaysia Airlines pilot Eugene Choo Jin Leong  and Richard Mayne, Ben Pocock and Liam Sweeney from the UK. Facebook has taken down the pages but the external site goalshighlights.com remains live. It was registered in Bucharest, Romania in 2010 and the ISP address tracks back to the Netherlands. Ken Gamble, chairman of the Australian chapter of the International Association of Cybercrime Prevention, said it looked like the website had been hacked in order to divert to adult hook up websites and others selling counterfeit drugs. Online fraud experts said the pages were in poor taste but would only be forcibly removed by Facebook if they were criminal . 'I've seen this quite a lot, hackers get in, take control of a site and they then divert to a stack of stuff and use the bandwidth of this guy's website sometimes for illegal purpose sometimes or for getting the hits up on certain sites,' Mr Gamble said. He added that the websites that goalshighlights.com diverted to contained malicious files that would infect a user's computer if clicked on. Canberra mother-of-two Liliane Derden was one of the victims targeted by the scam . Mr Gamble added that fraudsters often capitalised on disasters like the MH17 crash. 'When a disaster like this happens it's a great opportunity for all sorts of scammers,' Mr Gamble told Daily Mail Australia. 'Everybody is out there looking for information at the moment, everyone wants to know more about what's happened. 'It's a great opportunity to prey on people's vulnerabilities and emotion is the greatest one.' Scammers aim to lure a portion of the high amount of internet traffic going to websites with MH17 information, Mr Gamble said. 'Some people will be using it for an opportunity to market their sites, it's a good way to bring a massive amount of traffic to someone's site,' he said. 'Other offenders will be doing this for more sinister purposes.' Before the Facebook pages were removed users expressed outrage, labelling them 'disgusting' and the person who created them a 'sicko'. Others reported the pages to Facebook as spam in the hope of getting them taken down. But some Facebook users did not realise the pages were fake, posting heartfelt messages to the page. 'Incredible, terrible...To lose your kids in this way...Such beautiful lovely children...no words...' one person wrote on the page of Mo Maslin. 'We pray for all the Australian people, especially the children god will take care of them in his safe hands let the stars shine bright for u so u know that ur not alone,' another person posted. A spokesman for Facebook said: 'We are disabling these profiles as soon as we are made aware of them. 'We encourage people to block those responsible and report suspicious behaviour to our team of experts via our reporting buttons so that we can quickly take the appropriate action.'","Company in Kuala Lumpur applied to the Australian Trade Marks Office to have the term 'MH17' trademarked .

Speaking at an Eid el-Fitr - breaking of the fast - event in the northwestern city of Bursa, he claimed Turks had 'abandoned their values' and pleaded people to rediscover the Koran. Describing his ideal chaste man or woman, Arnic said they should both have a sense of shame and honour. 'Chastity is so important,' he said. 'It is not only a name. It is an ornament for both women and men. [She] will have chasteness. Man will have it, too. He will not be a womaniser. 'He will be bound to his wife. He will love his children. She will not laugh in public. She will not be inviting in her attitudes and will protect her chasteness,' he added. According to the Hurriyet Daily News, he went on to condemn the transformation of young females in society. He said: 'Where are our girls, who slightly blush, lower their heads and turn their eyes away when we look at their face, becoming the symbol of chastity?' Arınç also said he was frustrated by high consumption, referring to the number of cars and mobile phones that individuals now own. Targeting women once more, Arınç said women discuss unnecessary things such as 'recipes' on the phone and should, in future, reserve these conversations for when they meet face-to-face. He also said people should not use their personal cars too excessively, adding that even if the River Nile  was full of oil, there would not be enough fuel to power cars. Condemning society: He also said that women should not talk on their mobile phones 'unnecessarily' and should reserve conversations for when they meet face-to-face (file picture) Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu, who is running for the president against Arınç’s boss, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan, commented on Arınç’s statement via Twitter, saying Turkey needed women to laugh because of a need to hear their happiness. Mr Arınç is a member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) which conservative values leading to it being described as Islamist. Turkey has historically been more progressive with women’s rights than neighbouring countries but problems concerning honour killings and domestic violence have prompted concern. Tayyip Erdogan said he is 'glad' to give money back . The Turkish Prime Minister has said he is happy to return a reward he received from the American-Jewish Congress in 2004 for helping to broker peace between Israel and Palestine, after they labelled him the world's most 'virulent anti-Israeli leader'. Last week the New York-based organisation condemned Tayyip Erdogan after he suggested Israel had 'surpassed Hitler in barbarism' through its attacks on Gaza. As a result, officials from the group demanded that he return money they handed to him for his efforts to improve relations between the countries a decade ago. According to World Bulletin, an open letter from Turkey's ambassador to Washington, Serdar Killic, to American Jewish Congress President, Jack Rosen, stated Mr Erdogan would be 'glad' to give the money back. It read: 'The absence of this award will not prevent Prime Minister Erdogan from resolutely fighting against terrorism, working towards the peaceful solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and upholding the safety and well-being of the Jewish community in Turkey.' 'Instead of acting according to the requirements of international law, Israel continues its occupation and destruction policies ... (and) attempts to depict Prime Minister Erdogan's legitimate criticisms of the Israeli government's attacks on civilians as expressions of anti-Semitism is an obvious distortion and an effort to cover up the historical wrongdoings of the Israeli government,' it continued. 'We would like to urge you to publicly condemn the Israeli government's policies that have caused public outrage around the world.'","Bülent Arınç complained about 'moral corruption' at an Eid el-Fitr meeting .

"By . Sanchez Manning . Festive appeal: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has urged Christmas shoppers to give money to Britain's expanding network of food banks . The Archbishop of Canterbury has urged Christmas shoppers to give money to Britain’s expanding network of food banks rather than splash out on expensive presents. The Most Reverend Justin Welby made the appeal in reaction to news of a shocking increase in the number of impoverished Britons now relying on food handouts. With the number of those receiving basic supplies trebling over the past year to 350,000, he said it would be ‘wonderful’ if people gave a tenth of their festive shopping budget to their local food bank this Christmas. The Archbishop also warned cash-strapped shoppers to beware of overspending and plunging themselves into debt. He said: ‘I am not a Scrooge. But what I would say to people is, be sane about it.‘Don’t overstretch yourself and end up with an enormous debt hangover.’ Archbishop Welby’s warning comes as it was revealed that Britons will spend an average of £28.70 on each present this Christmas – an increase of £1.70 on the figure for 2012. And a YouGov survey reported earlier this week that UK households are set to spend £822 on their seasonal celebrations – £54 more than last year. The comments are the latest in a string of outspoken pronouncements made by Archbishop Welby in recent months. Appearing on television earlier this week, he complained about what he called a ‘secular over-the-topness,’ adding: ‘New this, new that, new the other – it’s ridiculous, it’s absurd, it shouldn’t happen.’ And in an interview with The Mail on Sunday last month,  he hit out at energy firms for imposing huge price hikes on struggling families. Calling on energy suppliers to be ‘conscious of their social obligations,’ the Archbishop, a former oil executive, said: ‘The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe, and the companies have to justify fully what they are doing.’ The Archbishop's warning comes as it was revealed that Britons will spend an average of £28.70 on each present this Christmas - an increase of £1.70 on the figure for 2012 . Another target of Archbishop Welby’s criticism recently has been the controversial payday loan firms. He . said it was his dream to ‘compete’ Wonga out of existence through the . growth of credit unions offering much lower lending rates. The Archbishop’s focus on food banks chimes with political concerns about rising levels of food poverty. In October, a cross-party group of politicians was set  up to investigate the surge in demand that has led to the  creation of about 400 food banks across the UK. And the Red Cross has also announced that it will start collecting and distributing food to the needy in Britain for the first time since the Second World War. But there has been scepticism from some about the need for such handouts, with Education Secretary Michael Gove claiming in September that those who find themselves without enough money for food are ‘not best able’ to manage their finances.","Number receiving basic supplies trebled over the past year to 350,000 .

"By . Charlotte Ward . Tackling issues: Katherine Preston, 29, travelled all over America to see front line treatment for stutterers . It was just a simple request to invite her godmother to her next ballet performance, but the moment is for ever etched in Katherine Preston’s memory. As she stood in her tutu at the age of seven, her voice faltered and she was unable to get the question out. ‘Try as I might, I just couldn’t  get past the B in ballet,’ she says. ‘It felt like a barrier had closed the path from my lungs to my mouth. That was the first moment I was aware I had a stutter.’ Now, 22 years later, Katherine’s stammer remains. This common speech problem affects about one person in every 100, causing them to be blocked or stuck at the beginning, middle and end of words and leading them to repeat words several times over. The morning of our interview, I notice Katherine is struggling with long, drawn-out Ls, Ks and Ws.  ‘And all the rest of the alphabet,’  she laughs. Such is the impact of her stutter that five years ago Katherine, now 29, decided to quit her job in asset management in London and set off on a year-long fact-finding trip around America to work out how she could rid herself of the speech impediment. After travelling from coast to coast to witness treatments at the forefront of stutter research, she has written a memoir about her experiences – which also led her to fall in love with a fellow stutterer. For in the course of that trip, it transpired that far from ruining  her life, Katherine’s stutter was the making of her. ‘I am not sure who I would be without my stutter,’ she says. ‘Today I can see that stuttering has given me far more than it ever took away.’ It’s a surprisingly positive attitude for someone who, by the age of eight, had transformed from an outgoing little girl to a shy, withdrawn child as her speech let her down. Her worried parents took her to see the UK’s best speech therapists but watched in dismay as Katherine continued to clench, whistle and choke on her words. ‘Growing up, I heard strangers tell me to slow down, calm down or take a deep breath – as if stuttering was that easy to overcome,’ Katherine recalls. ‘I was desperate to find a way to “fix” my problem and went in and out of speech therapy for years trying to be fluent.’ While she was never bullied and had a loyal circle of friends, her stutter made her less vocal at school. ‘In class, I wanted to be able to interact and answer a question but held back,’ she says. ‘For a while I became a sort of walking thesaurus. I’d deliberately dodge hard words and rack my brain for an alternative. Often I wasn’t saying what I wanted to say. I felt my stutter made others question my intelligence and sanity.’ We clicked: Katherine fell for Jeremy Cohen during a speech therapy course in Washington DC . After Durham University, Katherine started climbing the corporate ladder in London. Although doing well at work and on the verge of promotion, at the age of 24 she still felt ashamed of her speech. It was time to take her stutter in hand. ‘For years I believed that stuttering was my fault, that it would hold me back, that it made me ugly,’ she says. ‘The biggest battle I had to fight was breaking through the glass ceiling I’d created for myself.’ So in September 2008, Katherine vowed to devote a year to touring the US, interviewing as many stutterers, researchers and speech therapists as possible. Starting in Boston and travelling from state to state, she painstakingly researched the different schools of thought on the causes and cures. For years I believed that stuttering was my fault, that it would hold me back, that it made me ugly. I had created a glass ceiling for myself. ‘Treatments ranged from vitamin supplements, relaxation classes and hypnosis to cranial osteopathy and electric shock treatment,’ she says. ‘One involved whispering in a “phone sex” voice, and some therapists handed out gifts for fluent words – to positively reinforce the stutter out of our voices.’ In California, Katherine met physician and fellow stutterer Dr Gerald Macguire, who believes that adults who stutter often have excessive dopamine in their brains, drawing strong similarities to Tourette’s syndrome. According to Macguire, surplus dopamine can affect the brain’s natural timer and speech initiation – something he remedied by taking asenapine (commonly used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) with positive results. He claims his stutter would return within three days of him stopping medication. With 70 per cent of Macguire’s patients reporting benefits, this was the closest Katherine had come to finding a cure – but she had reservations. ‘Although drugs had helped many people, I was unsure about achieving fluency with medications that were still in their infancy for stuttering,’ she says. ‘I wanted to continue my search.’ As well as interviewing doctors and researchers, Katherine met stutterers from all walks of life –ranging from New Mexican ranchers to Hollywood celebrities. ‘Film star Emily Blunt confided that acting helped her to be someone else and overcome her stutter, while Michael Palin told me about his experiences growing up with a father who stuttered.’ Advice: Katherine, from London, got advice from fellow Londoner and stutterer Emily Blunt on her tour . Understanding: Michael Palin also told Miss Preston about growing up with a stammering father . It was at a speech therapy course in Washington DC that Katherine met her now-fiance Jeremy Cohen. After an immediate rapport, their romance was sealed when he agreed to join her on a six-week research road trip from Texas to California. ‘Meeting Jeremy and falling in love with him changed the way I saw stuttering,’ says Katherine. ‘I don’t think I realised how interesting and attractive stutterers could be. Watching his determination to be heard opened up a new way for me to be proud of who I was.’ Emily Blunt confided that . acting helped her to be someone else and overcome her stutter. Michael Palin told me about his experiences growing up with a father who . stuttered. After 12 months exploring dozens of techniques, treatments and therapies, Katherine came to an unexpected decision. Rather than taking medication or speaking in a controlled manner, she would try voluntary stuttering – a technique pioneered in the 1950s by stutterer and speech therapist Joseph Sheehan. ‘Sheehan did not believe that stutterers should or could speak fluently,’ she explains. ‘Instead, he preached self-acceptance. The idea is that if you stutter on purpose in the lead-up to a problematic word, then you will feel in control once you reach it.’ Katherine first tried voluntary stuttering at a Boston Starbucks, deliberately stammering through her order without apology and taking as much time as she needed to get out each word. ‘It was empowering for me to be  in control of my speech. Stuttering on purpose allowed me to go through the motions without having the anxiety and worry,’ she says. ‘It goes against the habits I’ve learnt over the years but enables me to feel good, own the fact that I stutter and be extremely comfortable with it.’ Now, four years on and living in San Francisco running a mobile phone exchange business with  Jeremy, Katherine sees her stutter as a quirk of her character rather than an enemy. ‘For ages it was as though my stutter was an impostor in my body but everyone has parts of themselves that they are worried about, or some vulnerability. Ultimately my speech has given me the career I dreamed off, the man I want to grow old with – and introduced me to a community of incredible people. ‘I’ve realised that our imperfections are actually what make us attractive and interesting.’ lKatherine Preston is the author of Out With It: How Stuttering Helped Me Find My Voice  (Simon & Schuster, £16.99).","Katherine Preston, 29, withdrew when she struggled with words aged 8 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The sister and father of a Malaysia Airlines worker due to fly on MH17 were left reeling with shock when they heard about the massacre – but unbeknown to them, their loved one was safe and sound, because she’d given up her seat on the doomed flight to another passenger. Nina Corder, from Toledo, Ohio, spoke of the hours of agony she went through with her father when they heard about the horrifying missile attack. Ms Corder said her father had called her last Thursday to tell her the chilling news that her sister, Wani Hashim, had been killed. Scroll down for video . Relieved: Nina Corder thought that her sister had died on MH17 - but she'd given up her seat at the last minute . She told Fox 5 Vegas: ‘My dad started shaking. He was like, “I don't know what to do. You need to do something.”’ Ms Corder, who works in downtown Toledo, said that she tried for several hours to get clarification on exactly what had happened, and whether her sister was safe. She tried her sister’s cell phone over and over again, but to no avail. ‘I just started crying,’ she said. But after several attempts, to her astonishment – and joy – she got through and her sister answered. ‘I picked up my phone and I dialed her again and then I heard her voice say, “Hello!”’, Corder said. It turns out that the flight had been overbooked so Wani changed her plans and flew to Paris instead, where she prepared for a meeting in London. After the plane crashed in eastern Ukraine, she immediately sent her sister a text. It said: ‘I gave up my seat for another passenger. OMG, I nearly took that flight.’ The family are incredibly grateful, but are all too aware that someone else perished instead of Wani. Corder added: ‘I think it's not her time. It's just a miracle.’ Meanwhile, bodies of the dead from the downed Malaysia Airlines plane have arrived in Holland to be received by a nation in mourning. 59908 . 143802 . 60651 . 71425 . 29443 .

They touched down to the sound of tolling bells just before 3pm UK time and were greeted by Dutch king Willem-Alexander and queen Maxima as well as by Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. Relatives of the 298 people, including 10 Britons, who died aboard flight MH17 were also at Eindhoven. Waiting at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport was Barry Sweeney, father of Newcastle United football fan Liam Sweeney, who was on board MH17 on his way to see his team play in a pre-season friendly in New Zealand.

"By . Jack Doyle . The racial ‘bias’ in police use of stop-and-search powers is much worse in rural parts of England than previously thought – with black people as much as twelve times more likely to be stopped than whites. In 27 force areas, the true extent of the disproportionate use of so-called sus powers on black people has been revised upwards in new research by the equalities watchdog. These include Dorset, where black people are a staggering twelve times more likely than whites to be stopped and searched by the police. In Gloucestershire, they are nearly eight times more likely, in Wiltshire seven times and more than five times in Norfolk and Suffolk. Overall, the Census figures showed lower numbers of black, mixed race and other ethnic minority groups were living in some rural areas. The extent of racial bias in the Met is a third lower than was thought . Several other forces have been shown to have much higher levels of racial bias include Warwickshire, Surrey, Devon and Cornwall, Kent and Hampshire, the Equality and Human Rights Commission report shows. The new figures – which will be a major concern to ministers, officers and race campaigners – emerged after stop and search numbers were re-calculated with up-to-date population estimates from the 2011 Census. In a report released yesterday, the . Equality and Human Rights Commisssion compared figures for how many . people in force areas in different ethnic groups with stop and search . totals for 2010-11 and 2011-12. Home Secretary Theresa May is reining in stop and search powers . Under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act officers can to stop and search someone if they have reasonable suspicion they are about to commit an offence. Overall, the Census figues showed lower numbers of black, mixed race and other ethnic minority groups were living in some rural areas. By contrast, the numbers for urban areas are much higher. As a result, researchers have recalculated the extent to which stops and searches are ‘disproportionate’ across England and Wales. In Dorset, the size of the black population is 2,920 – less than half the earlier estimate of 7,480. The old figures suggested 3.8 black people were stopped for every white person, compared to more than ten under the new calculation for 2011, and nearly 12 in the 2012 figures. The extent of racial bias was found to be twice as high in West Mercia, and nearly twice as high in Sussex than previously thought. The census also showed ethnic minority populations in urban areas were much higher. That means urban forces, including the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands and Greater Manchester, have lower levels of racial bias, and search fewer black people as a proportion of the overall population. The extent of racial bias in the Met is a third lower than was thought. The force carried out 471,336 – or 47 per cent – of the 1.1million stop and searches in England and Wales last year. The Census showed there are 888,166 black people living in London, compared with 662, 396 under old Office for National Statistics (ONS) population projections. The estimate for people of mixed race has increased from 188,784 to 280,891. These mean that rather than five black people being stopped and searched for every white person, the true figure is just over three. For people of mixed race, the proportion has nearly halved. Across England and Wales, the revised figures show 6.5 stops of a black person for every white, instead of 7.5 under the previous population figures. The extent of racial bias in stop and search was cited as a major factor in the causes for the 2011 riots by some commentators. Home Secretary Theresa May is reining in stop and search powers after figures showed just 9 per cent of all stops led to an arrest. In some parts of the country, the figure is as low as 3 per cent, raising huge question marks over whether the power is being used properly. A spokesman for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: ‘The change from ONS population estimates by ethnic group to 2011 Census data has revised population profiles for some police force areas with either relatively lower or higher ethnic minority populations. ‘This either increases or decreases estimates of race disproportionality.’ ‘For example, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire have higher figures for black/white disproportionality based on the Census estimates, while Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire have lower figures.’","In Gloucestershire, they are nearly eight times more likely, in Wiltshire seven times and more than five times in Norfolk and Suffolk .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Gammon joints, parmesan and coffee may not sound like the kind of essentials that would drive the desperate to theft. But they are now among the items most frequently stolen from the high street – as middle Britain goes shoplifting to maintain its lifestyle. The problem of food theft is becoming so serious that many supermarkets are introducing electronic security tags to deter thieves from pinching products such as turkey and steak. Targets: Gammon joints and Nescafe Gold Blend coffee are among the items most frequently stolen from the high street - as middle Britain goes shoplifting to maintain its lifestyle . According to the latest Global Retail Theft Barometer, the total cost of retail theft has hit £3.4billion, or £124.60 per household – which is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. And the goods most likely to be stolen include gammon joints, frozen chicken breasts, beef joints, bacon, gourmet cheese such as brie or parmesan, Nescafe Gold Blend coffee and wines and spirits, particularly Glen’s Vodka. One Tesco store has even found it necessary to put manuka honey, which can sell for as much as £20 a jar, into large plastic security boxes to deter the sticky-fingered thieves of Cambridge. In the health and beauty section, razor . blades, mascara, lipsticks, perfume, skin care, sun protection, hair . straighteners, electric toothbrushes and sports nutrition are at the top . of the thief’s wish list. Popular: The goods mostly likely to be targeted also include parmesan cheese, left, Glen's vodka and wine . DIY and home improvement stores, meanwhile, are most likely to lose power tools, cables, batteries and door locks. The theft barometer report, compiled by analysts Euromonitor and funded by retail security firm Checkpoint Systems, said: ‘A key observation from the grocery retailers interviewed was an increase in food theft … including items such as fresh meat, owing to the weak economy.’ Russell Holland of Checkpoint Systems . said: ‘We know that, due to the recession, people are stealing out of . need for food, but you also have a Middle England group of people who . have not had a bonus or pay rise but still want to maintain their . lifestyle. ‘Really, there is no longer a typical person described as a shoplifter, they can come from all walks of life. You can see the profile of people involved by looking at the products that are being stolen.’ Marks & Spencer now routinely puts electronic security tags on its turkey crowns ahead of Christmas, while Tesco and Sainsbury’s have given store managers authority to tag the birds if their outlet is in a theft hot spot. The tags are designed to set off an alarm if a shopper tries to leave without paying.

It is the first time that the experts from the Netherlands and Australia have been able to go to the site, which appears to still be under control of pro-Russian separatists. Fighting along the route to the wreckage between government troops and the separatists had kept them away. Scroll down for video . A Ukrainian government army soldier stands guard next to the cars of a convoy of OSCE investigators making their way to the MH17 crash site . Ukrainian government troops rest near their tank at a check-point in the village of Debaltseve in Donetsk as investigators arrive at the MH17 crash site . Ukrainian troops move near to the village of Debaltseve, Donetsk. Ukraine has agreed to a 24 hour ceasefire in the country . Fighting along the route to the wreckage between government troops and the separatists had kept investigators away . It is expected that they will initially focus their efforts on retrieving bodies that are still on the site and collect victims' belongings. It remains unclear exactly how many bodies remain and what condition they are in after being exposed for so long to the elements. Earlier this afternoon, the investigators were allowed through a checkpoint leading to the crash site at the village of Rozsypne. The convoy of investigators and Organization for Security and Cooperation officials were taken through the rebel-held city of Donetsk through the town of Debaltseve, which was earlier this week re-taken by government foces, and later back in rebel territory. Armoured personnel carriers, waving the blue and yellow Ukrainian national flag could be seen in and around Debaltseve. Medical teams from the Netherlands and Australia have also carried out a joint training exercise in case they need to evacuate personnel involved in the humaitarian mission in the Ukraine. A delegation from Russia's state aviation body also said it hoped to visit the site, an agency spokesman said today. The announcement of a ceasefire follows a plea from the UN for a truce to allow a stalled probe into the downing of the passenger jet to go ahead . Military spokesman Olekisy Dmytrashkivsky said that the ceasefire  was in response to an appeal by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon . Sergei Izvolsky told the AP that a delegation of Russian specialists from Rosaviatsiya was due in Kiev today to participate in the investigation. Representatives of the Dutch and Ukrainian commissions would not comment on the arrival of Russian officials. Continuing fighting has hindered access to the crash site, located in rebel-controlled territory in east Ukraine. But earlier today the Ukrainian military announced that there would be a day-long pause to its  offensive to oust pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country. The announcement follows a plea from the UN for a truce to allow a stalled probe into the downing of the passenger jet to go ahead. In Eindhoven, Dutch and Australian medical personnel conducted a joint exercise at a military base . The aim of the exercise was to prepare in case they needed to evacuate personnel involved in the mission in the Ukraine . Military spokesman Olekisy Dmytrashkivsky said that the move was in response to an appeal by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, adding: 'We have taken a decision not to conduct military operations on this so-called ""day of quiet.""' Meanwhile Malaysia's prime minister has also called on Ukrainian and pro-Russian separatists to agree to a ceasefire as he met his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte. Najib Razak was in The Hague to discuss repatriating Malaysian victims of the crash and the security situation in Ukraine. 'We ask there be an immediate cessation of hostilities in and around the crash site by both Ukrainian and separatist forces,' Mr Razak said. We ask that all sides respect the lives lost and the integrity of the crash site so that the investigation may proceed.' The Malaysian Prime Minister met with his Dutch counterpart in The Hague today and called for a ceasefire so victims of the crash can be repatriated . Mr Razak also signed a book of condolence and later will visit Hilversum Centre where the remains of more than 200 victims are being held . All 298 passengers and crew aboard Flight 17 were killed, including 43 Malaysians and 195 Dutch nationals. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said around 80 bodies have yet to be recovered from the wreckage. The remains of more than 200 victims that have been recovered and brought to the Netherlands are being painstakingly identified at a military base in Hilversum, a process expected to take weeks or months. Mr Razak also signed a condolence register for victims and will visit the Hilversum Centre later today.","Team from the Netherlands and Australia have finally reached the crash site .

"By . Jaya Narain . Jailed: Foulser was sentenced to eight months in prison yesterday . A newly qualified driver mowed down a great-grandmother on a pedestrian crossing while revving her car in frustration at a couple dawdling across the road. After killing 75-year-old Averil Monks, who was crossing just behind the couple, Natalie Foulser, 21, broke down and screamed: ‘I want my dad.’ A court heard that Mrs Monks’s husband George, 76, died 14 months later a broken man after being left inconsolable and refusing to sleep in their bedroom. Foulser was in the outside lane of a dual carriageway in June last year when she saw Coral Bawden and Anthony Ainsworth on a pedestrian crossing up ahead. Believing they were walking ‘deliberately slowly’, she engaged the clutch and revved the engine of her Honda Civic to scare them off the road while her car was still moving at around the 30mph speed limit. She then drove over the crossing at around 35mph while staring angrily at the couple, who had to jump out of the way. But Foulser did not see Mrs Monks, who was hidden from view by the couple, and smashed into her. The retired hospital nursing sister, was fatally injured and died at the crossing in Marton, near Blackpool, Lancashire. Plea: The 21-year-old admitted causing death by careless driving at Burnley Crown Court yesterday . Afterwards, Foulser cried for her father and wailed: ‘I can’t believe I’ve just killed someone.’ Paul Cummings, prosecuting, said that because she was staring at the pedestrians, she only saw Mrs Monks at the very last moment and was unable to avoid hitting her. Foulser was jailed for eight months after a judge at Burnley Crown Court said her attention should have been on the road instead of rebuking pedestrians. Tragic: Averil Monks, 75, was walking behind a couple who had angered Foulser by dawdling . Mr Ainsworth said: ‘When we got to the central reservation we could see cars in the distance but they were far enough away for us to make the call to cross. ‘As we got close to the pavement I heard a loud noise – like a car was revving its engine, so I grabbed Coral and we ran to the pavement. The car’s exhaust made two really loud noises, increasing in volume. ‘What I saw next made me feel physically sick.’ Miss Bawden said: ‘Just after the crash I did see the driver get out of the car in a distressed state and I heard her say, “I can’t believe I’ve just killed someone”.’ Foulser told police: ‘They continued to stare at me and I stared back. They were a hazard in my way and when I stared back, there was another hazard in the way.’ Witnesses described the accident and its aftermath to the court. Gail Miller said: ‘I went to her and tried to assist her and calm her down. She said, “Two kids were messing about around the junction. I revved my engine to scare them because they were messing about”.’ David Marsden, a driving instructor, said: ‘The female driver was in hysterics on the central reservation and was screaming, “I want my dad”. She then said either “It revved” or “I revved it”.’ Wayne Jackson, defending, said: ‘This is a momentary lapse of judgment by somebody who is new to driving. The two pedestrians had hidden Mrs Monks from view beyond the crossing. Banned: Foulser, pictured at an earlier hearing outside Preston Crown Court is banned from driving for two years . 'She has been significantly traumatised by what took place. She has apologised every day in her head. She was a talented artist, described in testimonials as gifted, but humble.’ Judge Robert Altham told her: ‘Inexperience must have played some part in this accident. There was at least an element of you rebuking these people by continuing to stare at them and that meant you didn’t see Mrs Monks until it was far too late. ‘It is clear you are a bright young woman, cherished by your family. ‘But Averil Monks was also somebody cherished by her family. ‘Her husband, in particular, was devastated. He couldn’t go home for many months and when he did, he couldn’t bring himself to sleep upstairs. 'He changed from being a happy, confident man into being an absolutely inconsolable, unhappy man in the last months of his life.’ Foulser, of Fleetwood, admitted causing death by careless driving. She sobbed as she was jailed, banned from driving for two years and ordered to take an extended driving test.","Natalie Foulser was revving her engine in frustration at pair of pedestrians .

"By . Mark Prigg . Spacewalking astronauts have replaced a dead computer outside the International Space Station to bring their orbiting home back up to full strength - and managed to grab a space selfie in the process. The two Americans on board, Rick Mastracchio and Steven Swanson, got through the urgent repair job, swapping out the computers within an hour, and competing tests to prove it was working - leaving time to take some pictures. 'My arms are too short for a selfie,' Mastracchio said with a chuckle, his camera pointed at himself. Scroll down for video . Rick Mastracchio's space selfie, taken while on a recent spacewalk to fix a computer. There are now fears his return trip could be cancelled over a sanctions row . In this Wednesday, April 23, 2014 image made from video provided by NASA, astronauts Rick Mastracchio and Steven Swanson exit an airlock from the International Space Station. The spacewalk was scheduled to replace a dead computer and get their orbiting home back up to full strength. (AP Photo/NASA) Nasa feared that if the primary computer went down as well, the entire space station would be in jeopardy. These two computers - the primary and backup - control the pointing of the solar wings and radiators, as well as the movement of the robot-arm rail cart. It was the first failure of one of dozens of so-called MDMs, or multiplexer-demultiplexers, in and outside the space station. Within hours, he has posted to picture to Twitter, telling followers 'the space suit makes it very difficult to get a good selfie. 'I tried several today.' 'Excellent work, gentlemen,' Mission Control radioed. The removed computer, a critical backup, failed nearly two weeks ago. The prime computer has been working perfectly, but NASA wanted to install a fresh spare as soon as possible. Mission Control waited until after the arrival of a capsule full of fresh supplies Sunday. Replacing the computer — a compact 50-pound box — involved just three bolts. Engineers do not know why the original failed. Mission Control asked the spacewalkers to keep an eye out for any damage that might explain the breakdown. Nothing jumped out. Rick Mastracchio (pictured) also got fellow spacewalker Steven Swanson to take this picture of him in front of the station's Japanese module . Flight controllers were trying to load software into the spare computer on April 11, but it failed to activate. That set into motion a frenzy of ground meetings and tests to fix the problem.

Mission Control kept the spacewalk short and straight-to-the-point; it lasted a mere one hour and 36 minutes. All routine spacewalks by U.S. station crew have been on hold since last summer's near-drowning by a spacewalking astronaut. His helmet filled with water from the cooling system of the suit, and NASA is continuing to investigate the problem. NASA hopes to reuse the bad computer, once it's inspected indoors by the astronauts and updated. Their mission accomplished, Mastracchio and Swanson exchanged a few jokes and laughs as they got ready to go back inside.

The spacewalk will mark the 179th in support of the orbiting space station, a global collaboration that includes Europe, Canada, Japan, the United States and Russia. Mission Control spotted a small object floating over Mastracchio's right shoulder as the spacewalk drew to a close. He said he didn't think he lost anything. The NASA commentator, Dan Huot, later said it appeared to be a tiny wire tie. The space station is home to six men: the two Americans, three Russians and one Japanese.","Computers control the pointing of the solar wings and radiators .

"By . Sarah Dean . An ABC reporter who has been criticised for touching clothes and debris from the MH17 plane crash has defended his actions saying 'it's not as though it's a crime scene'. Phil Williams was shown handling victims' belongings in a report published on the ABC website after a Sky journalist was also seen sifting through personal possessions among the wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines plane - sparking 110 viewer complaints. The ABC report was removed from its website for re-editing as Mr Williams told the broadcaster's PM show on Monday: 'I am guilty of picking up, touching a scarf on the ground'. Since the bodies of the 298 victims fell from 33,000ft after their plane was struck by a surface-to-air missile, they were left in the open in sweltering heat for three days before being gathered up in bags, bundled on to trucks and driven away. Their belongings were scattered over several kilometres across fields near a village in Rassypnoye in eastern Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Phil Williams was shown handling victims' belongings in a report published on the ABC website . Mr Williams explained his actions, which have been branded inappropriate, by saying: 'There are piles of people's belongings that have just been collected and dumped on the roadside, they've been picked through and so it's not as though it's a crime scene, an uncontaminated crime scene there.' He added: 'It's a very difficult scene to report on. Literally the evidence is everywhere you walk.' An ABC spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald that they have 'reminded journalists of responsibilities when reporting from an air crash scene such as MH17'. They confirmed: 'A report has been re-edited to avoid any distress to our audience.' In his ABC news report from the tragic scene, Mr Williams said: 'As we come over this way here, as we walk through, you will see little bits and pieces of people's everyday lives. Someone's shawl there. Over here, one of the backs of one of the plane's chairs. 'There are little bits everywhere as I walk - another large chunk of the aircraft and very sadly a lot of personal items.' The ABC are re-editing the video so that Mr Williams can't be seen picking up a victim's purple scarf . Sky News also apologised after in a live broadcast, presenter Colin Brazier was shown picking items – including a set of keys and a toothbrush – out of someone's open luggage before saying: 'We really shouldn't be doing this, I suppose.' The report has so far sparked 110 complaints with television watchdog Ofcom, amid growing anger over the desecration of the crash site and allegations of looting by pro-Russian rebels. Brazier's actions has also sparked a furious response on social media - with one Twitter user asking 'Why is Colin Brazier still on my telly?' Scroll down for video .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . and Victoria Woollaston . Canada has made a claim on the North Pole in an effort to assert its sovereignty in the resource-rich Arctic. The country last week applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic . Ocean, including  extensions into the Arctic seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles (1.7 million sq km). Canada filed the preliminary submission last week based on rules laid out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which regulates international law for the oceans. Canada has made a claim on the North Pole in an effort to assert its sovereignty in the resource-rich Arctic, pictured. The country last week applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic Ocean, including  extensions into the Arctic seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles (1.7 million sq km) Currently, under international law, . Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the U.S. - the five countries with . territories near the Arctic Circle - are allotted 200 nautical miles . from their northern coasts. However, . under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, exclusive claims can be . vastly expanded for Arctic nations that prove that their part of the . continental shelf extends beyond that zone. Canada has applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic . Ocean, including  extensions into the Arctic seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles (1.7 million sq km). This is roughly the size of Alberta and the Saskatchewan region combined. If successful, the country will have rights to the polar region's resources, which is estimated to contain 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 15 per cent of oil. While Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, John Baird announced that the country’s final claim would include the North Pole, he added scientific evidence to back the claim isn't yet ready. ‘For whatever reason, the scientists and the aircraft stopped the research when they got to the Pole,’ Professor Robert Huebert, an Arctic expert at the University of Calgary told MailOnline. ‘The science couldn’t have been too hard, because they were able to get up to the Pole. But no one has given me a satisfactory answer as to why they stopped.’ ‘It may just have been a simple mistake,’ he added. Professor Huebert said further studies . will depend on the availability of researchers, ice breakers and . scientific equipment, but at a push, it could be completed in a year. Canada’s . decision to continue the work puts it head-to-head with Russia, along . with potential negotiations with Denmark and the U.S., as all have . expressed interest in the Pole. Asserting Canada's rights in the . Arctic has been a popular domestic issue for Prime Minister Stephen . Harper, though at least one expert on the issue described the planned . claim as a long shot. Currently, under international law, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the U.S. - the five countries with territories near the Arctic Circle - are allotted 200 nautical miles from their northern coasts. The different regions are shown on this map . This graphic shows how Canada wants to expand its borders in the Arctic . ‘We . are determined to ensure that all Canadians benefit from the tremendous . resources that are to be found in Canada's far north,’ Mr Baird said. Canada's . submission last week set out the potential outer limits of the . country's continental shelf in the Atlantic - a claim of 656,373 miles . (roughly 1.7 million sq km). Canada's follow-up submission will . include a claim to the Lomonosov Ridge, an undersea mountain range . between Ellesmere Island, Canada's most northern land mass, and Russia's . east Siberian coast. That claim would extend Canada's claim 200 nautical miles beyond the North Pole. The submission that Canada filed with . the UN is essentially a series of undersea co-ordinates that map what . the government claims is the country's extended continental shelf. Mr Baird said it's a mammoth task, and . the government needs more time to complete the mapping in the Arctic, . and to get its UN submission right. Following the claims made by Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, John Baird, Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to increase its focus on the Arctic. Speaking to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin praised the military's work in the Arctic and said it intended to finish plans by the end of the year to upgrade military bases in the resource-rich region where world powers jostle for control. As well as Canada, the U.S., Denmark and Norway are also pressing for control of what they consider their fair share of massive untapped oil and natural gas reserves. 'I request that you pay special attention to the deployment of infrastructure and military units in the Arctic,' Putin said, speaking at a Defence Ministry board meeting. 'By the end of the year it is planned - and I expect it will be done... the renewal of the Tiksi airfield and completion of construction work on the Severomorsk-1 airfield,' he said in televised comments. Russia has already completed work on renovating an airfield on the Novosibirsk Islands, which was abandoned in 1993. Earlier this year Moscow sent 10 warships and four icebreakers to the islands in a show of force. Underscoring Moscow's sensitivity over Arctic claims, Russia arrested 30 people on board a Greenpeace ship during a September protest against Russian offshore Arctic drilling. They now face charges carrying seven year jail sentences. Putin said earlier this week that Russia's military presence in the Arctic was needed to protect against potential threats from the United States. The world's largest oil producer, Russia expects to see oil output decline at its mainstay western Siberian oilfields in coming years and has looked further afield to potential Arctic reserves. Russia, Canada and Denmark all say an underwater mountain range known as the Lomonosov Ridge, which stretches 1,800 km (1,120 miles) across the pole under the Arctic Sea, is part of their own landmass. ‘That's why we have asked our . officials and scientists to do additional and necessary work to ensure . that a submission for the full extent of the Continental Shelf in the . Arctic includes Canada's claim to the North Pole,’ he said. The UN submission is also . political, said Michael Byers, an expert on Arctic and international law . at the University of British Columbia. ‘(Harper) does not want to be the . prime minister seen publicly as having surrendered the North Pole, even . if the scientific facts don't support a Canadian claim,’ Professor Byers . said. ‘What he's essentially doing here is . holding this place, standing up for Canadian sovereignty, while in . private he knows full well that position is untenable.’ If Canada's claim is successful, the country will have rights to the polar region's resources, which is estimated to contain 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 15 per cent of oil. The area is highly political and Russia, in particular, has recently been looking further afield to these potential Arctic reserves . The UN submissions do not lead to a binding decision, but lay the groundwork for future country-to-country negotiations over competing territorial claims in the Arctic that could take years to resolve. Mr Byers said there isn't any particular rush for Canada to stake its claim for the North Pole, pointing out that such claims cover some of the most remote and harshest places on the planet, and commercial exploitation of resources is a long way off. ‘We're talking about the centre of a large, inhospitable ocean that is in total darkness for three months each year, thousands of miles from any port,"" he said. ‘The water in the North Pole is 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) deep and will always be covered by sea ice in the winter. It's not a place where anyone is going to be drilling for oil and gas. President Vladimir Putin has also ordered Russia's military to increase its focus on the Arctic and finish plans by the end of the year to upgrade military bases in the resource-rich region where world powers jostle for control. ‘I request that you pay special attention to the deployment of infrastructure and military units in the Arctic,’ Putin said, speaking at a Defence Ministry board meeting last year. Putin said earlier this week that Russia's military presence in the Arctic was needed to protect against potential threats from the United States.","The country has applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic .

"By . Gerri Peev . A millionaire Tory MP has admitted making an expenses claim for the electricity used by his horse riding business and a yard manager’s mobile home. Nadhim Zahawi, who was a successful entrepreneur before becoming an MP in 2010, had the highest energy expenses of any politician, a newspaper report revealed. He said the claim was a ‘mistake’ as he had not realised there was no separate energy bill for the horse riding business run from his sprawling 31-acre Warwickshire estate. Apology: Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, 46, has apologised for claiming almost £6,000 in electricity bills to run a business from his second home . Mr Zahawi has been a vociferous supporter of statute-backed Press regulation. Last year, he was one of 42 Tory MPs to sign a letter calling for tight controls. He agreed with Lord Justice Leveson . that having the Press preside over its own regulator was akin to ‘having . the industry mark its own homework’. The Stratford-upon-Avon MP claimed nearly £6,000 for his energy bills. MPs are only allowed to claim expenses on domestic energy use at their second homes, not for costs linked to running a business. Mr Zahawi vowed to repay the money in full but said the figure had included bills for a previous year and was closer to £4,000. He said: ‘I have been looking into . this matter further and can confirm that all claims for heating fuel . relate purely to my second home. However, I have made a mistake with my . electricity claims. ‘Electricity for a mobile home located in the stable yard, and electricity for the stables themselves, was linked to my house. ‘Whilst a meter was installed in the . stable yard, I have only been receiving one bill; it was wrong to assume . I was receiving two and to have not checked this sooner. ‘I am mortified by this mistake and . apologise unreservedly for it.  I will obviously be paying back  any . money that was wrongly claimed immediately.’ Mr Zahawi’s second home has a stable . with room for at least 20 horses. He runs Oaklands Riding School and . Livery Yard from the estate with his wife Lana. There is a mobile home on site for the yard manager, who is thought to pay Mr Zahawi £120 a month in rent to live there. The couple, who have teenage twin sons, also own a £5million home in Putney and three rental flats in London. Labour MP John Mann called for the . Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, IPSA, to investigate the . claims revealed by the Sunday Mirror. The Bassetlaw MP said: ‘If one of my . constituents had done this they would have been expecting a knock on the . door from the police. IPSA need to look at this and find out why it . wasn’t spotted.’ Jeff Kenner, a Labour councillor in . Stratford-upon-Avon, said: ‘People will be stunned to find they have . been paying for the running of Mr Zahawi’s stables.’ He said Mr Zahawi’s position was . ‘untenable’, particularly as many of his constituents were grappling . with spiralling energy bills. Visitors to Mr Zahawi’s personal website were not sympathetic. Matt Williams posted: ‘If I over-claimed to a similar extent at my workplace, I would be sacked for gross misconduct. ‘Please could you explain why you deserve a different approach?’ Another said: ‘Do you think it is . fair and reasonable for MPs to claim such large amounts for energy for . their second homes? Surely it should be capped at the average energy . bill or say £1,000.’ Peter Tennent wrote: ‘If you have . enough money for two homes why do you need to claim money back to heat . them? Why don’t you get rid of one and use the money to heat the other? Then you won’t need to use taxpayers’ money.’ Born in Baghdad to Kurdish  parents, Mr Zahawi is one of the country’s wealthiest MPs. He is a co-founder of research firm YouGov and has been tipped as a future minister. This month, Nick Clegg defended MPs . claiming the cost of energy bills on their second homes. He said . expenses were there to help MPs with the cost of living and working in . two different places.","Nadhim Zahawi, 46, claimed money for electricity used to run a horse riding stables at his home in Upper Tyfoe, Warwickshire .

"By . John Hall . This is the moment a pair of daredevil skydivers set a new base jump world record by leaping 2,717 feet off the tallest building in the world. Veteran base jumpers Fred Fugen and Vince Reffet prepared for their record breaking leap from Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower by spending time up a Swiss mountain to acclimatise to the altitude. The men are not the first to base jump from the top of the tower - which is roughly twice the height of New York's Empire State Building - but they had a special platform built to add an extra 500 feet, enabling them to break the world record.

Heartstopping: Daredevil skydivers red Fugen and Vince Reffet set a new base jump world record by leaping 2,717 feet from Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower - the tallest building in the world . Experience: Fugen and Reffet are veteran base jumpers and members of the Soul Flyers, a group that organises aerial sporting events - including skydiving, base jumping and paragliding . Success: Fugen and Reffet congratulate one another after making their world record breaking jump. The pair had to practice on a Swiss mountain to get used to the altitude . A spine-tingling video shows the two . base jumpers dive from the world's tallest building and plummet towards . the ground, before eventually pulling the chord on their parachutes and . landing safely. To ensure they were used to the altitude, Fugen and Reffet practiced base jumping from a mountain near Lauterbrunnen in Switzerland, which is roughly the same height as the Burj Khalifa tower. The pair also made several jumps from helicopters in Dubai ahead of their record breaking effort in order to ensure they would not be distracted by the famous skyline. No fear: The daredevil duo steady themselves for their record breaking base jump earlier today . Prepared: Fred Fugen and Vince Reffet are not the first to base jump from the Burj Khalifa tower but had a special platform built to add an extra 50 feet, thereby enabling them to break the world base jump record . Don't look down: The Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai is the tallest building in the world at 2,723 feet . After jumping from the tower, Fugen said: 'This was the jump of a lifetime and an achievement of three years of hard training.' 'This was the jump of a lifetime and an achievement of three years of hard training. I am glad we landed successfully, accomplishing a lifelong dream', he added. His skydiving partner Vince Reffet said: 'This was my best jump by far. It was a dream come true.' The record breaking leap was only . possible with the construction of a three by one meter platform at the . very top of the pinnacle, which was incredibly difficult to build. The . structure took a total of three days to install, with challenging weather conditions limiting the time available for . construction. Skydive Dubai, who organised the record breaking jump, celebrated by posting a video of it on their Facebook page. In a statement, they added: 'This . success is due to the 'practice make perfect' method of training that . we always follow and the 100 per cent dedication of everyone working on this . project.'

"By . Sarah Michael . and Louise Cheer . Fatima Dyczynski was travelling to Perth to start a new life as an intern for IBM on flight MH17 . The Perth-based parents of Fatima Dyczynski, who is believed to be a MH17 victim, are on their way to the flight's Ukrainian crash site, still holding onto the hope that their daughter is alive. Miss Dyczynski's father, Dr Jerzy Dyczynski - also known as George - told Daily Mail Australia, from the Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, that despite the dangers of the war zone he and his wife were travelling to, it was something they had to do. 'Every day we believe she is still alive,' he said. 'We believe our daughter is alive and we’re going to look after her. 'We know it’s a dangerous place but we have to go because she is our daughter.' A promising space engineer and aspiring astronaut, Fatima Dyczynski, 25, was moving from Germany to start a new life in Perth when she boarded the Malaysia Airlines flight along with 297 other people. Despite authorities advising that there were no survivors of the crash, Angela Rudhart-Dyczynsk said she held hope her daughter might be alive because her mobile phone continued to ring after the plane was downed, The West Australian reported. 'We believe that Fatima could be alive - this is why we're going on this trip,' she said. Mrs Rudhart-Dyczynsk and her husband Jerzy (George) Dyczynski, who live in Mosman Park, left Perth Airport to fly Amsterdam on Thursday wearing t-shirts emblazoned with their daughter's picture and the words 'Fatima We Love You'. Dr Dyczynski vowed he and his wife would 'go on our own' to the Ukrainian war zone where MH17 was shot down if it is discovered Miss Dyczynski's body is among the 100 feared missing, after officials warned victims' families against travelling to the region. Former Perth talkback radio host Howard Sattler, who is close friends with Dr Dyczynski and Mrs Rudhart-Dyczynsk and has spent every day with them since the crash, said they believed there was a remote possibility she could have survived. Mr Sattler said that since Friday the 'deeply religious' couple had been watching footage about the crash on television hoping to see anything that might say their daughter is alive. Scroll down for video . Dr and Mrs Dyczynski arrived at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands on Thursday and walked past the MH17 memorial . Dr Dyczynski and his wife, Angela, still hold onto hope that their daughter, Fatima, is alive . 'Their faith is keeping them going,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'They believe the freezing temperatures up there would be counteracted by the explosion and on that basis she may have survived. 'People may say ""How could she survive a fall of 30,000 feet?"" but it has happened in extremely rare cases that the seat has remained intact. 'There are still 16 people confirmed to not have been found at all.' Mr Sattler became friends with Dr Dyczynski, a cardiologist and acupuncture practitioner, after seeing him as a patient. He said the couple moved to Australia after their daughter 'fell in love with the place' when she spent a year as a student at Perth's John XXIII College in Year 11. Mr Sattler said all three had applied for permanent residency and had received it this week. 'Posthumously she's an Australian I guess,' he said. Mr Sattler said the couple would arrive in Amsterdam on Thursday afternoon AEST, and their plans depended on whether Miss Dyczynski's remains were among those transported to The Netherlands. Miss Dyczynski Perth-based parents arrived in Europe to find their daughter . 59908 . 143802 . 60651 . 71425 . 29443 . 'It depends a lot, totally, on the fact if she's there she's there if not they make look elsewhere,' he said. Since Friday Miss Dyczynski's parents have been at home reflecting on stories about her. 'Some of her old school friends have visited, friends of the family, people from their church,' Mr Sattler said said. 'She was so brilliant and remarkable. 'She is an amazing young woman for whom it was often said nothing was impossible for her.' Mr Sattler has written a blog post explaining why Mr Dyczynski's believes she may have miraculously survived. 'He theorises that she may have been catapulted into the sky, still strapped to her seat and if it had remained intact it could have cushioned the impact of falling to ground from such a great height,' Mr Sattler wrote. 'The freezing temperatures encountered by anyone exposed to the atmosphere at over ten thousand metres could have caused the brains of any survivors of the initial blast to ""hibernate"", at the same time countering the heat generated by the explosion, he says. Miss Dyczynski, who is trained in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering, was moving to Perth to start an internship at IBM . 'With time crucial, Dr Jerzy has sent urgent messages to Prime Minister Abbott, Foreign Minister Bishop and international news outlets detailing his theories and calling for the search to be upscaled.' Dr Dyczynski is also critical of the fact that there were no medical personnel at the crash site in case 'life-saving measures' were needed. 'These are not the ramblings of a mad man, just the overwhelming feeling of grief, finding an avenue to soften the excruciating horror that has befallen him,' Mr Sattler wrote. Dr Dyczynski and Mrs Angela Rudhart-Dyczynski are some of the first people to take up the Australian government's offer to fly victims' families to the Netherlands to accompany their loved ones home, if they so wish. Miss Dyczynski, who was trained in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering, was moving to Perth to start an internship at IBM. Miss Dyczynski was the chief executive and founder of Xoterra Space, a high-tech start-up company developing means to create tiny satellites which would connect mobile phones to directly to space technology.","George Dyczynski and his wife Angela are now on their way to the crash site .

"By . Matthew Blake . Weed with Eaze: Startup company Eaze promises to 'dispatch a professional caregiver' to deliver prompt delivery of a range of different strains of cannabis to clients across San Francisco . A smartphone app that hand-delivers marijuana to customers' doors within ten minutes has been branded the 'Uber of weed' after it was launched last week. Startup company Eaze promises to 'dispatch a professional caregiver' to deliver prompt delivery of a range of different strains of cannabis to clients across San Francisco. They claim to be able to deliver the package within ten minutes to anyone who lives in the Bay Area after they register for the 'on-demand healthcare delivery service'. Within . days of its launch, the firm was widely compared to Uber - an app which . allows customers to book and track taxis on their mobile phone. Eaze offers the same technology, letting users watch their caregiver's progress as they drive to their home. Delivery . is a free service for patients, with money to pay drivers reportedly . coming from revenue that Eaze takes in from dispensaries for generating . extra business. 'We're offering the revolution of . on-demand services for medical marijuana patients,' said Eaze CEO and . founder Keith McCarty, formerly an executive at enterprise social . network Yammer, which was acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion. He says . his app has automated the generally 'slow, cumbersome, and . unpredictable' process of checking dispensaries and confirming . eligibility.' 'The . process of acquiring medical marijuana can be slow, cumbersome and . unpredictable,' he said. 'Often patients have to search multiple . dispensaries manually each time they order as stock often varies. 'Verification . of medical eligibility can take 24 hours and has to be repeated with . each dispensary. Eaze’s technology automates all of that so each patient . can have a consistent, comfortable experience -- and can focus on . getting better.' Classified: Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug by the government, but pot entrepreneurship is growing. So is legalization of marijuana - currently 23 states and the District of Columbia allow medical pot use . Each driver will start a shift by picking up a kit at a dispensary preloaded with 8 ounces of pot - the legal limit they can carry. Typical sales are one-eighth ounce, or 3.5 grams, which sells for about $50. 'Having (enough supply for) 64 deliveries on them means they can get to patients in an average time of 10 minutes,' McCarty said. 'That's a compelling value proposition.' Eaze will . verify customers' legal rights to buy marijuana by reviewing images of . their doctors' notes and drivers' licenses, submitted online. Drivers' cars will be unmarked - important because they must accept cash for . deliveries, due to strict federal rules regulating banks and credit card . companies. The . service will be in operation daily from 8 a.m. to midnight. Drivers . will make $10 per delivery. McCarty wouldn't say how much Eaze would . collect as a commission from dispensaries. 'On-demand healthcare': The company's website (pictured) claims to be able to deliver the package within ten minutes to anyone who lives in the Bay Area after they register for the 'on-demand healthcare delivery service' Drivers . must pass criminal and driving background checks and must themselves be . medical marijuana users so they are legally allowed to carry 8 ounces. 'We want them to be able to relate to the patients,' McCarty said. Revolution: Eaze CEO and founder Keith McCarty says he is 'offering the revolution of on-demand services for medical marijuana patients' McCarty says they won't drive under the influence - and that the company is considering some form of drug tests for employees. 'We don't have a protocol yet, but plan to do it,' he said. According to McCarty, Eaze carries insurance in addition to the drivers' personal policies, but the company did not respond to a request for more details on the amount and type of its policies. While currently, the company only operates around San Francisco, McCarthy says he plans soon to move into southern California, then to Washington and Colorado. But his grand vision involves a vast network of caregivers across the country who deliver marijuana to patients in all states where the drug is legal. He added: 'Although the healing effects of marijuana have been researched and documented, the medicine is still subject to much controversy. 'It’s a shame that patients requiring marijuana for chronic illnesses are often stigmatized. At Eaze, we developed technology to make it easier and quicker for patients to receive their medicine through professional delivery experiences.' Eaze, however, already faces stiff competition in this apparent emerging market and is not the only startup which offers such a service. Just last week it was reported that two 19-year-old students at the University of Washington in Seattle launched a phone app to deliver cannabis to medical-marijuana users. Josiah Tullis and Megh Vakharia also describe their business, called Canary, as ‘Uber for marijuana.’ The app allows medical-marijuana cardholders to select different strains of pot from different medical dispensaries and then have it delivered by a cardholding driver. Another company, called Grassp, also offers a near-identical service in Los Angeles. Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug by the government, . but pot entrepreneurship is growing.

"By . Aap . The Australian government is increasingly confident it will be only a matter of days before the remaining bodies of MH17 victims and their effects are transported from the crash site in eastern Ukraine. It comes after international experts, including Australians, finally arrived at the crash site - two weeks after the tragedy. The optimism comes after a meeting between Russian, Ukrainian and separatist leaders in the Belarussian capital Minsk and the successful mission of an advance team involving Australian and Dutch police. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Volodymyr Groysman wrote on Twitter that within two days militants would allow passage of the bodies through the war-torn Donetsk region. Experts who are recovering the remaining bodies of the MH17 victims have finally arrived at the crash site . The advance team identified a new, safer but longer route to the site. This was the route a 14-vehicle convoy of up to 100 Australian and Dutch police and a team from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe later took to reach the area in Donetsk on Friday. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the team would 'start working in earnest' to recover further remains and the belongings of the passengers and crew of the Malaysia Airlines plane went down on July 17. Ms Bishop, who was leaving Ukraine to return to Australia, said refrigerated vans would carry the remains, which would then be transferred to the Netherlands for identification. It has taken experts two weeks after the crash to arrive at the site to recover as many as 80 bodies still remaining . Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the remains from the site would be transferred to the Netherlands for identification . 'My work is done but the mission goes on,' she said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the advance team had itself recovered some remains. Australian officials believe as many as 80 bodies are still at the site. The Boeing 777 is believed to have been shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired by pro-Russian separatists, killing all 298 people on board - including 38 Australians. Mr Abbott said the joint mission between Australian Federal Police and Dutch police was risky because of the continued fighting which involved Ukrainian forces and separatists in the area. But the government had taken the best expert advice and Australia's special envoy Angus Houston was 'plugged in' to the international team involved in the mission. 'But let's not forget 298 innocent people have been murdered, 38 Australians have been murdered,' Mr Abbott said. 'We owe it to our dead to bring them back, we owe it to their families to bring them back.' Tony Abbott said the joint mission between Australian Federal Police and Dutch police to protect experts at the site was risky because of the fighting . The advance team had paused for a moment's silence at the crash site, almost two weeks to the hour since the plane went down. Senior representatives from Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE met in Minsk as news came through of the successful advance mission. A statement following the meeting said the senior representatives had committed to securing safe access by international investigators to the crash site until their work on the spot was completed. There was also agreement on the release of hostages, improved monitoring of the ceasefire and better control and verification on the border between Ukraine and Russia. Another meeting will be held next week.","Bodies will go to the Netherlands where they will be identified by experts .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Britain may have a new species of bat. Geoffroy’s bat was first seen in the UK last year but a second sighting has raised hopes that the tiny mammal has set up home here. A solitary male, usually found in continental Europe, was spotted at a nature reserve near Bath. DNA in its droppings will be analysed to confirm the discovery. A Geoffroy's Tailless Bat was discovered at a nature reserve near Bath . Jim Mullholland, of Avon Bat Group, said the creature was too far inland for it to be a vagrant. ‘Given the sedentary nature of the species, which typically only travels up to 25 miles between its breeding area and hibernation site, this find provides bat experts with hope that Geoffroy’s bat is now resident within the UK.' Named after French naturalist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, the bat was first seen in West Sussex last September. The species (Myotis emarginatus) is generally found across the Mediterranean, Belgium, and southern parts of the Netherlands, Germany and Poland, as well as northwest Africa and the west side of Asia Minor. Perfect habitat?: The view close to Brown's Folly near Bath where the bat was discovered by Jim Mullholland . Brown's Folly is well-known for bats with 13 of the 17 UK bat species recorded there including the greater horseshoe and Bechstein's. A key distinguishing feature of the Geoffroy's bat, which is named after the French naturalist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, is the notch on its ear. The 100-acre Brown's Folly reserve, where the bat was found, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, has wildflower-rich grasslands and ancient woodlands.","Hope that Geoffroy's bat species may settle here permanently .

"By . Ap  Reporter . Procter & Gamble executives say it was striking the first time they witnessed a man shave while sitting barefoot on the floor in a tiny hut in India. He had no electricity, no running water and no mirror. The 20 U.S.-based executives observed the man in 2008 during one of 300 visits they made to homes in rural India. The goal? To gain insights they could use to develop a new razor for India. ‘That, for me, was a big 'a-ha,'‘ said Alberto Carvalho, vice president, global Gillette, a unit of P&G. ‘I had never seen people shaving like that.’ Oops: Gillette shave products are now seeing success in the huge Indian market, but their first attempt was an embarrassing flop . The visits kicked off the 18 months it took to develop Gillette Guard, a low-cost razor designed for India and other emerging markets. Introduced three years ago, Guard quickly gained market share and today represents two out of every three razors sold in India. The story of how Guard came to be illustrates the balance companies must strike when creating products for emerging markets: It's not as simple as slapping a foreign label on an American product. To successfully sell products overseas, particularly in developing markets, companies must tweak them so they're relevant to the people who live there. And often, that means rethinking everything from the product's design to its cost. More companies will have to consider this balancing act as they increasingly move into emerging markets such as India, China and Brazil to offset slower growth in developed regions such as the U.S. For its part, P&G has doubled the percentage of its roughly $20 billion in annual revenue coming from emerging markets since 2000 to about 40 percent. Ali Dibadj, a Bernstein analyst who follows P&G, said the Guard razor, which has been used by more than 50 million men in India, serves as a roadmap for companies seeking to court emerging markets. Unfocused group: Gillette tested its Vector razor on MIT students of Indian descent rather than on India residents. The problem? Unlike all Indians, the students all used running water . ‘It made P&G realize how much investment it really takes to be successful in India,’ he said. ‘That's the art of emerging markets.’ India long has been an attractive country for U.S. companies looking for growth. It has 1.24 billion people. And its economy is bustling: India's annual gross domestic product growth was 3.2 percent in 2012, according to the World Bank, compared with 2.2 percent in the U.S. the same year. Still, India's widespread poverty presents challenges for companies used to customers with more disposable income. India's per capita income is just about $124 a month, compared with $4,154 in the U.S., according to the World Bank. Gillette has sold razors in India for over a decade. The company had 37.3 percent market share in 2007, selling its high end Mach3 razor, which costs about $2.75, and a stripped down Vector two-bladed razor on the lower end, which goes for about 72 cents. Learning: When it took on the Indian market again with the Guard, Gillette took into consideration the country's widespread lack of running water . But Gillette wanted more of the market. To do that, P&G executives would have to attract the nearly 500 million Indians who use double-edged razors, an old fashioned T-shaped razor that has no protective piece of plastic that goes between the blade and the skin when shaving. This razor, which makes skin cuts more likely, costs just a few pennies per blade. Carvalho, who spearheaded Gillette's effort to grow market share in India, didn't want to rush into designing a product, though. Gillette had stumbled once before with its early version of the Vector in 2002. The version of that razor had a plastic push bar that slid down to unclog the razor. The bar was added because Indian men have thicker hair and a higher hair density than their American counterparts. Adding to that, they often shave less frequently than American men, so they wind up shaving longer beards. Gillette, which is based in Boston, wanted to test the product among Indian consumers before launching it, but instead of making the costly trip abroad, they had Indian students at nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology test the razor. ‘They all came back and said 'Wow that's a big improvement,' Carvalho recalls. But when Gillette launched the razor in India, the reaction was different. Executives were baffled about why the razor flopped until they traveled to India and observed men using a cup of water to shave. All the MIT students had running water. Without that, the razor stayed clogged. ‘That's another 'a-ha' moment,’ Carvalho said. ‘That taught us the importance that you really need to go where your consumers are, not just to talk to them, but observe and spend time with them to gather the key insight.’ P&G acquired Gillette in 2005 and the next several years were spent integrating the companies. But in 2008, the focus on India returned when Carvalho decided to bring 20 people, ranging from engineers to developers, from Gillette's U.S. headquarters to India for three weeks. They spent 3,000 hours with more than 1,000 consumers at their homes, in stores and in small group discussions. They observed people's routines throughout the day, sometimes staying late into the evening. They also hosted small group discussions. ‘We asked them what their aspirations were and why they wanted to shave, and how often,’ Carvahlo said. They learned that families often live in huts without electricity and share a bathroom with other huts. So men shave sitting on their floors with a bowl of water, often without a mirror, in the dark morning hours. As a result, shaving could take up to half an hour, compared with the five to seven minutes it takes to shave in American households. And Indian men strain to not cut themselves. The takeaway: In the U.S., razor makers spent decades on marketing centered on a close shave, adding blade after blade to achieve a smoother cheek. But men in India are more concerned about not cutting themselves. ‘I worked in this category for 23 years and I never realized with those insights that's how they think about the product,’ said Eric Liu, Gillette's director of research and development, global shave care. With that knowledge, the Gillette team started making a new razor for the Indian market. In nine months, P&G developed five prototypes. The company declined to give specifics on each prototype for competitive reasons. But they tested things like handle designs, how well the blade cuts hair and how easy the razor is to rinse. The resulting Guard razor has one blade, to put the emphasis on safety rather than closeness, compared with two to five blades found on U.S. razors. One insight from filming shavers was that Indians grip the razors in many different ways, so the handle is textured to allow for easy gripping. There's also a hole at the handle's base, to make it easier to hang up, and a small comb by the blade since Indians hair growth tends to be thicker. Next, the company had to figure out how to produce the razor at the right price. ‘We had to say 'How do we do this at ruthless cost?'‘ Carvalho said. P&G scrutinized the smallest details. It cut the number of components in the razor down to 4 compared with 25 needed for Mach3, Gillette's three-blade razor. They even made the razor's handle hollow so it would be lighter and cheaper to make. ‘I can remember talking about changes to this product that were worth a thousandth, or two thousandths of a cent,’ said Jim Keighley, the company's associate director for product engineering. The result? The Guard costs about one third of what it costs to make the Vector. Gillette sells the Guard for 15 rupees, or 34 cents, and each razor blade is 5 rupees, or 12 cents. The company's strategy seems to have worked. P&G says with 9 percent market share, Guard has grown share faster than any other P&G brand in India. And Gillette's market share for razors and blades in India has grown to 49.1 percent, according to Euromonitor. That's up from 37.3 in 2007.","Gillette makes the Guard razor, which accounts for two of every three razor now sold in India .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An American girl who was abducted by her non-custodial mother as a baby almost two decades ago has been found 'safe and healthy' living with her mom in Australia. Savanna Harris Todd has been listed as a missing person for the last 19 years after disappearing from South Carolina in 1994 when she was 11-months-old. Her mother, Dorothy Lee Barnett, has remained the prime suspect after losing custody of her daughter to ex-husband Benjamin Harris Todd, after a court determined Barnett suffered from bi-polar disorder. Barnett, who split with her husband before the birth of her daughter, had picked up Savanna from her former mother-in-law's house in Isle of Palms on April 22, 1994, and the two vanished the next day. First time she has been seen in 20 years: Savanna Harris Todd (right) pictured for the first time since disappearing as a baby in 1994. Now living under the name Samantha Geldenhuys in Queensland, Australia, she is seen here in a Facebook photo . A long way from South Carolina: Savanna Harris Todd and her mother Dorothy Lee Burnett have been living on the Sunshine Coast, in the Australian state of Queensland, for at least the last four years under fake names. They had been officially listed as missing persons since 1994 until Barnett was arrest on November 4 . Then and now: Savanna Harris Todd has remained a missing person for 19 years after being kidnapped by her mother in April 1994. Pictures of her as a baby (left) were used to create impressions of what she might look like today (right). On November 4, Savanna was located in Queensland, Australia, living under the name Samantha with her mother, Dorothy Lee Barnett, who has been charged with three federal offenses . Now, Barnett, 53, has been arrested by Australian Federal Police on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland after living under several aliases. Savanna, now 20, who has been living under the name Samantha, was by her mothers side during a court appearance on Wednesday, where Barnett was denied bailed. According to The Australian, Savanna - who has been studying nursing at a Queensland university - held up a sign during the hearing saying 'We love you Mom'. Barnett, who 'winked' back at her daughter, was supported by over two dozen people, some of whom had sworn affidavits attesting to her good character. Barnett's barrister, Jeff Hunter QC, said his client was not a flight risk and had a close and special relationship with the Sunshine Coast community. She has maintained a job while in Australia and managed to get a mortgage on her home. Barnett was charged with international parental kidnapping and two counts of false statement in a passport application after being captured on November 4. Barnett will be extradited back to the United States to face her charges. She is thought to have fled the United States using a fake passport with the help of a secretive organization called Children of the Underground, who help women stuck in abusive relationships. According to Queensland news reports, Barnett initially fled to South Africa, where she married a man, Juan Geldenhuys, in 1995 and later gave birth to a son, now 17, before moving to New Zealand and becoming a citizen. Five years ago she settled in Australia after splitting with Mr Geldenhuys, who recently died of bone cancer. During her alleged time on the run, Barnett used aliases such as Alexandria Maria Canton, federal authorities said, to evade detection. Dorothy Lee Barnett (pictured left in the early 1990s and right in an artists impression of her today) lost custody of her daughter Savanna to her ex-husband Benjamin Harris Todd because tests showed her to be bi-polar. Barnett and Savanna disappeared from South Carolina in 1994 but have now been found in Australia following almost 20 years on the run. Barnett has been charged and faces extradition to the U.S. Once in March 2003 and again in March 2004, Barnett used her new name, Alexandria Maria Geldenhuys, to attempt to get a U.S. passport, according to the indictment against her. Court papers say Savanna's father was the one who lead authorities to find his ex-wife. An Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Barnett's second husband, had grown suspicious of her. He heard Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship. A simple internet search provided old photos of Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna, and the Australian man was able to contact Benjamin Harris Todd. Outside court this week, Savanna- Samantha - would not comment when approached by reporters. But in an affidavit tendered to the court, Savanna described Barnett as 'an amazing woman, having raised both myself and my brother and always giving us the support we needed to become the people that we are'. Barnett, a flight attendant, and Todd got married in December 1991 in Beaufort. She filed for divorce in February 1993, alleging in court documents that Todd had left her because he was angry about her being pregnant, reports The Post and Courier. Todd countered, saying Barnett physically and emotionally abused him. That month, Todd was given temporary custody of his unborn daughter after psychiatric tests showed Barnett to be bi-polar. Savanna was born May 6, 1993. During a court-supervised visit in April 1994, the two left for a birthday party without an escort and never returned, the police reported at the time. Barnett’s disappearance prompted a probe by the FBI, which obtained a warrant for her arrest in April 1994. Artists created images depicting what Savanna and Barnett would look like as the years went on. If convicted of the charges she is facing, Barnett could spend three years in prison on the kidnapping charge and 10 years on each of the two passport counts.

"By . Damien Gayle . Forget about the Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain, now two Englishmen and a Welshman have gone up a mountain and come down a hill. The three ramblers have stripped a remote mountain in the Scottish Highlands of its status after measuring it at two foot six inches below the official height. John Barnard, Graham Jackson and Myrddyn Phillips set out to complete Britain's most daring mountain survey on Knight's Peak on the Isle of Skye. Making a molehill out of a mountain: Knight's . Peak, highlighted, has been downgraded after three amateur cartographers . scaled it and found it fell short of mountain status by just . six-and-a-half inches . 'It was a difficult climb to the summit': . Myrddyn Phillips beside the Leica GS15 on the north-westerly summit of . Knight's Peak, which he and his friends scaled equipped with ropes, . harnesses and helmets . Measurements: The Leica GS15 is a state-of-the-art, highly precise dual frequency GPS mapping tool . Maps list the jagged rocky peak in the Cuillin mountain range at 3,002ft high, just two feet above the 3,000ft required height for mountain status. However it has been a source of controversy among hillwalkers who suspected it fell short of the height given on the maps. Equipped with state-of-the-art GPS technology, the trio carried out the risky climb with ropes, harnesses and helmets. Then they spent two hours at the summit recording hundreds of measurements. While nearby peak Basteir Tooth was confirmed at 3,009ft, the reading for Knight's Peak fell short of the magic mountain mark of 3,000ft by just six-and-a-half inches. As a result, Knight's Peak has been stripped of its status as a 'munro top' - the name given to secondary peaks in Scotland above 3,000ft. Their escapade is a deflating inversion of the story of The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain, a film in which a Welsh villagers conspire to turn their local hill into a mountain by building an earth cairn on top of it to restore their town's pride. Negotiating the 'Bad Step' on Am Basteir on way to the Basteir Tooth: That peak was confirmed at 3,009ft . The survey team on the summit of the Basteir . Tooth: Mr Phillips and his friends see themselves as carrying on the . work of Scottish mountaineer Sir Hugo Munro, who compiled the first list . of Scottish mountains in 1891 . The findings have been accepted by the Scottish Mountaineering Club, custodians of the official list of munros and munro tops. Munros are named after Scottish mountaineer Sir Hugo Munro, who compiled the first list of Scottish mountains over 3,000ft in 1891. A munro top is also a summit above 3,000ft, but one that is considered a secondary peak of a munro. The most famous munro is Ben Nevis, which stands at 4,409ft tall. Mr Phillips, 52, said: 'We have surveyed over 150 summits in Britain but none compared to the task we set ourselves in the Cuillin Mountains. 'Knight's Peak has long been a source of controversy because in the early 1970s it was listed on Ordnance Survey maps as being 2,994ft tall. 'Then, when it appeared in the Munro Tables in 1997, its height was given as 2,998ft which is still below the 3,000ft mark but it was included anyway. 'Current maps list it as 3,002ft. 'Hill walkers have been arguing about its true height for a long time and we wanted to provide a definitive answer. 'In that sense we are continuing the great work of Sir Hugh Munro in accurately mapping Scotland's munros. 'While he had to use an aneroid barometer to get his measurements, we use dual frequency GPS mapping tools. 'It was a difficult climb to the summit but we got the definitive data we were after which confirms it falls short of the 3,000ft mark.' On the summit of the Basteir Tooth: The nearby Knight's Peak has been a source of controversy among hill walkers after its official height kept on changing on different maps published at different times . Long way down: This shot of the Basteir Tooth summit shows just how risky a climb they had to undertake . Andy Nisbet, president of the Scottish Mountaineering Club, said the reclassification of Knight's Peak had been met with mixed reactions from club members. He said: 'There are some who think it's a shame that Knight's Peak is no longer a munro top because it is very dramatic and one of the hardest to summit. 'However others are more concerned with having the most accurate list of munro tops possible. 'The figures speak for themselves though - Knight's Peak is not 3,000ft high. 'The Scottish Mountaineering Club accepts the findings of the survey and future tables and books will reflect the new classification.' Mark Greaves, a geodetic analyst at the Ordnance Survey, said official maps would now be ammended with the new heights for Knight's Peak and Basteir Tooth. He said: 'We are provided with the data which we then cross check. The results will be rounded up or down to the nearest metre and then changed on our maps.' The survey team setting off on their mission: Mark Greaves, a geodetic analyst at the Ordnance Survey, said official maps would now be ammended with the new heights for Knight's Peak and Basteir Tooth .

Mr Barnard and Mr Jackson are retired research chemists from Mold, north Wales, and Cheshire respectively, and Mr Phillips is a former manager at a printing firm and lives near Shrewsbury. They have measured over 150 hills in England, Scotland and Wales since 2008 and downgraded two munro tops previous to Knight's Peak - Sgyrr nan Ceannaichean and Beinn a' Chlaidheimh. They have also elevated two hills to mountain status, which in England and Wales is classed as 2,000ft. In 2008 they measured Mynydd Graig Goch in Snowdonia at 2,000ft and 6 inches - up from 1,998ft. Earlier this year they upgraded Thack Moor in the Cumbrian Penines from 1,998ft to 2,000ft.","Knight's Peak on the Isle of Skye had been thought to be 3,002ft high .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Divorce battle: Dr Anushika Sharma is involved in an 'acrimonious divorce' battle with her ex-husband and his family - particularly his mother - over a £10million chain of dental practices . A ‘strong mutual antipathy’ between a  millionairess dentist and her former mother-in-law is at the heart of a bitter divorce battle, a court heard yesterday. The dispute over the family business – divided up after the couple’s separation – involves not only the woman’s ex-husband but his ‘controlling’ mother. Anushika Sharma, 36, and her 45-year-old former husband Sunny, worked together running their ‘niche’ dentistry business and are believed to have had assets worth up to £10million. They raised two children together as their empire of 12 practices spread across London and the Home Counties. And when the couple divorced last year, Mrs Sharma took ownership of seven of them.But now Mr Sharma and his ‘strong-willed’ mother Kesh Sharma have insisted that  five of those surgeries belong to them. The fight has resulted in an atmosphere of ‘unremitting hostility’ between the divorcee, her ex-husband and his family – particularly the older Mrs Sharma, judges were told. Last year Anushika Sharma claimed she owned seven of the 12 successful dental practices, and family judge Mr Justice Simon, ruled in her favour. The mother-of-two said she had started a parallel company, to escape ‘interference’ in her commercial affairs by her ‘dominant and highly controlling mother-in-law’. Sunny Sharma, his mother and his brother Rajesh are now asking three judges at London’s Appeal Court to return ownership to them. Representing Anushika Sharma, Alan Gourgey QC, told the court: ‘The wife is a dentist and it is common ground that she owns two practices. ‘The beneficial ownership of five other practices has, however, been the subject of dispute between the parties.’ Businessman Sunny Sharma, 45, pictured left outside London's Appeal Court, and his wife Dr Sharma, right, are fighting out who owns which practices . The barrister said the younger Mrs . Sharma acquired three practices in Hampshire, one in London and one in . Banbury, Oxfordshire, when she was a director of the family dental . business. She had done that because she feared her formidable mother-in-law . ‘controlling’  her and wanted to leave the marriage with her business . interests intact, Mr Gourgey added. Referring to the initial hearing, he said: ‘Mr Justice Simon found that, . at the heart of the case, lay a strong mutual antipathy between two . very strong-willed women, the husband’s mother Kesh, and the wife. Dr Sharma claims she is entitled to beneficiary ownership of five of the family's 12 practices, on top of the two she already owns . 'Kesh had been the driving force of the Sharma family businesses and she . held a dominant and highly controlling position within the Sharma . family.’ He added that the older Mrs Sharma ‘expected deference from her family, . which she regarded as her due, both as a mother and one of the founders . of the family fortune’. But the court heard that Anushika Sharma was ‘aware of her . mother-in-law’s control’ so obtained ‘fully informed consent by all the . joint venturers to her acquiring new dental practices for her own . account’. Richard Snowden QC, representing Sunny Sharma and his family, argued . that Anushika Sharma had acted unlawfully in acquiring the five . practices for her own company while still ‘wearing the hat’ of a . director of the Sharma family business. He told the judges that the family’s ‘financial standing’ had allowed . the practices to succeed and that she owed the business a duty of . loyalty. Adding that Anushika Sharma was ‘a daughter-in- law for whom [Kesh . Sharma] had no warm feelings,’ Mr Snowden argued that the younger woman . had breached duty of trust. Mr Gourgey said Anushika Sharma had ‘acted honestly and reasonably’ and . should not be made to hand over the five practices she had worked so . hard to establish. ‘Kesh was in complete control of the Sharma family businesses. If . Anushika fell out with Kesh, she would be vulnerable,’ he told the . court. ‘Kesh agreed that Anushika would have full control [of the five practices] without any interference. ‘The success of the business relied entirely on Anushika, the only qualified dentist and the driving force of the business.’ In last year’s hearing, which was decided in the younger Mrs Sharma’s . favour, Mr  Justice Simon said that the family had ‘lived with this case . for many months of unremitting hostility’. He added: ‘The two sides are very suspicious of each other and highly antagonistic.’ The Appeal Court judges have reserved their judgment on the case, which will be delivered at a later date.","Divorce feud centres on Dr Anushika Sharma, 36, and her mother-in-law .

"By . Sam Webb . A holidaymaker has told how he cheated death when he was gored by a rampaging bull. Brian Gage, 57, was tossed and dragged 200 yards by the 1,300lb beast during an annual 'running of the bull' festival in Portugal. He’d climbed a tree to escape the enraged animal when it speared his leg with its horn and pulled him down. Mr Gage, 57, was gored by a bull as he tried to climb a tree and dragged to the floor, where he was mauled by the powerful animal . Lucky to be alive: Mr Gage recovering at home. He suffered extensive wounds including a dislocated shoulder and five broken ribs. He also needed 300 stitches . Mr Gage, of Chingford, Essex, and his friend Stuart Field, 42, were at the bull event in the town of Moita do Ribatejo when he was attacked. Local people then fought to save Mr Gage by pulling on the bull’s tail. He was eventually freed and taken to Sao Jose Hospital in Lisbon, where he underwent initial 10-hour surgery for a raft of horrific injuries, before the family endured an anxious three-day wait as Mr Gage was treated in intensive care, with his wife Jill by his side. Ten weeks after the ordeal he is home, but still confined to his bed. He was on a three-week holiday with family and friends when the attack happened. Mr Gage had just finished a family meal in the town of Moita when he decided to step outside with three of his friends, beyond the restaurant gate. He was at the bull event in the town of Moita do Ribatejo when he was attacked. Local people fought to free him by pulling on the animal's tail . During the annual bull event, gates and bars are installed in front of bars, clubs and restaurants to protect the public. Two of Mr Gage’s friends crossed the street and climbed a tree to watch the event and Mr Gage was standing near a closed gate and suddenly realised he couldn’t get back into the restaurant. He said: 'I walked towards a tree and then the bull appeared directly opposite me. As I climbed the tree a bit, the bull had gone around the tree and stuck his horn through my leg and dragged me down off the tree, at which point, I thought that was it. 'The bull pushed me along the ground and threw me up in the air. It pushed me against a wall and continued to gore me (in the stomach) from left to right and went through my scrotum. 'It gave me five broken ribs, took my arm out of its socket, and resulted in me needing over 300 stitches where it slashed me to pieces.' Participants in Moita seek respite in the sea in this picture from the 2004 'running of the bull' An acrobat jumps over a charging bull at Moita bullring. The town's running of the bull festival is a popular festival for tourists and locals . Happier times: Mr Gage (centre in the beige shirt) before the attack. Ten weeks on and Mr Gage is still bed-bound. He cannot put any pressure on his right leg as he may tear the skin graft and he is only just able to lift his left arm . Local people taking part in the event . tried to get the bull away from Mr Gage by tugging its tail and banging . objects on the ground. However, Mr Gage was thrown around and dragged 200 yards, saying he didn’t feel a thing as he was in shock. When the bull released Mr Gage, local people moved in and placed him on a stretcher and he was rushed to a first aid centre. The victim (right) before the accident. He has praised the medical staff in Portugal who saved his life . Mr Gage praised the people at the festival and the medical staff at the hospital. He said: 'Without a doubt, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.' But he said getting on a plane and returning to the UK was also terrifying. Ten weeks on and Mr Gage is still bed-bound. He cannot put any pressure on his right leg as he may tear the skin graft and he is only just able to lift his left arm. Mr Field watched the drama unfold from up a nearby tree. He said: 'The bull charged at him front on, pinned him up against a wall, flipped him to the ground, rammed into him several times, and then started dragging him. 'The horn got under his skin, split open his right leg, went up the back of his left leg, and across his groin.' And Mr Gage’s daughter Vicki, 26, was full of praise for the medical staff in Portugal. She said: 'The injuries my dad suffered were awful, absolutely horrific and it has been a very stressful situation because he could have died. 'The care and treatment he has received from the staff has been fantastic and the intensive treatment unit is one of the best I have ever been to.' At a similar 'running of the bull event' event in Pamplona, northern Spain, 15 people have been killed at the annual festival since records began in 1911, and 200 to 300 are usually injured each year.","Brian Gage, 57, was trying to get up a tree to escape the powerful animal .

"By . Matt Blake . and Daily Mail Reporter . Death by stoning for convicted adulterers could be rewritten into Afghan law, 12 years after the barbaric execution method was banished along with the Taliban regime, a senior government official has said. Rohullah Qarizada, who is part of the . sharia Islamic law committee working on the draft, said the sentence could only be passed if the act of adultery was witnessed by four people or more. The sentence for married adulterers, along with flogging for . unmarried offenders, appears in a draft revision of the country's penal . code being managed by the ministry of justice. 'Inhumane': The sentence for married adulterers, along with flogging for unmarried offenders, appears in a draft revision of the country's penal code being managed by the ministry of justice (pictured is a protest in Berlin) Backward steps: An Afghan family talks to a prisoner through wire at the police headquarters prison in Kabul. If the revision of the country's penal code is passed through adulterers could be stoned to death, so long as there are four witnesses . 'We are working on the draft of a sharia penal code where the punishment for adultery, if there are four eyewitnesses, is stoning,' said Qarizada, who is also head of the Afghan Independent Bar Association. It is the latest sign that human rights won at great cost since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 are rolling back as foreign troops withdraw. 'Men and women who commit adultery shall be punished based on the circumstances to one of the following punishments: lashing, stoning [to death],' article 21 states. A Taliban council: During the its time in power, the Taliban ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist. Women were not permitted to go out on their own, girls were barred from schools and men were obliged to grow long beards. Article 23 goes on to state that stonings should be carried out in public. Billions have been invested on promoting human rights in Afghanistan over more than 12 years of war and donors fear that hard won progress, particularly for women, may be eroding. During the Taliban's 1996-2001 time in power, convicted adulterers were routinely shot or stoned in executions held mostly on Fridays. Women were not permitted to go out on their own, girls were barred from schools and men were obliged to grow long beards. 'Absolutely shocking': Human Rights Watch blasted Afghan President Hamid Karzai for entertaining the idea of bringing back stoning . Providing fresh evidence popular support for the brutal punishment has endured, two lovers narrowly escaped being stoned in Baghlan province north of Kabul, but were publicly shot over the weekend instead, officials said. 'While they were fleeing, suddenly their car crashed and locals arrested them. People wanted to stone them on the spot but some elders disagreed,' the provincial head of women's affairs, Khadija Yaqeen, told Reuters on Monday. 'The next day they decided and shot both of them dead in public. Our findings show that the woman's father had ordered to shoot both man and woman.' The public execution was confirmed by the provincial police chief's spokesman, who said the killings were unlawful. 'It is absolutely shocking that 12 years after the fall of the Taliban government, the Karzai administration might bring back stoning as a punishment,' said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. The U.S. based rights group has urged funding to be tied to commitments and last month, Norway took the rare step of cutting aid on the grounds that Afghanistan had failed to meet commitments to protect women's rights and fight corruption. Most donors, however, have stopped short of using money to pressure President Hamid Karzai's administration and U.S. and United Nations officials were aware of the plan to reintroduce stoning, Qarizada said. The new law, he told Reuters, was unlikely to make stoning a common practice. 'The judge asks each witness many questions and if one answer differs from other witnesses then the court will reject the claim,' Qarizada said.","The sentence appears in a draft revision of the country's penal .

"By . Tim Shipman In Delhi . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The coalition government has made decisions that are not in the national interest, David Cameron has admitted. The Prime Minister said the Liberal Democrats have forced him into adopting policies that will damage Britain 'in the long term'. But Deputy PM Nick Clegg hit back, insisting blocking some Tory policies was the 'right' thing to do. Tour: David Cameron, who met staff at Air Radio in Kolkata, India, revealed the downside of sharing power with the Lib Dems . Mr Cameron and Tory MP Priti Patel walked through Kolkata, India, where they visited the Howrah Bridge which was built by the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company . Mr Cameron made the explosive claim . about his misgivings on life in coalition at a leadership conference in . the Indian capital Delhi. He . has previously conceded that he has had to make compromises as a result . of the coalition. But the suggestion they could erode the national . interest is a distinct toughening of his rhetoric. He . told the audience of politicians and businessmen: 'I would prefer not . to have a Coalition. We were confronted with a hung parliament after the . election with a country in economic crisis. The most important thing to . do was to get on and form a government…and make it work. 'We’ve . shown it can work. And actually the good parts of Coalition are because . you have these arguments within government and you have to proceed on a . rational basis – that’s good. Compromise: David Cameron, during his visit to India, revealed the impact of coalition on taking the long-term decisions the country needs . Talks: Mr Cameron met with Indian prime minster Manmohan Singh in New Delhi during his trip . Mr Cameron went on: 'I think what’s bad about it is that . sometimes you have to make compromises that are not necessarily in the . long-term interests of the country.' He added: 'I think the clarity you get from single-party government.' Mr Cameron did not specify precisely which Lib Dem policies he was referring to as damaging to Britain. But senior Tories have been angered that Nick Clegg has blocked efforts to reform human rights laws, go further with welfare cuts and blocked the introduction of IT counter terror measures, dubbed the Snooper's Charter by critics. A Tory source said: 'It's no secret there have been a few areas where we would like to have done more.' Defiant: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'right' that his Lib Dems moved to block some Tory policies . Challenged about the remarks today, Mr Clegg was defiant about his role in forcing Conservative policies to be shelved. 'Of course there are compromises that the Conservatives have made that they don’t like,' he said on his weekly LBC 97,3 radio phone-in. 'They wanted to say employers could fire any employee at will, the Liberal Democrats said no you can’t do that. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . 'They floated a plan of having profit making in state schools and we said no. I so happen to think those are things we blocked because it was in the national interest to do so. 'Of course I understand he’s the leader of the Conservative party. He doesn’t like having to make those compromises. 'I so happen to think that with the Liberal Democrats in coalition government, we have not only proved that coalition government works but that it is still anchored in the centre ground.' He defended his role in blocking the Snooper's Charter, which would have given the police and intelligence agencies greater access to communications data. Mr Clegg added: 'I thought it was right for me to say I’m sorry I don’t think its in the national interest to have the Snooper's Charter going ahead, whatever you Conservatives think. 'And I have had to make compromises. I have wanted to go further on all sorts of things that I haven’t been able to, but I think on the whole comprise in politics just as it is in life, as long as you do it in a grown up way, actually works for all sides.' Plea: Mr Cameron, pictured with Tory MP Priti Patel in front of the Shah Sayyid Tomb in the Lodi Gardens in Delhi, urged voters to return a single party government at the next election to prevent a repeat of coalition compromises . Mr Cameron is on a trade visit to India before attending a meeting of Commonwelath leaders in Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister insisted the British public shared his desire for single party government. 'I prefer a more decisive form of government,' he said. 'I think what the British people want is a government with a very clear plan that acts on that plan. 'If the plan works then keep them in; if the plan doesn't work then kick them out.' His words will be greeted with relief by Tory backbenchers who are concerned that Mr Cameron is plotting to form another coalition. The Tory leader is already looking at plans to change Conservative Party rules so that all his MPs would get the chance to vote on a future coalition agreement in order to 'dip their hands in blood' and stop them complaining if there is another power-sharing deal.","Prime Minister complains about 'bad' decisions taken for political reasons .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Managers at a Co-op store resorted to displaying only empty jars of instant coffee because so much was being pinched. Shoppers were told they could claim a full one at the till once they had paid. The tactic, introduced in the centre of Blackpool two months ago, was deemed such a good idea a second branch did the same thing. Staff at a Co-op in Blackpool filled the shelves with empty jars of coffee to stop thieves (pictured) But the practice was stopped this week after the manager of a Tesco store spotted the empty jars and tweeted about them. Matt Ashby sparked a debate by posting a picture of four shelves of empty coffee containers, including a £7.99 200g jar of Douwe Egberts and a £6.79 200g jar of Nescafe Gold Blend. He tweeted: ‘Wow, all coffee in empty jars in Blackpool Co-op.’’ Twitter user Vickiaday noted: ‘I’ve just never seen empty jars before – it’s due to theft.’ The discussion was spotted by a Co-op manager, who tweeted: ‘Not how we would usually do it! Are you able to confirm which store so we can follow-up? Thanks.’ Full jars were back on the shelves on Friday. A shop worker said: ‘We had been losing quite a bit.'

"By . Dan Bloom . It is a feat which would put Cliff Richard to shame. A bright green bus with 600,000 miles on the clock has been saved from the scrapyard - and turned into a holiday cottage. The 31-year-old double decker boasts two double bedrooms, carpets, sofas, a kitchen, idyllic country views and even a log-burning stove in a creation reminiscent of the 1963 hit film Summer Holiday. Not your average campervan: Carpenter Adam Collier-Woods, 42, bought this bright green double decker bus on eBay for £4,500 and and turned it into a holiday let with a kitchen, bedrooms and even a log burner . Summer Holiday: Bus 2464 entered service in 1982 and was almost sent for scrap. Its owner now lets it out to up to six people at a campsite in Wealden, East Sussex - with the remains of the seats still intact . Cosy: The bedrooms on the top deck swap sticky floors for carpets and include a vintage lemonade advert . In the film Cliff Richard played a bus mechanic who turned an iconic red London double decker into a touring campervan and drove it across Europe. The Metro Cammell Weymann metrobus was the same sickly green colour as it is now when carpenter Adam Collier-Woods, 42, bought it on eBay for £4,500. One of more than 4,000 buses of its type, it entered service in 1982 with route number 2464 and spent almost 30 years on the streets of Coventry, Birmingham and Hull. It clocked up 600,000 miles - almost the distance to the moon and back. Mr Collier-Woods spent six months full-time on the project and scoured homeware shops for matching cushions and paint, spending more than £10,000. He said: 'I saw an old double decker rotting in . a farmer's field while driving through the countryside last Christmas. By the time I was home I had already planned in my head how it could be . done. Unusual: Most buses today have little room for pushchairs, but this one has found space for a log-burning stove . Watching the world go by: The £15,000 project includes an original seat on the top deck with idyllic views . Parts of the 31-year-old bus could be mistaken for a 1970s caravan - but it is far more sprawling than that . Snug: The double and bunk beds on the top deck call to mind the carriage of an old-fashioned sleeper train . Mr Collier-Woods spent £10,000 fitting out the bus - and finding green furnishings to match the paint . 'I had a look on eBay and found that double deckers were not as expensive as I would have thought, so bought one for £4,500. 'I . quite simply wanted to give people the experience of staying something . like this, and I think people are interested because it's the type of . bus they may have taken to school.' He named it the Big Green Bus and lets it out starting at £150 a night at a rural campsite in Wealden, East Sussex.

"By . James Rush . and James Nye . A 12-year-old girl has become the latest victim of a dangerous new online trend which sees people setting themselves on fire. Daisy Schumer, of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, had to be taken to hospital with burns to her back after taking part in what has been dubbed 'the Fire Challenge'. The new trend has seen videos posted online of people pouring alcohol over themselves and setting the accelerant on fire. Scroll down for video . Daisy Schumer, of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, had to be taken to hospital with burns to her back after taking part in what has been dubbed 'the Fire Challenge' Daisy, left, said somebody 'poured the perfume on my stomach and then I told her to stop and then she lit the lighter and I was rolling on the ground trying to get it out and it burned my back' Daisy told KFVS 12 how she was injured however after taking part in the challenge. She said: 'This person poured the perfume on my stomach and then I told her to stop and then she lit the lighter and I was rolling on the ground trying to get it out and it burned my back.' Earlier this week it was reported that a Kentucky teenager was recovering from second-degree burns after copying the new trend. The 15-year-old, who declined to be identified for CBS Affiliate WKYT, poured rubbing alcohol over his chest and filmed himself last Friday. He told the news organisation: 'I just poured alcohol on it, and lit it, and it just automatically went and burst.' Firefighters arrived at the home of the boy's aunt and took him to hospital for treatment for severe burns on his chest and abdomen. Earlier this week it was reported that a Kentucky teenager was reocvering from second-degree burns after copying the new trend . The 'Fire Challenge' has seen many upload videos of themselves setting fire to their arms, legs, chest and even genitals . The lucky teenager said that he had no idea of the likely effects because in the videos he had seen, the person who did the 'fire challenge' never kept the camera running long enough afterwards. Firefighters in Lexington said they hope others listen and don't try to copy the teenager. 'What they don't show at the end of the videos is the consequences of doing this, getting second and third degree burns,' Lexington Fire Department Captain Chris Harrod said to WKYT. The 'Fire Challenge' is the latest internet phenomenon in the same vein as the the gallon milk and cinnamon challenge. Some undertake the challenge in a shower so that they can douse themselves with water immediately afterwards . However, while those are relatively safe, this is far more serious. Videos online reveal a number of young men either using an aerosol canister or alcohol as an accelerant and then lighting their chest, legs, arms or even genital areas. Most scream and shout as the flames ignite and thrash wildly to put the fire out while friends who are filming laugh out loud. Others undertake the challenge in a shower, with close access to water should they need it.","Daisy Schumer taken to hospital with burns to her back following stunt .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Out of pie: Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick in Blackadder, has lost two stone on a juicing diet . He was famously unwashed  and prone to illness as Baldrick in TV’s Blackadder. Yet Sir Tony Robinson – who is also presenter of long-running archaeology show Time Team –  is a health freak in real life. The actor has been on a strict vegetable and fruit juice diet for three months and has managed  to shed 2st. ‘At the start I had juices for  every meal and that was it,’ he explains. ‘For the first three days  it felt very strange not to be chewing anything, but after a week I felt fantastic. ‘I realised I was getting more nutrients from the juices than I did from eating regular food.’ Sir Tony, 67, decided to go on the regime before signing up for a role in a ballet adaptation of The Wind In The Willows in London’s West End. He’s the narrator and, although not dancing, he is on stage in every single scene. ‘Physically, it’s very draining as I’m  on stage for two hours at a time,’ he says. ‘However, on this juice plan I’ve got more energy than ever. 'I’ve started to cut back to juicing for breakfast and lunch, and eating some fish with steamed vegetables in the evening, and I think I’ll continue like this for a while. ‘I just feel fantastic as I can do the shows, run around with my grandchildren and I’ve lost 2st. ‘I don’t know why I never did it in the past!’ It seems that Baldrick’s ‘cunning plan’ is actually working out well for once. Taking a Vitamin D supplement can ease chronic pain and fatigue in fibromyalgia sufferers if they have low levels, according to a new study. Those taking the supplement showed improved physical functioning in a trial of 30 female patients at the Orthopaedic Hospital in Vienna. The improvement was still marked 24 weeks after the supplementation had ended. Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body, including difficulty sleeping, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome and muscle stiffness. ‘Vitamin D may be regarded as relatively safe and economical,’ says lead investigator Florian Wepner. lashing out: Gail Porter pictured being hit by birch twigs in a bid to lose weight . Her . nude form was once projected on to Big Ben. Now Gail Porter has been . having her naked body beaten with twigs to lose weight. The . TV presenter, right, has been receiving 20-minute lashings with the . birch sticks, called venik, at a Slimmeria retreat in East Sussex. ‘It’s . quite forceful and strangely exciting,’ says Gail, 42. ‘When she first . hit me I thought, “Give us a break,’’ but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I’ve . lost weight already and have another stone and a half to lose.’ A Slimmeria spokesman says:  ‘It facilitates the removal of toxins.’ Old-school ninja: Game Fruit Ninja has been found to help stroke victims . Fruit Ninja, the smartphone app that involves ‘slicing’ flying melons with the  swipe of a finger, may help stroke patients recover, according to an Australian study of 18 healthy participants aged 49 to 72 and five patients who had recently suffered a stroke. After being asked to play Fruit Ninja for an hour a  day, five days a week over a period of three weeks, the stroke patients showed significant improvement in upper limb function. Good neighbours are beneficial to your health. People who live in a close-knit community have a lower risk of suffering from strokes, according to a University of Michigan study of 6,740 people. Researchers say it could be because social interaction and trust is important to reducing the risk of stroke. Those in a friendly neighbourhood were 15 per cent less likely to suffer a stroke. And people in the closest communities were 48 per cent less likely to have a stroke, according to the study published  in Social Science and Medicine. A stroke is caused by a disruption in blood flow to the brain. More than 150,000 Britons a year suffer strokes, and it is the third leading cause of death.","Actor Sir Tony Robinson has been on a strict juice diet for three months .

"By . Rachel Reilly . British scientists are tracking an iceberg eight times the size of Manhattan in a groundbreaking bid to prevent a disaster. Experts are monitoring the massive iceberg - which broke off a glacier in Antarctica - following fears it could drift into world shipping lanes. The giant iceberg measures roughly 270 square miles (700 square km). British scientists are tracking an iceberg (pictured) the size of Manhattan in a bid to prevent a disaster in ocean shipping lanes. The giant iceberg measures roughly 270 square miles (700 square km) The huge chunk of ice could survive for a year or more and the researchers hope to stop it becoming a hazard by predicting the path it will take. Icebreaks around this size split from glaciers on average every two years worldwide, but this is the first tracking attempt of its kind. Using satellite technology, it’s being funded by a 50,000 pound urgency grant from The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Expert Dr Robert Marsh, from Ocean and Earth Science at the University of Southampton, Hamphire, is investigating as part of the project. The iceberg (ringed in red) could survive for a year or more and the researchers hope to stop it becoming a hazard by predicting the path it will take . The Pine Island Glacier is shown separating from the Antarctica continent in this  image taken by Nasa's Aqua satellite on November 10 . He says the iceberg could cross into a ship’s path in the Southern Ocean. Dr Marsh said: 'The primary reason to monitor the iceberg is that it’s very large. An iceberg is a large chunk of frozen of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water. The word 'iceberg' has its roots in the Dutch word 'ijsberg' which means 'ice mountain'. Because of the density of pure ice is lower than that of sea water, typically only one-ninth of the volume of an iceberg floats above water. In addition to this, the shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface. When a piece of iceberg ice melts, it makes a fizzing sound called 'Bergie Seltzer'. This sound is made when the water reaches ice that contains trapped compressed air bubbles. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a 'popping' sound. The bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice, that eventually got buried to a given depth (up to several km) and pressurised as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice.[ . 'An iceberg of this size could survive for a year or longer and it could drift a long way north in that time and end up in the vicinity of world shipping lanes in the Southern Ocean. 'There’s a lot of activity to and from the Antarctic Peninsula, and ships could potentially cross paths with this large iceberg, although it would be an unusual coincidence.' The team will use their results to more accurately model the paths of future large icebergs. These are likely to become more common as global warming encourages glacier calving - where ice breaks off of the end of a glacier. Investigators from Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, are tracking the iceberg using earth observation satellites TerraSAR-X from the German Space Agency (DLR). Principal investigator Professor Grant Bigg says large amounts of freshwater from the melting iceberg could affect ocean currents. Prof Bigg, of the University of Sheffield, said: 'If the iceberg stays around the Antarctic coast, it will melt slowly and eventually add a lot of freshwater that stays in that coastal current, altering the density and affecting the speed of the current. An iceberg twice the size of Manhattan (ringed) tore away from one of Greenland's largest glaciers in July last year. Nasa satellites revealed when broke away completely, freeing an iceberg measuring 46 square miles . 'Similarly, if it moves north it will melt faster but it could alter the overturning rates of the current as it may create a cap of freshwater above the denser seawater. 'This glacier is not large enough to have a big impact, but it could have an effect. 'Particularly if these events become more common, there will be a build-up of freshwater which could have lasting effects.'","The giant iceberg measures roughly 270 square miles (700 square km)

"By . Becky Barrow . One in three families in Britain would survive for less than a week if they lost their job, a damning study reveals today. Around 8.8million households in this country ‘only have £250 or less’ set aside as a financial safety net, which would protect the average family for just five days, according to the report. In a further blow, the number of struggling families has reached a record high as bills rise relentlessly, but their pay has barely changed for five years. A damning new study by banking giant HSBC has revealed one in three families wouldn't last a week on their savings. It found 8.8million of the country's 26million households have £250 or less set aside as a financial safety net (stock image) The report, from the banking giant . HSBC, found 34 per cent of families have £250 or less of ‘accessible’ savings, such as money in their current account, tax-free Isas and . savings accounts. This is the highest figure recorded by HSBC, which has conducted the same piece of research every year for the last four years. In . 2010, the figure was 30 per cent, falling to 28 per cent in 2011, . rising again to 31 per cent last year and reaching an all-time high of . 34 per cent this year. Over . the last year alone, it estimates around 800,000 families have been . caught in the trap of having either no safety net or one that would last . for just a few days if disaster struck. To make matters worse, the most common answer given by these families is that they have no savings at all. Of . the 34 per cent who have £250 or less, the report says this comprises . of 25 per cent with ‘no savings’ while a further 9 per cent have some . cash set aside. The average family needs just under £50 a day to survive, according to the report. The study shows the number of families struggling has reached a record high as the cost of living continues to rise (stock image) This . is money needed to cover all their typical outgoings from food to . electricity, council tax to water, transport costs to gas. For many families, it is not just losing their job which would cause a problem. Others . might be tipped over the edge by losing a shift or over-time pay, . becoming too ill to continue to work full-time or having an unexpected . bill to pay. On average, . HSBC said the average person has a savings pot of £14,400, which would . last for just over nine months based on an average monthly expenditure . of £1,500. However, there . is a significant gender divide, with 29 per cent of women having no . ‘accessible’ savings compared to only 19 per cent of men. It . comes as official figures showed inflation dropped sharply last month, but prices are still rising three times faster than the average . worker’s pay. The figures, . from the Office for National Statistics, show the consumer prices index . measure of inflation fell from 2.7 per cent in September to 2.2 per cent . in October. The Prime . Minister hailed the ‘significant drop’, which brings down inflation to . the lowest annual rate since last September, and said it is ‘encouraging . news for hard-working people’. But . the fall in inflation comes amid a backdrop of crippling increases in . energy bills, paltry pay rises of just 0.7 per cent and rising food . bills up by 4.3 per cent over the last 12 months. To . add to the pressure on families, inflation has been above the . Government’s target of two per cent for four years during a time when . pay rises have been below inflation throughout. The HSBC report was based on survey of 2,035 people in the UK aged 18 and over.","The HSBC study revealed 8.8million households have £250 or less in savings .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Lost boy: Nikolay Gorashenko, 13, had just started school in the UK when he was lost by BA staff . British Airways has been accused of abandoning a 13-year-old passenger, leaving him to wander around an airport alone and without his passport. Nikolay Gorashenko, a Russian boy who goes to school in Hertfordshire, said goodbye to his parents in Moscow and caught a flight to London. However, when he landed at Heathrow his guardian, actor Richard Cordery was shocked to find that the youngster had been allowed to walk off the plane by himself, and to roam the airport on his own. Despite Nikolay being booked on to a . £60-a-time Skyflyer Solo chaperone service, his minders at Heathrow did not realise he . had gone missing. Alone in the airport, the lost boy sent confused text messages from . the terminal, seeking help. One message said 'I'm underground and I don't know where to go', with another saying 'I'm lost and I don't have my passport'. Mr Cordery, 63, rushed to raise the . alarm when he realised Nikolay was on his own, but staff unsympathetic . brushed him off as a 'teenage tearaway', and said there were so many . children on the plane they had no way of keeping track of them. After 45 minutes, a member of airport staff found Nikolay and brought him through passport control, but Mr Cordery said he was 'terrified' while waiting for him to return, and that the boy 'could have been molested' or abducted by anybody in the airport. It was the boy's first time flying by himself. British Airways had made an announcement during the flight that all children flying alone should stay on board and wait to be met. Safe: Nikolay at Heathrow after he had made it through passport control . Nervous: Mr and Mrs Goranshenko, pictured with Nikolay, were nervous about using the accompanied flight service to send their son from Russia to the UK . However, Nikolay followed a group of . more confident young travellers off the plane, and when they later . disappeared he was left with nowhere to go. Mr Cordery, who turned to the . MailOnline after his complaint to BA hit a dead end, said: 'Nikolay goes . to school in England but lives abroad. 'He . had started at boarding school this term, and had flown back over the . half term to see his parents, who were nervous about him flying alone.' 'I went to the airport on Sunday night and waited until I saw his flight had arrived, and texted him to ask how he was. 'I . received a reply which said he would be out in around 20 minutes, but . after some time he sent another message asking me which terminal I was . at.' Relief: Nikolay makes his way back to school after his ordeal . 'When I realised he was on his own, I told him to find somebody in uniform to look after him' 'I . then headed to to the office that deals with the accompanied flights - a . tawdry, miserable affair - and told them ""There's been a terrible . mistake, little Nikolay has got off the plane and there's nobody with . him.""' 'Then a woman, who I . was not talking to at the time, said ""Teenage tearaways, what can you do . about that?"", which I thought was a disgraceful response. 'She asked how old he was and I said he was 13, to which she said ""There you are - a teenage tearaway.""' Shocked: Actor Richard Cordery, who is Nikolay's guardian, said he was terrified that something would happen to the boy, and that BA should provide a full refund . Mr . Cordery said the staff were unable to find out who had sent whom to . collect Nikolay, and they were unaware the teenager had gone missing, . until they were told. After seeing him safely to school, Mr . Cordery complained to British Airways, but was passed between call . handlers and kept on hold for almost an hour. Mr . Cordery said: 'I told them there had been a terrible breach of security . - anybody could have just grabbed him. I was terrified, he could have . been molested by somebody. 'I said that they weren't taking this seriously, but I was told that they had ""followed the procedures"". 'His parents had paid $100 a shot for this service - and how would they feel if something happened? 'The service guarantees that they accompany the child - at no stage are they ever allowed to be on their own. 'I want British Airways to acknowledge what they did and change their procedures so that it doesn't happen to anybody else. 'I also think they should provide a full refund, and something for Nikolay to make it up to him. But after they heard my complaint British Airways said they had ""done all that we can""' Nikolay, the eldest of two children, attends Haileybury School in Hertford, where he was sent for the first time this year by his parents, Sergei and Maria Gorashenko. Mr Cordery knows Nikolay and his family because his son tutors children abroad. Foreign children who study in the UK require a family member or friend to be responsible for them while they study, a role which he agreed to fulfill for Nikolay. Mr Cordery is also a well-known actor, who has recently appeared in About Time as Uncle Desmond, Les Misérables as the Duc De Raguse, and also featured in the 100th episode of Midsomer Murders. A BA spokesman said staff were looking into the claims made by Mr Cordery. 'We treat matters of this nature extremely seriously, and we are currently investigating the claim.'","Nikolay Gorashenko allowed to leave the plane on his own at Heathrow .

"By . William Turvill . These pictures show the dramatic scene after a car smashed into a ground floor flat. The driver of the silver Volkswagen Polo was arrested for drink driving following the crash, which led to an evacuation from the block of flats. The incident took place at 10pm last night, with residents having to wait until the early hours of the morning to find out whether they could return to their homes. The driver of this Volkswagen Polo was arrested for drink driving last night after his car smashed into a flat . The man who lived on the ground floor flat, which the car crashed in to, escaped uninjured despite the fact a section of his ceiling caved in. The driver, who was arrested at the scene, in Russells Hall, Dudley, West Midlands, had to be cut from his car by fire crews. While every other resident in the building was able to return home - after a three and a half hour wait - the ground floor flat tenant had to stay with friends away from the scene. According to one resident, occupants have been told the damage may not be fixed until at the earliest. According to a resident, fire crews took two hours to cut the motorist out of his car at the scene . Resident Jake Stone, 29, a teacher, was in bed when the crash ‘shook’ the entire building. ‘The person who lives in the flat was in the room at the time - he got covered in dust from all the bricks but luckily he was on the other side of the room when the car collided with the wall,’ he said. ‘He managed to get himself out of the flat and even tried to help the driver of the car. ‘It must have been horrendous for him.’ Mr Stone said that he and fellow residents were evacuated and had to wait to find out whether they would be allowed back into their homes. He added: ‘The fire crew and police arrived and got all the residents out - it took about two hours to remove the car. ‘There was quite substantial damage caused to the block - we weren't allowed back in until around 1 am. ‘While we were waiting for the all-clear some of us were wondering whether or not we'd have to find somewhere else to stay. ‘I know the man in the flat the car hit has gone to stay with friends - the structural engineer from the council said the damage may not be fixed until Christmas at the earliest.’ Residents had to wait three and a half hours to be allowed back into their homes on the Dudley estate . Commander Andy Clay, from Dudley fire station, said: ‘One man was in the flat at the time and managed to get out, but fire crews had to rescue the person that was driving the car.’ ‘The resident was shocked. ‘He said something fell from the ceiling and then all of a sudden a car was in the room.’ All six residents were allowed to return to their homes today after it was deemed safe following the smash at 10pm on Saturday night.","Crash, which 'shook' block of flats, saw building evacuated at 10pm .

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Martin Robinson . and Amanda Williams . Charles Clarke told yesterday how he was confronted over a rumour that he was having an affair with his ‘blonde, attractive’ special adviser. The former Labour home secretary told the hacking trial that Westminster gossip surrounding his relationship with Hannah Pawlby was ‘completely untrue’ and that he had threatened to sue a newspaper if it published the claim. News of the World journalists began a  surveillance operation after learning of the rumour and the tabloid’s investigator Glenn Mulcaire eavesdropped on the Home Office special adviser’s phone messages, the hacking trial heard. Scroll down to listen to audio . Evidence: Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke arrives at the Old Bailey, where he denied having an affair with his former aide Hannah Pawlby, also pictured today, who was herself a hacking victim . Mr Clarke, 63, and Miss Pawlby, 34, both denied any suggestion they were involved in a sexual relationship and no newspaper printed the claim. But the prosecution allege the rumour set a hacking operation into action at the News of the World. Features editor Jules Stenson sent editor Andy Coulson an email in May 2005 which said: ‘Lewis [Panther – a journalist] has had a tip that Home Secretary Charles Clarke is having an affair with his blonde, attractive special adviser Hannah Pawlby.. ‘He got this from a Westminster insider who fancied Pawlby, was going to ask her out and was told “Don’t bother wasting your time, she’s with Charles”.’ The newspaper’s chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck watched Miss Pawlby’s house for any sign of the Home Secretary while  Mulcaire recorded messages from her mobile phone, the court heard. He was alleged to have gathered information about her parents, her grandparents and friends of the family, including one whose  husband was the head of the intelligence agency MI6. In the dock: Former News of the World newspaper editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson . Mr Clarke – who described the House of Commons as ‘a gossip mill’ – told the Old Bailey he was unaware of the rumours until he was confronted by journalist Trevor Kavanagh, who was then political editor at The Sun. He said: ‘Trevor Kavanagh said he had  evidence of such an affair and said he would try to get it sympathetically covered in The Sun if I confessed and gave him the story. I said that there was absolutely no basis for him to have any such evidence as such a relationship did not exist. ‘As there was no substance to it at all, I wasn’t prepared to discuss it with him and I said that we should just end the conversation, which we did.’ Miss Pawlby was also approached by another journalist from The Sun about the rumour and Mr Clarke said he decided to call the newspaper’s editor Rebekah Brooks ‘to make it clear that such a story was completely untrue’. She was away at the time and Mr Clarke said he spoke to her deputy and threatened to sue for libel if the story was published. Family: Ms Brooks was accompanied to the Old Bailey in central London by her mother Deborah Wade . Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC asked Mr . Clarke, the Labour MP for Norwich South for 13 years until 2010: ‘Was . there any truth in that rumour?’ He . replied: ‘Absolutely not. I have never had a relationship of that kind . with Hannah. I wouldn’t dream of doing so and the suggestion is . completely untrue.’ Hacker: Glenn Mulcaire, pictured at an earlier hearing, has already admitted he intercepted voicemails illegally . The story was never published. There was no suggestion that  Mr Kavanagh was involved in hacking or that The Sun had learned of the affair rumour through hacking. Under cross-examination from Alison Pople, for Coulson, Mr Clarke agreed he had met the News of the World editor but said Coulson had never mentioned the rumour to him. The jury was played a series of recordings of voice messages from Miss Pawlby’s mobile phone, including two from Coulson in June 2005. In the messages the News of the World editor said he needed to speak to the then home secretary about a ‘serious story’ the newspaper was intending to publish. Miss Pawlby said she never heard the messages because they  were stored on her phone as ‘saved’ as a result of being hacked. She was Mr Clarke’s diary secretary when he was education secretary and became  his special adviser when he moved to the Home Office in 2004, a promotion she said was ‘unusual’. She told the court she had been aware of a rumour about a relationship circulating from 2004 until 2006, but added that there was no truth in it. The court also heard Mulcaire had hacked Lord Archer’s acquaintances following his 2001 conviction for perjury. Mulcaire and Thurlbeck have both  admitted being involved in phone hacking. Coulson and Brooks, both 45, deny  conspiracy to hack phones. The trial continues. Victim: Kerry Katona was repeatedly hacked by Mulcaire from 2005, pictured, including on Christmas Day . Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona was persistently hacked by Glenn Mulcaire, including on Christmas Day 2005, the Old Bailey heard. Days later, on New Year's Day 2006, a story appeared in the News of the World about problems the 33-year-old was allegedly having with ex-husband Brian McFadden's mother. Her details, including her address in Warrington, Cheshire, phone and voicemail numbers, PIN code and password, were in one of Mulcaire's notes dated November 29, 2005. News editor Ian Edmondson made three calls to Mulcaire that day and another four the following day, phone records show. Ms Katona's phone was then hacked by Mulcaire four times on November 30 in the space of three hours. The singer, who had already been exposed in June that year as a cocaine user, was on the front page of the December 4 edition of the News of the World under the headline: 'Kerry in new coke shocker'. Mulcaire hacked her phone again in December, and made more notes on her boyfriend Dave Cunningham, pal Neil Clucas, and ex-husband and Westlife singer Brian McFadden. More hacks followed in January 2006, and a new note was made by Mulcaire including details on her 'new man' Mark Croft, his Warrington address, and his place of work ABBA Cars. The court heard Edmondson texted Mulcaire on March 2 before Ms Katona's phone was hacked three times by Mulcaire. An email sent by Mulcaire to Edmondson on June 1, 2006, with the subject 'katona' included five mobile numbers, one landline number, and the phrase 'fav no's'. The jury have been sent home until Monday, when the trial continues.

"By . Lucy Osborne . The husband of a GP who has gone missing while suffering the symptoms of post-natal depression has begged his ‘amazing’ wife to get in touch. Dr Elizabeth Kinston, 37, who was suffering from ‘worry’ and ‘anxiety’ after the birth of her daughter, Elsie, has been missing for a week. Her husband David, 36, has made an emotional plea for the mother-of-two – known as Lizzie – to let him know she is safe. Scroll down for video . Disappeared: Dr Elizabeth Kinston walked past the Vat and Fiddle pub, in Queensbridge Road, Nottingham, at 11.43am on Friday. She has not been seen since . Detective Inspector Kev Broadhead, of Nottinghamshire police, said: 'Elizabeth has never left her family like this before' Speaking yesterday from their home in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, Mr Kinston said his wife had shown ‘no warning signs’ before she disappeared. GP and mother-of-two Elizabeth Kinston, 37, has been missing from her home in Beeston since Friday and her husband David, 36, has begged her to come home . But he added that she had been worried and anxious after the birth of their second child. ‘She’s not been diagnosed with post-natal depression as yet, that’s just what the symptoms show.’ The civil engineer said: ‘Lizzie, I miss you, the girls miss you. It’s so hard without you here. We need you. If you want more time, that’s okay. But please call me – or call your mum and dad or your sister, who are all so worried about you too – just so we know you are all right.’ He described her as ‘such a caring person, an amazing mum and wife’, adding: ‘She’s everything to me.’ Dr Kinston’s sister, Charlotte Naaman, said: ‘There’s a pattern leading up to it. Just worry, anxiety, but we never thought things were this bad that Liz would just take off.’ She said the couple’s daughters – Elsie, ten months, and Sophia, three – were with their grandparents. ‘They don’t know anything about this.’ CCTV pictures show Dr  Kinston walking past the Vat And Fiddle pub in Nottingham city centre at 11.45am on Friday – an hour after leaving home. She was spotted in her Audi soon after at a petrol station and later at a car park in  Nottingham. Her car was found there the following day, with her purse and phone inside. Dr Kinston was on maternity leave from her job as a GP after the birth of Elsie in January. She was recently treated for anxiety and had a doctor’s appointment, which she failed to keep, last Friday. Co-founder of Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support, Rachel Dobson, last night said the organisation was being contacted by ‘more and more healthcare professionals’. One theory is that Dr Kinston boarded a train, but this footage raises the possibility she walked past the station . Dr Kinston's husband made an emotional appeal for his wife to let him know she is safe . ‘Unfortunately they feel there is still a lot of stigma within the NHS, in that they are not able to ask for help and because there is not that help available,’ she said. Detective Inspector Kev Broadhead, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘We are aware that Elizabeth has been  battling post-natal depression. ‘That fact, along with our belief that she has little money, no bank cards and no phone with her is of great concern. The cold weather is an added worry.’ Dr Kinston is described as white, 5ft 7in tall and of medium build. She has blonde, shoulder-length hair, which was tied back in a ponytail. The day she went missing, she was wearing a dark green quilted coat with a fur hood, a light pink pullover, blue jeans and dark brown knee-high riding-style boots. Detectives hope the distinctive jumper could be the key to finding her. It has the outline of a chicken pecking at a cup on the back. Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. The distinctive pink hooded jumper worn by Dr Elizabeth Kinston. Police are hoping someone will remember seeing it on Friday . A smaller version of the chicken image is also repeated on the front left side of the jumper .

"By . Julian Robinson . Egypt is planning to build a new Suez canal alongside the existing 145-year-old waterway in a multi-billion pound bid to boost its economy. The 45-mile corridor will expand what is the fastest shipping route between Europe and Asia and is part of several 'mega projects' designed to breathe new life into the nation. Warplanes flew overhead in a ceremony broadcast on state television from the canal city of Ismailia as Egypt's president Abdel-Fatteh el-Sisi officially launched the military-led scheme, set to cost £2.4bn. Scroll down for video . Egypt is planning to dig a new waterway alongside the existing Suez Canal in a move they believe will pump billions of pounds in to the economy . Egypt is the gatekeeper of the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest water corridors and the strategic link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean . He said that digging of the new canal  will allow ships to travel in both directions for just under half of the canal's 101-mile length. And although the initial time frame for completion was five years, el-Sisi estimated  it could be finished in just 12 months. Egypt is the gatekeeper of the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest water corridors and the strategic link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. The current Suez Canal brings in around $5billion of revenues per year, a vital source of hard currency for Egypt which has suffered a slump in tourism and foreign investment since its 2011 uprising. The first canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas via the Nile River was dug in 1874 B.C. during the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Senausret III. It was abandoned and reopened several times over the subsequent 2,500 years. Pharonic inscriptions showed that Egyptians used the canals to move warships, send pilgrimages to the Holy Land and transport grain and stones used in ancient monuments. Napoleon sought to build a modern canal in order to undermine Britain's control of trading routes to Asia, but he abandoned the project after engineers wrongly determined that a difference in water levels would cause the Mediterranean to be inundated. Damaged ships are pictured in Egypt's Port Said, north of the historic waterway, during the Suez Crisis of 1956 . French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps and Egyptian viceroy Said Pasha developed the current Suez Canal in the mid-19th century. French and Egyptian private interests controlled the company entrusted with building and running the canal, though Britain later acquired Egypt's share. Completion of the 101 mile waterway took 10 years of intense and generally poorly-paid work by Egyptians who were drafted at the rate of 20,000 every 10 months from 'the peasantry.' The canal, which was opened for navigation on November 17, 1869, cut weeks if not months off journeys between Europe and Asia that otherwise necessitated a trip around Africa. Numerous heads of state visited Egypt for weeks of celebrations. In 1956, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the canal, leading to a failed invasion by Britain, which controlled the channel, as well as France and Israel. The waterway was closed briefly until 1957 and the again for eight years following the 1967 war with Israel. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced on Tuesday that Egypt would build a new channel as part of a larger project to expand port and shipping facilities around the canal in an effort to establish Egypt as a major trade hub. But sources in the Suez Canal Authority have reportedly said the new canal will boost annual revenues to $13.5billion by 2023. To attract more ships and generate more income, the country has had plans to develop 29,000 square miles around the canal for years. 'This giant project will be the creation of a new Suez Canal parallel to the current channel of a total length of 72 kilometres (44.74 miles),' Mohab Mamish, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, told a conference in Ismailia. A couple watch the vast U.S. aircraft carrier USS Bataan pass through the Suez Canal in 2007 on its way to Bahrain. The new 45-mile section will allow ships to pass for just under half of the 101-mile canal . A new Suez Canal running alongside the existing one could be completed within five years - though Egypt's president believes it could be finished in just 12 months . Mamish spoke at a conference in which President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to announce a winning consortium to develop the project, which includes building an international industrial and logistics hub in the Suez Canal area. He said the project would involve 21 miles of 'dry digging' and 22 miles would be 'expansion and deepening', indicating the current Suez Canal, which is 163 km (101 miles) long, could also be widened as part of the project.","The new 45-mile section would run alongside the existing Suez Canal .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said Lloyds staff involved in an astonishing scam to defraud taxpayers could be guilty of ‘criminal conduct’. Lloyds was yesterday discovered to have ripped off the Treasury at the height of the financial crisis by lying about its creditworthiness. This allowed the state-backed bank to gain access to tens of billions from a Government ‘lifeline’ scheme at favourable rates – but left taxpayers out of pocket. Scroll down for video . Anger: Details of a letter sent by Bank of England governor Mark Carney (pictured) to the Lloyds chairman revealed the governor's fury . Between April 2008 and September 2009, four traders cut £7.8million off the fees Lloyds paid to the Treasury by manipulating the ‘repo rate’ which set the level of the fee. Yesterday – as Lloyds was fined £218million and a senior MP said the public did not understand why rogue bankers had not been jailed – details of a letter sent by Mr Carney to the Lloyds chairman revealed the governor’s fury. He wrote: ‘Such manipulation is highly reprehensible, clearly unlawful and may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals involved.’ He added that ‘in view of the seriousness of this matter’, the Bank will consider pursuing further action against Lloyds and the individuals involved. Lloyds also faces a possible investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Lloyds chairman Lord Blackwell replied: ‘This was truly shocking conduct, undertaken when the bank was on a lifeline of public support.’ Last night Tory MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘The public doesn’t understand why bankers have not gone to prison. Ripped off the Treasury: Lloyds was fined £218million and a senior MP said the public did not understand why rogue bankers had not been jailed . ‘This is, on the face of it, a deliberate action to defraud the taxpayer by a bank that we bailed out.’ His Tory colleague Andrew Tyrie, chairman . of the committee, said: ‘The banks were manipulating Libor [the . inter-bank lending rate] and the repo rate, in the process deceiving the . Bank of England in its operation of a taxpayer-backed support scheme.’ He called it ‘appalling behaviour’. July 27, 2006 . July 28, 2006 . July 19, 2007 . August 17, 2007 . March 31, 2009 . The Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS) was set up as a lifeboat for Britain’s ailing banks in 2008. It allowed banks to swap unwanted, mortgage-backed securities for desirable UK Treasury Bills which could be used to swiftly raise cash. Participating banks were charged a fee by the Bank. This fee was intended to make the overall cost of SLS funding comparable with commercial borrowing. Crucially, the banks were allowed to set their own ‘repo rate’ which would determine the level of fees. During the period that Lloyds TSB and HBOS used the SLS, they paid £1.28billion in fees. High street giants Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have already received hefty fines for manipulating Libor, which is a key inter-bank lending rate used to set mortgages. But Lloyds is the first to be penalised for attempting to fix repo rates to reduce fees for the Special Liquidity Scheme. Lloyds was the biggest beneficiary from the SLS, receiving more than £90billion in emergency funds before the scheme was closed in 2012. Yesterday regulators said that by manipulating the rate, Lloyds also reduced fees paid by other banks, meaning taxpayers were left further out of pocket. Damning messages published by regulators showed how traders joked about rigging the interest rates. One message sent by a trader to his manager on July 19, 2007, joked: ‘Every little helps…It’s like Tescos.’ The Lloyds manager replied: ‘Absolutely, every little helps.’ Reflecting the seriousness of the scam, £70million of the £105million penalty imposed on Lloyds by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority was for rigging the repo rate. The remainder was for manipulating Libor. A further Libor-linked fine of £113million was imposed by regulators in the US, bringing Lloyds’ total fine to £218million. In total, 22 former and current Lloyds staff were involved in manipulating both rates. The bank said all of them have either left, been suspended or will now face disciplinary action.  Lloyds has also agreed to a demand from Mr Carney to pay back the £7.8million. The taxpayer still has a 25 per cent stake in the bank. Critics have complained that no bankers have been jailed for a string of scandals, although 12 people have been charged by the Serious Fraud Office over Libor-rigging so far. Lloyds’ bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance is set to hit £10billion on Thursday, when it is expected to set aside more money to compensate customers.","Mark Carney says Lloyds staff involved may be guilty of 'criminal conduct'

"By . Suzannah Hills . Response: Supt Kevin Purcell (pictured) apologised to motorists. But his colleague attacked 'vile' drivers on Twitter for encouraging the man to jump while they waited in a queue . A senior policeman has condemned ‘vile’ trolls who took to social networking sites to complain about a motorway being closed for 24 hours because of a man threatening to throw himself from a bridge. Police closed the M42 in both directions at Junction 1 near Bromsgrove in the West Midlands  at 12.45pm on Saturday. They finally talked the man  down at 3pm yesterday. Specialist negotiators could be seen talking to the man – who was standing at railings on the A38 road bridge over the motorway. Thousands of drivers were stuck in queues for several hours on Saturday as police closed the busy motorway in both directions between the M5 and Junction 2 of the M42. But despite diversions and appeals for motorists to avoid the area, roads remained clogged with traffic. Some . irate drivers vented their anger on Twitter and Facebook labelling the . man's actions as 'selfish' and encouraging him to jump. But many others expressed their concern for the man and their own disgust at some of the abusive messages being posted online. Yesterday before the man got . down, Assistant Chief Constable Gareth Morgan took to Twitter to . criticise those mocking the individual. ‘Unfortunately for travellers M42 is still closed,’ he tweeted. ‘The intolerant, hateful and “Don’t you know what you’re doing” brigade should be ashamed. Sealed off: Police at the bridge on Saturday night where a man had been threatening to jump on to the M42 . Tailbacks: Police closed the M42 between the M5 and junction 1 which caused huge traffic jams . 'No shortage of armchairs or experts to fill them giving advice and or being vile about people/things they know nothing about.’ Superintendent Kevin Purcell, policing . commander for North Worcestershire, had apologised to drivers for the . traffic tailbacks but insisted there was no alternative but to close the . motorway. He said: 'I . would like to apologise to all motorists and local people who have . experienced significant disruption as a result of this incident. Big incident: Specialist police negotiators were sent to talk the man while other officers cordoned off the road . 'Clearly we strive to resolve such matters as quickly as possible, but I would like to make it clear that the threat of harm both to the individual concerned and to vehicles driving on the M42 is so significant, that there was no alternative but to close the motorway and for it to remain closed until the incident has run its course. 'Once again I apologise for any . inconvenience caused and would thank members of the public and local . community for their patience and understanding. 'We are doing all we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible and are following national guidelines. Traffic chaos: The incident had already started to cause long tailbacks on the M42 on Saturday evening . 'Our number one priority is the protection of life.' Samaritans charity, who provide support for people battling emotional distress, urged those affected to contact them. A spokesman said: 'Anyone that is affected by the on-going incident on the M42 we're always open and we encourage people to get in touch.' For confidential support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details . Knock-on effect: Several roads around the M42 also had traffic tailbacks because of the closures .","Man has been on the bridge over the M42 since 12.45pm yesterday .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has launched a legal challenge against the former South African leader's will insisting she is entitled to the rural estate where he is buried. The 77-year-old who divorced the late anti-apartheid activist in 1996, is demanding ownership of Mr Mandela's ancestral home in Qunu in the Eastern Cape. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela claims that she bought the property in 1989, while her then husband was imprisoned in Robben Island, giving her ownership rights under traditional law. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who has launched a legal challenge against the former South African leader's will insisiting she is entitled to the rural estate where he is buried . Mr Mandela, pictured, left nothing to his ex-wife Winnie in his will, it was revealed earlier this year . It is thought that Mr Mandela left the home to his family trust and third wife Graca, who he married in 1998, although in the weeks after his death in December last year, there were reportedly attempts to try and block her from the property. It was later revealed that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was left nothing from her former husband's £2.4million estate, which was divided between his family, the ruling African National Congress party, former staff and several schools. His homes in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Mthatha were also left to the family trust with instruction on who could live in each property. Each of his six children and some of his 17 grandchildren received almost £180,000.

As Mr Mandela lay in hospital on life support a year ago, a rival family faction led by Mandla's aunt, Makaziwe, won a court order for the bodies to be re-exhumed and returned to Qunu. Two weeks after Mandela's death, South African newspapers reported that Makaziwe had changed the locks on the Qunu house to keep Mandla out and had written him a letter ordering him to remove his dogs from the property.

"By . Jack Doyle . Newspaper reports based on top-secret documents about British and US electronic surveillance could have helped terrorists evade monitoring and capture, a former foreign secretary said yesterday. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, warned stories about Britain’s electronic snooping capability – leaked by rogue CIA technician Edward Snowden - might have enabled terrorists to avoid detection. The former defence and foreign secretary also defended Downing Street’s efforts to have The Guardian newspaper - which published many of Mr Snowden’s revelations - destroy the classified documents held on computers in its offices. Controversy: The Guardian's  computer components, including the motherboard and solid-state hard drive destroyed in the interests of national security . Row: David Cameron asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to contact the Guardian about the classified material handed over by Edward Snowden, which led to the destruction of hard drives . Home Secretary Theresa May said the police were right to detain David Miranda (left), the partner of Glenn Greenwald (right), who was carrying secret intelligence files leaked by ex-CIA analyst Edward Snowden . It has been confirmed that Theresa May (pictured) knew that Mr Miranda would be detained . He said the documents were ‘top secret’ and the intelligence and security agencies rightly wanted them destroyed. Yesterday, Nick Clegg confirmed he backed the decision to go after the documents - but refused to endorse the detention of David Miranda, the partner of the Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald who wrote the stories based on Snowden’s stolen documents. Mr Miranda’s detention for nine hours at Heathrow sparked a major row this week with civil liberties groups and Lib Dem backbenchers accusing the police of abusing counter-terrorism powers. The 28-year-old was reportedly carrying some of the top secret documents when he was stopped while changing planes on route from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro where he lives with Mr Greenwald. Police also seized his hard drives and other electronic equipment. Home Secretary Theresa May has defended the detention, saying the police acted in the interests of national security. Mr Miranda (pictured left with Mr Greenwald at a Brazilian airport) was questioned for nine hours by police . A statement released by Mr Clegg’s office said: ‘We understand the concerns about recent events, particularly around issues of freedom of the press and civil liberties.’ It said the Lib Dem leader will ‘wait and see’ the findings of a review of the case to be carried out by a terror powers watchdog, David Anderson QC. Speaking on the Today programme, Sir Malcolm, a former defence and . foreign secretary directly challenged repeated claims by the BBC that . the documents held by the Guardian were destroyed to avoid . ‘embarrassment’ to Government . He said it was ‘not a question of embarrassment to the government’ - but ‘something potentially relevant to terrorism’. He . said: ‘There’s no question that the various press reports of some of . the Snowden leaks - what Snowden has given to various newspapers in the . United States and the United Kingdom - gave information about the way in . which the intelligence agencies are able to access emails or telephone . calls by people who they suspect are terrorists - procedures that are . much more sophisticated than perhaps terrorists understood. ‘And terrorists, some of whom are very smart people, will have picked up that information and will have responded accordingly, and potentially made it more difficult if they have access to that information.’ He said The Guardian’s editor Alan Rusbridger was not in a position to judge whether the release of ‘top secret information’ could have ‘significant relevance in the battle against terrorism’. Yesterday, the Mail revealed that senior Downing Street mandarin Jeremy Heywood contacted The Guardian seeking to destroy documents it held on its server from the Snowden cache. After two months of negotiations, hard disk drives were smashed in the basement of the Guardian’s building. Sir Malcolm added: ‘I think Mr Rusbridger and the article he wrote yesterday about the destruction of his hard disc is on relatively weak ground. ‘He clearly did not dispute that he had no legal right to possess the files or the documents that were being discussed. Former CIA and National Security Agency worker Edward Snowden has been given temporary asylum in Russia . ‘Clearly if he thought that what he was doing was perfectly lawful that he was perfectly entitled to have these documents he would have told the Cabinet Secretary to “get lost”. ‘As far as the security agencies were concerned, he said, ‘there was a top secret document, which the Guardian had in its possession. They wanted that back or they wanted it destroyed.’ On the destruction of the hard disks, Mrs May told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One: ‘If Government believes information that could be of help to terrorists is potentially being held insecurely, could fall into the wrong hands, I think it is right the Government should act. ‘I don’t find it strange that should be done at a senior level.’ Mr Snowden who worked for the CIA and the National Security Agency, has been granted temporary asylum by Russia after the US charged him with espionage. He stole a raft of top secret US government documents on the activities of the NSA before leaking them to the Guardian and US newspapers.","PM asked Sir Jeremy Heywood to warn paper against publishing material .

"By . Corey Charlton . Ukrainian media have published images they claim shows wreckage from the downed Malaysian aircraft is being used as part of a roadblock leading into the breakaway Donetsk region. The photographs, taken by Ukrainian journalists, purport to show part of the aircraft's fuselage being used to strengthen a roadblock near the village of Rassypnoye. Journalist Boris Mihalov, 32, said: 'We wanted to take more pictures and question those about how the wreckage was being used in this way but we were basically ambushed and carted away. This is the image showing wreckage from the crash, in which 298 people died, being used in a roadblock . 'They wanted to take the camera's memory card but we gave them an empty one and hid the one with the photograph where they didn't see it.' The pictures have now been handed over to Ukrainian authorities. MH17 was show down while flying through eastern Ukraine airspace on July 17, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board. Pro-Russian rebels have been blamed for shooting down the Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight and have also been accused of hampering investigators' access to the crash scene, which lies in rebel-controlled territory. Ukrainian media said they showed how little respect the rebels - who have sealed off part of Ukraine - have for the memory of the dead. It was not possible to independently verify the pictures in a country which has seen both sides using the media to justify their case. Journalists who took the photos claim rebels tried to make them destroy their cameras' memory cards . As fighting and violence increase in the region, claims and counter-claims about the brutality of the other side have become a constant presence in the local media and on social networks. The Ukrainian military only recently appeared to be readying a long-awaited major assault on the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, warning civilians to leave as troops tightened their ring around the city amid heavy fighting. Ukrainian troops have already taken the town of Yasynuvata, home to a key railway control centre between Donetsk and Luhansk.","Photographs purport to show wreckage from MH17 being used in roadblock .

"By . Allan Hall . A German spy caught selling American battle plans while working at a NATO base has been jailed for seven years for plunging western security into danger. Manfred Koenig - who hid most of his £5million loot in bank accounts in London and Luxembourg - was a civilian worker at the vast Ramstein Air Force Base in western Germany when he was caught in June last year with USB sticks and top secret plans of American land and air operations on his computer. He also had secret passwords for computer programmes intended for military top brass only. It is described as 'grade A’ material that the Russian FSB secret service paid him handsomely for. Spy game: Manfred Koenig worked at Ramstein Air Force Base when he was caught with top secret plans of American land and air operations on his computer . America had to rebuild its global military strategy plans ‘from scratch’ after routine security checks unearthed his spying, which had gone on for many years. Police and intelligence officers traced the bank accounts to London and Luxembourg where they were held under false names, and the money has been frozen. But the damage to NATO planning had, in the words of one official, ‘been immeasurable.’ ‘We are talking names, codes to top secret operational files, the planning of black ops, the targeting of enemy strongholds, tactical land missions everywhere - it is the whole shooting match, not just in Afghanistan but across the world,’ said one NATO official. Koenig, 61, was portrayed in court as an embittered man who grew disillusioned with his meagre pay and status and so began collating the material for his ‘pension.’ The stolen material was retrieved from his home in the village of Boerrstadt near Kaiserslautern after he left the employ of the Americans after a row. Similar plans: Whisteblower Edward Snowden, former technical assistant for the CIA, revealed details of top-secret surveillance conducted by the United States' National Security Agency . ‘The disclosure of the files would have allowed a potential enemy of NATO to gain access to the secret network of NATO,’ the court in Koblenz found. It rejected the man's claim that he had wanted to point out security gaps when he copied the data and hid it on USB memory sticks in his kitchen and basement last year. Koenig, an IT expert, had worked for NATO for more than 30 years. He copied the data in March 2012 and failed in an attempt to obtain more in June but left NATO shortly afterward. The data were the ‘crown jewels’ and ‘operative heart’ of the system and would have allowed a foreign power to launch a cyber-attack with ‘devastating impact’, said presiding judge Andreas Voelpel. The defendant had earlier denied the charge, saying: ‘I was never a traitor. I am not and never was an enemy of NATO, only of the security sloppiness of employees.’ The sentence for treasonable espionage was only slightly milder than the seven and a half years that prosecutors had sought.","Manfred Koenig was paid £5m by the Russian FSB secret service .

"By . Paul Harris . When a 200ft pentagram-shaped crop circle appeared in his prized wheat field, farmer Henry Arden was livid. And the arrival of hordes of sightseers when pictures of it spread rapidly online did little to calm his temper. But now Mr Arden’s views on the mystical design have turned full circle – he admits he has ‘grown to love it’. The five-point star appeared last week in his field near Tetbury, Gloucestershire. Within hours it was photographed and logged on internet crop-circle sites. The 200ft pentagram-shaped crop circle, which appeared in a wheat field in Tetbury, Gloucestershire last week . The reports went viral – and soon the design was drawing the crowds. A party of French nationals turned up by coach, offering to pay for a viewing. A Lyon-based TV crew filmed it for the Discovery Channel and a group of unannounced visitors got an earful from Mr Arden when he caught them on his land. But the pentagram, widely used in paganism, Wicca and other religions, seems to have had a calming effect on Mr Arden. He and his girlfriend Sarah Jennings – temporarily separated following a ‘falling out’ – repaired their relationship after spending time enjoying its tranquility at the weekend. The mystical design, which is widely used in paganism, Wicca and other religion had visitors flocking to Henry Arden's prized field . Mr Arden, who is also a professional photographer, said: ‘Sarah and I spent a wonderful, peaceful four hours there, chilling out. It happens to be on a part of the farm that is astonishingly beautiful. ‘I don’t believe in mystic powers and I certainly don’t want people to think these things are made by aliens, which obviously they’re not. But I have to say, it looks great.’ The first Mr Arden knew about the crop circle was when he saw a helicopter hovering nearby. ‘I went up there and found the circle,’ he said. ‘I didn’t really want hordes of people trampling over our finest milling wheat. I was so angry about it I was really rude to some people. However, I’ve grown to love it for various reasons.’ The new circle is a few miles from the Prince of Wales’s Highgrove estate. Prince Charles, a keen agriculturalist, took a public interest in the once-mysterious crop circle phenomenon before it was proven to be no more than a series of man-made hoaxes. Nevertheless, perpetrators have since striven annually to create the biggest, best or most intriguing circles. This one is believed to be the latest in a succession recorded recently in Gloucestershire, Hampshire and Wiltshire. Alas, Mr Arden’s circle of love may soon vanish through a more traditional use of English wheat fields. He is about to harvest the grain.","Henry Arden discovered 200ft crop circle in his prized wheat field last week .

The image, taken from the International Space Station earlier this year, shows North Korea as a swathe of dark ground between China in the north and South Korea . North Korea - which is ruled by supreme leader Kim Jong-un - is almost completely black appearing to show a distinct lack of power or energy supply.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Do you hate the thought of ever being parted from your beloved dog? You may never have to thanks to a UK competition organised in South Korea that will clone your dog for free. The winner of the contest will be flown to Seoul in South Korea to watch the process as part of a Channel 4 documentary to be aired next year. Imagine never having to say goodbye to your pet dog. That is what is in store for one lucky British dog owner as a team of top scientists from Seoul, South Korea, are offering a once in a lifetime opportunity to clone 'man's best friend' for free . Taking just one microscopic skin cell, the team from Sooam Biotech claim they can recreate an exact clone of a dog canine in just two months. Dr Woo Suk Hwang, the chief technical officer at Sooam Biotech, pioneered the technique in 2005. His group is currently the only company in the world that offers dog cloning commercially. He has now successfully cloned at least 400 dogs - thought to be one of the most difficult animals to clone. Taking just one microscopic skin cell, the team from Sooam Biotech claim they can recreate an exact clone of a dog canine in just two months . The process involves obtaining live cells from a living dog or a dog five days after it has died. Dogs that have similar ovulation time are selected as egg donors and surrogate mothers. Eggs . are collected from the egg donor through a procedure called ‘flushing’ and the nuclei of the eggs, which contain DNA of the egg donor, is . removed. Then donor cell is then injected into the enucleated egg and the two cells are ‘fused’ together. This fusion procedure produces a cloned embryo that is transferred into a surrogate dog. The whole process takes less than a day but comes with a hefty price tag, at around $100,000 or £63,000 to clone one dog. Sooam Biotech has cloned highly trained rescue and police dogs for the South Korean government, as well as a number of highly prized pets in the US. But the cloning of animals has been a source of controversy since the technique was pioneered in Scotland in 1996 with the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned. John Woestendiek, the author of 'Dog, Inc.', a book about the dog cloning industry, says that the practice is centred in South Korea because there are much lower ethical standards for the treatment of dogs than in Europe and the United States. 'You can rent [dogs] from farmers for the laboratory and, hopefully, everything goes OK, return them to the farmer, but everything's not going to go OK.' The author says that some of the dogs used in the cloning process as egg donors or surrogate mothers are later sent back to the farms where they are killed and eaten.

"By . Jason Groves, Chief Political Correspondent . David Cameron is facing a Tory rebellion of up to 20 MPs today as he tries to head off calls to hold a referendum on Europe next year. Maverick Tory Adam Afriyie last night indicated he would defy the Prime Minister and force a Commons vote as he tries to make the PM hold a referendum before the 2015 general election. Mr Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum by the end of 2017. Maverick: Adam Afriyie, left, has called on David Cameron to hold a referendum before the next election in 2015 . In a letter to MPs, Mr Afriyie said: ‘This is Conservative MPs’ last chance to try to secure a  referendum. If we don’t take this opportunity we risk sleepwalking to election defeat by driving voters to Ukip.’ Mr Afriyie has come under intense pressure from Downing Street and some Eurosceptics to drop his amendment to James Wharton’s private member’s bill, which aims to enshrine in law Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold an in/out referendum on Europe by the end of 2017. Senior Tories fear his intervention could reduce the chance of the legislation becoming law and fuel public perceptions that the Tories remain divided on Europe. His decision to push for a vote today means Tory MPs now face the prospect of being asked to vote against a potential referendum next year in order to keep the Prime Minister’s plans on track. A number of prominent Eurosceptics rounded on Mr Afriyie during a stormy meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Wednesday night, urging him to back down for the sake of party unity. Veteran Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash said Mr Alfriyie's challenge threatened to break the Tories' united front . His decision to push for a vote today means Tory MPs now face the prospect of being asked to vote against a potential referendum next year in order to keep the Prime Minister’s plans on track. One source said as many as 20 Tory MPs could vote with Mr Afriyie. Conservative Peter Bone: 'It's not a Tory split - we all want a referendum' ‘The trouble is there are people in marginal seats, with Ukip breathing down their necks, who don’t want to be seen voting against a referendum in any circumstances,' the source added. A poll last night showed one third of Tory members support Mr Afriyie’s plan. The survey by the grassroots website ConservativeHome found that 35 per cent of members want a referendum on Europe to be held in October next year. A further 22 per cent want the referendum held before the Prime Minister’s planned date of 2017. Just 35 per cent fully back Mr Cameron’s timetable. Tory MP Peter Bone last night said: ‘It’s not a Tory split – we all want a referendum, this would just bring it forward before the election.’ But veteran Eurosceptic Bill Cash warned the amendment could derail the Conservative Party’s concerted bid to finally hold a referendum on Europe. Mr Cash said: ‘It is a very difficult issue. Many people would like to see a referendum before the election - I am one of them. ‘But there are a number of practical difficulties and there is also the issue of party unity. We have been united from top to bottom on this - how will it look if we end up looking disunited again?’ The Liberal Democrats have refused to support Mr Cameron’s plans, forcing the Conservatives to use a private member’s bill to try to get his pledge into law. Labour opposes Mr Cameron’s plan to hold a referendum in 2017 but has so far abstained in votes on Mr Wharton’s bill. However, the legislation faces a difficult route to becoming law, as it could easily be blocked in the House of Lords.","Maverick Adam Alfriyie leading charge to hold in-out vote two years earlier .

Airport in Romulus, Michigan bound for Sky Harbor International Airport . in Phoenix, Arizona. As . soon as the plane lifted from the runway, it began to roll from . side-to-side and struck a lighting pole. This severed part of the left . wing and set jet fuel stored in the wing on fire. The aircraft then tipped violently to the right, causing the wing to tear through the roof of a car rental building. Completely . out of control, it crashed into cars on to a nearby highway and broke . apart before bursting into flames when it hit an overpass. The . National Transportation Safety Board determined the crash was likely . caused by  crew’s failure to check the slats and flats on the wings. These work to control speed and angle of take-off. A . lack of electrical power was also cited that failed to trigger the . warning system that the plane was not properly configured for take-off. Causes for an electrical failure were never found. The . National Transportation Safety Board concluded the plane's crew failed . to set the wing flaps properly for takeoff. The agency also said a . cockpit warning system did not alert the crew to the problem. It was believed that Cecelia survived the crash because her mother shielded her with her own body. Her mother, Paula, father Michael and brother, David, six were among those killed as the family returned from their vacation. They lived in Tempe, Ariz., at the time. The four-year-old suffered serious injuries including a . fractured skull, broken leg and collarbone and third-degree burns. She . underwent four skin grafts for the burns on her arms and legs. There was intense global interest in . the little girl, which saw her feature on magazine covers and receive . piles of gifts from strangers. More . than 2,000 presents and 30,000 cards were sent to the University of . Michigan Medical Center but her guardians asked that they be distributed . to local children's hospitals. The family also set up a trust fund . after she received more than $150,000 in donations. Her . uncle Franklin Lumpkin and her aunt Rita, her mother's sister, kept her . sheltered from the attention once she left hospital after seven weeks . of treatment, allowing her to grow up in obscurity in Birmingham, . Alabama. Crocker said the enormity of what had happened didn't really hit her for a while. 'When I realized I was the only . person to survive that plane crash, I was maybe in middle school, high . school, maybe, being an adolescent and confused,' said Crocker, who was . interviewed by the film's director, Ky Dickens, over 1.5 hours in . Queens, N.Y., in September 2011. 'So . it was just extra stress for me. I remember feeling angry and . survivor's guilt. ""Why didn't my brother survive? Why didn't anybody? Why me?""' As for returning to the air, Crocker 'feels fine flying and does so quite often,' Dickens said. 'Flying . doesn't scare me. I have this mentality where if something bad happened . to me once on a plane, it's not going to happen again,' Crocker says in . the film. 'The odds are just astronomical.' Disaster: The plane, bound for Phoenix, Arizona, crashed shortly after take-off at 8.46pm near Detroit killing everyone but one child on board . Devastating loss: Cecelia was just four when her father Michael, mother Paula and six-year-old brother David were killed in the air disaster . Cecelia said that she had finally . decided to open up about the crash because the film was a group project . 'and that’s why I’m willing to get involved and be part of something . bigger'. The man who pulled her from wreckage more than 20 years ago, firefighter John Thiede, recalls hearing her distant cry in the wreckage. 'I heard that faint cry a baby doll . makes,' he said. 'I looked to my right and I could see an arm, kind of . bent, coming out of a chair.' It . was initially believed that the four-year-old was one of those injured . on the ground until her grandfather came forward to identify the little . girl by her chipped front tooth. Dr . Jai Prasad, the doctor who led the team which cared for the . four-year-old, said at the time: 'She understands she has lost her . father and her mother, and her brother. 'She understands that she was involved in an accident. 'But she doesn't have any memory of how it happened.' Moving forward: The French schoolgirl Bahia Bakari, dubbed the 'miracle girl' survived the Yemenia Flight in 2009 that killed all the other 152 passengers on board . Miracle: Bahia Bakari, 12 in July  2009, miraculously survived the Yemenia airliner crash off the Comoros islands, being ejected from the plane into pitch-black Indian Ocean waters . Aftermath: Search parties scour the Indian Ocean off the coast of Comoros in search of the still missing Yemenia Airbus A310 in Moroni on July 6, 2009 . Cecelia has kept in touch with the families of those who died in the 1987 crash - including her rescuer Lieutenant Thiede. He met her for the first time on her wedding day when he watched her walk down the aisle to become Cecelia Crocker. The firefighter spoke out as part of the documentary. 'To see her come down the aisle, my heart, I lost it really. Just to see her in person was something,' he said. Sole Survivor is expected to have its . theatrical premiere and widespread release later this year. The movie focuses on Crocker - known . as Cecelia Cichan at the time of the crash - as well as three other . 'sole survivors' of plane crashes: George Lamson Jr., a then . 17-year-old from Plymouth, Minn., who was aboard a Galaxy Airlines . flight that crashed in Reno, Nev., in 1985; Bahia Bakari, a 12-year-old . girl who lived through a Yemenia Airways flight that crashed near the . Comoros Islands in 2009; and Jim Polehinke, the co-pilot of a 2006 . Comair flight that crashed in Lexington, Ky.

"By . Ruth Styles . She's never been one to shy away from making a bold sartorial statement and the welcoming ceremony on Horseguard's Parade for the president of South Korea was no exception for Theresa May. The Home Secretary, 57, looked cheerful in her brightly patterned coat as she strolled towards the ceremony with a thoroughly upstaged David Cameron and William Hague. The coat, which made its first appearance during a House of Commons speech in 2011, was teamed with a pair of stylish patent over-the-knee boots, black leather gloves, a black clutch bag and a patriotic red poppy pin. Fashion fan: Mrs May arrives at Horseguard's Parade alongside David Cameron and William Hague . Recycled: Mrs May's coat made its first appearance during a speech at the House of Commons in 2011 . But there was one person at Horseguard's Parade that Mrs May couldn't completely overshadow - the Queen, who was resplendent in an elegant pink wool and silk dress and coat by Karl Ludwig and a matching hat by Angela Kelly. By contrast, Park Geun-Hye, the first female president of South Korea, plumped for an elegantly minimal ensemble comprised of a navy coat and grey trousers accessorised with a diamond brooch. Mrs May is famous for her penchant for fashion and love of colour, although not every look has proved entirely successful. Most recently, she made headlines when she appeared at the Conservative Party conference in a daring tartan suit by Vivienne Westwood which she teamed with a pair of £215 Russell and Bromley flats. She is also well-known for her love of leopard print and famously wore a pair of print kitten heels to the 2002 conference.

So well-known has Mrs May's style become, she's even inspired her own tongue-in-cheek blog entitled Fashion Moments With Theresa May. And Theresa May isn't the only Conservative MP to mix style and a high-flying political career. During her tenure as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher was famous for her distinctive style which usually included a pussy-bow blouse, her trademark pearl necklace and a ladylike bag. Other female politicians known for their grasp of fashion include former French Justice Minister Rachida Dati, Laura Chinchilla, the first female president of Costa Rica, and Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt.

Patent leather might have spent the past few seasons in the fashion wilderness but this season, it's back with a vengeance as Mrs May knows all too well. She teamed her colourful coat with a knee-length pair of patent boots, taking an easy route into a trend that isn't always the easiest to wear. But while patent boots offer an easy way to pack a particularly fashionable punch, there are plenty of alternatives around for those who prefer shoes without the shine. The patent leather pencil skirt has proven particularly popular among fashion mavens, with Rihanna, Leigh Lezark and fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson among those adopting it. Spotted on the catwalk at Versace, Altuzarra and Salvatore Ferragamo among others, patent isn't for the faint-hearted but looks set to stick around well into next Spring.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A moving love letter found placed on top of the mummified body of a man has revealed the grief of his pregnant wife 445 years ago. The male mummy was unearthed in Andong City, South Korea, along with 13 letters addressed to a man called Eung-tae, who is presumed to be in the tomb. One of the letters is particularly touching as it is written by the dead man’s grief-stricken wife, who was pregnant with his child. Scroll down to read a translated version of the letter . A moving love letter (pictured) found placed on top of the mummified body of a man, has revealed the grief of his pregnant wife, 445 years ago . The letter, which was discovered and translated in 2000, reveals the woman’s sense of loss and sorrow. The letter is addressed to ‘Won’s father’ Eung-tae, whose mummy measures 5 feet and 9 inches and was found with a bundle of 12 others in the tomb. The letter was found on the mummy’s chest, where his partner must have placed it and asked him to ‘look closely at this letter and come to me in my dreams and show yourself in detail’. She also asks Eung-tae why he left her and their baby and confesses that she is not sure how she will be able to live without him. She wrote: ‘I just cannot live without you. I just want to go to you. Please take me to where you are. My feelings toward you I cannot forget in this world and my sorrow knows no limit.’ Scientists have said the letter dates to 1568, and although its author is anonymous, a little more is known about her partner. The full transcript of the heartbreaking poem written in 1586 . The said Eung-tae is thought to have been a member of Korea's ancient Goseong Yi clan. He was taller than most Korean men at the time and the mummy’s skin and beard are well preserved, which indicate he was quite dashing in his day. Se-kwon Yim, former director of the Andong National University Museum told the Archaeology journal and one of the first people to see the mummy, said: ‘The dark moustache made me feel that he must have had a charming appearance.’ A pair of slippers woven from the . woman’s hair and wrapped in a delicate paper parcel were also found next . to the mummy’s head in the tomb. His partner also wrote on the package, saying: ‘with my hair I weave this […] before you were even able to wear it’. The letter was found on the mummy's chest, where his wife must have placed it and asked her partner to 'look closely at this letter and come to me in my dreams and show yourself in detail'. Here, archaeologists in Andong City in 2,000, unwrap cloth covering the 16th-century mummy of Eung-tae . While slippers made of hair might seem unusual to people living in the west, they reoccur in Korean literature as a symbol of love and hope for recovery from an illness. Chris Scarre, head of archaeology department at the University of Durham, told International Business Times that the body, letters and slippers were so well preserved as some burials were sealed in concrete, which preserves organic materials exceptionally well. Archaeologists reportedly broken open a hardened earth shell of the tomb, a little like concrete, to expose the wooden coffin with the mummy inside, which was hidden beneath some clothes. He said: ‘As well as studying changes in rank and ideology, archaeologists who investigate tombs are often moved to wonder about the character of the deceased, the thoughts of the mourners and their hopes and fears on the passing of a person dear to them. In this extraordinary burial from Korea, we hear these voices directly.’ While the writer of the letter might be anonymous, her letter has inspired an opera, film and numerous novels, almost 450 years after her death.","The mummy is that of Eung-tae, who was tall, probably handsome and a member of Korea's ancient Goseong Yi clan .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Not one to be outdone by a rival, Samsung has unveiled a new curved handset just days after LG declared it was working on flexible displays for smartphones. Called the Galaxy Round, the Korean firm's new handset has similar specifications to its Note 3 device, but additionally has a 5.7-inch concave screen fixed to curved casing. It's designed to fit in the palm of a hand more comfortably, but as Android expert Kellex from Droid Life exclaims: 'This is a Galaxy Note 3 with a curved display and a couple of extra gimmicky . features. We still aren’t seeing a point.' Scroll down for video . Apple could also copy rivals Samsung and LG by launching the iPhone 6 with a flexible display, similar to the Galaxy Round, pictured . Samsung's Galaxy Round handset, pictured, curves from left to right. The company claims this makes it more comfortable to hold than other phones . Display: 5.7-inch curved AMOLED screen . Thickness: 7.9mm thick . Weight: 154g . Battery: 2800mAh . Camera: 13MP . Operating system: Android 4.3 . The phone is only currently available in Korea through mobile operator SK Telecom, and costs 109 million won (£632). Samsung has not announced if or when then the handset will be made available in other countries. Samsung's Galaxy Round is not technically flexible because it can't bend or change shape, but it is said to be the world's first smartphone to have a curved design. The size of the screen makes the Galaxy Round the same size as Samsung's Galaxy Note 3. It is 7.9mm thick and weighs 154g. Samsung has said that its overall design and curve offers: 'a comfortable hand grip feeling to users, and exclusive experiences of [a] curved display. Samsung announced in September it was working on phones with a curved display. Earlier this week, LG Display said it had developed flexible display technology, and its research arm LG Chem confirmed it is almost ready to unveil its bendy batteries. LG's 6-inch display will be made of bendy plastic substrates, rather than glass, and the panel can be attached to any curved device. The design is 0.44mm-thick and has a protective film attached to the back, making it 'bendable and unbreakable.' It has a radius of 7cm, weighs 7.2g and is vertically concave from top to bottom, whereas Samsung's display is horizontally concave. The curved Galaxy Gear smartwatch is set to follow Samsung's foray into curved TVs, and likely use the technology found on Samsung's curved phone, the Galaxy Round, pictured, launched in October . Other features of the Galaxy Round that take advantage of the curved display include what's dubbed Roll Effect. This lets users roll the phone towards them to see the date, time, missed calls and battery life without pressing the power button or activating the home screen. The Galaxy Round additionally has a 2800mAh battery and a 13MP camera, as seen on the Galaxy S4 and Note 3. It runs Android 4.3 and has 3GB of RAM with a 2.3GHz quad-core processor. Both Samsung and LG have already used curved displays on top-of-the-range OLED TVs. On TVs, the curved screen is designed to improve the viewing angle and make shows and films feel more 'immersive.'","Galaxy Round has a 5.7-inch concave screen attached to a curved casing .

"By . Jenny Hope . Researchers have found acupuncture on the ear helped overweight people slim down within eight weeks (file picture) There's hope if Christmas over-indulgence leaves you with an unsightly spare tyre – because acupuncture on the ear will banish it,  say researchers. They found it helped overweight people slim down within eight weeks, especially around the midriff. One treatment, which involves inserting needles 2mm deep on five points around the outer ear, was particularly effective at tackling a bulging waistline. But even targeting one spot termed the ‘hunger’ point produced results, they said. Participants in a two-month study saw their body mass index (BMI) drop by up to 6 per cent and also had less body fat and a smaller waist, says a report published online in the journal Acupuncture in Medicine. So-called auricular acupuncture therapy is based on the understanding that the outer ear represents all parts of the body. It was first used in France in 1956 by Dr Paul Nogier, who noticed that a patient’s backache was cured following a burn to the ear. In the UK, acupuncture may be offered as traditional Chinese therapy using needles at certain points on the body to boost energy or in a Westernised form of electro-stimulation to release endorphins, the body’s natural painkillers. Researchers at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, South Korea tested the traditional method on 91 overweight adults, who were all put on the same diet. A third were given the five point treatment, another 30 people were assigned the ‘hunger point’ method, while the rest were given a ‘sham’ treatment. One treatment, which involves inserting needles 2mm deep on five points around the outer ear, was particularly effective at tackling a bulging waistline . Almost a third dropped out before the eight weeks were up, 15 of whom were in the sham treatment group, suggesting they found it harder to regulate their hunger and cope with the restrictive diet, say the authors. Among those who kept going there was a 6 per cent drop in BMI in the five-point group and 5.7 per cent in the one-point group. Waist circumference fell, with the largest drop seen in the group on the five-point treatment. There were also significant differences after four weeks. Previous research has suggested the treatment raises the metabolic rate, alters hormones or suppresses appetite by releasing natural painkillers. But Edzard Ernst, a professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, said: ‘It is hard to think of a treatment that is less plausible than ear acupuncture. 'Consulting an acupuncturist will reduce your cash but not your body weight.’","Study done by researchers at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, South Korea .

"By . Lucy Crossley . When fashion design student Anaïs Bordier was watching a YouTube video she was stunned to see a face that looked uncannily like her own staring out of her computer screen. Miss Bordier then discovered that not only did she share a birthday with Samantha Futerman, the actress in the clip, but the pair had both been born in Seoul, South Korea - prompting the young women's claim that they are twins who were separated at birth and adopted by different families on opposite sides of the globe. Now the pair’s astonishing story is to be made to a documentary film and a book, focussing on their chance meeting via the internet, and the moment they came face to face for the first time. Scroll down for video . Sister Sister: Suspected twins Anaïs Bordier (left) and Samantha Futerman (right), pictured during their first Skype conversation, believe they are twins who were separated after birth and adopted by different families . Alike: Miss Futurman (left) grew up in New Jersey, USA, while Miss Bordier (right) was raised in a suburb of Paris, France . Last February Miss Bordier, 26, who is studying at Central st Martins in London but was raised as an only child in a Parisien suburb, had been watching a YouTube film when she noticed that an actress in the clip looked very similar to her. She also shared similar mannerisms to the actress, who turned out to be Miss Futerman, also 26, who grew up in Verona, New Jersey and was living in Los Angeles. Miss Bordier contacted aspiring actress Miss Futerman on Twitter and the women say they soon worked out that they were both born in the South Korean capital on November 19, 1987. 'I was terrified and excited at the same time,' Miss Bordier told The Sunday Times. 'Sam responded with a picture of her birth records. There was nothing there to say she was a twin but then she sent pictures through and it seemed to settle it. It felt like having a heart attack, but it was also the happiest moment - a new world was opening.' Contact: Miss Bordier (left) contacted aspiring actress Miss Futerman (right) on Twitter and the women say they soon worked out that they were both born in the South Korean capital on November 19, 1987 . Miss Bordier had been placed into foster care by an American agency - Holt International Children's services - and adopted by her French parents three months later. Meanwhile Miss Futerman was adopted around three months after her birth, having been fostered by another agency - Spence-Chapin. She said that documentation given to her adoptive parents did not contain the names of her birth parents, or if she had any brothers or sisters. Following their Twitter conversation the women plucked up the courage to speak to one another via a Skype video call. Miss Futerman then started a Kickstarter page to fund a documentary to chronicle their first meeting and their subsequent adventures together. Truth: Miss Futerman (left) and Miss Bordier (right) say that have taken a DNA test, but have vowed only to reveal the result in their film . The pair hoped to raise $30,000, around £19,000, and more than 1,000 people have donated a total of $44,000 (£27,000) - which paid for a DNA test to reveal once and for all if the pair are in fact sisters. The women have now started a second Kickstarter campaign to raise $80,000 (£49,000) for their documentary's post-production, and have taken in more than $20,000 (£12,000). They say that have taken a DNA test, but have vowed only to reveal the result in their film - prompting some to wonder if the pair's story is an elaborate hoax. Miss Futerman journeyed to London to meet Miss Bordier in May last year. Miss Bordier said: 'The door opened and I felt paralysed. She was right in front of me and I didn't want to move. We were just staring at each other.' Similarity: The suspected twins say they have used their physical similarities to play tricks on their parents - just like in the 1998 Lindsay Lohan film The Parent Trap . She said that her father had cried upon meeting Miss Futerman, while her mother believed that the pair were so alike that they had to be sisters. They both share a love of Harry Potter, the arts, and many of the same television programmes, while Miss Bordier confessed that the duo had taken advantage of their physical similarities to play a trick on Miss Futerman's mother and father. 'I came out first and surprised them and they stopped for five seconds, saying, ""What? What? No!"" and they said we were identical too. It was just like The Parent Trap.' The 1961 Hollywood movie, remade in 1998 starring Linday Lohan, features twins who were separated as babies and brought up by their divorced mother and father respectively only to meet as teenagers at summer camp.","Anaïs Bordier spotted Samantha Futerman, both 26, on a YouTube video .

Shock: When Mr Williams woke up ready to begin his ride down the length of Africa he discovered his bike, pictured outside St Petersburg, Russia, had been stolen off the drive . 'I grew up in Swansea and spent 20 years here so was really excited about coming back to visit,' he said. 'It is very much my home town and I had a great family Christmas and New Year here.' But when Mr Williams woke up yesterday morning ready to begin his ride down the length of Africa he discovered his bike had been stolen off the drive.

A 2009 survey revealed that the Welsh city was the most likely place in the UK for drivers to make a claim for a crash or stolen car, with the SA4 postcode area producing more insurance claims per head than any other. Crime figures released last year showed there had been 1,684 reported thefts from cars and vans and 785 vehicle thefts across Swansea and Neath Port Talbot. Police have said that vehicle crime in the city has fallen over the last decade. The machine is a white, blue and green coloured 650cc Kawasaki bike with an Australia number plate of NSW 37. Mr Williams said: 'It is a proper travel bike built for tough roads. I had modified it in order to be able to travel round the world.

'I was planning to travel for six months, return to Australia and then travel some more but now I have no idea what to do. It is awful news and now all I am hoping for is my bike to be returned to me. 'If whoever stole my bike sees this story I just want them to park it up and give me a call or send me an email.'

Suddenly doing the housework doesn’t seem like quite so much of a chore, thanks to LG’s line of HomeChat appliances. The electronics company have created a washing machine, fridge and oven that you can communicate with via Line Messaging, a smartphone app which sends instant messages, similar to WhatsApp. Housework just got easier: LG's HomeChat range, pictured here, enables consumers to communicate between their phones and home appliances . Well-stocked: LG's new HomeChat appliances will tell you via instant messaging service Line Messaging, how how food you have in your fridge . Technology is built into the appliances with which the app communicates, so by using the app users can communicate with their various gizmos as if they were just another contact in their phone book. You can ask the appliance specific questions and provide additional information to alter their functions, which means you can be sitting at your desk at work whilst putting a load of washing on. You’ll be able to use the app to simultaneously check the temperature inside your fridge as well as the status of how much milk is left. Using its built-in camera, the fridge can scan its own contents and send you a damage report on request. Load less trouble: Samsung's WW9000 washing machine, pictured here, has a touch screen and can produce a freshly washed 2kg load in just 15 minutes . This remarkable technology, says Rocket News 24, also has the ability to tell the vacuum cleaner to run about the house looking for . dust or turn the central heating down a few degrees. Currently the HomeChat appliances are only available to buy in LG’s native South Korea, though LG have said they want to expand availability worldwide. Fortunately, Samsung have it’s own version of the washing machine, and it’s available in Britain’s very own John Lewis for £1,699. The WW9000 - available in two colours, white or graphite – follows the same experience as HomeChat. You can pause or start a wash using your mobile device, plus get notifications telling you how long there is left and when a cycle has finished. It also stores around a month’s worth of detergent, releasing with each wash the exact amount needed for the size of the load. It also features a handy touchscreen and different programmes to target specific stains: The Gardening cycle shifts soil and grass stains whilst Cooking & Dining gets rid of food and grease marks. And, thanks to it’s speed, a 2kg wash can be done in just 15 minutes.","LG's HomeChat range includes a fridge, washing machine and oven .

"By . Wills Robinson . A council has been criticised after a new bus lane camera was revealed to have raked in more than £600,000 of fines in just two weeks - snaring more than 10,000 motorists. More than 700 people were handed penalties for using Nelson Mandela Place, in Glasgow City Centre, in the two weeks after the CCTV camera was set up. But drivers believe the warning signs are 'woeful' and have complained that they are constantly blocked by other vehicles. Lucrative: Glasgow City Council has raked in £600,000 in just two weeks by fining motorists who have been using the bus gates at Nelson Mandela Place . Warnings: Furious motorists say the signs are confusing and are often blocked by other vehicles . Council bosses have defended the system, insisting that the camera and the accompanying signs are adequate. Furious architect John Taylor was given a fine after he was caught going through the bus gate. After submitting a Freedom of Information request to Glasgow City Council, he discovered that he was not alone. He said: 'The signposting for the bus gate is woefully inadequate. I have no problems with bus lanes and improving traffic flows but the problem here is the bus gate is so badly signposted. 'The sign in West George Street can often by obscured by traffic or a parked van, so motorists have no way of knowing they are about to break the rules. Angry: Architect John Taylor uncovered the vast number of penalties through a Freedom of Information request after he was slapped with a £60 fine . 'If the council really wanted to curb private cars going into George Square they would signpost it fully.' Mr Taylor lodged a freedom of information request with the city council asking how many cars contravened the bus gate from the day it went into operation on Monday June 30 until Wednesday July 16. On one of the days the camera was not in operation but, on the remaining 15 days, it caught a total of 10,096 motorists. The lowest number of breaches was on the first day of the new scheme, when 477 were nabbed, and the highest on Friday, July 4, when 802 went through the bus gate. Blocked: He says the signs surrounding the gates are often obscured by other cars or lorries . Each motorist will be hit with a £60 fine, reduced to £30 if paid within 14 days. Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said the city council had failed to get information about the bus gate over to drivers. He added: 'Clearly there is a complete failure of signpost information when so many people are getting caught.' A city council spokesman insisted the new traffic restriction is well signposted. He said: 'The majority of drivers don’t receive fines as they don’t choose to drive through a well publicised and very visible bus gate. Signs: The council has defended the criticism and insists that the signs around the bus gate are adequate . 'The number of offences has dropped by 65.7 per cent since the bus lane enforcement began and we expect further reductions. 'Seven permanent signs advising the bus gate is operational have been in place since the beginning of June and are clearly visible on Hope Street, West George Street, West Nile Street and at Nelson Mandela Place. 'In addition, there were two temporary signs on Bothwell Street and West George Street in the run up to the bus gate coming into play.' Councils are using spy cameras to catch more and more drivers . Drivers are milked of more than £135million a year by spy cameras in bus lanes and box junctions, figures have revealed. A record 1.32million fines were issued for minor offences in 2011/12, 16 per cent up on the year before. Local authorities are using an increasing amount of technology to snare motorists - and are collecting a huge number of penalties in the process. Last month it was revealed that Kingston Council raked in nearly £1million in bus lane and box junction fines – in just three months. They collared an average of 72 motorists a day for bus lane infringements over 12 weeks in spring. However more than £1.8m was paid back to motorists after they were fined for driving over a bridge in York city centre. Almost 60,000 motorists were issued with penalty notices for using the Lendal Bridge after controversial traffic restrictions were introduced. Essex County Council was also forced to hand back more than £1m to motorists fined for illegally using its new bus lanes - because the signposts were not adequately marked. In terms of parking fines, CCTV cameras mounted on cars - that have generated around £300million in the last five years will be made illegal. Some 75 councils currently have permission to use ‘approved devices’ rather than traffic wardens to enforce parking restrictions, under Labour’s 2004 Traffic Management Act. In these areas, a third of all parking fines are now thought to be issued via CCTV rather than parking wardens.","10,000 drivers were fined for using Nelson Mandela Place in Glasgow .

The Speaker and two Commons officials, along with two MPs, flew to the event in Seoul, South Korea, last weekend, in a trip thought to have cost more than £10,000. Mr Bercow’s office said the Speaker had a ‘packed schedule’ and had delivered a ‘well-received’ keynote speech to the World E-Parliament Conference 2014. But Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘Some parliamentary representation there was sensible but there is little justification for as many as five people taking part in such an event in these straitened times.’ Mr Bercow has made reconnecting voters and MPs through the internet a key aim and has set up a Speaker’s Commission on Digital Engagement, made up of members including Tory MP Robert Halfon and Labour’s Meg Hillier, who also flew  to Seoul. Challenged on the costs of the trip yesterday, a spokesman for Mr Bercow said he and one aide had flown business class at £2,600 each return, having chosen the ‘cheapest business flight available’. Delegates are thought to have stayed at a four-star hotel where rooms cost up to £250 a night. Hackney MP Ms Hillier and Mr Halfon, MP for Harlow, flew out ahead of the Speaker. Mr Halfon last night said they were invited by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which was funding their costs. He said: ‘It was not a jolly – I was in the South Korean parliament solid for three days.’ Ms Hillier also insisted the conference was hard work.

"By . Dan Bloom . It's only natural to fear being upstaged on your wedding day, so imagine competing with 2,499 other brides. But that did not deter these couples - some of whom met just days ago - when they married today in the romantic surroundings of a 25,000-seat sports stadium. Dressed in gleaming white with the men in sharp black suits, they were part of only the second 'cosmic blessing' by South Korea's famous Unitarian Church since the death of its leader, divisive self-proclaimed messiah Sun Myung Moon, in September 2012. We do! Some 2,500 couples took part in a mass 'cosmic blessing' today by South Korea's Unification Church, founded by self-proclaimed messiah Sun Myung Moon . With this ring I thee wed... and what's your name again? Some of the couples met just days ago and not all spoke the same language, as part of the faith's tradition . Blessing: South Korea's Unification Church is famous for its cosmic blessing ceremonies, often held in sports stadiums. More than 40 of the couples met just days ago . Love (with an earpiece): One newlywed couple make the heart shape with their hands. They will have to abstain from sex for at least 40 days and nights . Scale: The church was founded in 1954 by self-proclaimed messiah Sun Myung Moon and its first blessing had 33 couples. Today's ceremony was held by his widow . Need a private moment, dear? While some of the couples were reaffirming their vows, others did not even speak the same language and were united by 'True Mother' After confirming under oath that they are virgins the couples sprinkle holy water, recite vows pledging themselves to be fathful to each other and exchange rings and prayers. But the tradition then steers wildly away from Christian marriage - as the newlyweds must then go for at least 40 days without having sex. The period of abstinence is supposed to be an echo of Jesus's 40 days and nights wandering the desert, where the Bible says he remained in the wilderness as the devil appeared to him and offered him a string of temptations, all of which he ignored. A highly controversial figure accused of leading a cult, Reverend Moon founded his church in 1954 and began holding the mass 'blessings' soon afterwards, which grew to global prominence as he gained followers around the world. The first ceremony in 1961 attracted just 33 couples, but they soon expanded. In one such mass blessing in 1997, 30,000 couples tied the knot in Washington D.C. Just two years later 21,000 filled the Olympic Stadium in Seoul. Rev Moon died in September 2012 at . the age of 92 of complications from pneumonia, and today's ceremony - as . with another with 3,500 couples this time last year - was overseen by . his 71-year-old widow Hak Ja Hang. Are you sitting comfortably? Seats were laid out in neat rows in the stadium, a vast sports and cultural complex on the outskirts of South Korean capital Seoul . Identical: Standing from plastic chairs, the couples were dressed the same with women in white dresses and veils and the men in black suits with white shawls . Devotion: Newlyweds bow to Rev Moon's 71-year-old widow Hak Ja Hang, described by followers who flock from around the world as 'True Mother' Mass ceremony: Though taking place in a free and democratic country, the mass spectacle is reminiscent of displays by Korea's dictatorship neighbour to the north . It was held at the CheongShim Peace World Center, a vast sports and cultural stadium with a full roof buried in the countryside on the outskirts of the South Korean capital Seoul. As the second-largest arena of its kind in Asia, it is the same venue where the religious leader's opulent funeral was held in 2012. Confetti was hurled into the air today as the identically-dressed couples exchanged their vows, with women dressed in traditional white dresses and veils while the men wore sharp black suits with white shawls. Some of the couples were already married and were reaffirming their vows, while others had been engaged for some time. For some, however, cold feet would be a real danger - as they would have met their partners just days before. Some 140 people from 10 countries who were born into the church - 43 men and 97 women - gathered at a camp near the venue last week for a 'matching ceremony' to meet their new partners for the first time. The newlyweds-to-be, five of whom were . from America, went to classes and lectures alongside each other before . putting on their wedding clothes after lunch and waiting for the 'True . Mother' - Rev Moon's widow - to appear and match them up with each . other. Hak Ja Hang began matching the oldest candidates, working her way . down to the youngest. The . church's American website said: 'After the matches were confirmed, it . was a joy to watch the new couples converse happily with one another, . many of them with the help of a translator.' Confetti: The blessing was just one step in a long a complex process which ends in the formal unification between man and woman in a three-day ceremony . Sharing a prayer: But the insistence that leader Rev Moon was the second coming of Christ led him to be regarded with wide suspicion as a cult figure . Stadium: The ceremonies have taken place regularly. The church claims to have three million members but most people say that number is far smaller . It's time to party! There were so many couples that they and their guests filled the arena, which is the second-largest of its kind in Asia . Spectacle: A bride and groom to be take a minute to absorb the view in the stadium - or are they taking a cheeky pair of selfies? Here come the brides: A woman complete with a bridal veil and white glove takes a moment to take a photo. Today's ceremony was the second since Rev Moon died . Devotion: The mass blessings have become a world-famous ritual, with couples who are already married reaffirming vows alongside those joining for the first time . Say cheese: Although many people may find the ritual unusual, it was a happy affair for the thousands of couples who posed for photos together afterwards . One of the American participants who got married today added: 'It's weird to think that any one of these . women who I am sitting next to during lectures, or eating lunch at the . same table with, could be my future spouse.' Rev Moon was famous for personally pairing up couples who could not even speak the same language because he preferred marriages to be across cultures and nations. His teachings included that more earthy romantic love ruined society by leading to sexual promiscuity and badly-matched couples. After the 40-day period of separation, couples join together for the 'three day ceremony', the last step in the unusual process. According to the church's American . website: 'Over a three-day period, the wife gives rebirth to her husband . from the position of mother and then receives him in the position of . wife. 'Then in the position . of father, the husband gives rebirth to his wife and receives her in the . position of husband. Through this process, God breathes into the couple . a new conjugal life.' Despite . gaining a huge following around the world, the insistence that Rev Moon . was the second coming of Christ led him to be regarded with wide . suspicion as a cult leader. In . 1982, he was jailed for 13 months in the U.S. for filing false federal . income tax returns. His church insisted he had been pursued by the . authorities because of his religious activities. The church claims to have three million members worldwide, though most sources say that number is likely to be far smaller. Cult-like: The Rev Moon, pictured left in 1998 with his wife who oversaw today's ceremony, said he had a vision in which God told him to do the messiah's work . History: The ceremonies have happened for several decades, such as this one at the Jasmil gymnasium in the south Korean capital Seoul on October 14, 1982 . Cult of personality: Mourners gather beneath a gigantic depiction of Rev Moon at the same stadium as today's ceremony during a memorial service in August last year . Leader: Wearing a crown, Rev Moon wedded 4,200 'Moonies' at New York's Madison Square Garden during a 1982 ceremony in which he picked couples himself .","Wedding by Unification Church was second since the death of leader and self-declared messiah Sun Myung Moon .

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's execution of his uncle last week is an example of the worrisome unpredictability of that regime and could be a prelude to some kind of provocation by Pyongyang, top Pentagon officials said on Thursday. The execution of Jang Song Thaek on Friday was the biggest upheaval in years in North Korea, which has conducted three nuclear tests and this year raised the possibility of nuclear war with South Korea and the United States. Tension: The execution of Jang Song Thaek on Friday was the biggest upheaval in years in North Korea, which has conducted three nuclear tests and this year raised the possibility of nuclear war with South Korea and the United States . 'These kind of internal actions by dictators are often a precursor to provocation to distract attention from what they're doing inside of that country,"" General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon news conference. North Korea's KCNA news agency said last week Jang had been executed for trying to seize power and for driving the economy ""into an uncontrollable catastrophe.' But North Korean politics are virtually impenetrable from outside. Analysts have speculated, for instance, that Jang could have been purged over a falling out with Kim or other personal reasons. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that uncertainty about North Korea's motives is ""concerning to everyone."" 'That nation is as closed as any nation in the world. There is no transparency,' Hagel said. 'And so when you see things like this occur, it heightens the reaction of what people think ... could happen, with that kind of unpredictability. So, it's not a welcome event at all.' Dempsey did not explicitly say what kind of provocation he feared from the North. The United States blames it for the 2010 sinking of a South Korean warship. Tensions were heightened earlier this year during U.S.-South Korean military drills that Pyongyang branded a 'rehearsal for invasion.' In a rare show of force during the drills last year, two nuclear-capable, bat-winged B-2 stealth bombers flew 37 1/2 hours from their U.S. base to drop dummy munitions on a South Korean range, and then returned home.","Message warned that North Korea would strike if the protests continued .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . South Korea's prime minister has resigned over the government's handling of a ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing. Chung Hong-won's resignation comes amid rising indignation over claims by the victims' relatives that the government did not do enough to rescue or protect their loved ones. Most of the dead and missing were high school students on a school trip. A spokesman said President Park Geun-hye would accept the resignation, but did not say when Mr Chung would leave office. South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won bows during of a press conference in Seoul this morning where he announced his intent to resign over the Sewol ferry sinking . Officials have taken into custody all 15 . people involved in navigating the ferry Sewol, which sank April 16. A . prosecutor revealed that investigators were also looking into . communications made as the ship sank between a crew member and the . company that owns the ferry. South Korean executive power is largely concentrated in the president, Park Geun-hye, so the resignation appears to be largely symbolic. Mr Chung was heckled by relatives and . his car was blocked when he visited a shelter on an island near the site . of the sinking a week ago. On Sunday, he issued an extraordinary . statement to reporters in Seoul on the national tragedy. 'As . I saw grieving families suffering with the pain of losing their loved . ones and the sadness and resentment of the public, I thought I should . take all responsibility as prime minister,' Mr Chung said. 'There . have been so many varieties of irregularities that have continued in . every corner of our society and practices that have gone wrong. I hope . these deep-rooted evils get corrected this time and this kind of . accident never happens again.'

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) Meanwhile, Yang Jung-jin of the joint investigation team said two helmsmen and two members of the steering crew were taken in on preliminary arrest warrants issued late Friday. Formal arrest warrants were issued Saturday night. Eleven other crew members, including the captain, had been formally arrested earlier. All are accused of negligence and of failing to help passengers in need as the ferry Sewol sank. The captain initially told passengers to stay in their rooms and took half an hour to issue an evacuation order, by which time the ship was tilting too severely for many people to get out. Divers have recovered 187 bodies and 115 people are believed to be missing, though the government-wide emergency task force has said the ship's passengers list could be inaccurate. Only 174 people survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members. The seven surviving crew members who have not been arrested or detained held non-marine jobs such as chef or steward, Yang said in a telephone interview from Mokpo, the southern city near the wreck site where prosecutors are based. South Korean television aired video of police escorting the four men to court. All four wore baseball caps that hid their faces, and at least one was limping. Captain Lee Joon-seok told reporters after his arrest that he withheld the evacuation order because rescuers had yet to arrive and he feared for passengers' safety in the cold water. Crew members have also defended their actions. Helmsman Oh Yong-seok, one of those arrested Saturday, has said he and several crew members did their best to save people. He said that he and four crew members worked from nearby boats to smash windows on the sinking ferry, dragging six passengers stuck in cabins to safety. Officials in charge of the search effort said divers had reached two large rooms where many of the lost may lie dead, but the search has been suspended since Saturday because of bad weather. Currents were also strong, as they were in the first several days of the search, when divers struggled in vain even to get inside the submerged vessel. The two rooms where searchers hope to find more of the missing soon are sleeping units designed for many people — one in the stern and one in the bow. Fifty students from Danwon High School in Ansan were booked into one of them. Students from the city near Seoul make up more than 80 percent of the dead and missing; they had been on their way to the southern tourist island of Jeju. Large objects that toppled when the ferry tipped over and sank are believed to be keeping divers from reaching bodies in at least one of the rooms. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries also said it would soon change ferry systems so that passenger, vehicle and cargo information is processed electronically. There is not only uncertainty about how many people were on the Sewol, but a huge discrepancy regarding the amount of cargo it was carrying when it sank. The Sewol was carrying an estimated 3,608 tons of cargo, according to an executive of the company that loaded it. That far exceeds what the captain claimed in paperwork — 150 cars and 657 tons of other cargo, according to the coast guard — and is more than three times what an inspector who examined the vessel during a redesign last year said it could safely carry. Yang, the prosecutor, said that the cause of the sinking could be due to excessive veering, improper stowage of cargo, modifications made to the ship and tidal influence. He said investigators would determine the cause by consulting with experts and using simulations.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Apple and Samsung have finally decided to call an end to their four-year battle over patent infringements. In a joint statement, the two tech giants said they have agreed to drop all suits against each other in countries outside of the US. However, the companies added they will continue to pursue the existing cases currently going through the American legal system. Apple and Samsung have finally decided to call an end to their four-year battle over patent infringements.In a joint statement, the two tech giants said they have agreed to drop all suits against each other in countries outside of the US, but will continue to pursue all the existing cases going through the American legal system . The latest case began on . 31 March and a jury concluded both firms were at fault to varying degrees. In 2010 Apple began by suing Samsung, but the Korean firm counter-sued just . days later. Apple then secured an injunction to restrict sales of . Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Europe. In . July 2012, Apple was told to publicly state Samsung hadn't copied its designs, but in August 2012 Apple won $1 billion . in damages. These damages were then dropped from $1 billion (£593 . million) to around $800 million (£475 million). In June last year, . the International Trade Commission ruled iPads infringed on Samsung . patents and  should be banned in the U.S. This ruling was vetoed two months later. A retrial began in November that Apple won, but Samsung appealed. Countries where both companies have launched legal action in the past include South Korea, Japan, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Reports of a potential truce began in May, and the claims followed shortly after a jury awarded both companies damages during a high-profile court battle. This was said to have made it easier to resume talks. The brief statement, sent to journalists by Samsung Electronics Australia said: 'Samsung and Apple have agreed to drop all litigation between the two companies outside the United States. 'This agreement does not involve any licensing arrangements, and the companies are continuing to pursue the existing cases in U.S. courts. 'No further comment or interviews will be available.' The two tech giants have been battling over patent lawsuits since 2010. Each company accuses the other of stealing and using hardware and software features from their respective handsets. The more recent battle began in March and was brought by Apple in the US. It involved at least 10 patent software infringements from the ‘slide to unlock’ feature, to Face Time and video calls. The most recent legal case began in March between the two firms, and was brought by Apple. It concerned software infringements, including the 'slide to unlock' feature (pictured). A jury agreed Samsung infringed two Apple patents, and awarded $119.6 million, but also found in favour of Samsung, awarding $158,400 . The case ran for two months before a California jury reached a mixed verdict. The eight-person jury agreed Samsung had infringed two Apple software patents, awarding the company a total of $119.6 million. But the jury also found in favour of Samsung in its counterclaim, awarding the firm $158,400 for the infringement of one patent. The $119.6 million is barely more than five per cent of the $2.2 billion in damages Apple asked of the court. It is also much less than the $930 million Apple was awarded in 2012 in the same court, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Jose. The move comes after Apple and Google bought a similar three-year battle to an end by issuing a statement in Mary saying they will be dismissing all patent disputes. The most recent disputes applied to patents Google inherited when it bought Motorola Mobility in 2012.","The two tech giants have been battling over patent lawsuits since 2010 .

"By . John Hall . North and South Korean warships have exchanged gunfire after Kim Jong-Un's navy were accused of illegally entering waters belonging to its neighbour. In the latest sign of rising animosity between the bitter rivals, officials from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff and Defense Ministry said a North Korean vessel fired two artillery shells at a ship patrolling  the countries' disputed maritime boundary in the Yellow Sea. The shells apparently missed the South . Korean ship, which responded to the act by deliberately firing several . artillery rounds in to the water near the North Korean vessel.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Hernias can be resolved with a routine operation today, but in the 17th century sufferers were forced to cope with incredible pain - as well as the risk of death - when their internal organs became dislodged. Now CT scans and an autopsy carried out on a Korean mummy have revealed that one high-ranking official lived with the condition 300 years ago. And while organs, including his liver and stomach, pushed though a hole in his diaphragm, experts do not believe he died from the condition. CT scans and an autopsy recently carried out on a Korean mummy (pictured) has revealed that A middle aged man who lived in the 17th century ago suffered from a hernia . Experts think the man was 45 when he died in the 17th century. He was probably married, as suggested by his top-knot hairstyle. The man stood 5ft 3inches tall. He was probably of high social status as he was buried in a royal tomb. The man could have suffered from chest pains, breathing difficulties and nausea as a result of this condition, but he would not have known why. Using CT scans and an autopsy, scientists revealed that the man had a hernia in his chest . Part of his liver, stomach and colon were found to be pushing through a hole in his diaphragm. The man, thought to be middle-aged,  suffered from a hernia in his chest, LiveScience reported. Examination of the mummy, which was discovered last year and was buried in a royal tomb of Korea's Chosun Dynasty in Andong, South Korea, reveals that he would have been around 45 years old at the time of death. It is thought he was around 5ft 3inches tall (160cm) and was probably married, as indicated by his topknot hairstyle. Experts also came across evidence of a hernia, which they described in the journal PLOS ONE. Scientists revealed that the middle-aged man suffered from a hernia in his chest. An autopsy confirmed their suspicions that there was a hole in his diaphragm and that part of his liver, stomach and colon were pushing through it. This photograph shows the hole in the mummy's diaphragm. The liver, labelled Lv, is pushing against the lung . Examination of the mummy, which was discovered last year and was buried in a royal tomb of Korea's Chosun Dynasty in Andong, South Korea (marked on the map), reveals that he would have been around 45 years old at the time of death . They found that he lived with a condition called Bochdalek-type congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which he was almost certainly unaware of at the time. The man could have suffered chest pains, nausea and breathing difficulties. CDH hernias are caused by a birth defect where a hole forms in the diaphragm. This means that organs in the abdomen can push through the hole into the chest cavity with potentially fatal results if the heart or lungs are compressed. Experts from a number of universities in South Korea placed the mummy in a CT scanner to discover the anomaly. An autopsy confirmed their suspicions that there was a hole in this diaphragm and that part of his liver, stomach and colon were pushing through it. The scientists found that he lived with a condition called Bochdalek-type congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which he was almost certainly unaware of at the time. The man could have suffered chest pains, nausea and breathing difficulties from some of his organs squeezing though a hole in his diaphragm (shown in these CT scans) It is thought that the man was around 5ft 3inches tall (160cm) and was probably married, as indicated by his topknot hairstyle. He was laid to rest in straw shoes and was well preserved (shown by his hand, right) The team, which was led by Yi-Suk Kim of Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea, do not think that the man died directly or his condition. ‘The CDH itself might not have been the main cause of death in his case,’ they wrote. ‘He could have lived with CDH in this lifetime while experiencing a few signs of respiratory disturbances. ‘We suspected that the functional defects caused by the CDH in the present male mummy case might have been largely compensated for as he grew older.’","CT scans and an autopsy recently carried out on a Korean mummy has revealed that a 45-year-old man suffered from a hernia in the 17th Century .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Fears that North Korea is planning a nuclear test to coincide with Barack Obama's Asia visit have prompted the United States to warn Kim Jong-un not to threaten regional peace. The South Korean government reportedly said that heightened activity had been detected at North Korea's underground nuclear test site, indicating possible preparations for another atomic test. President Barack Obama, left, arrives in Japan at the start of his Asian visit. It comes amid reports that North Korea, led by Kim Jong-Un, right, could be planning a possible atomic test . The U.S president is visiting Japan today and is due in Seoul on Friday, where he is expected to discuss ways to deal with North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. And State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted they were closing watching Pyongyang and the Korean pennisula. She said: 'We have certainly seen the press reports ... regarding possible increased activity in North Korea's nuclear test site. 'We continue to urge North Korea to refrain from actions that threaten regional peace and security and to comply with its international obligations and commitments.' Kim Min-seok, the South Korean' defence ministry spokesman, said that 'a lot of activity' was being seen at the Punggye-ri test site. Mr Obama is welcomed to Japan on his Asian visit by ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and her husband Edwin Schlossberg . North Korea warned last month it would not rule out a 'a new form' of nuclear test after the United Nations Security Council condemned Pyongyang for launching ballistic missiles into the sea. On the Air Force One flight carrying Obama to Asia yesterday, White House spokesman Jay Carney was asked about the reports that North Korea may be preparing a nuclear test. 'North Korea has a history of taking provocative actions and we are always mindful of the possibility that such an action could be taken,' he told reporters. 'There is a kind of cyclical nature to the provocative actions that North Korea tends to take and we'll be watching it very closely.' He later met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. On Friday he will travel to South Korea . Recent commercial satellite imagery indicates North Korea has begun new operations at Punggye-ri, said 38 North, a North Korea monitoring website run by Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. The activity 'could represent an early stage of preparations for a test or may be intended for a less provocative purpose, such as conducting maintenance after a long winter' 38 North concluded. Nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis, of the Monterey Institute of International Studies in the United States, said this month that the reference to a new form of test could mean simultaneous detonation of two or more devices as part of a programme of more intense nuclear testing expected over the next few years. While North Korea has detonated several nuclear devices since 2006, analysts doubt it has the technical capability to reliably mount a nuclear warhead on a missile.

"By . Will Stewart . Jews in eastern Ukraine are so concerned over their safety after last week's alleged anti-Semitic incidents that they are seeking advice on repatriation to Israel, it was claimed today. This follows fears over a leaflet distributed in the city of Donetsk which demanded that people over 16 of Jewish origin should register with the authorities, a sinister development that smacked of the Nazi-era. It has since been branded a fake by the pro-Russian separatists it claims to represent, as well as one of the city's rabbis. But some local Jews are also concerned about a Russian invasion, with tens of thousands of troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian frontier, said Alexander Ivanchenko, who runs Sohnut, an organisation assisting people to go and live in Israel. The leaflet distributed in Donetsk, Ukraine, calling for all Jews over 16-years-old to register or face deportation, sparked concern among the area's 15,000-strong Jewish community. Now many are looking at fleeing Ukraine for Israel . Pamphlets circulating in Donetsk demanded . 'citizens of Jewish nationality' over the age of 16 pay $50 to register . and be issued special passports 'marking the confession of faith'. 'We are talking about Jewish people returning home to Israel,' he said. 'It is hard to talk about numbers now but I see that there are more people who come for advice asking how to apply for repatriation. 'I cannot say for sure that they will make a decision to leave for Israel, but I do see a rise in the level of interest. People call the Israeli embassy in Kiev. They start gathering the documents.' Recent anti-Semitic incidents, including the controversial leaflet in the name of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic - which strongly denies any role in it - have led to some of the local 17,000 Donetsk Jewish population considering fleeing to Israel. A pro-Russian activist stands guard in front of the Donetsk Regional Administration building in Donetsk this week. The Donetsk People's Republic has denied responsibility for an anti-Semitic flyer circulating in the city while the local rabbi has branded it a fake . 'Most essential is, of course, the safety issue,' he said, as well as the chronic economic demise of Ukraine. 'People fear that war will start. They realise that the mythical ""Banderovtsi"" (so-called Ukrainian nationalist supporters of Stepan Bandera, who Russians associate with fascism) are not a threat - but Russian troops are. 'Now you add to that the anti-Semitism which has become an issue for some people. It's hard to say how many people would apply to move to Israel because of anti-Semitism. Escape: Holocaust survivor Sam Pivnik has urged Jews in Ukraine to flee the country . 'We will see the statistics later, maybe in a month or two, but it is clear that such anti-Semitic provocations have not happened here since World War Two, and no matter who was behind the leaflets, the message itself and the fact that they appeared, do scare people.' Meanwhile, a Holocaust survivor has urged Jews in Ukraine to flee the country. Sam Pivnik, 86, who was 14 when his family were rounded up in Bedzin, western Poland, and sent to Auschwitz, says Ukraine is still a hotbed of anti-semitism.M . Mr Pivnik, who now lives in Golder Green, London, told the Daily Express: 'Jews have no place in Ukraine, because nothing has changed,and as long as Jews remain there, nothing will change. 'They had no business staying in that country after the atrocities of 1939-1945. Jews in the Ukraine should leave.' Before the Second World War a little under one-third of Ukraine's urban population consisted of Jews. In 1941 there were an estimated 2,700,000 Jews in Ukraine. Nearly a million were murdered by the Nazis, often with the complicity of Ukrainians, and they were persecuted under the Soviet regime. In 1959 just 840,446 remained and numbers have declined steadily since then, leaving 65,000 today. Ivanchenko said some Jews in Donetsk were pro-Russian, others pro-Ukrainian, and there was 'no united position', but the flare-up of anti-Semitism was a concern. 'A month ago I saw small posters hanging in Pushkin Boulevard in the city centre with anti-Semitic content. 'The poster said that Zionists want to unite Ukraine with Europe, to break the country away from its Slavic brothers, how wrong this was, and there were quotes from the bible. It clearly had an anti Jewish message. A pro-Russia activist stands guard in front of the flag of the so-called  Donetsk republic outside the police regional building seized by the separatists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavians . On the edge: The situation in Ukraine is getting worse, with five dead in an attack near Slaviansk last night . 'I'm not sure who's doing it, including those posters that appeared last Tuesday, but I do not think that it is the representatives of the Donetsk republic. 'You have to be really crazy to make such statements and I personally think that it is a provocation, but the problem is that it is very easy to do such a thing. 'And it will destabilise the situation. You can play any political game here and use it in any context. 'And what worries me is not the leaflets because they are forgeries. It is 99.9 per cent that it is just provocation. 'Who can guarantee that it will not move further and someone will be killed, for example. 'We have a lot of people brought into the town now, some criminal elements who are here to destabilise the situation. Some have weapons. 'And if some side decides to play the Jewish card, it can just fly out of control. 'People in balaclavas can come into the synagogue beat someone up or rob them. 'We do have fears that it can actually happen and there are talks about it in the synagogue. I think it can also motivate people to think more about repatriation.' US Secretary of State John Kerry branded the leaflet 'grotesque' while he was in Geneva as part of peace talks. But the handout may have been a fake aimed at stirring up trouble in the region . The Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk demanded that those responsible for the flyer - calling on Jews to register and pay a fee - are found. He urged 'the Ukrainian military and security forces and Ukrainian Department of Homeland Security urgently to find these b******* and to bring them to justice', he said. The incident happened as around 20 Jews were leaving the synagogue earlier this week. The three hooded men handing out the pamphlets were carrying a Russian flag and the symbol of the separatist Republic of Donetsk. The leader of the breakaway republic Denis Pushilin - whose name was on the flyer - strongly denied any role. However, the flyer has been branded a fake by religious leaders, including the area's rabbi. The flyer, described as 'grotesque' by US Secretary of State John Kerry, has now been classed by the leader of the city's Jewish community as a hoax, aimed at stirring up trouble. Russia has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the Jewish people. In the late 18th century, Catherine the Great created the Pale of Settlement, which dictated where in Imperial Russia Jews were allowed to reside, an area of about 20 per cent of then-European Russia which today is part of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and, notably, Ukraine. Tsarist Russia also saw a wave of anti-Jewish  riots, known as pogroms, which took off with the violent persecution in Odessa in 1821, now the third largest city in Ukraine, which had one of the highest percentages of Jewish population in the Pale of Settlement. Decades of pogroms followed, with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in the Russian Empire, notably in Kiev, Warsaw and Odessa. The trigger was the assassination of Russia's Tsar Alexandr II, for which many blamed 'The Jews'. Between 1903 and 1906 thousands of Jews were killed in pogroms, including the 1905 pogrom of Odessa which saw up to 2,500 Jewish men, women and children killed, according to historic reports. The pogroms,  harsh conditions and wide-spread poverty in the Pale of Settlement saw some two million Jews emigrate, mainly to the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s. During the Soviet era, the Soviet Union and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting Jews. Josef Stalin was said by numerous sources to despise Jews and under Brezhnev, Jews faced discrimination. 'Perhaps you got Ukraine confused with Russia, where Jewish organizations have noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year.'","Leaflet in Donetsk, Ukraine, ordered Jews to register or face deportation .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Malaysia Airlines is set to be nationalised in a bid to rescue the company still reeling after the MH17 and MH370 tragedies which cost 537 lives. Malaysian state wealth fund Khazanah National said on Friday that it planned to buy out minority shareholders in the company, in which it already has a 69 per cent stake, in the first stage of a 'complete overhaul' of the loss-making airline. There have been suggestions that the struggling company, which would be delisted from the Malaysia stock exchange, could also be renamed as part of the £1.4billion takeover. Scroll down for video . Shot down: Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 is pictured taking off from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, hours before it was hit over eastern Ukraine. The struggling carrier is set to be nationalised in takeover bid . Khazanah said the state takeover will represent the first stage of a 'complete overhaul' of the loss-making airline, and that detailed plans will be announced by the end of this month. The company said that the plan would 'require all parties to work closely together' in order to once again make the national airline a profitable business. For years the airline has struggled to compete with the growth of regional and international airlines and this year's devastating disasters have only added to its financial woes. Flight 370 disappeared mysteriously in March with 239 people on board after diverging from its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The plane has still not been found, with a search in the southern Indian Ocean underway. The airline was widely criticised for its handling of the crisis. Last month, 298 people were killed when Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. First tragedy: In March Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 mysteriously disappeared with 239 people on board as it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The airline had suffered losses in the years leading up to the two disasters . Before the disasters, the carrier's financial performance was among the worst in the industry, raising questions over its future even before the tragedies. Some analysts last month said the airline would not survive a year without a substantial cash injection from the Malaysian government. Crisis and risk management experts suggested the government should bring in new management to the company - possibly from outside Malaysia - as Korean Air and Garuda Indonesia did in response to safety-related crises. Malaysia Airlines lost 4.1billion ringgit (£760million) from 2011 to 2013, and a further 443million ringgit in the first quarter of this year. It has struggled against competition from budget carriers on short-haul routes while being required as a state-owned carrier to fly a series of unprofitable domestic routes. Larger carriers such as Qantas, Sinapore Airlines have been luring away Asian customers, while its Middle Eastern business - an important earner for the company - has been hit by competition from increasingly popular - and profitable - Gulf airlines.","Malaysian sovereign wealth fund has proposed £1.4bn takeover of airline .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . It has been a summer Tim Krul will never forget. From the euphoria of being thrust on to the global stage as Holland's penalty shootout hero in their World Cup quarter-final win over Costa Rica, to the devastation of the MH17 disaster which claimed the lives of 193 of his compatriots and two Newcastle fans. It was on July 5 in Salvador, Brazil that Krul, Holland's substitute goalkeeper, was brought on by Louis van Gaal following a goalless 120 minutes. The 26-year-old saved two spot-kicks and made headlines around the world as the Dutch advanced to the semi-final – he was a national hero. VIDEO Scroll down for Krul on his penalty heroics and what he said to Costa Rica players . Roar: Tim Krul was the penalty shootout hero for Holland against Costa Rica in the World Cup quarter-final . Mobbed: Krul is congratulated by his Holland team-mates after his heroics . But just 12 days later he was left in a state of shock and distress as news broke from Ukraine. A Malaysian Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur - carrying 298 passengers and crew - had been shot down killing all on board, including Newcastle fanatics John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, on their way to watch their team play in New Zealand. Krul, enjoying a post World Cup holiday at the time, was sickened. 'You go from such a high to real life and lives being taken. It's sick,' said Krul, who was born and raised in The Hague before signing for Newcastle as a 17-year-old. 'I have two families – in Holland and in Newcastle. I get shivers just thinking about it. It's such a tragedy. Tragedy: Two Newcastle fans were among 298 passengers killed after a plane was shot down . Tribute: Newcastle fans carried out a one minute silence in Wellington after the tragic event . VIDEO Newcastle remembers fans caught in MH17 disaster . 'So many people who have nothing to do with any conflict out there to be shot down, and so many families affected, it's just disgusting when you think about it. It's hard to think of words to describe it.' Events in Ukraine, of course, put the relative highs and lows of football into perspective. But Krul admits that his World Cup experience less than two weeks earlier had ranked as 'the best of his life'. 'It's what you dream of as a little boy, going to a World Cup, and the experience did not disappoint – it was amazing,' he said. 'It was mad. After beating Spain in the first game I was like “Ah well, he (Louis van Gaal, then Holland manager) is not going to change a winning team now, is he?”. Highlight: Krul says his exploits in Brazil were 'the best of his life' 'And then that moment came in the quarter-final. Before we went to the stadium the goalkeeper coach pulled me over and said there was a big chance they would use me if penalties arrive. 'At the time I thought, “Yeah, good one, it probably won't happen”. Then the game went on and we hit the post, the crossbar and missed so many chances. 'I started itching more and more and got the call to get warmed up and it was just a surreal moment. 'I was not allowed to tell anyone either but I was doing my stretching and all sorts and the boys were looking at me thinking, “What's going on?”. 'And when the moment came it was the best 10 minutes of my life, as well as my little girl being born of course. Spot on: Penalty-saving expert Krul was due to feature in the last four shootout . 'It was surreal but it is what you work for and work towards. It gave me such a boost – that's where I want to be, on that stage.' Krul, though, was a reserve again for the semi-final with Argentina in Sao Paulo. Again, however, Van Gaal's plan was to use his penalty specialist should the tie go the distance. That it did, following another stalemate. But by that point Van Gaal had been forced to use his final substitute. Holland were beaten and Krul was left to reflect on what might have been. 'For the semi-final the manager was going to use me again,' he revealed in an interview with BBC Newcastle. 'It's just a shame (Robin) Van Persie was knackered and had to come off. He was ill before the game and ran out of steam. So (Klaas-Jan) Huntelaar had to go on. It was disappointing to go out.' That disappointment, of course, was soon forgotten. Paying their respects: Fans hold out boards in tribute to the two fans which were killed . In the wake of MH17 Newcastle's St James' Park became a shrine to Liam and John. Football fans from across the world paid tribute, including a fund set up by a Sunderland supporter which raised nearly £33,000. Krul is now back in Newcastle, the place he has called home for eight years. He and his team-mates are preparing for the new season with the added motivation of giving something back in memory of Liam and John. Krul went on: 'The reaction has been very good and shows how together everybody is in the North East. And that has been the same in Holland. 'John had only missed one game in 30 years, that just shows you what a commitment he had and what a commitment Geordies have. That will give us such a boost to give the fans something back because they follow us everywhere.' And everywhere they do go, those supporters and Tim Krul, in particular, will never forget the summer of 2014.","Krul thrust on to the big stage after his penalty shootout heroics at World Cup for Holland .

"By . Martyn Halle . A pioneering operation that shrinks the heart without surgery has been carried out in Britain for the first time – and may help thousands of people with heart failure. A drawstring-like device is used to shut off damaged heart tissue. It has given a new lease of life to  the first Briton to undergo the procedure. Before the operation, Sevket Gocer was so breathless he could  not walk. Revolution: How the new non-bypass Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement surgery is carried out . He had suffered two silent heart attacks that caused a large  area of damage to his heart – sending him into heart failure, in which  the heart enlarges and cannot pump effectively. ‘There was very little I could do without having to stop as I was out of breath and exhausted. Just going upstairs at home was an effort,’ says the 58-year-old, who has diabetes. Heart failure affects more than 750,000 people in the UK. ‘When people are not able to walk around because their heart is too weak, they are at increased risk of death,’ says Professor of Cardiac Surgery Olaf Wendler, who carried out the operation at King’s College Hospital in London. ‘It is not unusual for a patient to have heart attacks without knowing – and the patient has no idea of the damage caused. They become aware something isn’t right when minor exercises cause breathlessness and simple tasks become difficult. Diabetics are at high risk of developing coronary heart disease, and scarring from heart attacks is one of the main reasons for developing heart failure.’ Important care: Heart failure affects more than 750,000 people in the UK . If the heart has been scarred, the damaged area is useless. The conventional operation for heart scarring is to stop the heart and cut out the scarred area while the patient is kept alive on a heart-bypass machine. But this is a risky procedure that doesn’t always produce an improvement. Given Mr Gocer’s frail health, Mr Wendler decided to try the new operation – known as Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement, or LIVE. LIVE can be performed without bypass. It is still necessary to make an incision of 12 to 15cm to open up the chest wall. However, the heart doesn’t have to be cut open. Then, using an X-ray, a needle guides a wire through the left ventricle – one of the heart’s four chambers – and across the scarred area of the heart. The wire is anchored to the walls of the chamber – and then pulled taut to seal off the scarred part of left ventricle. This significantly reduces the size  of the left ventricle, which is the part responsible for pumping blood around the body and which swells and scars during a heart attack. With the scarring sealed off, the ‘resized’ organ is able to pump much more effectively. Mr Gocer, from Bromley, South London, first developed breathing difficulties last year, over several months. He said: ‘My family urged me to get the breathlessness checked and I was referred to King’s by my local hospital. When they scanned me, they could see the scarring and the cardiologist reckoned I’d had two “silent” heart attacks without any pain.’ Before being referred for the procedure this summer, Mr Gocer was worried that he wouldn’t see his two young grandsons grow up. ‘I was told it might give me another ten years, which would be great. No one knows precisely because I’m the first in this country to have had it. But I’m definitely feeling the benefit.’ The hour-long operation is being tested at hospitals across Europe and Mr Wendler believes it could help many thousands of patients. ‘If successful, the operation can bring patients on to an exercise level where they’re able to look after themselves properly, including doing the shopping and having a social life,’ he says. ‘It’s superb that Mr Gocer is doing so well.’ Arsenal fan Mr Gocer had stopped attending football matches because  he ran out of breath walking to the ground. But now he is going again, as well as taking long walks. ‘Last week  I walked over a mile,’ he says. ‘Afterwards I felt fantastic.’","Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement can be performed without bypass .

"By . Martin Robinson . One of the two Muslim converts who hacked Drummer Lee Rigby to death has launched a taxpayer-funded appeal against his murder conviction, it was revealed today. Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, ran down the 25-year-old Fusilier at 30mph before executing him in a Woolwich street using a meat cleaver and knives last year. They were found guilty of his murder in just 90 minutes last month, but Adebolajo maintained they were 'soldiers of Allah' and 'at war', so should not have been convicted. Victim: Drummer Lee Rigby was murdered last year but his killers have not yet been jailed, but this could now be imminent . Murderers: Lee Rigby was killed in a Woolwich street by Michael Adebolajo, 28 (left) and Michael Adebowale, 22 . (right). Adebolajo has now launched an appeal against his conviction . He has now applied to the Court of Appeal in London to have it quashed, it has emerged. If judges agree his case deserves a new hearing, his defence could cost the taxpayers tens of thousands in legal aid. On May 22 last year Adebolajo, a married father of six, lay in wait near Woolwich Barracks with Adebowale so they could kill a soldier. They picked 25-year-old Fusilier Rigby because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack. After driving into him in their Vauxhall Tigra, the killers - who had armed themselves with eight knives, including a meat cleaver and a five-piece set bought by Adebolajo the previous day - butchered him in the street in front of horrified onlookers. Lee Rigby's family fled the Old Bailey in tears on several occasions during the harrowing trial. One witness described the killers' actions as being 'like a butcher attacking a joint of meat'. Profile: A forensic psychiatrist told the Old Bailey Michael Adebolajo (pictured), showed 'no regret or remorse for his actions' Cold-blooded: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand after he had hacked Lee Rigby to death . The jury of eight women and four men sat through weeks of evidence including shocking footage of Adebolajo with bloodied hands confessing to the killing and claiming his actions were 'an eye for an eye'. They then waited for armed police hoping they would be killed and sent to 'paradise' but Scotland Yard officers shot them but ensure they did not suffer fatal injuries. Adebolajo was seen dropping the meat . cleaver as he sprinted across the road towards a police car, collapsing . to the ground when he was shot. Adebowale, . who moved along a wall to draw fire from the officers, was seen folding . over as he was shot by one of three armed officers and had a finger blasted off when he tried to point his gun at them again. Both were then given life-saving first aid in the road. The killers asked to be called by their adopted Islamic names in court - Adebolajo as Mujahid Abu Hamza, and Adebowale as Ismail Ibn Abdullah - and claimed they carried out the murder because they were 'soldiers of Allah'. The jury was told this was no defence in law to the charge. Gesture: Adebolajo holds the Koran up to his face and kisses it as the verdict of murder is delivered. Next to him Adebowale stares grimly ahead . High Court: Adebolajo's appeal would be heard here at the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in London . The men were cleared of the attempted murder of a police officer, and had previously admitted possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. Mr Justice Sweeney said he will sentence the pair after a key Court of Appeal ruling on the use of whole-life jail terms. A date for the appeal judgment has not been announced following a recent hearing before a panel of five leading judges, headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas.","Adebolajo, 29, executed soldier with help of friend Michael Adebowale, 22 .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Botox is being used to treat women who suffer from persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD). This distressing sexual dysfunction causes spontaneous, unwanted and uncontrollable arousal, unrelated to sexual desire, that can last for hours, days or even longer. Orgasm may only give a few hours of relief. Sexual frustration: The symptoms of persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) can last for days and conventional methods of satisfaction may only help for a few hours at a time . Doctors in Turkey successfully treated two women with single Botox injections to block the dorsal nerve, which provides sensation to the clitoris. Both patients reported improved symptoms. The condition is believed to be linked to this nerve. 'Botox reduces electrical activity in the nerve so it can dull an inflamed nerve to provide relief,’ says Botox expert Dr Patrick Bowler, founder  of Courthouse Clinics. Releasing the tension: Using Botox to treat PGAD could bring relief to thousands as it is believed to be plaguing more than one in 100 women . PGAD was first described in 2001 and can be extremely distressing. Last year a 39-year-old Florida woman committed suicide after suffering with it for more than 16 years. The true numbers affected are unknown as many women are too embarrassed to seek help; studies suggest it is more than one in 100 women.","Botox has been proven to help control persistent genital arousal disorder .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Hong Kong billionaire who promised £80million in 'dowry' to the man who could win the affections of his lesbian daughter has withdrawn his offer. Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, a 77-year-old property magnate sparked global controversy in 2012 when, refusing to accept his daughter Gigi's civil union to her lesbian partner of eight years, he offered 500 million Hong kong dollars to the man who could convince her to marry him. He then doubled it recently, insisting that Gigi was 'still single', despite the fact that she married her long-term partner Sean Eav two years ago. Scroll down to read the letter in full . Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, a 77-year-old property magnate who promised £80million in 'dowry' to the man who could win the affections of his lesbian daughter Gigi has withdrawn his offer . Happy couple: Gigi, right, asks her father to 'not be terrified' of her partner Sean, left, whom she married in a civil ceremony two years ago, and to 'treat her like a dignified human being' His 34-year-old daughter initially laughed it off, but last week she went public with her plea for him to understand that she is gay, and that if it is as easy as he thinks to change her sexual orientation, he should lead by example. Now the father of three has taken his offer off the table and said the money is 'staying in his pocket.' 'If Gigi's said that this is what she chooses, then it's all over,' Cecil Chao said Thursday an interview with CNN. 'I can't say I am happy with her choice,' he said. 'If this is her choice then it's for her.' But said he will not be accepting his daughter's partner into his family. 'I have no intention of mixing my life with her life,' Cecil Chao said. 'But if this is what she wants, then I respect her choice.' Definitely not single: Gigi Chao, right, and her partner Sean Eav, have been together for nine years and married in Paris in 2012 . In denial: Hong Kong billionaire Mr Chao, who claims to have slept with 10,000 women, still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he won't force her . Following the publication of an open . letter to her father, Ms Chao said she will enter a straight marriage, . when her father enters a gay one. 'Since . Dad thinks it's so easy for me to switch from gay to straight, I should . just leave it for him to demonstrate. I think I'll marry a man when he . marries a man,' she told The Times. In the letter published by South China Morning Post, Ms Chao reaches out to her father, asking for him to come to terms with the fact that she is a lesbian. In . the letter, which starts 'Dear Daddy', Ms Chao explains that although . her love for him has not changed, the time has come for her father to . accept her sexual orientation and her partner, Sean Eav, whom she has . been with for nine years. Deal: Ms Chao offered to comply with the terms, as long as the man in question donated a large part of the 'reward' to her charity, and did not mind that she already has a wife . 'I must have misled you to hope there were other options for me,' she writes. 'I know it’s difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can’t really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much. 'Now, I’m not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her [partner Sean Eav], and treat her like a normal, dignified human being.I understand it is difficult for you to understand, let alone accept this truth.' 'I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out who I am, what is important in my life, who I love and how best to live life, as an expression of all these questions. 'I am proud of my life, and I would not choose to live it any other way (except also figuring out how to be gentler on the planet). 'I’m sorry to mislead you to think I was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good, suitable men in Hong Kong. 'There are plenty of good men, they are just not for me.' VIDEO: Gigi reads some of her marriage proposals... yes, she's still close with her father... Ms Chao married her long-term partner . Sean in a church ceremony in Paris in early 2012, but it was not . until news of their union was printed in the Hong Kong tabloids that her . father promised the million HKD fortune to any potential male suitor . able to walk Gigi down the aisle. Ms Chao had already told her father about . her wedding, and said he was ‘surprised and unpleasantly shocked,’ but . urged her not to make it public. When the plea for a man for Gigi spread over the world, the offers came pouring in. ‘War veterans from the US, someone . from Ethiopia, from Istanbul, South America, Portugal, really just from . all over the world,’ Ms Chao said. 'One American suitor wrote: ""I’m interested in the offer. I am a male person, who also happens to be gay"".' Ms Chao, an executive director at her father’s . property development company, part-time pilot, and founder of anti-poverty charity Faith . in Love Foundation, has maintained throughout her father's persistent . quest that she knows he is only doing it out of love and concern. 'I . understand that he loves me, it’s just he’s from another time and it’s . difficult for him to understand the plight of the LGBT. 'At the office . it’s business as usual. At family gatherings we hug and dance. And we . just agree to disagree on what marriage is and family is.' Dear Daddy, . I thought the timing was right for us to have a candid conversation. You are one of the most mentally astute, energetic yet well mannered and hard-working people this humble earth has ever known. Your confidence, quick wit, and charisma brightens any room you enter. I love you very much, and I think I can speak for my brothers also, that we have the utmost respect for you as a father and role model in business. I am sorry that people have been saying insensitive things about you lately. The truth is, they don’t understand that I will always forgive you for thinking the way you do, because I know you think you are acting in my best interests. And we both don’t care if anybody else understands. As your daughter, I would want nothing more than to make you happy. But in terms of relationships, your expectations of me and the reality of who I am, are not coherent. I am responsible for some of this misplaced expectation, because I must have misled you to hope there were other options for me. You know I’ve had male lovers in the past, and I’ve had happy, albeit short-lived, relationships. I found myself temporarily happy, buoyed by the freshness, the attention, the interest, of someone physically stronger than myself. But it was always short-lived, as I quickly lost patience, and felt an indescribable discomfort in their presence. It usually made me frustrated, and I would yearn for my freedom again. I’ve broken a few hearts, hearts of good, honest and loving men, and I’m sorry that it had to be so. But with Sean, a woman, somehow it was different. I am comfortable and satisfied with my life and completely at ease with her. I know it’s difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can’t really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much. My regret is that you have no idea how happy I am with my life, and there are aspects of my life that you don’t share. I suppose we don’t need each other’s approval for our romantic relationships, and I am sure your relationships are really fantastic too. However, I do love my partner Sean, who does a good job of looking after me, ensuring I am fed, bathed and warm enough every day, and generally cheering me up to be a happy, jolly girl. She is a large part of my life, and I am a better person because of her. Now, I’m not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her, and treat her like a normal, dignified human being.I understand it is difficult for you to understand, let alone accept this truth.

"By . Richard Shears . A notorious British paedophile is expected to spend the rest of his life in a mosquito-plagued Far East prison after being convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl five years ago. Former hairdresser David Fletcher, 67, has been sent to prison in Cambodia's insufferable Prey Sar prison to serve out a 10-year sentence after he was arrested when he was extradited from neighbouring Thailand earlier this week. He had been convicted of rape in his absence by a court in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, after he fled to Thailand in the wake of claims that he was using a charity to groom for sex a number of poverty-stricken children who lived in a rubbish dump. Visitors at the entrance to Cambodia's notorious Prey Sar Prison where Fletcher will serve a 10-year prison sentence . Following Cambodia's request to have him extradited from Thailand, Fletcher went to the Thai Court of Appeal to fight the move - but the court upheld the Cambodian demand. According to The Cambodia Daily, Fletcher is the first paedophile ever to be sent back to Cambodia to serve a prison sentence. Cambodia was once the haunt of notorious child molester Gary Glitter . Last night, Mr Samleang Seila, director of the anti-paedophile group Action Pour les Enfants, spoke of his gratitude to the authorities for pressing on with their attempts to have Fletcher extradited. 'We are satisfied with this extradition,' Mr Seila told the Daily. 'Even if it took so much time, we are happy it was done.' Fletcher, from Cambridge, has a history of assaults on children. On one occasion in 1967, he was sentenced by the Norwich Crown Court to 18 months in jail for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, who he was said to have plied with champagne. He said of his conviction later: 'She was just my girlfriend…I just did it ahead of her 16th birthday. People will stoop very low to say bad things about me.' Later in Cambodia police built up a file of evidence showing that Fletcher had used his charity to groom young girls - and also their families - with the intention of having sex with the them. Cambodia was once the haunt of notorious child molester Gary Glitter, who fled to neighbouring Vietnam when authorities moved in on him. He was later arrested for sexual molestation of children in Thailand and after serving a prison sentence was deported back to the UK.","David Fletcher, 67, has been sent to prison in Cambodia's Prey Sar prison .

"By . Aap . Australian police have recovered human remains and passenger belongings from the MH17 crash site during their first visit to the area. Federal police were part of an 80-strong Australian and Dutch team that has spent five hours combing farmland, paddocks and villages in eastern Ukraine in an operation that could last up to 10 days. While deadly clashes between Ukrainian government troops and pro-Russian rebels continued nearby, the recovery mission was not under threat, Australian Federal Police national security specialist Andrew Colvin said. Scroll down for video . Inspection: Australian and Dutch investigators examine a piece of debris from MH17 near the village of Hrabove, 100 km from  Donetsk, Ukraine . Dedicated team: Officials spent five hours at the vast site and are expected to take seven to ten days to complete their task . Search: The fields are still littered with huge pieces of debris which stayed intact when the plane was shot down by a missile . 'All parties involved respected the conditions set to allow safe passage both in an out of the wreckage site and at the wreckage site itself,' Deputy Commissioner Colvin told reporters in Canberra on Saturday. Australian representatives were not armed during the visit on Friday and there are no plans to carry arms to the site, concealed or otherwise, he said. Assuming conditions in the area remain stable, he expects the mission to recover bodies will last seven to 10 days. The team's focus is purely humanitarian and will not consider gathering evidence to investigate the crash, he added. Grim search: Australian and Dutch investigators have waited days to get on to the site in the hope of recovering dozens of bodies and bringing them home so they can be laid to rest . Desolation: In normal circumstances, a huge team of experts would have spent weeks collecting evidence from the crash site . 'We are focused on removing the remains and bringing some closure to the families.' Bodies and belongings will be taken to the Netherlands for identification. And as soon as the team has done 'the best we can do, we will get out,' he said. He is confident the search will continue on Saturday but admits safety considerations need to be assessed daily. 'We won't take any unnecessary risks.' Police are working in hot and difficult conditions at the site. Each day the team will travel from an Australian base located away from the crash site. It is more than two weeks since the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet came down after being hit by a missile, killing all 298 people on board, including 38 Australian residents. Prime Minister Tony Abbott welcomed news that Australian police have accessed the crash site, but warned that a lengthy task still lay ahead. Difficult working conditions: Ukrainian soldiers inspect a car at a checkpoint near the village. Fierce fighting has prevented the team reaching the area for days . Warzone: A Ukrainian serviceman takes the opportunity to sleep at a checkpoint near the crash site . He could not say how many bodies had been recovered overnight, nor how many more could lay undiscovered in the 50 square kilometre search area. 'It will be a long and slow process and I expect our officials will be on site for a week or so yet and that's assuming nothing goes wrong,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. He said police are working under difficult and dangerous conditions in a high-risk environment but that their efforts are justified by the importance of the task. Remains will be taken to the Netherlands as quickly as possible but the prime minister added delays are still likely. 'By way of possible parallel, after the Bali bombing it was some three weeks before the first victims were identified and some five months before the last victim was identified and brought home.'","International team spends five hours combing area of Ukraine farmland .

And yesterday, as he reached his landmark 65th birthday, he fulfilled his official duties in India with his usual style and bonhomie. As he walked along bustling Jew Street in the city of Cochin, Kerala, he stopped in his tracks when he heard an English voice serenading him with a tuneful version of Happy Birthday from a balcony. Scroll down for video . Charles threw a rose up to one British holidaymaker who serenaded him with a rendition of Happy Birthday . Trish Lewis (top left) said she felt 'so thrilled and flattered' after Prince Charles threw her a rose . Prince Charles cuts his 65th Birthday cake as Camilla looks on during a reception at the British High Commission . Charles waited until Trish Lewis finished singing and then threw her a gift-wrapped red rose a well-wisher had given him. After a little scrabbling, and to the prince’s cheers, the holidaymaker managed to grab the flower. ‘We couldn’t believe we were coming half way round the world and here they are,’ said Mrs Lewis, who sings with The Panda Players back home in Wendover, Bucks. ‘I feel so thrilled and flattered he threw me a rose. How wonderful. I just can’t believe it.’ As well as flowers, the prince was the recipient of no fewer than six birthday cakes yesterday – the last following a 75-minute flight from India to Sri Lanka. At the High Commission in Colombo he was presented with a large carrot cake decorated with the Prince of Wales feathers. A Metropolitan Police protection officer had to . hastily move Prince Charles away after his jacket almost caught alight . on the 100-year-old burner lit with 65 flaming wicks in honour of his . birthday . The Royal couple were cheered by hundreds of wellwishers as they walked along the bustling Jew Street and some sang Happy Birthday to the prince . Prince Charles offered 'namaste' - or greetings - to people on Jew Street as he walked past a poster of himself . The cake was so moist the slice he cut off fell from his knife. Undeterred, he offered a morsel to his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and popped one into his own mouth in front of a cheering crowd of wellwishers. Back in Kerala, his staff had teased him with a cake in the shape of a free bus pass, which he can now claim as a pensioner. Marked with Westminster Council, it said: ‘HRH Prince Charles. Valid from 14 Nov 2013. Concessionary travel funded by HM Government with your local authority. Happy 65th Birthday!’ Everywhere he went he was the centre of attention – on walkabouts,  pressing the flesh and allowing himself to be festooned with flowers in ancient Cochin. A birthday message for Prince Charles that was put on a building wall on Jew Street . The Prince throws a flower into a giant cooking bowl big enough to feed 6,000 people . Camilla carried a parasol and a fan during as they arrived at the Jewish Synagogue in Kochi . For most people reaching the age of 65, such a relaxing and carefree day would be a fitting way to start slipping into a comfortable retirement. But for the prince it marks the beginning of something more profound. With his mother the Queen now in her 88th year, he is likely to be asked to assume more and more of her duties as head of state. His mission now – with his chosen consort Camilla at his side – is to prove himself a worthy king-in-waiting. His first task – opening the Commonwealth Heads of Government conference in Sri Lanka today – is at best a challenge, at worst a diplomatic minefield. Canada, India, and Mauritius have boycotted the meeting in protest at Sri Lanka’s alleged human rights abuses against its Tamil minority and the atmosphere in Colombo is crackling with tension. But keeping the Commonwealth together through monumentally difficult times in the post-colonial era is one of his mother’s proudest achievements. It is now up to Charles to show the same leadership and qualities of conciliation. The Royal couple received a garland of flower each before being given a tour of the synagogue . The Duchess was trying to keep herself cool during the string of engagements today . A small boy is held up by his father as places a garland of flowers over Prince Charles's head . Clarence House has refused to comment on whether Charles plans to raise in private the human rights issue with Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa but Amnesty’s Steve Crawshaw urged him to take action. ‘Prince Charles is clearly in a difficult position representing the Queen who famously avoids politics in all contexts,’ he said. ‘But I very much hope that in private Prince Charles will make absolutely clear how dismayed anybody who cares about human rights would be, seeing what is happening in Sri Lanka today. ‘As the representative of the Queen he will no doubt choose his words carefully when speaking publicly, but I hope that even there we will see a reflection and understanding of how serious the problems are that Sri Lanka is facing, and one would hope that will not be swept under the carpet.’ Charles tastes into his 65th birthday cake which had been decorated with the Prince of Wales feathers . After landing in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Prince Charles toasts the assembled crowd after having come carrot cake . The prince started his birthday in the £500 a night presidential suite of the luxury Kumarakom Lake Resort, situated on the banks of the Vembanad Lake, a vast stretch of tranquil, emerald green backwaters. It wasn’t quite the romantic getaway his wife might have hoped. Thirty rooms were booked by the royal party and close to 400 police officers took over the security of the resort. On waking up Charles was presented with cake number one featuring a portrait of himself and his wife. He cut a slice to enjoy on his plane later and arranged for the rest be sent to a local orphanage. The Prince of Wales (centre) is presented with a birthday cake topped by three Elephants, by the President of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa (left) and his wife Shiranthi (right) at the Presidents Palace in Colombo, Sri Lanka . After that, however, it was very much business as usual with a break-neck string of engagements – another example of what his wife affectionately described in yesterday’s Mail as her exhausting, workaholic husband. At a souvenir shop Charles almost set himself alight on a 100-year-old oil burner that had been lit with 65 wicks to honour his big day. One of his Metropolitan Police protection officers lunged forwards to stop the prince’s clothing catching alight but slipped on the shop’s highly polished doorstep and stumbled against his boss – to comic effect. It was also to Charles’s relief because of the intense heat from the wicks – and the Indian sun. The prince woke up to a view like no other to start his birthday at the £500-a-night Presidential Suite at the luxury Kumarakom Lake Resort in rural Kerala . Prince Charles stayed in the £500-a-night presidential suite, which is a by-word for royal seclusion . The luxury stay was not quite the romantic getaway Camilla might have hoped for as 30 rooms were booked by the royal party and close to 400 police officers took over the security of the resort .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Fierce fighting raged in Donetsk today as Ukrainian government forces closed in on the rebel stronghold while pro-Russian insurgents backed away from an unconditional cease-fire offer that they announced just the day before. Following a string of military successes and with the broad support of the West, as well as many Ukrainians, Kiev has taken a hard line against the rebel forces and has promised it will only relent when the separatists surrender. Few civilians in Donetsk dared to venture outside tonight as explosions rang out every few minutes and burnt-out buses and buildings smoldered from the night before. Scroll down for video . Raging: Ukrainian soldiers take up positions during fighting against militants, near Ilovaysk town, outside Donetsk, Ukraine, as government forces closed in on the rebel stronghold . Orders: Ukrainian soldiers are briefed by their commander before fighting commences against militant in Ilovaysk today . Briefing: Ukrainian government forces have narrowed the ring around Luhansk and the other rebel stronghold Donetsk, as artillery attacks continue in the region . Open fire: Ukrainian soldiers cover their ears from the noise, after firing a mortar during fighting against militants . In a statement made on Saturday, newly elected rebel leader Aleksandr Zakharchenko had appeared to call for a cease-fire without stating any preconditions. However, today rebel spokesman Elena Nikitina repeated the rebels' earlier stance, saying that talks on the conflict could only begin if the Ukrainian army withdrew from the region - which Kiev is unlikely to do. She also denounced the government as 'incapable of negotiating.' Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that the only way for the rebels in Donetsk to save their lives would be to 'lay down their arms and give up.' He said the Ukrainian side hadn't seen the rebels show any real willingness to cooperate. Blast: An Ukrainian soldier watches an explosion during fighting against militants. pro-Russian insurgents backed away from an unconditional cease-fire offer that they announced just yesterday . Prepare to fire: Ukrainian soldiers load a mortar as part of their push against pro-Russia militants in Donetsk . Taking aim: A Ukrainian sniper takes aim during fighting. Following a string of military successes and with the broad support of the West and many Ukrainians, Kiev has taken a hard line against the rebel forces and has promised it will only relent when the separatists surrender . Armed: An armed Ukrainian soldier, his face hidden by a scarf, rides on a military jeep before the fighting in Ilovaysk started . Duck and cover: A soldier takes cover and puts his fingers in his ears to block out the noise after firing a mortar . Support: Ukrainian soldiers carry their injured comrade on a stretcher after he was hurt during fighting today . 'If white flags come up and they lay down their arms, nobody is going to shoot at them,' he said. '(But) we have not seen any practical steps yet, just a statement."" Mr Lysenko added that the Ukrainian military's recent successes in encircling Donetsk, the largest rebel stronghold in eastern Ukraine, had bred 'panic and chaos in the ranks of the rebels,' and said the Kiev government had information about rebels 'deserting their posts en masse.' According to city council spokesman Maxim Rovinsky, at least one person was killed and ten injured in shelling overnight, as more than ten residential buildings, a hospital and a shop were heavily damaged in the fighting. Mr Rovinsky said that he believed 100,000 people had left the city of one million in the past week alone - adding to the 300,000 who were already estimated to have fled. He said at least 10,000 people were without electricity, and that the local government was working hard to preserve access to gas, electricity, and phone service and 'avoid a humanitarian crisis.' More than 1,300 people have died in the conflict since April, according to a U.N. estimate. Time to flee: A man runs out of a building destroyed by shelling in Donetsk as fighting raged in the eastern Ukrainian city . Fire fighting: Few civilians in Donetsk dared to venture outside tonight as explosions rang out every few minutes and burnt-out buses and buildings smoldered from the night before . Injuries: According to city council spokesman Maxim Rovinsky, at least one person was killed and ten injured in shelling overnight . Damage: More than ten residential buildings, a hospital and a shop were heavily damaged in the fighting, as was this building which was destroyed by fire . 'This is a real war. It's impossible to live in this city, I've been sleeping in the basement for the past week,' said lawyer, Inna Drobyshevskaya, 48, who lives in the city. 'We don't want Novorossiya (New Russia) for this price,' she added, referring to a term used by rebels to describe the parts of eastern Ukraine seeking independence from the government in Kiev. Rebel leader Mr Zakharchenko's apparent call for a cease-fire Saturday was met with support from Russia, where Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by news agency ITAR TASS as saying a truce was 'not only possible, but necessary.' 'We believe the question is urgent and there can be no delay, and the issue is under the control of the Russian president,' he said. Mr Lavrov said that Russia was reaching out to the Red Cross and the U.N. to discuss the possibility of delivering humanitarian aid to the region. After the fighting: A firefighter puts out a blaze which destroyed several buses in the city. Civilians caught up in the fighting described Donetsk as 'impossible to live in' Cut off: At least 10,000 people are reportedly without electricity, and that a local government spokesman said leaders were working hard to preserve access to gas, electricity, and phone service and 'avoid a humanitarian crisis' Accusations: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Western leaders have repeatedly accused Russia of providing arms and expertise to the rebels, something Russia denies . Left behind: A  firefighter stands next to a huge shell crater, while a number of burnt out buses can be seen behind him . However, the rebels' request was met warily by government officials in Kiev and in the West. Those leaders expressed concern that the move could be aimed at increasing international pressure on Ukraine to allow in a Russian aid mission. The West says that could be used as a pretext to bring Russian soldiers into Ukraine - and says 20,000 of them are massed near the Russian border with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Western leaders have repeatedly accused Russia of providing arms and expertise to the rebels, something Russia denies. He issued a statement late Saturday saying that Ukraine was prepared to accept humanitarian assistance in eastern Ukraine. But he said the aid must come in without military assistance, pass through border checkpoints under Ukrainian control and be an international mission. Mr Poroshenko said he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed German participation in such a mission. Time to go: Smoke from the shelling rises over blocks of flats in Donetsk. 100,000 people are thought to have left the city in the past week alone . Plea: Rebel leader Mr Zakharchenko's apparent call for a cease-fire Saturday was met with support from Russia, where Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by news agency ITAR TASS as saying a truce was 'not only possible, but necessary' On the warpath: Pro-Russian rebels, dressed in camouflage and armed with weapons, drive down a road in Donetsk on a tank . Seeking shelter: Donetsk residents sit inside a bomb shelter where they are seeking refuge during shelling . On Sunday, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmer expressed 'great concern' that the humanitarian situation for civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk is getting worse. He said Germany is already working with the ICRC and U.N. agencies to ensure that existing aid is coordinated and gets delivered where it is needed. He said was 'good that there seems to be basic agreement about the delivery of humanitarian goods between Ukraine and Russia,' but added that Russian aid 'must only be delivered with the express agreement of the Ukrainian government' and under the supervision of international organizations. In Washington, the White House said President Barack Obama and Merkel agreed that any Russian intervention in Ukraine was unacceptable and would violate international law. Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron, meanwhile, 'expressed grave concern about reports that Russian military vehicles have crossed the border into Ukraine and that Russian armed forces are exercising for a ""humanitarian intervention"",' according to Cameron's office. Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine was the power base for former President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled office in February after months of anti-government protests kicked off by his decision to scuttle an association agreement with the EU in favor of closer ties with Moscow. Fighting in the east began in April, one month after Russia annexed Ukraine's Black Sea region of Crimea.

"By . Emma Innes . Long-term use of commonly prescribed heartburn drugs increases the likelihood B vitamin deficiency . Long-term use of commonly prescribed heartburn drugs increases the likelihood B vitamin deficiency, a study has shown. Lack of vitamin B12 can increase the risk of dementia, nerve damage, anaemia and other conditions, some of which may be irreversible. Scientists who studied a large population of U.S. patients found an association between taking some antacid medications and diagnosis vitamin B12 deficiency. Stomach acids are known to aid vitamin B12 absorption. Suppressing the acids, to combat heartburn and acid reflux, or treat ulcers, may lead to a health-threatening lack of the vitamin in the body, the researchers believe. The study is the first large population-based investigation linking vitamin B12 deficiency to antacid drugs known as protein pump inhibitors (PPIs). Examples of these medications include esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole. Researchers from Kaiser Permanente, a leading U.S. health provider, compared data on almost 26,000 patients diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency in northern California with more than 184,000 ‘control’ patients who were not B12 deficient. ‘Patients who took PPI medications for more than two years had a 65 per cent increase in their risk of B12 deficiency,’ said study leader Dr Douglas Corley, a gastroenterologist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research. ‘Higher doses also were associated with an increased risk, compared with lower doses. ‘Kaiser Permanente's electronic health records allowed us to look at what happens in the real world for these commonly used medications.’ Among the vitamin deficient patients, 12 per cent had used antacids for at least two years. A related class of antacid drugs called histamine-2-receptor agonists (H2RAs) were also associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, but to a lesser extent. Lack of vitamin B12 can increase the risk of dementia, nerve damage, anaemia and other conditions, some of which may be irreversible . The findings are reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr Corley added: ‘This research raises the question of whether people who are taking acid-depressing medications long term should be screened for vitamin B12 deficiency. ‘It's a relatively simple blood test, and vitamin supplements are an effective way of managing the vitamin deficiency, if it is found.’","Long-term use of antacids can cause vitamin B12 deficiency .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Fisher-Price is facing a backlash over its decision to sell a baby bouncy seat with an attachment where parents can insert an iPad to keep their newborns entertained. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a Boston-based advocacy group, wants the company to recall its Newborn-to-Toddler Apptivity Seat for iPads. The group says it's not healthy for a baby's development and encourages parents to leave baby alone. Outrage: Fisher Price faced a heavy backlash last December when it introduced this iPad-enabled baby bouncing seat, pictured. Experts warned it could affect development and limit parent-child interaction . Demanding a recall: Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is calling on Fisher-Price to immediately stop selling its Newborn-to-Toddler Apptivity¿ Seat for iPad® device . The seat is angering parents and child advocates who say the introduction of screen technology so early is harmful to the health and development of babies and claim Fisher-Price’s seat hits a new low. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood today began a letter writing campaign against the $75 product, calling it 'oppressive and destructive to young children,' while also naming it the worst toy of the year. Fisher-Price’s iPad seat is the 'ultimate electronic babysitter, whose very existence suggests that it’s fine to leave babies as young as newborns all alone and with an iPad inches from their face,' said Susan Linn, director of child advocacy group the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC). 'Fisher-Price should stay true to its mission to foster learning and development by creating products for infants that promote, rather than undermine, interaction with caregivers,' Ms Linn said. How it works: The Apptivity Seat is a bouncy seat for infants with a place for an iPad directly above the baby¿s face. Critics say it blocks his or her view of the rest of the world . There is an equal amount of outrage . aimed at a similar product aimed at potty-training toddlers . which mounts an iPad in infront of a child who is learning to use the . toilet. Both efforts ask . for the products to be recalled under the guise that they could harm . developmental learning of body cues, and socialization. Victor . Strasburger, a doctor and professor of pediatrics at the University of . New Mexico School of Medicine said attaching iPads to babies’ seats is . 'a terrible idea.' 'Does . anyone out there think that kids need more screen time?” Strasburger . asked. “There is no need to hurry to expose kids to new technology, . certainly not babies — or newborns!' A doctor who spoke to ABC is weary about how it might affect babies. ‘I think parents need to be really careful here,’ said Dr. Richard Besser. He . explained that toddler’s brains go through changes and a lot of . development in early years before explaining that the real world, not . the virtual one, is where babies belong. Virtual babysitter: More than half of U.S. parents have admitted that they use tech gadgets to entertain their children when they are busy . Other options: The arm can be removed to 'disable' the iPad-holding feature . ‘The . best thing for a child is extensive interaction with people, hearing . voices, seeing faces, physically touching toys,’ he said. ‘I worry that . screens will replace these important human interactions.’ Fisher-Price describes the seat on its Web site as 'a grow-with-me seat . for baby that’s soothing, entertaining, and has a touch of technology, . too.' Mattel is already . under pressure by the CCFC and other advocacy groups that have . complained to the Federal Trade Commission that Fisher-Price’s mobile . Apptivity suite of apps deceives consumers with promised educational . benefits despite little research having been done to prove that online . sites can help babies’ brain development. Parent company Mattel has kept quiet on the matter so far. The . slew of new baby-tech products has drawn criticism from parents . blasting CTA and Fisher-Price in Amazon.com’s customer-review sections. Fisher-Price’s seat had more than 100 reviews, the majority negative. One . customer wrote: 'I am disgusted with Fisher Price and urge Amazon to . reconsider carrying this terrible contraption!! First of all children . need to be able to move and putting them on the floor (on rugs or mats) is the best way they can freely move and explore their world. Secondly, . the American Pediatric Association recommends NO SCREEN TIME for babies . under 2. Babies need . to move to understand and explore their world and they need to . manipulate things, not passively watch them! It has NO redeeming . features, it is actually detrimental to children 's growth and . development!! For shame Fisher Price - you have stooped to new lows (and . there are lots of them).' Other . reviewers wrote similar scathing remarks: 'This has to be one of the . worst ideas for a baby product that I have ever seen. Babies under six . months of age should NEVER be strapped in and forced to stare at a . screen pulsing images in front of them. Not only is it horrible for vision and brain development, but it . encourages irresponsible parenting as well. The American Academy of . Pediatrics recommends ZERO screen time for children under the age of . two.' Bathroom reading: There have also been complaints about this potty-training device that comes complete with room for an iPad . As companies rush to . integrate technology into toys, baby gear and classrooms, doctors and . child advocates say children today are immersed more than ever in a . world of screens and thatt constant access to games, television and the . Internet may be taking away from family time, exercise and discovery in . the physical world, critics say. It's not the first time Fisher Price has been in the hot seat for a high-tech baby toy. Last year the company picked up the same worst toy award from the group for a stuffed monkey toy that mounted an iPhone in the belly area, and ran special Fisher Price apps.","Campaign for Commercial Free Childhood say Fisher Price should 'stay true to its mission' to promote interaction .

"By . Becky Evans . They may not be the usual tourist sports but for one urban explorer these abandoned buildings are the ideal holiday destinations. Photographer Dan Marbaix has travelled around the world to take pictures of the beautiful buildings that have been largely forgotten. However, his hobby is a dangerous one and he has been arrested 20 times for trespass in just five years. Scroll down for video . Abandoned: Urban explorer Dan Marbaix has travelled around the world taking pictures of unusual derelict buildings such as this decaying doctor's house in Germany . Stunning: The Chambre du Commerce in Belgium is a huge draw for urban explorers. The building, in Antwep, was erected in 1872 as a reconstruction of a 1531 Stock Exchange. It ceased being used in 2003 after failing to meet fire safety regulations and lay abandoned for seven years until a series of renovation plans were put forward. A private investor wants to turn the building into shops, a grand cafe, restaurants and a luxirous hotel. Renovation work on the outside of the building has begun. Hidden gems: The photographer often has to squeeze through windows and gaps in buildings or climb up walls to get in to abandoned rooms like this Belgian theatre . Left in a hurry? Hundreds of books have been left on the shelves in this but abandoned UK manor house but the wallpaper is ripped and the ceiling has partly collapsed . Industrial: The original Abbey Mills Pumping Station in East London was built in 1868. Now replaced by a modern sewage pumping station, Abbey Mills is used as a film location and represented Arkham Asylum in Batman Begins . Mr Marbaix has gained unique access to some of the rarest places in the world and uses any method he can to do so.The 33-year-old photographer creeps, . ducks, climbs, scrambles and squeezes his way into abandoned sites and . buildings to get unparalleled holiday experiences - even having to . sidestep security at times. But for all the times he’s been arrested or given a stern telling off from police, he insists it’s all worth it. Mr Marbaix, of London, said: 'I’ve seen sneaking around places I shouldn’t have been in since I was a teenager but have been more focussed in the past five years. Place of worship: Two religious statues - in almost perfect condition - still stand in this abandoned Belgian monastery . Former glory: The National Gas Turbine Establishment in Hampshire, known simply as Pyestock, was once an iconic site of British engineering but has been neglected since its closure in 2000. It is now scheduled for demolition but, in its heyday after the Second World War, it was at the forefront of gas turbine and jet engine research . Eerie: Mr Marbaix said despite the creepiness of buildings like the Masonic Boys School, in the UK (left), and a city hall in Germany (right), he is not interested in 'ghouls' Dangerous hobby: The photographer said he has previously been held at gunpoint by Italian police after trespassing to take pictures of abandoned buildings like this villa in Italy . School's out forever: This beautiful building was once filled with British schoolchildren but is now slowly decaying . 'I enjoy seeing what most people don’t . get to see when they go abroad and the buzz of getting into the . buildings. I used to work in the city so the peace and quiet of an . abandoned building and the lack of people getting in my photos were also . things I enjoyed about it. 'I started to meet people who did the same thing and before you know it you’re going most weekends.' The photographer jumps in his car with a basic idea of where he’s heading and off he goes. He has travelled through Italy, Germany, Austria, Holland and America enjoying his passion for urban exploring. Mysterious: Little is known about the ornate Chateau Lumiere in France but it is regularly visited by urban explorers fascinated by its decaying splendour . Left behind: This vintage Singer sewing machine has been left in the chateau with a cotton reel still attached to the top . All that remains: Objects like the stuffed pheasant at a Belgian villa (left) and the shoes left in front of the burner at a hunting lodge (right), give clues to the former owners . Macarbe: The green bed screens are still pulled across in this abanonded ward in West Park Mental Hospital in Epsom, Surrey. Built in 1923, the hospital was slowly run down from the mid-1990s and most of the buildings closed in 2003 . Untouched: ECVB power station in Ghent, Belgium, was hugely popular with urban explorers wanting to capture on film the huge rusting machinery but it is now being pulled down by the authorities . Despite the unbeatable views, Mr Marbaix insists the biggest adrenaline rush is avoiding getting caught. He . said: 'I rarely get spooked when I visit rotting and neglected places - . I’m not really into the ghouls and ghost side of it - but you do get an . increase in heart rate when hiding from security and they get within . metres of you. 'In the UK there's not a great deal police can do as long as you don’t break in or steal anything as trespassing is a civil offence. Once a home: The ornate twin beds at this Belgian chateau are still intact but the wallpaper has peeled and the floor is covered in rubble . Beautiful: Sammazzano Castle, in Tuscany, Italy, (left) is one of the most spectacular captured by the photographer. It is commonly known as Non Plus Ultra - meaning 'nothing further beyond' - because the words are decorated inside. Built in 1605, it is filled with dazzling Moorish designs and mosaics. It's ornate designs are in contrast to the stark, giant walls of this Belgian cooling tower (right) Creepy: This atmospheric picture of a derelict Belgian hunting lodge looks like it could have come straight out of a horror film . Holy site: The stunning mural can be seen on the far wall of this Belgian church but it seems to have been abandoned by its congregation . 'But in the U.S. it’s illegal to . trespass so the stakes are a little higher and if you do get caught it . all depends on the country and the mood the police are in. 'It’s . ranged from a chat and being allowed around the building to lying on . the floor as a policeman holds a submachine gun and shouts angrily in . Italian. 'Generally always just ends in a bit of a telling off.' Glorious: This dome sits on top of the former Beelitz-Heilstätten sanitorium in Germany, where Hitler recuperated after his World War One injury. From 1945 to 1995 it was used as a Red Army hospital but attempts to privatise it after the Soviet withdrawal were not wholly successful. While some buildings are still in use, the surgery, psychiatric ward and rife range were all abandoned . Glimpse into the past: Lights and a table still covered with a white sheet remain at this UK hospital (left) and candlesticks and glass vases and mirrors have just been left in this Belgian chateau . Industrial beauty: No one has ever removed this blast furnace in Belgium, which remains standing in almost the same condition as when it was used . Frozen in time: Some abandoned buildings such as Hospital Diablo in France has fallen foul of metal thieves and vandals .","Photographer Dan Marbaix has travelled around the world to capture some of the most beautiful abandoned buildings .

Coming soon: Passengers will be able to text while in-flight . ‘There is strong demand for this service and the ability to text in flight,’ Brad Jaehn, vice president, told CNBC. ‘We think a lot of our users will want to have the option to text while in flight.’ The service will work on just about any android or Apple smartphone. Users access it by downloading an app that links to Gogo’s network already in place on over 2,000 planes spanning nine domestic airlines, according to USA Today. ‘We can just turn on the application... on any plane that's already been Gogo-ized,’ a spokesperson told The Verge. Gogo’s network becomes active when a plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet or more. The app will able to be downloaded from either the Apple App Store or Google Play, and is available in several different languages, USA Today noted. Staying connected: Busy travelers will soon be able to text away once above 10.000 feet . Surveys taken by Gogo show strong demand for text messaging during flights, but there has been less enthusiasm about sharing flights with people rambling on their phones from take-off to landing, according to a spokesperson. ‘We see this as more of a text messaging product for commercial airlines in the United States, the phone functionality is something that some international air carriers and our business aviation customers are asking for,’ a spokesperson told The Verge. Skype and other VOIP services are already blocked from being used on Gogo’s in-flight networks, The Verge noted. ‘Currently in North America our nine airlines partners have no interest in enabling voice calls because of the social stigma that it ultimately introduces,’ the spokesperson told USA Today. A test flight last week resulted in mixed reviews of the voice call service, but mostly positive impressions of the ability to send text messages, reports said. Pricing has not yet been hashed out, but it may be similar to the daily, monthly and annual plans offered by Gogo for its in-flight internet service. The vendor aims to launch the new service in the first quarter of next year, according to reports.","The service will be available early next year through in-flight internet vender Gogo .

"By . James Slack . High court bid: Terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, who is on the run after fleeing in a burka, has submitted a human rights claim . Burka-wearing fugitive Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed provoked fury last night by demanding up to £1million in compensation from the taxpayer in yet another human rights fiasco. To astonishment at Westminster, the High Court yesterday ruled the terror suspect can make a claim for civil damages using legal aid – despite being on the run. It came as Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, told a public hearing that the intelligence agencies had been ‘sickened’ by terrorists getting large payouts through unfounded compensation claims. Mohamed alleges he was ill-treated after his arrest in Somaliland in 2011. The jihadist, linked to the murderous Al Shabaab gang, is suspected of receiving terror training overseas and plotting attacks against western interests. But his lawyers claim he was mistreated by his Somaliland interrogators with the knowledge of British security agents and are demanding huge sums in compensation for breach of Labour’s Human Rights Act. The fact Mohamed is on the run – after cutting off his tagging device at a London mosque last Friday –  has not halted the case. The terror suspect was referred to in court papers as ‘MA’ but anonymity was lifted yesterday following his disappearance. A second compensation claim is being made by another alleged jihadist, known only by the initials CF. The case sparked incredulity at Westminster and new demands for the scrapping of the Human Rights Act. If Mohamed is ever caught, he will still be entitled to pocket any award of compensation. Senior Tory backbencher Sir Gerald Howarth said the claim was a farce. ‘The abuse of the human rights legislation has now reached such offensive proportions that I think we will have to consider repealing it in this Parliament,’ he said. Case: The fugitive was allegedly held in Somaliland, Somalia, in 2001, four years after he arrived there (file picture) He added: ‘What are the courts doing? Some seem to live on another planet.’ Tory backbencher Philip Hollobone said: ‘The British public is fed up to the back teeth of Muslim terror suspects trying it on with the British justice system. 'It is yet further evidence of why we need to leave the European Convention on Human Rights so we can properly seal our borders against such people.’ Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s important that British security services are properly scrutinised, but with Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed absconding this case should surely be halted before any further costs to taxpayers are incurred.’ Mohamed travelled to Somaliland to undergo terrorist training in 2007. CF travelled there two years later. Both were detained by authorities in Somaliland on January 14, 2011 and held until their removal back to the UK on March 14 that year. Links: Fugitive terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, pictured left, is said to be know the White Widow, Samantha Lewthwaite, pictured right . They say they were tortured and mistreated during their detention and claim the Government is liable to pay them damages under the 1998 Human Rights Act for complicity in their alleged ill-treatment. Mohamed alleges that British authorities knew he was about to be arrested and that this was demonstrated by the Home Secretary’s application for a control order against him ‘as a precaution’ prior to his detention. An order was sanctioned by High Court judge Mr Justice Silber on January 13, 2011. Mohamed has lodged claims against the Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Defence and the Attorney General. An estimated £30million has already been paid to at least 16 terror suspects who claim the security services were complicit in their ill-treatment. The cases of Mohamed and CF will be heard partially in secret, the High Court ruled yesterday. The Government denies acting unlawfully in relation to their detention in Somaliland and says both men lack credibility, and no weight can be placed on their evidence. Caught on CCTV: Mohamed entered the An-Noor . Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in Acton, west London, at 10am. He . was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a . burka (right) Yesterday, in evidence to Parliament’s Security and Intelligence Committee, head of MI6 Sir John Sawers said intelligence agency staff had been ‘sickened’ by some of the compensation payouts made to terror suspects. He said the security services had been unable to defend themselves  against the allegations, which they denied, in open court. The hearing was the first time the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ had given evidence in public. Legal sources said legal aid for Mohamed could be withdrawn if he is not caught. Solicitors must be able to show they are taking instruction from their client to be entitled to state support.","Al Qaeda-trained Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed gave police the slip after cutting off his tag and disguising himself with a full-body cloak in mosque .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A man and a woman have died after a light aircraft crashed near a runway at manufacturers Airbus UK this afternoon. The male pilot died instantly and his female passenger died later in hospital after the crash, which is believed to have happened as their light aircraft was coming in to land at Hawarden Airport in Flintshire, north Wales. North Wales Police were informed of the incident involving a twin-engine aircraft in Broughton at about 1.10pm today. Police were called to the scene at Hawarden Airport at about 1.10pm, where the wreckage was found . Friends of Mr Vickers and Ms Clarke said they were returning from a Paris shopping trip when the plane crashed . A police spokesman said: 'The man was pronounced dead at the scene and the woman was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital where she later died.' North Wales Fire and Rescue Service sent three appliances to the scene but the wreckage of the aircraft just yards off the runway was tackled by on-site firefighters from the nearby Airbus factory. Crash location: The aircraft crashed onto the runway at Chester Hawarden Airport in north Wales . One worker said: 'The pilot was in trouble and there was a crash landing at the airport. It is a terrible tragedy.' Engineer Owen Reid, who witnessed the accident, wrote on Twitter: 'I was in the car park as it came in and saw the whole thing.  It looked pretty bad.' The man and woman have not yet been formally identified, and no-one else was onboard. A spokesman for Airbus said the crash at the Hawarden airfield did not involve one of its aircraft. Police said a full investigation would be undertaken to establish the full circumstances of the incident. A spokesman for the Air Accidents Investigation Bureau (AAIB) said: 'We have deployed a team to the airport to investigate.' Chester Hawarden Airport lies near the Welsh border with England, four miles south-west of Chester, and has a large Airbus factory which produces aircraft wings. During the Second World War Hawarden was a maintenance base for RAF aircraft.","Two die after light aircraft crashes at Chester Hawarden Airport, Wales .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . As adults it's easy to voice what we don't enjoy eating - we can actively say we don't want it or scrape the undesired morsel to the edge of our plate. For babies it is harder to voice a preference - until now. Engineers from the Thrill Laboratory have developed the world's first 'Baby Thrill-O-Meter' that measures a child’s physiological reaction to certain vegetables, fruits and spices, and in doing so gives parents an idea of what their children like - or don't like - to munch on. Scroll down to video . Engineer Brendan Walker, pictured, attached sensors to the feet of babies and fed them foods including mangoes, carrots and lemons. The Thrill-O-Meter, pictured, tracked changes in each child's Galvanic Skin Response. This response is caused by an emotional reaction to the food . 1.Mango . 2.Cinnamon . 3.Lemon . 4.Coconut . 5.Banana . 6.Papaya . 7.Red pepper . 8.Apricot . 9.Sweet potato . 10.Carrot . It uses sensors on the baby’s feet to track changes in their Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). These responses are caused by an increase in sweat levels that change the skin’s ability to conduct electricity. Reponses are triggered by an emotional reaction to stimuli, which in this case were the different foods. The Thrill-O-Meter was created by engineer Brendan Walker in partnership with baby food experts Ella’s Kitchen. GSR sensors were placed on the feet of seven babies as they sat in a highchair. The results were calculated by analysing increased Galvanic Skin Response from certain foods, combined with facial expression and body language analysis to determine how positive the child's response was. The food which produced the most positive physiological reaction in the babies was mango, pictured . At the bottom of the list were foods in which the flavours aren't as distinctive as those at the top. This included sweet potatoes, pictured, in ninth place . These sensors were then connected to the Thrill-O-Meter machine which tracked micro-fluctuations in sweat levels. When a baby was excited by a certain food or taste, their sweat levels, and ultimately their Galvanic Skin Response, increased. The . higher the score on the Thrill-O-Meter, the more excited the child was . about the food, which indicated their enjoyment of it. Walker . tested the babies’ responses to banana, lemon, cinnamon, mango, . coconut, papaya, red pepper, apricot, sweet potato and carrot. Despite its sharp taste, lemon, pictured, came third in the list of top foods the babies enjoyed, according to the Thrill-O-Meter results. Ella's Kitchen plan to use the results to improve its range of baby foods . Yet not all the babies had a positive reaction to lemon, as shown in this child's reaction to the sour fruit . The food which produced the most positive physiological reaction in the babies was mango, followed by cinnamon and then lemon. In fourth place was coconut, followed by banana and all the foods in the top five have distinctive, recognisable flavours. At the bottom of the list were food . in which the flavours aren't as distinctive, including carrot in last . place, sweet potato, apricots and red pepper. The flavour which got one of the most neutral reactions was papaya, in sixth place. Papaya, pictured left, was the sixth most popular food in the Thrill-O-Meter tests.  At the bottom of the list were foods including carrots, in last place, sweet potatoes, apricots and red peppers, pictured right . All the foods in the top five have distinctive, recognisable flavours, such as coconut, pictured, which took the fourth place spot in the Thrill-O-Meter's list of foods which excited the children the most . The skin, along with all tissue in the human body, can conduct a low-level of electricity. Nerves, . for example, transfer information from one part of the body to another . using currents and similarly, the skin also experiences slight changes . in electrical charge. These changes can be measured using sensors. A . person’s electrical conductivity can change depending on certain . situations, and these changes are known as the Galvanic Skin Response. These responses are caused by sudden changes in emotion, such as excitement or fear. The results were calculated by analysing . increased Galvanic Skin Response from certain foods, combined with . facial expression and body language analysis to determine how positive . the response was. Mr Walker said: 'Food can be really exciting for babies. It's an adventure from their first taste of coconut all the way through to their first piece of mango. When a baby becomes excited, their heart starts racing, their breathing quickens and their eyes become really large, but the things we can't see are the slight increases in their sweat level. ‘ . ‘Different food can stimulate different physiological responses and this innovative taste test reveals just how thrilling different vegetables, fruits and spices are for babies.’ Ella’s Kitchen plan to use the results to improve its range of baby foods. Other fruits the babies were given in order to gauge their emotional reaction were apricots, pictured left, and bananas, right. Bananas scored higher on the Thrill-O-Meter, in fifth place, while apricots were placed in ninth . Ella's Kitchen teamed up the Thrill Laboratory to help develop its range of baby foods and drinks.

"By . Mario Ledwith . Foreign criminals are ending up with shorter jail terms than British offenders because police are failing to carry out adequate background checks, a former intelligence chief has warned. Michael Askew, an ex-superintendent at Scotland Yard’s intelligence bureau, claimed simple checks that could flag up an offender’s criminal history overseas are being overlooked by police who are too busy. And he said UK citizens are receiving comparatively longer sentences as a result, because their offending history is always considered in court. Unfair: One in seven prisoners in Britain is a foreign national, but many receive softer sentences because police are too busy to check their past. A riot by foreign prisoners last month hit Maidstone Prison, pictured . Calling for such checks to be ‘routine’ for foreign offenders, Mr Askew pointed to a number of failings in the way police forces across the UK handle such cases. His warning follows a spate of high-profile cases in which violent offenders have travelled freely to the UK to commit brutal crimes despite their past. The alleged failures of police investigations could also increase concerns ahead of the UK’s decision to open its borders to migrants arriving from Romania and Bulgaria in January. Mr Askew said many forces were also regularly failing to act on European Arrest Warrants, and cited cutbacks as a factor in sub-standard investigations. He said that one in ten foreign nationals arrested when he worked at Scotland Yard was the subject of such a warrant, but they were not effectively investigated. Concern: Home Affairs select committee chairman Keith Vaz, pictured, will explore the issue tomorrow. He said free movement in Europe 'definitely aids crime' and courts were being left in the dark . He also pointed to legislation that suggests the failure of UK courts to check an alleged offender’s criminal history could be illegal. Speaking at a conference in Romania reported by the Times, he said: ‘Every day hundreds of foreign nationals are arrested and the police don’t always investigate the criminality of those people back in their own countries. ‘Officers are under so much pressure to move on to the next case. We are . not fully exploring intelligence opportunities and that can lead to . problems.’ ‘It is not fair that a UK national goes to court in the UK and their previous convictions are taken into account and they are given a heavy sentence.’ Mr Askew, who retired from the Metropolitan Police last year, helped to establish the police national database that allows forces to share information. A damning Government assessment published earlier this year revealed that up to one in four organised criminals targeting Britain is from overseas. The Parliamentary Home Affairs Select Committee will explore the issue tomorrow. The committee’s chairman Keith Vaz echoed Mr Askew’s comments, saying that courts are being 'left in the dark'. He said that free movement in Europe 'definitely aids crime', adding: ‘It means we are putting a lesser sentence on them than we would if we knew the whole history. It is a big worry.’","Michael Askew: Unfair that Brits are always checked but foreigners are not .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Steven Hallsworth was jailed for 18 months today after blackmailing a female colleague with lewd pictures because she wouldn't go on a date with him . An IT Executive blackmailed a female colleague by threatening to reveal intimate pictures to her terminally-ill mother because she refused a date with him, a court heard. Steven Hallsworth, 38, was described as a 'bully' by a judge today after sending anonymous text messages to the woman, threatening 'go on the game or give me money'. Hallsworth obtained the images when they were leaked online by the victim's ex-boyfriend, Aylesbury Crown Court heard. He then launched a cruel campaign of threats against the woman who he worked with. The court heard how Hallsworth sent the woman a barrage of text messages threatening to show the images to her cancer-suffering mother after she declined his offer to go out in December 2010. He even comforted the victim when she confided in him with her fears over the messages that were sent anonymously from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. When the woman suspected the 38-year-old was behind the cruel taunts, he stopped sending them until the following December. Despite pleading she 'didn't need this right now,' the victim continued to receive threats and eventually went to the police. She was also forced to reveal the ordeal to her ill mother in fear the intimate photographs would be posted to her house. Police were able to track the criminal through the phone he was using. Upon his arrest at his home in Ramsgate, Kent, officers found a laptop that stored the images in question. Hallsworth pleaded guilty before being told by Judge Francis Sheridan: 'You are a bully and you took advantage of this young girl. 'Having spoilt one Christmas, you spoilt the next one and carried on until in to the next year. The 38-year-old was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment by a judge who called him a 'bully' at Aylesbury Crown Court . 'Such is the seriousness of this crime, I sentence you to 18 months imprisonment.' Prosecutor Daniel Fugallo told the court how the victim 'started receiving text messages that called her a slag, referred to the . photographs and suggested they would be sent to her mother if she did . not pay some money. 'At this time, the complainant did not know who was sending these texts. She turned to her work colleague, the defendant, and confided in him. 'He was supportive in relation to these distressing texts that she was receiving. But, of course, he was the one sending them.' The court heard Hallsworth was 'clearly attracted' to the woman, but she had declined to go out for a drink with him. 'The complainant started to suspect this apparent friend was the sender of the text messages because some of them mentioned private matters she had mentioned to him - like the fact she had become depressed because of the texts and had started taking medication,' Mr Fugallo added. After responding with 'I don't need this. My Mum has cancer,' the victim received another message that read: 'Posted. Have a happy Christmas.' The images were described as the woman in 'various stages of undress', appearing in a tartan skirt while revealing her genitals, the court heard. The victim reported the messages to the police who were able to trace Hallsworth from the pay-as-you-go mobile phone he was using. File image . In one message, Hallsworth included one of the images saying: 'looking good aren't you'. Another threatened: 'The pictures will get sent (to your mother) one day. Are they worth anything to you?' Following his arrest in December last year, Hallsworth was interviewed and 'accepted sending the messages,' Mr Fugallo said. 'He said he started sending them to be silly because he was drunk and admitted it started because of feelings of rejection because she was not as interested in him as she was in her.' 'He said he was never after money; he just wanted to make her feel bad because she had rejected him.' His legal representative, Shelley Webster, said her client had been drinking heavily at the time following the breakdown of his relationship. 'He found himself unable to trust women and to pursue new relationships. He spoke to his friends at the time who said he should get some counseling, but he was stubborn and did not seek counselling. 'He says he is genuinely sorry. It was not personal. It was just where his head was at, at the time. 'He realises what he did was wrong,' she said. Judge Sheridan also imposed a restraining order banning Hallsworth from contacting the woman or her mother.","Steven Hallsworth threatened colleague with text messages for a year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A incredibly well-preserved example of a fossilised marine creature is set to fetch £100,000 at auction. The 6ft long ichthyosaur was discovered by a fossil hunter at low tide after rough seas tore away a section of cliff. The unnamed fossil enthusiast worked tirelessly for three days to collect the 200 million-year-old remains before expected storms would have ultimately destroyed it. The 6ft long ichthyosaur (pictured) was uncovered in the late 1990s and is now up for auction. The beasts would have looked similar to dolphins but were reptilian . He removed sections of rock from the cliffs known as Black Ven, near Lyme Regis, Dorset, and took them to local preparator Chris Moore. Mr Moore then spent hundreds of hours chipping away at the rock to expose the fossilised bones of the ichthyosaur. The result is one of the most impressive examples ever found, with the ichthyosaur in the same leaping position as when it died. Remarkably, one of its paddles on its side is preserved in 3D protruding from its body at an angle of 45 degrees. Ichthyosaurs - literally meaning 'fish-lizards' - were giant marine reptiles that resembled dolphins and thrived during much of the Mesozoic era. These huge animals rapidly diversified from being lizards with fins to developing a much more streamlined, fish-like form built for speed. One species has been calculated to have a cruising speed of 22mph (36 km/h). They first appeared approximately 245 million years ago  and at least one species survived until about 90 million years ago. The reptiles were particularly abundant in the Jurassic Period, until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by another reptilian order, the plesiosaurs, in the Cretaceous Period. The specimen, that was uncovered in the late 1990s, is now being offered for sale at Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex. It has a pre-sale estimate of 80,000 pounds but is likely to go for more. Errol Fuller, a natural history expert and curator for the auction, said: 'When you find fossils like this one them they aren’t in the state that you now see. 'A lot of the bone is covered in rock, probably is three or four very solid lumps and the finder would have had to use a wheelbarrow or something to remove it. 'It had been exposed on a ledge by rough tides and had the fossil hunter not found it itcould have been washed away and broken up very quickly. 'The fossil was prepared by Chris Moore at his workshop in Charmouth. The rock had to be drilled away very carefully, it is a painstakingly slow process. 'We are talking about a huge amount of work that has gone into preparing it.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Startling new research has revealed just how vulnerable our planet is to asteroid impacts. A trio of former astronauts has announced we’re up to ten times more likely to be hit than previously thought - and warn the only way we’ve avoided disaster so far is through 'blind luck'. However, the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Scroll down for video . New research suggests Earth is hit by up to ten times as many asteroids than was previously thought - and we've only avoided a 'city-killer' so far through 'blind luck.' However, the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . The announcement was made at a press conference at the Seattle Museum of Flight. Asteroids hitting the Earth caused 26 nuclear-scale explosions between 2000 and 2013, a new report has revealed. Some . were more powerful, and in one case, dozens of times stronger, than the . 15-kiloton atom bomb blast that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. The . impacts were recorded by the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation which . operates a global network of sensors listening out for nuclear weapon . detonations. Most occurred too high in the atmosphere to cause any serious damage on the ground. But the evidence is a sobering reminder of how vulnerable the Earth is to the threat from space, say scientists. The . most dramatic impact by an asteroid or comet in recent times occurred . when an object exploded over Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908 with an energy . yield equivalent to between 5,000 and 15,000 tons of TNT. An area of forest covering 770 square miles (2,000 square km) was flattened by the blast. Three former astronauts supporting the B612 Foundation - a private company devoted to protecting Earth from asteroids - presented the data. Dr Ed Lu, former U.S. Shuttle and Soyuz astronaut, and CEO of the B612 Foundation, was joined by fellow former astronauts Tom Jones and Bill Anders, the latter of whom flew on Apollo 8. The findings are based on information released from the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation. This operates a network of sensors that monitor Earth around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations. But what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions, but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale. Between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on Earth ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons – all caused by asteroid impacts. By comparison, the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 exploded with an energy impact of 15 kilotons, which was enough to level the city and kill around 80,000 people. In the video the B612 Foundation points out 26 explosions all over the world in the last 13 years that are thought to be the result of asteroid impacts ranging in size from one to 600 kilotons . Dr Edward Lu, pictured, is a former Nasa astronaut who flew on the Space Shuttle, Soyuz and International Space Station. He is now the CEO of B612 Foundation and works alongside other former astronauts . The explosions detected on Earth, believed to have been caused by asteroids, were up to 40 times as powerful as the nuclear bomb that devastated Hiroshima in 1945, pictured . The discovery signifies a ten-fold increase on the number of large asteroids that were previously thought to strike Earth, and the astronauts claim Earth is incredibly lucky to have avoided a major disaster occurring so far. Dr Lu said ‘most large asteroids with the potential to destroy an entire country or continent have been detected.’ But, he went on to say, ‘less than 10,000 of the more than a million dangerous asteroids with the potential to destroy an entire major metropolitan area have been found by all existing space or terrestrially-operated observatories. ‘Because we don’t know where or when the next major impact will occur, the only thing preventing a catastrophe from a ""city-killer"" sized asteroid has been blind luck.’ Despite the majority of impacts occurring in water and high up in the atmosphere, a number have taken place on land. For example, the Chelyabinsk meteorite, contrail pictured, flew above the Russian city in 2013. The impact injured hundreds of people and served as a reminder of how deadly incoming space rocks can be . This map shows the locations where asteroids have hit the planet from 3.5 million years ago up to 2013 . The solution, according to the B612 Foundation, is to build an early warning infrared space telescope for tracking asteroids. This would come in the form of their Sentinel Space Telescope Mission, which would let experts track potentially deadly asteroids many years in advance, when they are still millions of miles away. This would be the world’s first privately-funded deep space mission to create the first comprehensive dynamic map of our inner solar system. With a planned launch in 2018, it would identify the current and future locations and trajectories of asteroids that cross Earth’s orbit. It is hoped the satellite would detect more than 200,000 asteroids in the first year of its operation. It . would be capable of finding so many thanks to its unique orbit away . from Earth, which would scan the area around Earth’s orbit. And, the team hopes, it would be capable of finding and tracking asteroids that pose the greatest threat to life on Earth. This would be the most capable near-Earth orbit (NEO) detection system in operation. It . would be located in a Venus-like orbit but pointed towards the orbital . plane of Earth, completing a trip around the sun every seven months. Precise pointing accuracy to sub-pixel resolution would allow images to be studied in detail. It is designed for highly autonomous, reliable operation requiring only weekly ground contact and could perform surveying operations for around 6.5 years. The highly specialised design is specifically optimised for NEO detection and discovery. Sentinel is expected to discover approximately 500,000 NEOs by 2024, which will account for 98 per cent of all NEOs known to humanity. But the team states that if an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth the mission only has a 30 per cent chance of finding it. If . one is found, the B612 Foundation said: 'It is our belief that the . people of the world will then unite in carrying out a deflection of that . asteroid to prevent this future impact.' The Sentinel satellite, pictured, is planned to launch in 2018. The team says that by 2024 it will find up to 500,000 asteroids, which would account for 98% of all near-Earth asteroids known to humanity . The Sentinel satellite would operate in an almost identical orbit to another proposed mission called the NEO Survey Observatory. The orbit and field of view of the satellites are shown in this illustration .","New research has revealed asteroids hit Earth more often than first thought .

"By . Martin Robinson . Evidence: Hacking jurors have been played furious voicemail messages left by the former Home Secretary David Blunkett in the wake of false press claims about his relationship with a female friend . Former Home Secretary David Blunkett left a series of furious voicemails after he was falsely accused of an affair with a friend, the jury in the hacking trial heard today. The Old Bailey was played recordings from the autumn of 2005, in which the politician said he hoped whoever had leaked information to the media would 'rot in hell'. In one message left on his friend Sally Anderson's phone, he said: 'Someone very, very close has done a really phenomenal piece of work on destroying both our lives at this moment in time and it's vile. 'Whoever it is I hope they rot in hell.' The jury of nine women and three men were played recordings of a series of messages that were seized from the home of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, in which Mr Blunkett repeatedly says the media storm over the false affair claims was 'vile'. He said: 'I don't know who's done this to us but they're real b*******, they've done it for money and they've done it for themselves and the world stinks.' It is claimed that the messages were illegally accessed on behalf of journalists at the now-closed tabloid the News of the World (NotW). Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire; ex-spin doctor Andy Coulson, also 45, from Charing in Kent; former NotW head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, from Raynes Park, south west London; and the tabloid's ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, from Woodford Green, Essex, are all on trial accused of conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006. All the defendants have denied the charges. In one message, Mr Blunkett warns the former estate agent, whose married name is King, to start thinking about who might have passed information to the media. On trial: Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks arrives at the Old Bailey, where she is in the dock with seven others including former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, right, also today . He said: ' I do think that someone has done a pretty good stitch-up job, chapter and verse, times, places, everything. That's pretty sophisticated to say the least.' In another message, Mr Blunkett said: 'The hyenas are still trying to get me but when I'm back I will shed a little light and they will all run back into the jungle again.' Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC read statements that Mr Blunkett made to police, saying that his messages were 'intended for Sally Anderson and for her alone'. Messages: In voicemails hacked by the News of the World, David Blunkett told friend Sally Anderson, pictured, the press were 'hyenas' who with the help of an unknown source were 'destroying both our lives' Mr Blunkett successfully sued the People over an article it ran incorrectly claiming that the pair had a sexual relationship and that he had made her pregnant. In her statement, Mrs King, nee Anderson, said she found herself at the centre of a media storm in 2005 and travelled to the US with her partner. She realised that a NotW journalist was on the same flight, but assumed it was 'a coincidence', the court heard. While they were at a cafe in the US, her partner was approached by a NotW journalist, Rob Kellaway, and offered £150,000 to sell her story.She said: 'I couldn't work out how he knew how to find us.' Later, she agreed to allow the People to listen to some of her voicemails when she sold her story to the newspaper, and in March 2006 issued a public apology to Mr Blunkett for doing so after he took legal action. The court then heard from Mr Blunkett's former special adviser, Huw Evans, who described a conversation he had with Coulson, challenging the then NotW editor over a story it planned to run in 2004 about the politician's affair with former Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn. Mr Evans said he was 'puzzled' at how Coulson could be so certain that the affair story was true, because a photograph of Ms Quinn and Mr Blunkett together proved nothing. He said: ' I told him that the photograph in itself proved nothing. I remember the tone of his voice... it was flat, unequivocal that he was absolutely certain that the story was true and he was going to run it. I remember at that time remaining puzzled as to why he could be so certain.' Mr Evans later gave a transcript of a conversation between Coulson and Mr Blunkett about the story to the Spectator, and said the former home secretary was angry that he had done so, and 'shouted' at him. The jury heard that Mr Evans believed 13 people would have known about the affair with Ms Quinn, including media advisers. When questioned by Timothy Langdale QC, for Coulson, Mr Evans agreed that he had been concerned that news of the relationship would come out 'in due course'. Mr Blunkett invited Coulson to Sheffield to discuss the story. Mr Evans told the jury: 'The risk was that he was trapped in a conversation into standing up the story.' Mr . Langdale asked Mr Evans: 'When you had a conversation with Andy . Coulson, your conversation yet again stood the story up, in fact, didn't . it?' Mr Evans replied: 'I don't accept that, no.' He told the jury: 'The only way I could have killed the story was to have said it was false, and that would have been a lie.' Heartbreak: In a series of messages played to the court last week, Mr Blunkett was . said to have repeatedly declared his love for then lover Kimberley Quinn, right, as she tried to . break off their affair . The former special adviser said he did not see any public interest in running the story. 'I . can understand why it was considered a story, I didn't consider then . and I don't consider now that it was in the public interest to expose . it. It was a private relationship.' Mr . Blunkett and Ms Quinn had been on holiday abroad together in 2003 and . 2004, and attended a state banquet at Buckingham Palace in November . 2003, the court heard. In . a police statement, Mr Evans said: 'They were hiding in plain sight. I . always thought that it was a matter of time before someone worked it . out.' Last week the Old Bailey heard tapes of the ‘deeply personal and . intrusive’ voicemails – taken from the hacked phone of Mr Blunkett’s . lover Ms Quinn, with whom he had a three-year affair – were found . hidden in a safe. Police investigating phone hacking at the tabloid discovered 330 messages from Mr Blunkett and associates. In some, Mr Blunkett asked Mrs Quinn, . the then publisher of the Spectator magazine, not to end their . relationship, which is thought to have begun in 2001. In . one recording the Labour politician says: ‘You are breaking my heart.’ In others, he tells Mrs Quinn, now 52, that he ‘yearns’ and ‘longs’ for . her. The trial continues. TV presenter John Leslie and his former girlfriend Abi Titmuss had their voicemails hacked by the News of the World when they were lovers, prosecutors said today. The jury was shown handwritten notes kept by £100,000-a-year private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, which included references to Leslie, his mobile phone number and his parents' phone number. At the time Mr Leslie was dogged by a sex tape that emerged of him with actress Titmuss and another woman. Ms Titmuss and Mr Leslie, who once dated Catherine Zeta-Jones, met in 1998  when she was a nurse and he was hosting ITV show This Morning. Victims: The prosecution in the News of the World hacking trial said today that former couple John Leslie and his  Abi Titmuss had their phones hacked at the height of their fame in 2002 and 2003, pictured . One note from October 2002, with the name Greg in the top left hand corner, included the words 'do both phones'. The court heard that Leslie, who presented shows including Blue Peter and This Morning, was named in 2002 by TV presenter Matthew Wright over unproved allegations that he had raped Ulrika Jonsson. No charges were ever brought. Leslie then faced further claims from other women that were dropped when prosecutors offered no evidence. He said in a police statement that 2002 was 'a traumatic time in my life', and the intense media interest in him only abated three or four years later when he moved to Scotland and stopped working in television. Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron read the court a statement from Titmuss that said: 'I've been in the public eye since 2003 when I was working as a nurse and was in a relationship with the TV presenter John Leslie. The level of press interest in myself and John at the time was high. 'They were very interested in me and John as a couple and wanted to know everything about me. 'Ever since then I've been in the media spotlight and between 2003 and 2007 I would consider myself extremely high profile.'

"By . Misty White Sidell . A new designer fragrance containing notes of asphalt and pollution has been created by fashion label Comme des Garçons. The unisex scent, which will retail for £56 at the label’s Dover Street Market, was designed to mark the opening of the Serpentine Gallery’s new wing. An homage to the gallery’s Hyde Park location, the scent boasts notes of grass, leaves, pollen, oxygen, asphalt, and ‘a little bit of pollution,’ according to Dover Street Market’s website. City smell: Comme des Garcons's new Serpentine fragrance includes notes of 'pollution' The term ‘pollution’ is of course . figurative in this case.  Comme des Garçons has used the distilled essences of . juniper wood, gaiac wood, and benzoin (a tree resin) to evoke London’s . city smell. Similarly, the label has mixed a variety of black musks and nutmeg to create an asphalt-type scent. Serpentine comes bottled and boxed in packaging designed by Tracey Emin. The . artist’s famous handwriting adorns the bottle in a silver script that . reads: ‘The Grass, The Trees, The Lake, And You.’ Message on a bottle: English artist Tracey Emin (pictured, at the fragrance launch) has designed Serpentine's bottle and box to include her famous script . While she has previously created everything from beach towels to dog bowls, Serpentine marks her first perfume-related project. Ms Emin explained to The New York Times of her concept behind the bottle's quote: ‘I did it from a completely artistic point of view. I’ve always wanted to have a romantic rendezvous at the galleries — in those first days of spring when it’s warm and hazy and really sensual with the blossoms on the trees and the fresh-cut grass.’ A sketch of Ms Emin’s new sculpture The Hearts Has Its Reasons - which was created for the Serpentine’s new wing –  is inscribed on the inside of the fragrance’s box. Taking inspiration: The Serpentine Galleries, located in Hyde Park, have just welcomed the addition of The Sackler Gallery - a Zaha Hadid-designed structure . The Serpentine’s newest exhibition space, The Sackler Gallery, was created by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid. It opened in September 2013. It was built with contributions from the Sackler family foundation -  a well-known arts benefactor that has funded projects including the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Sackler wing, an Egyptian arts hall that houses the famous Temple of Dendur.","The £56 unisex fragrance by Comme des Garçons was created to celebrate The Serpentine's new Sackler Gallery .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A woman who suffered from crippling body dysmorphia has overcome her illness by becoming an underwear model. Roxy Drummond, 24, from Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, used to be so self-conscious about her appearance that she applied a full face of makeup every night before going to sleep. After years of cruel comments from school bullies who called her 'ugly', she became obsessed with her looks and would spend hours scrutinising herself in front of the mirror. Scroll down for video . Roxy aged 16, when girls would tell her she was ugly and looked like a boy (left), now aged 24, and a lingerie model (right) The brunette spent up to three hours a day applying makeup and even refused to open her front door unless she was wearing false eyelashes. In 2013, Roxy was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder - a mental condition in which the sufferer obsesses over their appearance and sees a distorted image of the way they look. She became so anxious that she couldn't leave the house and would scrub her face until it was raw in a bid to get rid of what she thought was chronic acne. Roxy said: 'The girls at school made my life an absolute misery and I dreaded going in every day. Sometimes I would pretend to be ill so that I wouldn't have to face them. 'All the girls would come up to me and tell me that I was ugly and looked like a boy. 'I had no confidence whatsoever and absolutely hated myself, and this self-hatred continued long after I'd finished school. 'Eventually I developed an obsession . with every little flaw in my appearance. I had crippling anxiety every . time I had to go outside, so I barely left the house.' Last year she was finally diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder . Roxy, a size 8, was constantly told by friends and family that she should become a model, but because of her warped vision of herself, she never believed that she could make it. Roxy said: 'All I could see when I looked in the mirror was a horrible, crooked face. 'I particularly hated my nose, which I thought was long and wonky - like a witch's. 'That, combined with all the non-existent spots that I could see on my face, just made me feel like a disgusting monster. 'I couldn't bear to look at myself, so I couldn't understand why anyone else would want to look at me.' Despite hating her appearance, Roxy developed an obsession with taking selfies and would post them on Facebook and Twitter in search of reassurance from her followers. Posting up to three new profile pictures a week, Roxy was showered with compliments from followers telling her how beautiful she was. One leading psychiatrist said the majority of patients he sees with Body Dysmorphic Disorder take a lot of selfies. Dr . David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist in cognitive behaviour therapy . at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and The Priory Hospital, said: 'Two out of three of all the patients who come to . see me with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) since the rise of camera . phones have a compulsion to repeatedly take and post selfies on social . media sites.' Roxy, who volunteers for a local charity, says: 'What people don't understand is that I wasn't taking selfies because I love myself. 'It's because I had to obsessively check that I looked okay before I could go out. Plus the likes and nice comments made me feel less self-conscious about my appearance. 'I suppose it is a bit attention-seeking, but everyone likes to be told that they look nice, so I don't see the problem.' With encouragement from her friends and . family, Roxy entered a modelling competition and won. The buzz she felt . from winning made her decide to beat her anxiety once and for all and . she embarked on a professional career in modelling. Roxy said: . 'People find it strange that I say I'm anxious about my appearance, but . can pose for raunchy shoots. And I can completely understand where . they're coming from. 'I suppose it does sound a bit silly when I say I'm shy and then strip off to my underwear. 'But . something just happens when I'm in front of a camera. I feel so much . more confident, and for that hour or so I forget about obsessing about . the way that I look. 'The photographers are always really encouraging too, and that's a real confidence boost.' Roxy developed an obsession with taking selfies and would post them on social media for reassurance . BDD is characterised by a preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in appearance, which are unnoticeable to others, according to the BDD Foundation. As well as the excessive self-consciousness, individuals with BDD often feel defined by their flaw. They often experience an image of their perceived defect associated with memories, emotions and bodily sensations - as if seeing the flaw through the eyes of an onlooker, even though what they 'see' may be very different to their appearance observed by others. Sufferers tend repeatedly to check on how bad their flaw is  - for example in mirrors and reflective surfaces -  attempt to camouflage or alter the perceived defect and avoid public or social situations or triggers that increase distress. People with BDD can find themselves housebound or seeking out needless cosmetic surgery. They are also at an increased risk of suicide. A leading psychiatrist said many patients he sees with Body Dysmorphic Disorder take lots of selfies . Roxy hopes to grace the pages of FHM and Esquire, and her boyfriend supports her . With hopes . of gracing the pages of FHM and Esquire, Roxy claims that modelling and . the support of her boyfriend, labourer Josh Wilmot, 23, has helped her . to overcome her insecurities. Roxy said: 'Body dysmorphia is not something to be ashamed of, and there is help available. 'Along with my modelling, I have also taken part in CBT counselling - which has really helped. 'I'm . concentrating on my modelling career at the moment, but I'd love to go . to university and study for a qualification in psychology. 'Body . dysmorphia is such a misunderstood condition, and it'd be wonderful to . try and help people who are going through what I have. 'I just want people to know that it doesn't have to control their lives, and they can go on to achieve their dreams.' While she's concentrating on modelling at the moment, Roxy also wants to study psychology one day .","Roxy Drummond, 24, from Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, was bullied .

Mrs Taufiq’s husband, . consultant neurosurgeon Dr Muhammed Taufiq Sattar, survived because he . was working in Dublin at the time of the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar arriving at Nottingham Crown Court on the first day of the trial of eight defendants who are charged with murdering his wife and three children at their Leicester home on September 13, 2013 . A fire officer told Nottingham Crown Court that blaze was the worst he had ever attended during his career . Jamal Tauriq, left and his brother Bilal both died in the blaze, along with their mother Shehnila and sister Zainab . Seven men and a . youth are accused of deliberately starting the inferno in . Spinney Hills, Leicester. They all deny four counts of murder. Nottingham . Crown Court was told the intended target of the arson attack was . teenager Abdul Hakim, whose mother lived just two doors away from the . Taufiq family. Seven hours earlier Hakim, 19, had been involved in a . confrontation with football coach Antoin Akpom, a friend and associate . of the accused, in which Mr Akpom was stabbed to death. The incident . took place in Sussex Street, Leicester, less than a mile from the scene . of the fire. Prosecutors claim the gang wished to avenge the death of Antoin Akpom, pictured, who was stabbed in Leicester earlier the same night as the fire . Prosecutors allege that the eight accused wanted to target the house of Abdul Hakim, who lived two doors away from the Taufiq family . Richard Latham prosecuting said as the eight defendants stuck, the family was asleep upstairs in their home, pictured . Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said the eight . defendants struck at the mid-terraced home where Mrs Taufiq and her . children were sleeping, believing it was linked to Hakim, who was known . by his nickname of ‘AP’. But Mr Latham added: 'They simply got the wrong house. A tragedy.' The . court heard one senior fire officer described the resulting blaze, . which was started by petrol being poured through the letterbox then set . alight, as the ‘worst he had ever attended’. Another said it was ‘ferocious’, adding: 'The heat vented out was amazing.' Mr . Latham told the jury that despite the efforts of neighbours and fire . crews, ‘nothing could be done’ to save the family after the fire was . started at around 12.30am on September 13 last year. Nottingham Crown Court heard the accused were searching for Abdul Hakim, right, sketched here during his trial for murdering Antoin Akpom on September 12, 2013 alongside his co-accused Hussain Hussain, left . The court heard that Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar had spoken to his wife and children on the phone an hour before the fatal attack . He said: 'The primary means of escape was unavailable because the fire was at the . bottom of the staircase. They were trapped upstairs. 'They had . nothing to do with the events in Sussex Street, nothing to do with AP, . whose mother simply happened to be a nearby neighbour. 'Those . responsible, we say, are the eight defendants in the dock, who it . alleged were all immediately outside when the fire was set. 'The prosecution case is this fire was set as part of the retribution process for the stabbing.' Dr . Sattar, who Mr Latham said had spoken to his wife and children on the . phone just over an hour before the blaze started, listened from the . public gallery as the prosecutor outlined the case to the jury. He said the death of Mr Akpom, 20, was the ‘background’ to the fire, which he described as a ‘horrendous act’. The . court heard he was stabbed once in the back during an incident . involving Hakim and another 19-year-old, Hussein Hussein, outside a gym. Hussein, a Somali refugee from London, was convicted of Mr Akpom’s . murder and jailed for life earlier this month. The court heard that Shehnila Taufiq, her daughter Zainab, and sons Bilal, and Jamal died in the blaze at the family's home in Wood Hill, Leicester, pictured . Mr Latham told the . court it quickly became ‘common knowledge’ Hakim had been involved in . the incident that resulted in the death of Mr Akpom, and that the . defendants soon ‘involved themselves in an evolving plan that resulted . in all eight being at Wood Hill in the moments before the fire’. He . added they travelled to the scene in two cars, one of which had to be . abandoned after the blaze was started because it was accidentally . blocked in by another vehicle, and that there was evidence all eight had . stopped using their mobile phones in the build-up to the fire. Mr Latham told the jury that the eight defendants had 'acted in concert'. He said: 'All the defendants were there and willing and able to give support to the enterprise.' Mr Latham added that by the time Mrs Taufiq’s home was set alight, Hakim had already left Leicester and was in London. The . accused are 19-year-olds Kemo Porter and Nathaniel Mullings, Aaron Webb . and Jackson Powell, both 20, Akeem Jeffers, 21, Tristan Richards, 22, . Shaun Carter, 24, and a 17-year-old who cannot be named for legal . reasons. The men all come from Leicester apart from Jeffers, who is from . Leeds. All of the defendants deny all of the charges. The trial, which is expected to last up to eight weeks, continues.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Shots were fired by armed officers as police arrested a suspect in the middle of a busy road during rush hour. Witnesses said they saw police in unmarked vehicles swoop on a Mercedes on the A27 in Lewes, East Sussex, as part of an operation led by London's Metropolitan Police. The firearms officers discharged breaching, or Hatton rounds, at the tyres of a car, bringing it to a 'hard stop', before a man was seen being escorted away in handcuffs, close to a nearby roundabout. Incident: This photograph, apparently taken at the scene, shows the chaos after a car was brought to a halt by armed police officers, and a man arrested on the A27 in Lewes, East Sussex . Breaching rounds usually consist of metal powder contained in a wax canister and are also used by officers to blast open locks or hinges, as they disintegrate on impact and do not ricochet dangerously, like a bullet can. The officers were part of the Trident Gang Crime Command, which works to tackle gang violence and investigates shooting incidents. The man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm, and was being questioned at a police station tonight. A Metropolitan police spokesman dismissed online rumours that the arrest had been linked to terrorism, and said the claims were 'pure speculation'. He said that . armed officers had stopped the vehicle and rounds were discharged by . officers, but that no injuries had been reported. The spokesman also confirmed that a weapon had been found in the car. 'MPS detectives and armed officers from the MPS Specialist Firearms . Command stopped the car at around 15:30hrs in relation to firearms,' he . said. The operation was led by officers from the Metropolitan Police, based in New Scotland Yard, London, who were part of Trident Gang Crime Command, which tackles gang violence . 'No shots were fired during the stop but Hatton rounds where discharged to incapacitate the car. 'There were no reports of any injuries. 'A suspected firearm was recovered. 'Aman . (no further details at this time) was arrested on suspicion of . possession of a firearm and has been taken into custody at a local . police station.' The disruption caused chaos on the road, with commuters caught up in heavy delays as they tried to get home from work. Following . the incident, which took place at around 4.30pm, one lane of the dual . carriageway's eastbound stretch was sealed off, with traffic backed up . for around five miles. One witness told the Brighton Argus: 'I came through minutes after the incident and this appears to be quite a large Police operation there are approx. 'Four or five un-marked police vehicles were involved and plain clothes police officers were in the road. 'They appear to have stopped or rammed a Mercedes car and handcuffed a very large gentleman at the side of the round.' Drivers in East Sussex faced further traffic woes after a house fire in Rottingdean caused the closure of the A259 coast road.","Witnesses said they saw police in unmarked cars swoop on Mercedes .

"By . Mark Duell . A U.S. Air Force lieutenant who damaged a precious statue belonging to a celebrity dog trainer during a marathon pub crawl was today fined almost £1,200. Christopher Mesnard began his binge drinking session in a champagne bar at London Paddington train station and had planned to drink half a pint in 26 bars along the Underground's Circle line. But the 26-year-old lost his friends and was found in the early hours of the morning astride a fake topiary dog owned by dog trainer Lucy Kennedy, Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard. Damage: Christopher Mesnard (left) lost his friends and was found in the early hours of the morning astride a fake topiary dog owned by dog trainer Lucy Kennedy (right), Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard . First Lieutenant Mesnard, a Deputy Chief of Public Affairs in the USAF based at Royal Air Force Mildenhall in Suffolk, broke the £995 ornament but claimed to have no recollection of the incident. Police were called at around 12:30am on March 30 following an allegation of criminal damage by Miss Kennedy, who trains pampered dogs for TV shows, the court was told. Manjit Mahal, prosecuting, said: ‘Miss Kennedy explained to officers she was at her property in her bedroom when she was disturbed by a noise outside.' After investigating the 'banging' noise, Miss Kennedy and her partner saw Mesnard fall off the statue which was bolted to the ground, the court heard. Still there: Miss Kennedy's remaining statue outside her home and workplace, which formed part of a pair . Mesnard was found around 650ft away from the luxury home in Notting Hill, west London, on a road which has an average property value of £1.7million. 'My parents raised me to own up to my mistakes and take responsibility for my actions' Christopher Mesnard . Mesnard was arrested and confessed he was on a pub crawl during a police interview. Mr Mahal said: 'They started drinking at a champagne bar in Paddington station at approximately 11am on March 29. 'He got separated from his friends and he was texting his friends to find out if they were about. He accepts he was drunk but not incapable.’ Miss Kennedy, 54, has been described as 'Notting Hill's best known dog nanny' and runs her business Happy Dogs from her home. Broken: The remaining part of the damaged statue outside Miss Kennedy's home and workplace in Notting Hill . Mesnard admitted a single charge of criminal damage to property valued under £5,000. 'He got separated from his friends and he was texting his friends to find out if they were about. He accepts he was drunk but not incapable' Manjit Mahal, prosecuting . Addressing the court, he apologised for his 'severe lapse' in judgement and confessed he does not yet know what punishment the Air Force will impose on him. 'I wish I could remember having damaged Ms Kennedy's property, but the fact is I unfortunately made the poor decision to drink too much,' he said. 'My parents raised me to own up to my mistakes and take responsibility for my actions.' Mesnard, of RAF Mildenhall, was ordered to pay £995 in compensation to Miss Kennedy. He must also pay a £150 contribution towards court costs and a £25 victim surcharge.","Christopher Mesnard began binge drinking session at Paddington station .

"By . Rebecca Camber . Terrorists are changing tactics to slip under the radar after being given ‘full sight’ of GCHQ tradecraft by whistleblower Edward Snowden, a counter-terrorism director warned today. Stephen Phipson, one of the Government’s most senior counter terrorism officials, said the surveillance leaks published in the Guardian newspaper had led to a ‘substantial reduction’ in intelligence on suspects as they have changed their methods of communication. The director at the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) said the release of information from the Snowden documents had given extremists ‘full sight’ of tools and techniques used by the British listening station GCHQ, which had had a ‘severe’ effect on spying operations. Listening post: GCHQ's headquarters in Cheltenham . He told a counter terrorism conference: ‘The leaks we have all seen in the press have made the work of the OSCT, the intelligence agencies and the apparatus of the Government much, much, much more difficult. ‘Our adversaries, the terrorists, what they now have is full sight of the sorts of tools and the range of techniques that are being used by Government and I can tell you the data shows a substantial reduction in the use of those methods of communication as a result of the Snowden leaks. ‘That makes it much more difficult to track the activity and the illegal activity of terrorists. ‘So the Snowden effect has been a very, very severe one.’ Whistleblower: Edward Snowden was a contract employee at the U.S National Security Agency . Attack: Mr Phipson described Snowden's leaks as 'very damaging' He went on to say the swathe of sensitive information leaked by Snowden, who stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files, had seriously damaged national security. ‘Basically you see people using less of the methods that he (Snowden) described the Government uses to track terrorism and as a natural consequence terrorists are trying to use other methods. We have to be more agile,’ he said. ‘There is no doubt it has been very damaging. ‘When you start revealing what the Government does to stop terrorism then you are going to get terrorists using other methods to try to get around it.’ Snowden, a former American National Security Agency IT contractor, caused uproar last June when he disclosed details of the extent of surveillance and electronic intelligence gathering by his former employers and GCHQ to the Guardian and Washington Post. The 30-year-old fled the United States where he faces espionage charges and has since been granted temporary asylum in Russia. He claimed that the NSA was mining the personal data of users of Google, Facebook, Skype and other US companies. Further leaks suggested the United States had monitored phone conversations of some 35 world leaders, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, while GCHQ has been accused of intercepting millions of Yahoo webcam chats as part of massive surveillance operations. But earlier this month a watchdog rubbished Snowden’s claims of ‘mass intrusion’ by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ into the private lives of millions of innocent citizens. The Interception of Communications Commissioner Sir Anthony May said they were not breaking the law, nor were they using US intercept material to snoop on Britons. Mr Phipson is the latest senior figure to blast the leaks, which have been described within Whitehall as effectively a ‘guidebook for terrorists’. Last year, Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5 said it had handed terrorists the ‘gift’ of being able to attack Britain at will. The Prime Minister has also warned they have made the country less safe, while former defence secretary Liam Fox has accused him of treason. Today Mr Phipson, who is the deputy to OSCT head Charles Farr, also warned that Syria is now the ‘front line of terrorism’ for Britain. The threat posed by hundreds of British fighters returning from the Syrian conflict is regarded as being on the same level as that from al-Qaeda terrorists in the borderlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said.","A senior counter-terrorism official said Snowden had helped terrorists .

"By . Louise Cheer . One of Australia's most well-known jihadists continued to receive welfare payments from the Federal Government months after he had fled the country to join other Islamic extremists in the Middle East. Khaled Sharrouf, who fled Australia in December on his brother's passport to link up with fundamentalist militia group Islamic State in Syria, was receiving a disability support pension at least two months after he left, according to The Weekend Australian. It is understood by the newspaper the convicted terrorist's $766-a-fortnight payments continued even after it was known by officials he was bound for the Middle East, but it cannot be confirmed that he was able to access the money. Scroll down for video . It was revealed Khaled Sharrouf, who posted a photo of him with a gun when he tweeted a call-to-arms, was receiving welfare payments for at least two months after he fled Australia . Sharrouf is currently being investigated by Australian authorities in relation to allegations he is fighting with Islamic State - a breakaway al-Qaeda group. In 2008, he became a convicted terrorist when he pleaded guilty and was jailed for acts in preparation for a terrorist act after he was one of eight people arrested for plotting to attack the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor - in Sydney's south. When asked by The Australian to confirm its findings, Human Services Minister Marise Payne declined to comment due to privacy reasons. Currently, authorities do not have the power to scrap welfare if an Australian is thought to be engaging in terrorist activities but a disability pension can be stopped once a person is not in the country for six weeks. An earlier picture on Sharrouf's Twitter page of a young child brandishing a gun with the caption: 'One of dawlas youngest members' This new information comes to light after Sharrouf issued a call-to-arms for other Australian Muslims to join Islamic State's bloody war in the Middle East as well as posting a photo on Twitter of a young child brandishing a rifle. In the early hours of July 5, Sharrouf tweeted: 'come and be part of what we have dreamt...for decades'. It was accompanied by a picture of him decked out in army camouflage posing with a gun in front of a white BMW. This followed his fellow brother-in-arms Mohamed Elomar, one of almost 60 Australians fighting for extremist groups in the Middle East, took aim at diggers fighting in Iraq, tweeting: 'Look at the end of these Iraqi maliki dogs bunch of girls can't wait to see a Australia soldier cyring [sic] saying bakia.' The Sydney Morning Herald reported that 'bakia' meant 'he cries' in Arabic and 'maliki' was a term used to describes the Nouri al-Maliki government, which is led by Shiites. The regime is strongly opposed to Sunni extremists who have torn through Iraq's north in the past few weeks. Another tweet fired off from Sharrouf read: 'My (provisions) are beneath the shade of my sword. We live better than we lived in our country.' But these uploads barely scratch the surface of the disturbing content found on Sharrouf's Twitter page. Earlier posts contain pictures so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to describe or publish them. But one that can be shared is of a young child brandishing a gun and smiling with the caption: 'One of dawlas [sic] youngest members' - which was posted late May. Dawlah is Arabic for country or state. Other photos show Sharrouf standing in front of military vehicles as well as fundamentalist propaganda memes. He told people to 'come and be part of what we have dreamt For for decades' and said: 'we live better than we lived in our country ' Khaled Sharrouf (pictured) is part of Islamic extremist group Islamic State - a breakaway group of al-Qaeda . These tweets came just days after the Australian Government said almost 60 Australians fight for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight. This information was revealed after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, became the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family in June bound for Iraq to fight in the troubled war zone. He went missing from his family's Bankstown home - in Western Sydney - almost three weeks ago, and has only been heard from once when he contacted his mother to say he was in Turkey. Ten Australians have died while fighting for extremists in Syria and Iraq. The latest is a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group Islamic State - formerly known as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' and 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria' - shortly before he was ambushed in Syria. In one of the recruitment videos entitled There Is No Life Without Jihad, an Australian man who calls himself Abu Yahya ash Shami said he wanted to send 'a message...from a Muslim brother's heart to another brother's heart'. He appeals to Australian Muslims to come join him in the Middle East to restore 'honour' in the region, saying: 'Wake up, wake up and be part of this effort.' The former Sydney resident fled from Australia in December - believed to be going to Syria - on his brother's passport . An ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'","It is believed Khaled Sharrouf, from Sydney, was on a disability pension .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Chief executive of Comic Relief, Kevin Cahill, (pictured receiving his CBE) pledged to 'do the right thing' after the public backlash . The beleaguered boss of Comic Relief yesterday promised to carry out a full review of its investments following revelations that it had pumped millions of pounds into tobacco, arms and alcohol companies. The charity is facing a huge public backlash and scathing criticisms from some of its own stars for putting money in controversial ‘booze, bombs and fags’ funds. Critics say the investments undermine its work to help the victims of smoking-related diseases, alcohol abuse and war. Hours after the revelations, thousands . of Comic Relief viewers expressed their fury on Twitter, with many . saying they wished they had never donated. Despite . initially defending the policy on the grounds that ethical investments . would generate a smaller return, chief executive Kevin Cahill appeared . to backtrack yesterday, pledging to ‘do the right thing’. Speaking . ahead of the BBC Panorama expose last night that broke the story, he . said: ‘We will do a full review of our policy after this particular . programme and these discussions. ‘It’s . really important that the public stick with us, that they trust us to . do the right thing and they understand that we are listening to the . messages that are out there on the social networks. ‘It’s showing us on the social networks this morning that the public do have some concern about these things.’ This year’s Red Nose Day raised more than £100million after an eight-hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, fronted by presenters including Lenny Henry, Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. This year's Red Nose Day, fronted by presenters including Lenny Henry, raised more than £100million . But some of the charity’s own stars, including comedians Frankie Boyle and Al Murray, have since distanced themselves from its activities, trading jokes about its connection to companies such as weapons manufacturer BAE Systems and cigarette firm British American Tobacco. Frankie Boyle tweeted: ‘Will happily perform at this year’s Comic Relief if paid in guns.’ According to Comic Relief’s accounts from 2007 to 2009, it placed millions in City funds that invested in the companies, including £2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009. It is sitting on a £100million pot of money donated by the public, despite promising to hand ‘every pound’ straight to good causes in its annual broadcasts. Mr Cahill – whose pay has increased from £111,000 to £131,000 since 2011 – told the BBC’s World At One programme yesterday that the investments were ‘a small percentage, no more than 5 per cent of our funds in any of those particular areas’. Stars including Ronni Ancona, Craig David, Lorraine Kelly, Scott Mills, Olly Murs and Dermot O'Leary, took part in the BT Red Nose Desert Trek in aid of Comic Relief . But he conceded: ‘The most important . thing for us is to keep the trust and faith of the public. We would . clearly be keen to be in ethical funds if they match other funds. ‘We should never forget that we are nothing without the public. They have given us over £800million to date. ‘All of that money, every single penny, partly because of our investment policy, has gone to people living in extreme poverty and to vulnerable communities domestically and overseas. We are listening to the public and we will do the right thing.’ But former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth gave Comic Relief a back-handed compliment for its investment policy last night. He said it should be ‘proud’ to invest in BAE Systems, saying the firm ‘contributes substantially to the defence of the United Kingdom and our way of life so that sanctimonious charity leaders may freely exercise their stupid prejudices’.","Chief executive Kevin Cahill pledged to 'do the right thing' after backlash .
